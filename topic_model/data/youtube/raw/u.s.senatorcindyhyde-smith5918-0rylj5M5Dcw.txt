why do they come well because our president basically invited them immediately after President Biden was sworn in he started dismantling vital policies like remain in Mexico and restarted catch and release halted construction on the border and essentially set up a big neon sign on the Southwest border that read vacant the rest is history 4.5 million border apprehensions with an estimated 1.5 million undetected gotaways a staggering increase in the number of women and children who are being subject to assault and domestic violence fentanyl flowing into our communities and skyrocketing deaths I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to go and listen to border patrol agents hear the stories of the cartels victim see for yourself the heartbreaking scenarios the greatest country in the world is allowing to unfold I learned much from my visit to the Border but perhaps the worst thing I learned is this the Biden Administration is not lacking any resources or authority to address this crisis no it can support our border patrol and border states it can secure our border it can save children from dying and drowning in the Rio Grande or 14 year old girls from being sold but it won't either through incompetence or by worse by Design thank you madam president I yield the floor

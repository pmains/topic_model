next madam chair um several things uh madam secretary i'm sorry social security's gone insolvent the administration has not proposed anything to address the insolvency um is there going to be a plan coming forward from the administration to address social security insolvency which is i think 12 or 13 years away now with all the implications of further delay makes it harder to address well so we gained one year um in terms of the life of the social security fund how long it continues to fund benefits that was in the recent yes but that's if you take a 75-year scoring we've learned that it's going to be a 211 trillion dollar trillion dollar deficit over 75 years so saying that it's going to be extended one to two years seems almost you know silly no offense so i do believe this is something it it's certainly true that um it's not um sustainable on a 75-year basis and this is something that congress and the administration should should address this is not news i would say we've known about this for at least 30 years and have not taken steps to address it so you agree it's important to take those steps i do believe it's something we should do let me move on um as regards the inflation one variable that we can potentially impact is the price of oil and gas now you've mentioned how it's an international market and there's some limit as the the impact of what we do locally but that said the administration has proposed decreasing tax incentives for the production of oil and gas now if you decrease tax incentives you're going to have less oil and gas produced now that's going to intuitively decrease supply and contribute to that upward pressure does that make sense well over the medium term we absolutely need to move to renewables and but i'm speaking about right now if we decrease tax incentives to produce that will decrease supply and yet the administration is proposing to do that um well i i'll just make that point and move on indeed if we're going to speak about i have a quote here apparently one of the major problems with producing oil and gas right now is the cost of oil field services and here's a quote from the ceo of occidental she says that the uh quote unquote uh the paraphrase given how expensive drilling and oil field services have gotten it's almost value destruction if you try to accelerate anything now now what would you think about increasing the tax incentive to drill oil and gas recognizing what the ceo of occidental says that the cost of oil field services are so great it is value destruction to attempt to accelerate well prices are very high in part because of importantly because of russia's war on ukraine and um i believe the incentives are certainly there to boost production and that is something we need in the short run to so would you so if we could make a case that and i don't mean to be rude i'm sorry if we could make the case that increase in the incentive increasing the tax credit for three to five years to to offset the increased cost of oil field services could increase production would that be something that should be entertained well look i you know i think it's profitable as it is prices have gone up a lot and that helps to offset those costs to help oil companies cover them and so the price system is working and provides provides incentives now what we're trying to do is lower the cost well let me just move on we're in a situation right now as regards russia and the price of oil in which because of the restrictions on purchasing russian oil their oil profits have increased so they're selling less but at a higher price to say one more time russia now makes more money from oil and gas sales than it did before we begin to apply sanctions now the europeans have considered coming together as a buying block to limit the price that we will pay monopsony power if you will we'll pay the price of production but no more and so therefore we don't pay the higher price at the pump but they don't get the increased revenue is the administration participating in this are we taking the lead in this is this something that we would entertain absolutely our objective is no absolutely we are involved in discussions to come up with a buyer's block that will not pay more than x amount yes can you give a kind of assessment of where those uh negotiations are extremely active i think what we want to do is keep russian oil flowing into the global market to hold down global prices and try to avoid a spike that causes a worldwide recession and drives up oil prices but absolutely the objective is to limit the revenue going to russia and the kind of strategy you suggest there there are different ways technically of accomplishing that but it's certainly a desirable strategy and gentleman's expired thank you thank my colleague senator cardin

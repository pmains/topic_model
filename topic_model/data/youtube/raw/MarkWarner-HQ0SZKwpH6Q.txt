happy to sit down with small business owners in this case retailers i have worked on small business lending i've been working on some new legislation recently to help starter tailors to talk about their challenges they face in this still struggling economy as someone who was involved as an entrepreneur and i have enormous respect for these small businesses in today's environment it's not the first time i've done this i've done this across virginia from one end of the commonwealth to the other and while i tried to explain some of the things we've done in congress small business lending act which is getting finally money out into particularly community-based banks new legislation i propose to make it easier particularly for high growth startup companies to get access to capital i think the retailers i talked to were interested in in this progress but there's still more to be done we work for you if you we don't do our job change us out these listening sessions are important for me they they give me ideas about uh what i can do in terms of bringing back specific policy proposals to an act here in washington uh but you know what i saw from these retailers yesterday in norfolk was again that kind of can-do spirit and willingness to say we're going to take a chance we're going to provide for our community and in the same state we're going to build a better value for their own families and their employees

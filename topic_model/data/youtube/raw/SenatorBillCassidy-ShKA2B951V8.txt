uh let's go to Bill Cassidy the Louisiana Republican senator Senate energy and natural resources committee finance committee he's on all the crucial committees kind enough to join US senator um what can we do about this obviously this was a unique problem I understand but we haven't seen anything like it since 9 11. it had a lot of folks very nervous what do you think well I'm struck they can't control the Border they can't keep planes flying but by golly you're not going to use gas to cook a good point I wanted to pick your brain on that gas stove thing but on this you know I know a good chunk of those infrastructure funds from the legislation were marked for airline advancements and upgrades and for the FAA it's a little naive of me to think that that money would already be spent and put to work but it certainly called for isn't it every high-tech system should have redundancy but and the more important the system the more redundancy should be built into it the idea that when I read is that there was a systems update that did not work uh ideally you'd have two systems and you would update one you'd keep the other running you'd make sure that it was running well and if not you'd go to the Redundant one and then you would update the Redundant one either their systems are bad or the people running it are not very good but there is really no excuse for a three hour shutdown affecting thousands and thousands of flights uh in the United States of America I'm just wondering as well Center what it's going to do about people who are thinking of flying between this today all the problems with Southwest before and before them Frontier and before then virtually everyone it seemed in the summer with all all the difficulties and long lines that people might think twice about flying in general um that could have clear economic implications are you worried it it could but uh but frankly uh Americans have become so used to commuting by airplane uh I imagine would take a little bit more for this to happen um but on the other hand this is a unforced error there's no reason why the federal government should not have redundancy in their systems any CEO of a company that's well run would have had that and those who don't end up getting rightfully criticized now the CEO of this company is Joe Biden I think ultimately he's a fellow that has to the Buck has to stop with him all right let's talk a little bit about this gas stove thing because it's a bit of a leap to sort of bend their sales outright um and I'm just wondering what Republicans plan to do about that but first in Louisiana we use gas to make ruse for our gumbos and our A2 phase and so it actually does cook in a superior fashion according to my wife and she's there but one of your interviewers he pointed out that this is really a backdoor way to go after natural gas let's just trip it away let's just take away the childhood asthma kind of yeah right um no this is their kind of how what can we do to inhibit the role of natural gas in our economy even though because it even though because we in the United States have used natural gas instead of coal we've actually decreased our emissions down to less than the emissions we had in 2005. despite a bigger economy more people and more manufacturing this Administration can't control the Border they can't take care of the airplanes but by golly they're going to go after fossil fuel and I think that's the way you have to approach this and it's going to damage the rest of the economy but I'm not sure they care yeah well there are bigger battles that seem to and should be fought right now but we'll we'll follow it Senator always good seeing you hope you had a happy New Year it's a bumpy year but happy all right uh Senator much appreciated

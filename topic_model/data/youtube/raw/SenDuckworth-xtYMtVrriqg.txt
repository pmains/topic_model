Thank You mr. chairman welcome general Milley it's good to see you again when we sat down together we had a good conversation about the importance of logistics to project and sustained our military power and I'd like to touch on that here how would you advise the president and the White House on what we need to do today to prepare for the fights of tomorrow whether through funding policy or other prioritization shifts especially when it comes to logistics well I think logistics as we discussed in your office and professionals military look at logistics is a long pole in the tent and the ability to for us to project forces overseas by Transcom for example the long sea and air lines of communication and keeping those open to sustain both ground air and naval forces in a theater in an active theater all of that depends on logistics the ability to move and shoot and communicate all of that has got a logistics tilt to it so it is a critical area of warfighting and and I want to believe that we pay close attention to it which we do and in terms of funding things like airlift and sea lift capabilities oftentimes we're overlooked because they're not they're not the warfighting of the leading edge of the war fighting but those are capabilities that we need to continue to invest in thank you we also burning on logistics we discuss our concerns with great power competition and some of my colleagues have talked about it here but one of the things that we talked about was just the need to have an American presence in especially the asia-pacific region not necessarily confronting China directly but just being there and being and operating there on a local level so that our allies and and partners in the region or you can refer to us and we're and we're just constantly there so that we're not leaving a vacuum for the Chinese to to occupy so Lee what more can we do to make sure our forces and our partners are treating the concerns of China's presence realistic and to make sure that they are mature and ready for the continued friction with China and with respect to our our own presence overseas can you give us an overview of how you might anticipate using or adjusting our ex-military exercises for example so we get the most use out of them you know I'm talking about our strategic partners in South Korea Japan throughout Southeast Asia when I was in Singapore for the defense summit just earlier just a couple months ago one of the things that was very clear was that the nations in the region were very uncomfortable with China being there but they needed an alternative and they needed a greater presence of the u.s. to be there necessarily confronting China directly but just being in the region can you address this well my experience in asia-pacific and I was stationed in Korea and spent time in Hawaii and various exercises plus travels as chief Stephanie I mean I've got to know pretty much all of my counterparts that are leading the the force surrounding and we have a very robust network in Asia of allies and partners official allies with full-blown defense treaties as well as partner nations that's critical and it's palpable when you go around the region as you have to see the anxiety and the fear that these countries have of an aggressive China and they want the United States there they want us there as a security partner they want us there as a security guarantor they want forward presence they believe that we're a force of stability and there's great concern so our task our key task I think is assurance and some of the military dimensions of that I think would be to do exercises and ensure that we have interoperability with the various forces in all the domains throughout the area and we do that in doe PACOM does that on a routine basis with a large large suite and capability of exercises throughout the region that we continue to sustain is there anything that you would change your enhance with those exercises that particular dimension well as Chiefs Navy Army we did a prototype of a multi-domain task force I think grouping those exercises into multi domain exercises would be worthwhile one of the things we'd like to do in you know I think it's 24 months I think were going to do it is do emergency deployment readiness exercises to asia-pacific into Europe and those those are Army's specific but we could expand that into the joint force in the concept of the dynamic force employment the DfE concept that is within the national defense strategy so that we can project power on an emergency basis in the Nexus and demonstrate that capability I think they would have a very strong effect on any adversarial nation thank you I'd like to now it's just shift gears and talk about the parole in place program agreement that DoD had with DHS to not deport the members of the family members of our military men and women who are currently on deployment can you how would you advise a president on the potential impacts of taking this action where the DHS is now saying they're going to resume deportation of family members of deployed service members what would you say to them in a women in uniform who are facing this issue at home especially when they're downrange yes I'm not familiar with what you're talking about I've read a headline on it I think the other day I would need to dig into exactly what DHS is saying and what they plan on doing our soldiers are defending our country and their families deserve the protection of this country thank you and if you could follow up with in writing I'd appreciate it I will do that thank you

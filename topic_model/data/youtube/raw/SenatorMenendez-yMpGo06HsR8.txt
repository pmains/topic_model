all of them and certainly to our honorees you're also going to see some incredible folklore dancing and I look forward to the Puerto Rican Alliance of Elizabeth foreign foreign [Applause] foreign as most of you would maybe be surprised to know when I was a student just down the road at what was Unionville High School I was terribly shy public speaking was my nightmare in fact the idea of standing up here and delivering remarks would have sent me into a cold sweat but the reason I'm able to be up here today is one of the best teachers I ever had Gail Harper she saw something in me that few people saw potential and when I told her that there was no way that I could recite the poems and speeches that were necessary for her class she stayed with me after school so I could practice one-on-one she assigned me a speaking role as a narrator for the school play and in doing so she quite literally helped me find my voice which I have used ever since to advocate for others and so every time I get up to speak every time I'm at a Podium like this silent prayer thanks for Miss Harper and everything she helped us online gracias this story of Miss Harper helping me break out of my show is a familiar one for many Latinos how many of you had had your own Miss Harper a parent deal deal a widow who helped us along the way local how many of you have a Primo Prima who isn't technically related to you but who treats you as if it was your deal or deal my guess is that all of you have someone who comes to mind it's a Hallmark of what makes us well which brings me uh to the theme central theme of Hispanic Heritage Month that I've been thinking about few days [Music] to ensure Hispanic Heritage Month is about celebrating communities and the ties That Bind them together it's no secret that our families are generally big they're allowed sometimes you're unconscious and sometimes they argue but despite whatever ups and downs despite the differences we may have I'm a firm believer Latina is UNA Familia a favorite uplifting and honoring true stories and traditions master [Music] equal signals mucho Anthony colonization English a family that can trace Our Roots from the earliest beginning to today and so with roots stretching far back to the founding of the oldest town in America Saint Augustine's Florida by Pedro Menendez de avilas Florida Latinos are a family that has been telling our story for years if not centuries take for example the brave soldiers who have fought for and sometimes died defending our country and our Democratic way of life all too often we Overlook the fact that Hispanic Americans served alongside George Washington yes George Washington in the Revolutionary War they fought to preserve the Union during the Civil War they were rough riders with Teddy Roosevelt they served in the trenches of World War and when the call went out for brave Soldiers to fight in World War II a Hispanic unit predominantly make up of Puerto Ricans answered the call nicknamed the porinqueneros they served on the battlefields of World War II and Korea with distinction the most honored group of military personnel in the history of the United States [Applause] foreign they fought for a country that turned its back on them when they came home yet despite overt racism and opportunities denied because of who they were they forged on today Latinos make up more than 17 percent of all active duty servicemen and women proudly wearing the American flag on their shoulder as a symbol of who they are sworn to protect hello libertas [Applause] now as I've said this month is a time to come together as family and to celebrate the unique Traditions that we are known and whether we come from the furthest tip of South America and Chile or Argentina or from the border communities in Tijuana and the Rio Grande Valley or throughout Central America there is no doubt that there is a fire in our bellies a similarity in our souls that have stood the test of time we may come from all over each with a unique difference [Music] are bonds unite us from a peruvian-born Trailblazer in TV journalism like La Rosa beaches and we will hear from later to the first Puerto Rican state senator our bonds unite us from Cesar Chavez The Humble Farm worker and labor organizer from Delano California changed the world with the phrase to Justice the Latino lawyer who defied her critics not just with her legal mind but by showing the world that three girls three like little girls everywhere can rise from a South Bronx housing project to the highest court in the land the Supreme Court of the United States our bounds are what binds us unites Us in the words of our national model out of many one think about that for a moment what a perfect phrase to describe the Latino family gathered here today is with so many of us one or two generations removed from jobs that required sacrifice jobs that demanded Early Learning and calloused hands entire feet what better way to honor our ancestors than with a celebration of the ties that bind us together what better way to tell our story than among our closest family and friends I remember well what it was like to serve as the only Latino elected official at many levels ever in fact ever since I've been in public office I've always found it a challenge to be introduced as a first Union City New Jersey is [Music] opportunity I am proud of those accomplishments they required hard work and dedication but I have always felt that being the first is not much a an accomplishment if there aren't others who follow after you and so for me the story of Hispanic Heritage Month cannot be told without taking a look around just how far we have come 50 years ago you could count the number of members of the Congressional Hispanic caucus on one hand today we have gone to 36 members encountered before you have to turn to 93.1 if you wanted to hear music in Spanish now go to any top 4 chances are that you'll hear a song by Luis fonsi Shakira or Camila Cabello Latinos have been making waves for years as astronauts Business Leaders and chefs Orchestra conductors cabinet secretaries baseball players artists and entertainers and in a few years we'll get a chance to learn more about that that's something that I helped create through my law the museum for the American Latino on the National Mall in Washington D.C [Applause] is [Applause] you know foreign [Music] [Applause] however this isn't to say that our road has always been easy every generation of Latinos has had to overcome odds and prove naysayers wrong I often tell the story the first time that I ran for congress I was giving a speech in Bayonne New Jersey campaigning in one of the cities that were part of that congressional district and after I spoke an older woman who came up to me in a very thick Irish robe and said to me I was the mayor of Union City was running for congress and you said to me mayor Menendez I'm so glad I came to hear you and I said really what was it that I said that that impressed you and she said oh it's not so much what you said the fact that you could speak English of course since I wanted to get elected I said Thank you and I moved on now I share that story to highlight the fact that in many ways we continue to Grapple with the same issues we Face from my parents first came from this country in the 1950s but there's a second Story one that I didn't share publicly before that further exposes the long road still ahead of us it was 2013 and alongside a majority of my colleagues in the Senate we had just passed the most meaningful bipartisan Immigration Reform Bill in decades unfortunately the House of Representatives never pasted history would be different but that day was a joyous day 67 votes in the Senate to pass immigration reform one of the proudest moments in my career as we had finally passed me that provided a pathway to citizenship from millions of undocumented Americans living in the shadows and to walk the occasions I was one of several centers being interviewed by the media about the importance of the bill for our nation the only difference was that I was the only one speaking to Spanish language news stations about what it would mean for the Latino community we were just wrapping up our interview went out of the corner of my eye I see a Republican senator turning the corner and walking towards me without noticing where he was going I realized that the senator was about to walk right in to the interview and spoiled the moment and in a moment that's so etched in my mind and in my memory he came up to me and said what I assume was the only thing that could come into his mind he blurted out the Speedy Gonzalez catchphrase so I don't dwell on that comment any more than you do but I tell you this story because my friends it happens every day it happens in every corner of our country from working class job sites to corporate borders and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened and yet despite this despite the bigoted commas despite being looked down on or made to feel different or not taken seriously we hinted we keep going our story is one of overcoming obstacles Rising above and carving out our rightful place in America and Society well the Hispanic Community has consistently beaten the odds and come up ahead and while it hasn't always been easy we still have a long way to go this month is a time to reaffirm ourselves to that fight what do we fight for we fight for the day when immigration reform not only passes the Senate but the House of Representatives and creates an opportunity for Millions to come out of the darkness into the light and participate fully in our society I firmly believe I firmly believe that immigration is our duration's civil rights issue and no matter how lows some decide to go with their anti-immigrant rhetoric we will continue to dream of to reach for the day when there is a pathway to citizenship for our fellow undocumented brothers and sisters [Music] we fight for a rightful place at the table where decisions are made because if you're not a table you're on the menu because for us diversity is more than just a nice picture in a brochure it's the very mechanism that we demand in order to create meaningful change when I raise my voice the one that Miss Harper helped me find all those years ago I do so on behalf of our community so that every Latina and Latino student can see themselves one day as CEO a senator a president the representation so we have a solemn responsibility to open as many doors for as many of our fellow Americans as possible that is what we fight for and why I'm proud every day to be your United States Senator that is why what we mean when we say that a win for the American people is a win for the Latino Community they are one and the same simple as that so whether it's the American Rescue plan that helped our local communities beat back covet or the bipartisan infrastructure law that will help fix our roads and bridges whether it's the pack act we live veterans or the chip sack to boost our economy or the inflation reduction act to bring down costs I think about that specifically when communities big challenge with diabetes for the first time we will have a 35 cap on insulin is [Applause] so we have passed Landmark bills that touch on the major issues of the day we have helped get vulnerable Latinos vaccinated so we can beat this virus once and for all we have invested in our buses our trains and our highways so the Latinos will dependent on public transportation can rely them to get to where they need to go to go and be delivered for Hispanic vectors for Hispanic solar panelists Builders Dock Workers and truckers nurses and other Frontline workers who keep large up Supply chains running in short we've passed bills into law that will transform millions of Hispanic lives by bringing down costs and boosting our economy we have only been able to do this because alongside my fellow Democratic Latino Senators currently there are three others but hopefully one day there will be more we have been on the front lines of pushing the powers to be to do more think about these major accomplishments over the past two years we cut child poverty in half prescription drug costs will be capped in the first time ever for uh we have increased insurance coverage for 700 000 more Latinos thanks to the Affordable Care Act we are creating cleaner air and lower emissions to address climate change and to take care of the Injustice that so many of our communities live next to places where the air is simply not clean enough we are creating millions of good paying unit jobs across the country and clean energy field all of this matters because Latinos get the job done as a community that has been battered by covet that has been burdened with student loan debt that has seen a greater share of its paycheck he stretched thin with Rising course we the Latinos were elected to serve you have gone to bed for you every single day so let me close this Hispanic Heritage Month I'm celebrating in true fashion I will have Willie Colon and Celia Cruz songs on there will be lechon in the oven and maybe a mojito in my hand that no matter how you choose to celebrate at home I hope that you take the heart of being part of an incredible Latino family that is 62 62 million people strong there is a reason in this country that Latinos have asserted their rightful place there is a reason why salsa outsells capture there is a reason why the Grammys the Oscars and the Emmys are seeing more and more of us on stage it's because as the saying goes we stand on the shoulders of giants and we walk in the footsteps of those who came before us so today I want to end as I normally do with a brief note about my hero the Latina who made it all possible my mother is foreign [Music] there isn't a day that goes by that I don't miss to the day I wish that I could see her you know Mommy [Applause] and hard work thank you for allowing me to carry on your work as your son my friends only in America could the son of refugees the first in his family to go to college who lived in horror in a tenement here in Union City could rise to be one of 100 United States senators in a country of 320 million people but that is the promise of America or future Generations thanks to her to you to the grace of God that I get up every day to serve the people of New Jersey and the United States Senate and so this Hispanic Heritage Month let us never forget where we came from let us not never stop moving forward towards where we are destined to be quite [Music] is please once again put your hands together

the first Latina superintendent of the Jersey City public school system who is present here today this is [Applause] [Applause] now I'm going to introduce an extraordinary woman but before I do I want to uh introduce another extraordinary woman the love of my life my wife Nadine hello Nadine's get up say hello everybody [Applause] now it's my honor to present today's first award as many of you may know every March I hold my annual women's History Month celebration where I on our trailblazing women from across New Jersey in honor of my late mother daughter celebrations in 2020 I had planned on honoring a dear colleague an extraordinary Fighter for working families and Latino communities in our state however due to covid we had to cancel both our 2020 and 2021 women's History Month celebration when we held one earlier this year I had planned on presenting her with her award but her schedule wasn't able to make it so today after nearly two years I am proud to finally able to present this award to our champion in Trenton state senator Teresa Ruiz and it is fitting that we do so today during Hispanic Heritage Month as we celebrate well over a decade of Senator luis's illustrious career says [Applause] in that time she'd been on the front lines fighting for our state's most vulnerable community he's LED Landmark legislative efforts on edge in everything she seeks to do she brings a determination that is unmatched I often say to people if I am in a fight I want Senator Ruiz to be in the fight with me [Applause] uh she has made history in New Jersey as I said as the first Latina not just the first Latina to serve in the New Jersey State Senate and as the New Jersey State Senate Majority Leader I said is [Applause] picture again good afternoon everyone let's hear it again for for someone who Puerto Rico canes as his own who's my friend and my brother in public service Senator Bob Menendez [Applause] I'm a little I'm a little I'm a little dressed down but it was because the city of Newark had their Puerto Rican parade and if I didn't show up to this event today I know Rudy would have sent a Union City police officers to my house to come so as I was chatting with Congressman Ceres and I said I can't remember why and then the senator started um the years of explanation 2021 in covet but before he gave the excuse the congressman said because let's hear it for Congressman albio series who's dedicated himself to New Jersey and I know that there is a wonderful human being I don't know if he's in the room with us who will be assuming that position and who becomes my congressman and I can't ever be so proud of having a young Dynamic man who takes a page out of his dad's book but I know will pave the way in his own rights and that's a future Congressman about Menendez Jr [Applause] we are more than a month we get together from September 15 through October 15th but in Trenton they know that Latina in history month is 365 days a year because there's never a moment where I don't use the opportunity that I've been honored with and blessed to go on the turnpike and bring the voices of so many women that have been marginalized and left outside of the conversation so I was talking to students on Friday in the middle of that speech I got really um passionate and on the verge of just anger that it was the woman who was stacking shows at the supermarket when we were all afraid to go into any store or anyone they got we were ordering online to get our food deliveries during covet she didn't have a chance she could not make the decision on her health she reported to work on a daily basis and it is precisely that woman that this country and this state in our communities forget that's why I go down to train as tired as I am as angry as I get to be sure that the person who doesn't have a direct voice in conversations not because they don't want or because they don't have the love or the passion or the opportunity to articulate but they're surviving whether they're going to pay rent or or make the the electricity bill or to be sure that they have food on the table that is the purpose of public not to come here moments and to accept beautiful Awards but to fight the good fight even when you're standing alone and Senator Menendez has demonstrated that over time and time and time again I remember during Hurricane Maria meeting him at Newark Airport when the federal government would not offer him an opportunity to go down on any of the rides and that was because they were probably putting so much paper towels on the plane that they didn't deem it fit to have the person that we call our Senator down there really getting at the stroke of the that today when I'm sitting here and I'm getting images and videos from our family after the federal government poured billions of dollars into infrastructure [Music] you can't even sneeze agua pero vision is [Music] to ask the real questions and to figure out why is it that a colony of this country continues to be treated the way we do that per capita we have more human beings who have dedicated themselves to Armed Services and yet in moments like this all backs are turned on us that is why I go down to trade because if you don't think for a moment what are your races Senator Menendez to take the stories of our parents who came here to choose this country just the same way anyone else does on a daily basis wanting a better quality of life for their children that if you don't understand there is an urgency impacting the Latino Community when the scores come out in the state for all the learning laws that we had during covid that we are in the midst of a crisis that's going to require woman power like nothing ever before because if you're not in the room like the senator said you are cut out of the equation and that even though sometimes he and I and the congressman may be the only ones and we may sound a little bit different and my hands may be used more than often and my hoop earrings may swing every now and again that it is viably important that we're in their spaces so to all of you all of you today when you're in the voting booth no one's checking to see if you have an accent no one is checking to see if if you love a specific way or if you're a man and a woman that is where you have the most power believe in people who have belief in you and this country will get better and better every day believe in people during this midterm election that understand that when I have choice about my body it is my choice and no one else can that my six-year-old seemed to be six-year-old has less directors and it's 2022. we have a lot to celebrate and I am so grateful of the women who carved out the way for me and the men who stood in spaces when they were told that they weren't enough on their shoulders and with their tears I stand before you here today but our work is far from being done we are more than a month and we are a Powerhouse when we're United to all of the honorees congratulations to Blanca Rosa gracias for your eloquent speech and reminding us the importance of being in tune to who we are and most importantly to Nuestra Familia I may not be from Union City and I'm not from Hudson County but you best believe when there's a fight and Latinos are getting out my armor is up and I'm duking it out on your behalf congratulations and God bless you all foreign please put your hands together for our Senate Majority Leader Terrace as she mentioned it is not always easy to represent your community in certain spaces and most most certainly to command that respect and how to be addressed I can tell you personally she is a woman that always has demanded respect and how to be addressed and that begins by how you address her do not address her by Teresa but Teresa and I applaud that every time next coming to the stage again salsa versus ketchup right senator coming to the stage we have kimbara dance studio performing a wonderful dance for all of us [Music] [Music] let's go guys [Applause] [Music] no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

budget committee which I was part of him when I got to this country when I arrived Iraq we were going to go obviously from New Jersey because my mother had a sister in New Jersey and since my mother made the decisions in the channel we were going to end up in New Jersey no matter what but as we went through the the process in Miami as a refugee they gave me a set of gloves they gave me a hack and a cup because we're going to go into cold the weather so I tell my friends I'm the budget committee on the other side I said that was the best investment this country could have made because I have paid with my taxes for those gloves for that hack and for that code a million times over in my example is not unique all those people that came to this country we come here for the opportunity for the freedom to raise our families and to get a better life we don't come here like they say that we walk drug dealers and we're bad and all these things we contribute to the mighty culture of this country

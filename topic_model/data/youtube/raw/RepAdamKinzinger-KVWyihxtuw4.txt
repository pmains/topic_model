  HOPING THAT CLARK WOULD THEN  HELP HIM WEAPONIZE THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT TO HELP HIM OVERTURN  THE RESULTS OF THE 2020  ELECTION. I WANT TO TURN TO THE SELECT  COMMITTEE MEMBER >>> REPUBLICAN OF ILLINOIS. CONGRESSMAN, THANKS SO MUCH  FOR -- FOR JOINING US. THE HEARING -- THE HEARING WAS  REALLY ABOUT TRUMP'S ATTEMPT TO  WEAPONIZE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BUT IT ENDED WITH THE PANEL  REVEALING NAMES OF REPUBLICAN  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WHOM  WITNESSES SAY SOUGHT PREEMPTIVE  PARDONS FROM THEN-PRESIDENT  TRUMP. THEY INCLUDE CONGRESSMAN MO  BROOKS, MATT GAETZ, ANDY BIGGS,  LOUIE GOHMERT, SCOTT PERRY,  PERHAPS MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. IT'S UNCLEAR. HER -- HERS IS LESS DIRECT. THESE ARE SILL YOUR SITTING  COLLEAGUES IN THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES. WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM? SHOULD THEY BE CENSURED? REMOVED FROM COMMITTEES? WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> NO, LOOK. I GUESS THAT'S A DECISION FOR  COLLEAGUES, RIGHT? I MEAN, MY JOB IS TO PUT THE  EVIDENCE OUT THERE. AND AS I SAID AT THE END OF  THAT, I ONLY KNOW OF ONE RECENT  TO SEEK A PARDON -- BECAUSE YOU  ARE WORRIED THAT YOU ARE GUILTY. THAT YOU COMMITTED A CRIME. THIS IS SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO  ANSWER TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T ENFORCE RULES  OF THE HOUSE OR DO CERTAIN  THINGS UNILATERALLY. BUT I THIS I THE BIGGEST POINT  IS, LISTEN, AMERICA. DO YOU REALLY WANT YOUR POSSIBLE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OUT THERE  TRYING TO BEND OR BREAK THE LAW  SO THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN  POLITICAL POWER? THAT IS LIKE ANATHEMA TO  EVERYTHING WE LEARNED IN HISTORY CLASS WHETHER IN 3rd GRADE OR A  SENIOR AND THAT IS GOT TO STOP.  >> YOU HAD ROSEN, DONOGHUE, AND  ENGEL TESTIFYING TODAY. THESE ARE OFFICIALS WHOP LOYAL  TO DONALD TRUMP BUT WERE WILLING TO RESIGN INSTEAD OF GO ALONG  WITH HIS UNCONSTITUTIONAL,  PERHAPS ILLEGAL, SCHEME. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE THE  TRUMP LOYALISTS THAT WE JUST  MENTIONED. THESE -- THESE REPUBLICAN  MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE. DO YOU THINK, IN YOUR OPINION,  ARE THEY FIT TO REPLAIN IN  OFFICE? >> YEAH. AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE. THAT IS A DECISION BETWEEN THEM  AND THEIR COULDN'T STITCH WENTS. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRESENT WHAT I PRESENTED. I WILL SAY THIS, THOUGH. LET'S CONTRAST THEM TO THESE  THREE GENTLEMEN THAT WERE IN  FRONT THERE TODAY. I AM I AM SURE ALL THREE OF THEM VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. I AM SURE ALL THREE OF THEM WERE SAD HE LOST. I AM SURE ALL THREE OF THEM  WISHED THE ELECTION WOULD HAVE  BEEN DIFFERENT. IT'S TOUGH TO EXPLAIN HOW MUCH  PRESSURE IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE A  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  PUTTING THAT ON YOU FOR ALL OF  THEM TO STAND STRONG. FOR ALL THE DEPUTY, YOU NO HE,  ATTORNEY -- ATTORNEYS TO  BASICALLY MAKE THE DECISION THAT THEY WERE GOING TO ALL RESIGN,  IT IS AN AMAZING STORY AND THAT  COURAGE HONESTLY BUT I THINK THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN  MIND, AND I KIND OF SAID THIS IN MY OPENING STATEMENT IS WHAT  WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMETHING  DIFFERENT HAPPENED IN THE  FUTURE? WHAT IF ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE  WOULD HAVE SAID WE WILL PUT THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE STAMP ON  YOUR LIES AND CONSPIRACY? THIS -- THIS DEMOCRACY WOULD BE  IN TROUBLE. THIS ISN'T OVER. WE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS.  >> DONOGHUE, THE -- THE FORMER  DEPUTY -- ACTING-DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL -- SAID THAT HE TOLD  JEFFREY CLARK THAT CLARK WAS  ADVOCATING, QUOTE, NOTHING LESS  THAN MEDDLING IN THE OUTCOME OF  AN ELECTION ASK WE ALSO HEARD  THAT CLARK WAS CONDUCTING HIS  OWN INVESTIGATION. UM, AND TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT VOTING MACHINES. UM, THE IDEA THAT TRUMP WAS  TELLING JEFFREY ROSEN TO SEIZE,  YOU KNOW, WHY HAVEN'T YOU SEIZED THE MACHINE? IN YOUR VIEW, DO YOU THINK THAT  THE COMMITTEE HEARD OR PRESENTED EVIDENCE TODAY THAT TRUMP  DIRECTED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  TO BREAK THE LAW? >> I THINK WE HAVE SHOWN A LOT  OF EVIDENCE THAT THE PRESIDENT  KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. THE BREAKING THE LAW PART, I  THINK YESSER PERSONALLY. BUT AGAIN, I LIKE TO LEAVE THAT  TO DOJ. IRONICALLY, DOJ WAS ON THE STAND TODAY. THEY PROBABLY HAVE A SPECIAL  INTEREST IN WHAT HAPPENED AT  THIS MOMENT. YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT THE  VOTING MACHINE THING. THINK ABOUT THIS. THE PRESIDENT ASKED ROSEN TO  SEIZE VOTING MACHINES. HE SAID I DIDN'T COUNTY DO IT SO THE PRESIDENT CALLED KEN  CUCINELLI AT DHS AND SAID, HEY,  ROSEN HERE SAID YOU CAN SEIZE  VOTING MACHINES. K, HE NEVER SAID THAT BUT JUST  GOES TO SHOW YOU CAN'T TRUST  ANYTHING THE PRESIDENT SAID. THANKFULLY, CUCINELLI SAID WE  CAN'T SEIZE MACHINES EITHER.  >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO  TELLING AND I GUESS WE HAVE  KNOWN THIS FOR YEARS NOW BUT  JUST TO SEE IT PLAY OUT BECAUSE  OF THE COMMITTEE' HEARINGS IS  THAT, YOU KNOW, A FEW PEOPLE  DIFFERENT IN THOSE ROLES, YOU  KNOW, A BUNCH OF JEFFREY CLARKS, SERVING AS VICE PRESIDENT,  SERVING AS ACTING ATTORNEY  GENERAL. SERVING AS SECRETARY OF STATE OF GEORGIA. JUST A HANDFUL OF JEFFREY  CLARK'S REPLACING ANY OF THOSE  INDIVIDUALS AND ALL THESE  INDIVIDUALS I AM TALKING ABOUT  ARE TRUMP LOYALIST CONSERVATIVE  REPUBLICANS. AND WE VERY WELL COULD HAVE LOST DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES.  >> YEAH. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE KNOWS THAT? NOT JUST YOU. NOT JUST ME BUT THE STEVE  BANNONS OF THE WORLD THAT  ACTUALLY PLANNING THIS. THEY -- THEY THINK, UNDER THE  RADAR, THEY CAN PUT IN LOYALIST  AND FRANKLY THEY CAN. I MEAN, THAT IS THE POINT IS  EVERY ONE OF THESE HEARINGS WE  HAVE DONE, WE HAVE SHOWN LIKE A  LAYER OF STUFF THAT COULD GO  WRONG. AND THERE IS REALLY NO, LIKE --  THERE IS NO MAGIC POLICE FORCE  THAT IF PEOPLE DON'T FOLLOW  THROUGH ON THEIR OATH IS GOING  TO COME IN AND ENFORCE THAT. IT IS REALLY JUST US HAVING TO  HOLD TRUE TO WHAT WE BELIEVE. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- WHAT --  WHAT HAPPENS IN TRUMP'S SECOND  TERM, IN THEORY, OR A TRUMP  ACCOLADE IN HIS TERM IN  PRESIDENCY. NOW, HE CAN INTERVIEW ANYBODY  FOR DOJ OR ANY POSITION AND SAYS IS YOUR LOYALTY TO ME OR IS TO  THE CONSTITUTION? AND EVENTUALLY, TRUST ME, YOU  ARE GONNA FIND PEOPLE THAT WILL  SAY I WILL PLEDGE MY LOYALTY TO  YOU OVER THE CONSTITUTION.  >> I REMEMBER YOU TELLING ME ONE TIME THAT THE GUARDRAILS HELD. BUT SOMETIMES, YOU DRIVE BY  GUARDRAILS ON A HIGHWAY AND YOU  SEE THAT IT'S DENTED AND IT  HELD. BUT THEN YOU WONDER IS IT GOING  TO HOLD NEXT TIME? >> THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH. I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY SAVE  SOMEONE'S LIFE IF YOU DESTROY A  CAR BUT WE ARE GOING TO PLUNGE  OFF CLIFF. WE ARE REALLY THERE AND THIS IS  THE THING. IT IS GREAT TO TELL THE STORY  BUT THE BIGGEST POINT IS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU HAVE TO VOTE  NOT BASE ON EVERY LITTLE ISSUE  THAT BOTHE

the Chairman I rise today in support of HR 3189 a wonderful bill called the form the Fed oversight reform and modernization act the form act and you know marriner eccles chairman of the Federal Reserve under President Franklin Roosevelt once began testimony to Congress by stating quote I'm speaking for the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System an agency of Congress and quote chairman Eccles recognized what many seem to have forgotten about the Federal Reserve's hundred year plus history that the Fed was created by Congress the board of governors are all appointed for terms of fourteen years by the President and confirmed by Congress and it operates per its charter and laws set out by yes Congress therefore the Federal Reserve is actually or theoretically is supposed to be accountable to Congress to say that today the Federal Reserve is one of the most powerful institutions in the world it is past time to restore transparency at the Fed and to hold it accountable to the American taxpayers the US Federal Reserve System or the Fed as it's known as created in 1913 in response to a series of economic crisis early in the 20th century and all the felt although the Fed was created as an independent agency deriving its powers from Congress over the past 100 years the feds power has significantly expanded while originally created to provide stability in the banking business the Federal Reserve has gained unprecedented power influence and control over the financial system while remaining shrouded in mystery to the American people at the same time the American people have continued to suffer through a financial crisis at least once per generation with such a poor record the Fed should not be free to carry on account without accountability to the institution that created it while we will not fully realize robust economic growth until the Fed changes the conduct of its monetary policy passed since the recession officially ended but the US economic opportunity it remains well short of its potential the Fed must be accountable to the people's representatives as well as to the two hard-working taxpayers themselves we need to modernize the Federal Reserve restore accountability and bring it into the 21st century that is why I introduced HR 3189 the form act of 2015 the format makes two fundamental changes to improve how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy now i know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle tend to kind of like to pass bills before they know what's in those bills that's one of the ways that they discover what is in those bills but if they actually read this bill they would see that it protects the feds ability to develop what it believes is the best course of action on monetary policy the exact opposite of what my colleague was saying but it requires them to then give the American people a greater accounting of its actions my bill directs the Federal Reserve to transparently communicate its monetary policy decisions to the American taxpayers not what it must do as is being asserted rather they must simply explain what they are doing and why they are doing it by requiring the Fed to regularly communicate how its policy choices compared to a benchmark guideline instead of continuing to ad hoc strategy currently being employed the form act will help consumers and investors make better decisions in both the present and create more sound expectations about the future even chair Yellen wants champion the merits of this approach stating that the quote framework of a tailer type rule could help the Federal Reserve communicate to the public the rationale behind policy moves end quote the format does not dictate any particular monetary policy course it simply ensures that the Fed transparency communicates its monetary policy decisions and I can't agree more with with the chair Yellen second the forum act reforms the Federal Reserve's emergency lending powers section 13 3 of the Federal Reserve Act closing a glaring loophole and preventing the likelihood of future bailouts as we've seen in the past during the last financial crisis the Fed used extraordinarily broad powers to provide trillions of dollars in low-cost loans to a handful of massive financial institutions the for Mac raises the bar from the current trigger permitting the Fed to invoke its emergency lending powers only upon finding that quote and this is from the text of the bill unusual and exigent circumstances exist that pose to a threat to the financial stability of the United States close quote responsibility limiting the Federal Reserve's lending authority has supported from head support from across the ideological spectrum ranging from conservatives to liberals such as senator Elizabeth Warren the form act also does the following it requires the Fed to conduct cost-benefit analysis for all of the regulations at promulgates failure to conduct cost-benefit analysis results in excessive regulatory burdens on small banks and businesses which harm the economy and I believe has slowed our recovery it also requires transparency about the Federal Reserve Bank stress tests as well as the international financial regulatory negotiations conducted by the Federal Reserve the Treasury Department the Office of the Comptroller of the currency Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation mr. chairman I'm afraid that we are sliding into a much broader a much broader area of regulation that is not u.s. regulation but is actually european and world regulation it requires the Federal Reserve to disclose the salaries of highly paid employees it provides for at least two staff positions to advise each member of the Board of Governors independent from the chair and it requires Fed employees to abide by the same ethical requirements as other federal financial regulators that sounds like an excellent idea in my mind it clarifies the blackout period governing wind Federal Reserve governors and employees may publicly speak to Congress public on certain matters and it automatically at the Federal Open Market Committee table which provides a more balanced representation of votes on the federal on federal policy at the FOMC it requires the full FOMC to decide policy rates on excess balances maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank by a depository institution it removes restrictions placed on the GAO the Government Accountability Office ability to audit the Fed and it directs the GAO to conduct an audit of the Fed within 12 months of enactment and report back to Congress finally the form act establishes a bipartisan monetary Commission as proposed by chairman Brady to identify other opportunities for improvement mr. chairman we can no longer afford to have an entity with so much power as the Federal Reserve without operate without by operating on a whim with ad hoc policy the reforms in this legislation strike the right balance between holding the Fed accountable to Congress and the American people while still affording it its independence to make monetary policy decisions free from political pressure of all stripes the Federal Reserve System is an agency of Congress as such it is not available and is not and its independence should be should not be unlimited let's restore proper congressional supervision and provide the American people with transparency I urge my colleagues to vote in support of HR 3189 the Fed oversight reform and modernization act of 2015 and with that I yield back

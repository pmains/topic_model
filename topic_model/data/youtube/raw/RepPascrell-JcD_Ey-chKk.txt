to the point with congressman bill pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of new jersey's ninth congressional district hello i'm congressman bill pasquale i'd like to welcome you to the latest edition of to the point this february marked a centennial that passed with little fanfare the authorization for congress to levy a federal income tax under the 16th amendment to the united states constitution although we've been paying federal taxes for more than a century now there hasn't been an overhaul of the tax code in nearly a generation as congress continues working on a path towards tax reform most americans would agree that our current tax code could well use a rewrite unnecessary complexities have led to taxpayers spending 7.6 billion hours and roughly 140 billion a year to comply with the daunting requirements in countless pages of paperwork at the same time big corporations like apple and google have been in the news for taking advantage of huge loopholes that allow them to shift their massive profits off overseas and to avoid paying taxes here at home many of the highest earning individuals often end up paying lower tax rates than working americans like teachers or cops firefighters reforming our tax code gives us an opportunity to create a fair system and also could stimulate job growth and create new economic opportunities while closing gapping loopholes with me today are two people that have spent their careers working on tax policy to shed some light on how we are going to fix our nation's tax system and what this means for the taxpayer like you and me mark mazur is the assistant secretary for tax policy with the united states department of treasury and is responsible for developing analyzing and coordinating treasuries and the white house's agenda its policies and the guidance in tax issues mark has spent 23 years working for the federal government including quest positions at the congressional joint committee on taxation the president's council of economic advisers and the national economic council under president clinton and the department of energy len berman is director of the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and the brooklyn brookings institute that provides analysis about tax policy to policy makers journalists researchers and the public len is also professor of public administration and international affairs at the maxwell school of syracuse university and the senior research associate at syracuse university center for policy research leon is author of the book and i've looked at that book and read the book taxes in america which offers an in-depth analysis of our nation's tax system and how it can be improved thank you both for being here and i'm really honored with people of your distinction to come on our show and talk to people straight across that's why you're asked to be here so you're not going to water any of the wine and that's a good sign i got a question to throw out and i i would direct the question um to to uh to len but i want you to jump in mark uh because i think it's very basic to what we're talking about how does this tax system how did it get to where it is right now and what will it take to change course uh and if do we need to change course in the direction that it's going start us offline well it's certainly a mess uh as you've pointed out in your introductory remarks and let's talk about we're talking about federal taxes because people here taxes they're talking about congressman what are you gonna do my my property taxes what do you do about my dog license fee now that the senator so we're talking about federal taxes everybody remember that go ahead and we're mostly talking about federal income taxes right although for most americans the biggest tax they pay is the payroll tax and most people don't really object to that because it pays for social security and medicare which they want the income tax the income tax is really complicated and part is complicated just because people's lives are complicated self-employed people you know they would their their situation would be complex no matter what but it's also complicated because i mean in part because of the pressures on on members of congress to do things to try to address problems and increasingly they've been doing it through the tax code there are more than 200 individual we call them tax expenditures which is a really nerdy term but basically it means that they're kind of spending programs that are run through the tax code and they're subsidies for all sorts of different activities they're all well intended i know you've been at lots of hearings where you've talked about these different things probably some of them should be in the code but the the problem is that it's that a lot of these things really aren't worth the the complexity they create for people they create opportunities for tax avoidance uh and it also sort of creates this funny situation where you know basically you owe a bunch of tax to the government but the government says well if you fill out all of these forms you can get some of it back which to me seems like a bad deal so the tax system seems to me you know ways and means committee we deal with this subject every day but it seems to me that what you make what you gather in as income or assets or whatever the case maybe we'll get to that you want to protect to the best of your ability now if you're a big corporation okay uh if you're fairly well to do you can hire 50 lawyers to protect that the regular guy can't do that he can't afford to hire all these attorneys right and and that's where this list of deductibles uh specialties grows and grows and grows and yet i'll give you a tough argument len if you want to take away uh the mortgage income deductible the interest deductible i'll give you a tough argument i mean it would bury new jersey i think if okay let's actually take it's a great example so when we talk about closing loopholes yeah it kind of sounds like well of course you don't want to  it out you know you don't want it well but when you look at that list of tax expenditures the mortgage interest deduction is right at the top of the list along with the tax break for health insurance which people also like but the thing about the mortgage interest deduction is that it doesn't help a lot of people in new jersey uh only 30 percent of people itemize their deductions they're the only ones who can get any benefit at all 30 30 and they're the only ones who can get any benefit at all from the mortgage-interested election uh and among those a lot of them don't actually get much benefit because if they're they're they're hardly better off than they would be if they didn't add up all their receipts and take the deductions anyway but it's different in every state though it is it is different in every state but depending on how that state depends upon income of the property taxes yeah but the property taxes stay in local taxes you know i guess one benefit of being in new jersey new york where i live for four years is those taxes make you want to itemize every year but the the the thing is that the biggest benefit goes to the people who don't really need help paying for housing people in the 39.6 tax bracket that most people get little or nothing and it probably pushes up housing prices you could take some of the money that goes into the mortgage interest deduction you could re-target it so that it was really aimed at middle-income people the people who really need help would you needs test that deduction you could make it into say a 15 credit and not make people itemize at all most people would be better off with that and the government would save money uh yeah what do you think about that more i think part of what you want to do with the tax system is you want to look at an efficient way to raise revenue you want to do it in a way that's fair or perceived as fair and you want to do it in a way that's administerable and simple so that individuals can understand what's going on so they don't need to go and get professional help to do their taxes i think on the mortgage introduction you can argue both ways on that you can argue that as llenn does that you could target it better and have better outcomes for housing and better outcomes for for support of the housing market and cost less revenue in in the long run or you could keep it in place as we've done because it is perceived as popular um you probably get um incoming letters from all kinds of folks on the social real estate industry who rely on that as a selling point not so much a selling point but it sustains people in their homes i don't think people buy a home because they can deduct it from their income tax i think they buy a home because they like the place they the schools whatever the case may be however in sustaining it down they like the idea even if it's only 30 they like the idea of going in on their income tax and making that deduction so i get something back on paying property taxes to the local community but i don't i don't get have a sense that that's going to change do you um it would be a big political lift for it to occur although actually they have the administration that would limit the subs that limit the subsidy somewhat basically that you know right now the value of your deduction depends on your tax bracket so 39.6 bracket you get huge subsidy from the government's per dollar yeah and if you're if you're in a 10 bracket you get 10 cents or actually even less yeah uh so the the obama administration proposed to limit the value of the subsidy to 28 so most people would be unaffected by this at all but people at the very top get a little haircut on do you think that ever that that has a good chance of being reformed this year no do you think it does we proposed as part of the budget it's sort of up to you on the ways and means committee to consider it i don't see any movement though at this point you don't see chairman campus talked about in the head of the ways and means committee really pushed tax reform this is not the environment tax reform is a big lift generally you're going to have a lot of people who perceive themselves as losing tax benefits you'll have some people who presume themselves as gaining tax benefits but generally the losers are more vocal than the winners and so politically it's just a big a big lift and i think chairman camps held hearings he's done a ton of educational work for the committee um i think he's done the necessary work to move forward on this it'd be great for him to move forward in this in a bipartisan way you don't think it's going to happen now not this year it's just a big political lift well you know that that brings up uh another topic people are talking about we're talking about the federal taxes here and people are burdened by property taxes people are burdened by excise taxes the people are burned by a lot of different taxes um people don't realize right now that they're actually paying less of their income in income taxes than they were 50 40 30 20 years ago am i correct in stating that i think that's right certainly for for most people uh that i mean the rates are much lower right when i came to washington uh top rates were 50 percent uh in the 1960s they were kennedy yeah uh so tax rates or tax rates are lower in a lot of ways the tax code is better than it was you know 30 or 40 years ago but we've got all these thousands of pages in the code but who put those pages there joe the barber did not well they kind of married the truck driver who put all these pages in the tax code they they kind of did though conservatives talking about this all the time massive tax code who put them there well you did well yeah the racial means committee did that for sure we haven't put any in lately but you know who has the opportunity the wherewithal the financial backing to do something like that there's two ways to look at that i think one is that there is often a demand for doing something with the tax code for instance providing tax incentives for education and that would come from middle-income people saying that we would like some additional help with with education financing is this the this is pleasantly deductible so the the american opportunity tax credit is a tax credit that the obama administration pushed to make higher education affordable for middle-income families that that was probably driven by middle-income folks on the other hand that was not coming from corporate america on the other hand you have corporate corporate uh interests and hike of individuals looking for ways to shelter or lower their tax bills i'm going to when we come back after the break i'm going to ask you both what is needed really to move us in a different direction for a fairer code but first of all i want to know do you think that the code is fair or not fair right now and then how do we make it fair and then i want to get into the subject of redistribution of wealth in america which democrats i told you before we're not supposed to even talk about the last thing you want to use is the word redistribution for sure they'll call you socialist but we've had a redistribution of wealth we'll get back to that in just a moment and we'll be back with our guests just hanging for the millions living with copd breathing becomes a real struggle copd stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but you may have heard of it as chronic bronchitis or emphysema over time it makes it harder and harder to breathe until you feel like you're breathing through a straw copd is the fourth leading cause of death in the u.s it kills one person every four minutes and it took my grandmother an estimated 24 million americans are affected but as many as half of them don't even know it it's a race against time to spread the word about this serious disease if you're over 35 and have ever smoked you could be at risk the good news is there are steps you can take to improve your symptoms i'm danica patrick and i drive for copd take action today to breathe better tomorrow join the movement at drive for copd.com take our screening questionnaire today and talk to your doctor we're back with our guests mark mazur and lynn berman thank you so much for for doing this today uh is the tax system fair mark i think overall people's perception of taxes overall the perception of the tax system is that people perceive it as unfair but if you look at the data the data seem to indicate that higher income people pay a larger share of their income on average than lower income people so in a sense the federal income tax at least is based on ability to pay and generally viewed as fair if you add all the other taxes together excise taxes payroll taxes corporate income taxes again the distribution is progressive in that higher income folks pay a larger fraction of their bear a larger fraction of the burden and lower income folks what do you think the percentages of people who don't forget your thought but what do you think the percentages of the people who don't pay any income tax but pay all the other federal taxes what's the percentage that doesn't pay any federal income tax 40 40 23 45 pay no income taxes but but the vast majority of those people pay payroll taxes 15 i mean between their employers themselves right 15 of their wages uh social security and medicare they pay excise taxes they pay stay in local taxes they've got i mean they're plenty they're tax plenty enough right i mean among the people who don't pay any that we can't find any federal taxes that that they pay i mean some of them are just really poor it's a really tiny fraction about 20 percent of them are old people who are just retired and we decided that if you're just living on social security we're not going to take a tax hit right so it's an easy target for some folks down here to say in washington while these people are playing and they're all doll drifters they're all hangers on that's not the case when you look into that that 40 some odd percent who don't pay any income tax they pay all the other federal taxes as well on limited incomes for the most part and yet there are there are some people who are very very rich who don't pay any taxes how does that happen well some of them are earning their income overseas and we don't tax it in the u.s until they bring it home some of them if we're bringing they ever do some of them get a lot of income from tax exemptions call repatriation yeah some of them have a lot of tax exempt bonds they're wealthy but we just decided that most tax exempt bonds are never subject to you do you think that's fair you didn't fair no it's fair that you could take your money offshore i mean it depends there are some legitimate purposes for which you would actually be investing overseas i actually think you should be taxed on your worldwide income uh and treasury actually has some proposals bill bradley would say you should tax income yeah you should tax income i actually want to make a point about what mark was saying and you answered a question about fairness i think you would have said this as well said there are two two notions of fairness one is when your income goes up do you pay more and the answer is that for the most part the federal tax system is progressive state taxes are not so much but there's another measure of fairness which is how you treat people who are kind of similar and our tax system they're wildly different tax tax rates depending on what kinds of things you do or how good your tax lawyer accountant is getting out of it you're good for instance just have regular interest income and interest from tax exempt bonds you could earn the exact amount of income and one is taxable ones not taxable yeah and that brings us to the to the subject and topic we talked about just very briefly before uh and that is income distribution right um when one looks at the last 50 years it would seem to me objectively and tell me if i'm wrong correct me that we've had a redistribution of wealth that more wealth has risen to the top i don't let's get past the argument well some people work and some people are just lazy we're beyond that that's not the case and everybody should be working and if they're not and they can they should be punished financially not taken to jail or anything but financially but how is am i right in saying that there has been a redistribution upward and that the working person can keep less of his money now than 50 years ago 40 years ago 30 years ago is that an exaggeration is that hyperbole i mean i i i guess i would view it in a somewhat different way which is that the economy has become more and more skewed towards people the very very top now how did that happen uh i mean in part that's important globalization well globalization i mean we're technology i mean a big thing is like ceo which is not available to the average working person not available the average working person the other thing is that it used to be that ceos were well paid they they lived in nice parts of new jersey but they weren't making hundreds of millions of dollars and the for reasons i don't fully understand it i mean that the people at the very very top just earn enormous wages and people you know the middle tiers you know are are they're doing okay but they're not not great and middle income people in the united states their incomes have been flat for the last 30 or 40 years and why uh what caused that flat 30 40 year period where wages have not gone up for the average working male female in this country economists argue over that a lot yeah one of the things is decline of unions um so there's less bargaining power for um middle-class people second i think that doesn't sound like walmart second i think is this idea linus talked about kind of a of a redistribution where folks who are able to capture larger gains from from productivity and organization do whereas 30 40 50 years ago they may have had more of a paternalistic view of their company and kind of not taking quite so much for themselves the anger about more people beginning to understand this martin len has led to all kinds of political movements political gestures and i think that if you peel back the onion you will see that there's a lot in common between the tea party and many people on the far left go ahead actually let me make you agree i disagree with that i do actually i mean well if they actually understood pretty scary thought but well that i mean part of what's happening it used to be that technology helped everybody you know you you you know when when henry ford learned how to set up the assembly line people got good wages because they became all of a sudden more productive one person could produce lots and lots of cars now technology you know we've got two kinds of technology there's still a technology that makes some people more productive particularly the people who can use the machines and are well educated there's another kind of technology that replaces replaces low-wage workers and even middle-wage workers increasingly every time you go to the grocery store and you check out at one of those automated checkout things that's pushing down wages for for the people who actually do work behind the counters there's going to be more and more and more of that and you know there's there is a real concern that going forward that that that the people own like the capital the people who own those machines are going to get more you know get get huge gains but the people who can be replaced by them you're not going to pay a checker more than it costs to to pay for the machine and the cost price those machines is going to go down mark how come we do not discuss more of what len and you and i are just talking about this right now how come we don't discuss this formal discussions committee discussions about this redis distribution of wealth we talked about this 20 30 years ago that that's you know communism socialism redistributing the federal government should not be trying to move uh income from this person to that person and there's a and there's a grain of truth in that we're not a socialistic system we don't want to pretend to be or aim at that but on the other hand 30 years ago when we changed tax codes and when we started to tax income more than assets because you can hide assets overseas etc etc etc nobody got up and said we're going to redistribute take it away for the middle class or give it to the rich that didn't happen that didn't happen what are we missing here and why aren't we discussing this i think you need more of a debate on what kind of an economy is sustainable i think the president's been clear about an idea of growing the economy from the middle out having a strong middle class has been historically important for the for the american economy so we need to do things that would address middle class jobs we need to invest in education we need to invest in the types of capital infrastructure roads bridges and so on that they need to to to thrive and as a country we've not made those important investments in the last decade or so you think the president's saying the middle class cut off here uh for non-taxation 250 000 is that a good number is that a poor number is it a debatable number one i think it's a debatable number i mean what's your thoughts my thought is that 250 000 is above the level at which most of the people working at the white house get paid so it seems like that must be rich people but uh it's a very cynical view but uh you know i like it but yeah uh i want to make just just two more points about the inequality discussion one thing is that you know invest as mark said investing in education getting more people in a position where they can benefit from the machines rather than be replaced by them is is really huge and in a lot of ways our educational systems are collapsing state universities all around the country are are under pressure tuitions especially in private schools are through the roof and we need to make more opportunities available we actually need to invest earlier too so kids are ready to go to college when you would support federal investment in higher education and in education as as having a very good consequence i think they pay very large returns the other thing is there there is a role for the tax system and the tax system you know particularly a well-designed tax system can mitigate economic inequality if you look at the distribution of income before taxes and after federal taxes in particular the people are a lot better off middle and lower income people are a lot better off for the tax system than they would be if we just you know if we had say a flat tax or something like that and you could do more of that actually another thing which is which contributes to the flat incomes for the middle is rising healthcare costs and if you can do things to control healthcare costs i know an objective of the affordable care act is to do that that also would help because a lot of middle-income people's wages are now just going to pay for health care wow you said a mouthful mark what do you think about it you also have a situation where some in some parts of the tax system it exacerbates income inequality for instance there's a carried interest loophole for hedge fund managers to take what essentially our earnings compensation for their services and turn it into capital gains income which is more likely taxed that encourages this activity to transform ordinary income into capital gains income doesn't benefit generally the the economy as a whole certainly benefits individuals who take advantage of it's a very important point we tried in 2007 to to change that uh i remember charlie rangel leading us in that direction but we didn't get too much help on the other side of being more fair so the tax system can be fair the tax system is necessary there needs to be a code one take some decision some advantages away from those who make a lot of bucks and because they got so many lawyers and they can take the money offshore which the average person cannot do look thank you leonard uh thank you mark you've done a great job i want to come back to this issue again i'm going to have you back on again appreciate it with your permission of course and we're going to talk about where do we go from here if reform doesn't work out in the next two or three months and god knows what's going to happen on whether we shut this place down again or not we hope not we pray not but it's people like you that need to be heard more often to put things into perspective so that the average person sitting on his couch right now watching us and his has all weird sometimes mythical ideas about how the tax system works and and like they they bring together property taxes and excise taxes and or income taxes so they blame everybody so you blame everybody i want to be blamed for what i did i don't want to blame for what your governor does or your state legislator does or whatever the case may be i wasn't one of those at one time thank you mark thank you lynn and thank you for watching this edition up to the point uh you've heard our thoughts now i would like to hear what you think about today's show if any comments if you have concerns or questions stay tuned our address our phone number our website and address will appear in a in a moment thanks again for tuning in i'll see you next time on to the point you

what's their strategy to convince republicans the president must be held accountable joining me now is one of those impeachment managers congresswoman madeline dean of pennsylvania thank you so much for joining me this morning uh and you know this trial won't start until a month after the capital attack a number of republican senators are telling cnn that passions are starting to cool making it increasingly unlikely that former president trump will be convicted was it a mistake to wait well good morning dana and congratulations on your new assignment and also my sympathies to the cnn family on the loss of larry king thank you uh he was a big fixture in our den every evening uh i i think you will see uh that we will put together a case that is so compelling because the facts and the law uh reveal what this president did i mean think back it was just two and a half weeks ago that the president assembled a mob on the ellipse of the white house he incited them with his words and then he lit the match and sent them on their way to pursue the big lie the big lie was his desperate attempt to hold on to power it was a lie that the election was somehow stolen he knew it those around him knew that was a lie and he sent them to the capitol not just on any day of the week he sent them there on an important constitutional day so it was a dual attack on our capital in a joint session of congress at the day the very day we were completing our constitutional obligation to certify the electors it's an extraordinarily heinous presidential crime and we must move forward only 10 republicans as you know supported impeachment in the house do you think that you will find more in the senate you're going to need to you need 17 17 of course 10 was a historically high number that was a bipartisan impeachment and so i find that to be heartening and encouraging because there was clarity in the folks who voted to impeach the president take a look at the words of liz cheney who said he assembled the mob he incited the mob and he lit the flame the president is responsible i take heart in that there is clarity in those ten and i hope over the course of the remaining days as we nine prepare this trial more and more elected officials will pay attention to their oath and see the egregious high crimes and misdemeanors that this president was so desperate and capable of on the last weeks of his term in office we're now learning that president trump nearly fired the acting attorney general earlier this month in order to replace him with someone willing to use the justice department to pressure georgia officials to overturn the election senator romney told me earlier this hour he presumes it will be part of your case will it well i am so honored to be a part of a team of nine terrific people of course supported by other excellent lawyers so i will not be previewing our strategy or our case but what i believe is the american public witnessed what happened here i was in the capitol on that day dana i had tried to leave the gallery as i was preparing for the challenge to the pennsylvania electors and when i left i was rebuffed by a very kind capital police officer who said cannon house office building is under a bomb threat please return to where you were so i was up in the gallery at the time of the attack i was there when they said sit down prepare to kneel or lie on the floor take out your gas masks now put your gas mask on i was there as the pounding on the doors began and the piercing of the doors on the floor of the house took place this was a terrifying moment it was absolutely what the world witnessed an attack on our capital an attack on a joint session where people came incited by the president to hunt down members of congress not to mention your own colleagues i was in the gallery with journalists they were they were asked and chanted hang vice president pence they sought to assassinate the speaker this cannot go unanswered the world has witnessed what has happened we will put forward a very strong case for impeachment for disqualification for conviction before i let you go president trump's first trial took three weeks do you think that this one will go faster i don't know and i do respect that it is up to the senate to place those rules i would expect it would go faster but i also want to say something that i think is that matters some people would like us to turn the page oh let's move on i think that president biden the night before he was sworn in laid down the predicate he said to heal we must remember sometimes it's hard to remember but we must do that even as a nation we must remember i believe that this impeachment trial i hope conviction ultimate disqualification are the very first powerful steps toward unity and our country moving forward madeleine dean thank you so much appreciate you joining me this morning thank you for having me

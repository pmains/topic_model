president no Senate will have this obligation to protect the Constitution religious liberty is at stake the Second Amendment says take freedom of speech to sit state our rights and liberties are at stake and they don't agree with us on these issues no wonder they will do or say anything to try to get the seat that I think is likely to be the 51st Republican seat in the next Senate

appreciate all being here today when I first explored running for congress one of the first things I did was to go online start figuring out who the veterans were because I knew that these were my brothers and sisters that we come from different backgrounds but at the end of the day we had all put on a uniform and figured out how to solve the mission that's why we're here we want to get things done that's why the American public has sent us here yeah I hear bannered around these Halls all the time people invoking founding fathers talking about this is the people's house and we the people if we think about that if 10 percent of a small of the overall number have been allowed to carry the day in the summer of 1776 we've never had a declaration of independence there would be no people's house we would have never gotten a constitution passed through the Constitutional Convention had 10 percent of the people been allowed to hold out and allow the other 90 deny the other 90 percent the ability to get things done the public has called on us to get a job done I often think my my favorite of the memorials here in D.C is uh the Vietnam memorial I happen to sneak out when I was at the Naval Academy on the day that was uh was uh unveiled back in the early 80s and it's just always had a special place for me when I think of all the number of problems we have right now one of those is fentanyl we are losing more people every single year now to fentanyl crossing our Mexican border than we lost in the entirety of the Vietnam War if you want to put that in perspective go out again sometime and walk down that wall and look at those names we have tens of thousands of Americans every single year now dying of fentanyl we have the administration that refuses to take on the problem that's one of dozens we could talk about we've got work to do we're wasting time and the public deserves better

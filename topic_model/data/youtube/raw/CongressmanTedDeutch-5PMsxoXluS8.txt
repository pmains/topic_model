MR. DEUTCH: THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. MADAM SPEAKER, I ARRIVED IN THIS STORIED CHAMBER 12 1/2 YEARS AGO, FRESH OFF OF A FLORIDA SPECIAL ELECTION TO FILL FORMER REPRESENTATIVE ROBERT WEXLER'S SEAT. I WAS A LONE FRESHMAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 111TH CONGRESS. I WAS EAGER, I WAS A LITTLE UNCERTAIN, I HAD A BIT MORE HAIR. WANTING TO DO RIGHT BY THE PEOPLE WHO SENT ME HERE. AND IT WAS DURING THOSE FIRST DAYS THAT I MET THE LATE JOHN DINGELL, THEN THE DEAN OF THE HOUSE, HIMSELF BY ALL ACCOUNTS A VERY IMPORTANT MAN. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, MADAM SPEAKER, BUT AT THAT POINT, HAVING SECURED THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SERVE AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND HAVING RECEIVED MY SPIFFY NEW CONGRESSIONAL PIN, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN FEELING A LITTLE IMPORTANT MYSELF. EVEN WITH THE NOVELTY OF MY NEW JOB. BUT JOHN DINGELL LOOKED ME SQUARE IN THE EYE AND GAVE ME A PIECE OF ADVICE THAT I WOULD NEVER FORGET. HE SAID, YOU'RE NOT IMPORTANT. IT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SENT IT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SENT YOU HERE. THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT. AND IF YOU NEVER CONFUSE THESE TWO, HE SAID, YOU'LL BE FINE. OVER THE COURSE OF MY TIME IN CONGRESS, AS MR. DINGELL PREDICTED, I HAVE MET SOME VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE. BUT THOSE PEOPLE, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUES, DON'T SERVE IN THIS CHAMBER. I MET MITCH LINDMAN, THE CHILDHOOD FRIEND OF PRIVATE FIRST CLASS KRAVITZ. FOR YEAR DECADES, MITCH WORKED TO FIND OUT WHY KRAVTH WHO SACRIFICED HIMSELF IN AN EXTRAORDINARY ACT OF HEROISM, NEVER RECEIVED THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR HE WAS NOMINATED FOR. THIS LED TO AN INVESTIGATION OF SOLDIERS DENIED THE MEDAL OF HONOR DUE TO PREJUDICE. THIS LED ME TO INTRODUCE AN ACT TO ENSURE EVERY SOLDIER DISCOVERED IN THAT REVIEW TO DESERVE THE MEDAL OF HONOR RECEIVED THAT AWARD. I WAS PROUD TO STAND BEFORE PRESIDENT OBAMA, SURROUNDED BY THE FAMILIES OF THESE BRAVEST AMERICAN, WHEN THE PRESIDENT AWARDED 24 RECIPIENTS, INCLUDING PRIVATE FIRST CLASS KRAVITZ, POSTHUMOUSLY, WITH THAT DESERVED HONOR. MITCH LIBMAN AND PRIVATE FIRST CLASS KRAVITZ AND WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO FOR THEM, THAT WAS IMPORTANT. I MEET MONA RHYS, THE FOUNDER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL WOMEN'S CENTER. OUTRAGED BY THE PREVALENCE OF UNSAFE BACK ALLEY ABORTIONS, BY THE INJUSTICE OF WOMEN HAVING TO TRAVEL ACROSS BORDERS TO ACCESS BASIC REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE THAT IS THEIR RIGHT, MONA LOBBIED FOR LEGALIZED ABORTION HERE IN WASHINGTON. THE DAY AFRO V. WADE WAS DECIDE SHED JOINED THE FIRST OUTPATIENT ABORTION CLINIC IN MIAMI AS A STAFF COUNSELOR, HELPING WOMEN ACCESS THE CARE THEY NEEDED. WHEN SHE MOVED NORTH TO MY DISTRICT, SHE FOUNDED THE PRESIDENTIAL WOMEN'S CENTER IN PALM BEACH COUNTY, A LEADING, COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE CARE FACILITY. IT IS BECAUSE OF HER DEDICATION TO WOMEN'S BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS IN SOUTH FLORIDA AND HER SHINING EXAMPLE NURTURING PATIENTS THROUGH THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION OF THEIR LIVES, THAT I FOUGHT HARD AGAINST EFFORTS TO ATTACK WOMEN'S BODILY AUTONOMY FIRST IN TALLAHASSEE, AND THEN IN WASHINGTON. SO I BECAME A TASK FORCE CHAIR OF THE PRO-CHOICE CAUCUS. TOGETHER WITH MY COLLEAGUES, WE PASSED THE WOMEN'S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT IN THE HOUSE TO CODIFY ROE INTO LAW AND PUSH FOR THE REPEAL OF THE GLOBAL GAG RULE. THAT WAS IMPORTANT. AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS MOMENT, IT CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT. I MET ROBERT BUE AND BRUCE WILLIAMS, ACTING MANAGER OF EQUALITY PARKT IN WILTON MANORS, FLORIDA. EVERY DAY, THE WORK THEY DO WITH THEIR TEAM TO CREATE A WELCOMING, EMPOWERING HOME WITH A WEALTH OF RESOURCES FOR SOUTH FLORIDA'S LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND PARTICULARLY LGBTQ SENIORS, FROM ART GALLERIES TO HEALTH WORKSHOPS TO EDUCATION AND COUNSELING, ROBERT AND BRUCE ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS ARE MET. BUT THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE ARE TREMENDOUS. LGBTQ SENIORS HAVE ENDURED A LIFETIME OF MARGINALIZATION AND DISCRIPPLE NATION AND THEIR NEEDS ARE MANY AND UNIQUE. THEIR WORK LED ME TO RUTHIE BERMAN, A LIFE-LONG ADVOCATE WHO FOUGHT ALONGSIDE HER WIFE CONNIE FOR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. EVEN THOUGH CONNIE IS NO LONGER WITH US, RUTHIE'S WORK HAS NOT LET UP. SHE IS STILL BRIEFING CONGRESSIONAL STAFF. RUTHIE, BRUCE, ROBERT, CONNIE, AND ALL THEIR WORK LED ME TO INTRODUCE THE ACT EVERY CONGRESS AND BECAUSE OF THEM CONGRESS BETTER UNDERSTANDS THE NEEDS OF THIS COMMUNITY AND AS THE TOOLS TO TAKE ACTION. THAT'S IMPORTANT. I MET DAVID HOGG -- I MET DAVID HOGG AND MATT AND RYAN, JACKIE CORAN, AND -- AND ALEX WYNN AND DOZENS OF THEIR CLASSMATES. WHEN 17 OF THEIR FRIENDS AND TEACHERS AT MARJORIE STONEMAN DOUGLAS WERE MURDERED BY A KILLER WITH AN ASSAULT -- ACCESS TO AN ASSAULT WEAPON, AND OUR COMMUNITY WAS WRACKED WITH SHOCK AND GRIEF, THESE YOUNG PEOPLE REFUSED TO SIT BY AND WAIT FOR THE NEXT SCHOOL SHOOTING. THEY GOT TOGETHER. THEY STARTED A NATIONAL MOVEMENT. THEY STARTED MARCH FOR OUR LIVES TO PREVENT THE NEXT TRAGEDY AND BECAUSE OF THEM, ROUGHLY HALF A MILLION PEOPLE SHOWED UP IN WASHINGTON, AND TWO MILLION IN CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD, TO DEMAND CHANGE. ONE OF THE LARGEST PROTESTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND BECAUSE OF THEM, WE HAD THE HIGHEST EVER YOUTH TURNOUT IN THE 2018 MID TERMS AND ELECTED A GUN SAFETY MAJORITY TO CONGRESS, A MAJORITY THAT INCLUDES DEDICATED ADVOCATES LIKE MY DEAR FRIEND, LUCY MCBATH. I MET LORI AND FLED DIAND DOZENS OF OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAD THEIR LOVED ONES TAKEN FROM THEM TOO SOON. WHO ARE STILL PUSHING THROUGH THEIR ANGUISH TO TRY TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY SAFER. BECAUSE OF THEM, I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON 3-D PRINTED GUNS, RAISED THE LEGAL AGE FOR PURCHASE, BANNED HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES AND ESTABLISHED A FEDERAL BUYBACK PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THEM A UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS BILL AND ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN HAVE PASSED IN THE HOUSE. BECAUSE OF THEM THE FIRST MAJOR GUN SAFETY LAW IN 30 YEARS IS NOW LAW. THAT WAS IMPORTANT. AND BECAUSE OF THEM I REMEMBER THOSE THEY LOST EVERY DAY. I REMEMBER ALISSA AND SCOTT AND MARTIN, NICOLAS, AARON, JAMIE, CHRIS, LUKE, KARA, GINA, JOAQUIN, ELENA, MEADOW, HELENA, ALEX, CARMEN AND PETER. THAT IS IMPORTANT. I MET CHRISTINE LEVINSON AND HER CHILDREN, SARA, DUNN, STEPHANIE, SAMANTHA, WHOSE HUSBAND AND FATHER, BOB LEVINSON, WAS BEING HOLD HOSTAGE IN IRAN. WHEN I GOT TO WASHINGTON, THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS FOR THREE YEARS. BOB BECAME THE LONGEST-HELD AMERICAN HOSTAGE IN HISTORY AS HIS FAMILY NAVIGATED A CONFUSING AND DISJOINTED LANDSCAPE OF SOURCES AND INFORMATION ACROSS MULTIPLE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS. BUT THE LEVINSONS DIDN'T GIVE UP EVEN AFTER WE LEARNED OF BOB'S LIKELY DEATH IN CAPTIVITY, THEY NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GIVE OTHER FAMILIES FACING THE SAME TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE THEY FACED MORE RESOURCES THAN THEY HAD. THEY DIDN'T STOP TRYING TO BRING BOB AND EVERY AMERICAN HOSTAGE HOME. AND BECAUSE OF THEM, PRESIDENT OBAMA ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO BETTER TRACK UNLAWFUL DETAINMENT OF U.S. NATIONALS ABROAD AND SUPPORT THE FAMILIES OF DETAINEES. AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WAS CODIFIED INTO LAW BY MY BILL, THE ROBERT LEVINSON HOSTAGE RECOVERY AND HOSTAGE TAKING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, SOON AFTER WE LEARNEDDED OF BOB'S PASSING. THERE ARE STILL HOSTAGES AROUND THE WORLD TODAY. BOB IS STILL NOT HOME BUT THE STRIDES WE MADE FOR THESE FAMILIES, THAT WAS IMPORTANT. THOSE OF US IN THIS CHAMBER AND ALL AMERICANS CONTINUING TO FIGHT TO BRING THEM HOME AND BRING CLOSURE TO THE LEVINSONS, THAT IS IMPORTANT. AND OF COURSE I MET PEOPLE BEFORE I CAME TO WASHINGTON. PEOPLE WHO INFORMED MY WORK IN TALLAHASSEE. THEIR STORIES HAVE CONTINUED TO BE IMPORTANT. THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO INSPIRE THE ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN IN THIS CHAMBER. ON A PLANE IN FLORIDA, SOON AFTER MY ELECTION TO THE STATE SENATE, I MET BERTHIE DELAREAU ZHA, SHE TOLD ME HER STORY AND THE STORY OF HER DAUGHTER LUCY WHO WAS LIVING WITH CEREBRAL PALSY, AUTISM AND MULTIPLE OTHER INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. SHE TOLD ME ABOUT A HARMFUL CHANGE IN LANGUAGE ON ITS WAY THROUGH THE STATE LEGISLATURE, WHICH COULD HAVE HAD DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR HER DAUGHTER AND MANY OTHERS WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES. SHE TOLD ME IF THIS GOES THROUGH, I'LL HAVE TWO CHOICES. I COULD PUT LUCY INTO AN INSTITUTION, OR SHE'LL DIE. BECAUSE OF HER, I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO FIX IT. WE GOT THAT LANGUAGE CHANGED. THE AMERICAN FLAG LUCY PAINTED STILL HANGS IN MY OFFICE IN WASHINGTON. AND WHILE LUCY PASSED AWAY TWO YEARS' -- TWO YEARS AGO, THE CHANGE SHE INSPIRED LIVES ON. THAT WAS IMPORTANT. THE PEOPLE I MET DURING MY CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE INFORMED IMPORTANT WORK. WORK THAT WE DO WITH A LASTING LEGACY. BUT SO DID THE PEOPLE THAT I CAME HERE WITH. THE DAY I WAS SWORN IN AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, SINCE IT WAS FOLLOWING A SPECIAL ELECTION, THERE WAS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF TICKETS IN THE HOUSE GAL REFOR MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I WAS ELECTED ON APRIL 13, 2010. AND SWORN IN TWO DAYS LATER. WHICH IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME FOR PEOPLE TO PLAN TO COME. BUT THEY DROPPED EVERYTHING TO COME EVEN ON SHORT NOTICE AND WE PACKED THE PLACE. SO MANY DEAR FRIENDS AND FAMILY WERE WITH ME THAT DAY, FILLING UP THIS GALLERY. IT'S HARD TO SINGLE ANY OF THEM OUT. THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO CARED ABOUT EVERY ISSUE UNDER THE SUN WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT VISIONS FOR WHAT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY COULD BE. BUT WITH MANY OF THE FACES IN THE GALLERY THAT DAY WHO DECIDED IT WAS WORTH COMING FOR TAY MOMENT, MANY OF THEM WERE PEOPLE I HAD GOT TON KNOW IN MY 25 YEARS LIVING IN BOCA RATON. THROUGH OUR SHARED INVOLVEMENT IN OUR LOCAL JEWISH COMMUNITY. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SHARE MY STRONG COMMITMENT TO BETTERING NOT ONLY THE AMERICAN JEWISH COMMUNITY AND NOT ONLY THE GLOBAL JEWISH COMMUNITY BUT OUR NATION AND OUR WORLD THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY'S ADVOCACY AND SERVICE. I'VE SEEN THEIR FACES EVERY DAY OF THIS JOURNEY. AS I HAVE FOUGHT ANTI-SEMITISM AS CO-FOUNDER OF THE BIPARTISAN TASK FORCE COMBATING ANTI-SEMITISM, BOLSTERED OUR NATION'S RELATIONSHIPS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND MIDDLE EAST SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR, STRENGTHENED THE U.S.-ISRAEL RELATIONSHIP AS A LOUD, PROUD, CONSISTENT ADVOCATE FOR CONGRESS' BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO THE U.S.-ISRAEL STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP, TO IRON DOME FUND, TO BILATERAL COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS AND FOR CALLING OUT ANTI-SEMITISM WHEREVER IT APPEARS ON CHR SIDE OF THE POLITICAL AISLE. AND I ADVOCATED FOR HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN LIVE OUT THEIR REMAINING YEARS IN PEACE AND TIGNYTY. AND A LOT OF THEM ARE BACK HERE IN THE GALLERY TONIGHT FOR THE END OF THIS RIDE. I LOST MY DAD, BERNIE DEUTCH, YEARS AGO. HE COULDN'T BE THERE TO WATCH MY SWEARING IN. BUT IT WAS CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAD WITH HIM YEARS AGO RINGING IN MY EARS THAT DAY. WHEN MY DAD SERVED IN THE BALLLE OF THE BULGE AND WENT TO EUROPE TO DEFEND AMERICA AND FIGHT THE NAZIS, IT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE WORK ON THE HOUSE FLOOR HE WAS FIGHTING FOR. THAT BRAVE AMERICANS IN UNIFORM ARE FIGHTING FOR AS I SPEAK. AND WHY DID HE DO IT? WHY DID HE REMIND ME OF THOSE STORIES? BECAUSE MY DAD TAUGHT ME, TAUGHT ALL OF US, MY BROTHERS, JEFF, STAN, AND EDDIE, AND MY SISTER ELAINE, OF THE DUAL IMPORTANCE, THE EQUAL IMPORTANCE, THE TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE, OF BEING BOTH A PROUD JEW, AND A PROUD AMERICAN. ONE INFORMS THE OTHER. THEY ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED. MY COLLEAGUES AND CONSTITUENTS KNOW ME AS A PROUD JEWISH MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN CONGRESS. MY INVOLVEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY, MY TRAVEL TO ISRAEL, THOSE HAVE BEEN SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF WHAT I'VE DONE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. THEY'RE CORNERSTONES OF THE LEGACY THAT THOSE FACES IN THE GALLERY THAT DAY, AND MY DAD, HELPED ME LEAVE. THAT'S GROUNDING. IT'S HUMBLING. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. THERE ARE EIGHT PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE WITH ME THAT DAY WHEN I WAS SWORN IN, 12 1/2 YEARS AGO, THAT I WANT TO SINGLE OUT EVEN ALL THESE YEARS LATER. ALL OF US IN THIS PLACE ARE DOING THIS FOR THE WORLD WE ARE HELPING TO CREATE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FOR CHAIR CHILDREN. FOR ALL OF THE GENERATIONS TO COME. MY KIDS WERE 15 AND 12 WHEN I GOT ELECTED. WATCHING GABBY, SERENA GO THROUGH COLLEGE, TAKE ON THEIR OWN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS ON CAMPUS, IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY, WATCHING THEIR PART TO HELP CHANGE THE WORLD, THAT HAS INSPIRED ME TO DO MY PART ALL THESE YEARS. MY WIFE JILL, A LEADER IN OUR LOCAL JEWISH COMMUNITY WITH BOUNDLESS PASSION FOR CULTIVATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF JEWISH LEADERS, ALL THE WORK SHE DOES EVERY DAY HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND INTS PRAITION FOR ME EVERY TIME I COME TO WASHINGTON. AND THE SUPPORT FROM JILL, GABBY AND SERENA, WHO ARE IN THE GALLERY WITH US TODAY AND COLE WHO IS WATCHING IN AUSTIN, THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT ME JOY WHEN WE CELEBRATED SUCCESS. AND IT'S WHAT SUSTAINED ME DURING THE CHALLENGING TIMES. JILL'S MOTHER, SARAH GAIL, IS WATCHING TODAY, I HOPE, AND HER FATHER FRANK WHO WE RECENTLY LOST, BOTH OF WHOM SUPPORTED ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. MY NEPHEW ELY WAS HERE THAT DAY. HE CAN'T BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE HE LEFT US. WHEN HE ACCIDENTLY INGESTED FENTANYL LACED IN AN ILLEGAL SUL SUPPLEMENT AND WE ALL FIGHT TO HONOR HIS MEMORY BY FIGHTING THIS EPIDEMIC EVERY DAY. AND MY MOM WHO STOOD IN THE CORNER OF THE CHAMBER GIVING THE ROYAL WAVE TO ALL OF MY NEW COLLEAGUES, UNDOUBTEDLY THE WOMAN OF THE HOUR, EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS NOT THE ONE BEING SWORN IN TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, DURING MY SWEARING IN SPEECH I TURNED TO HER, I FINISHED BY SAYING IN ALL HER 86 YEAR, MY MOTHER JEAN DEUTCH NEVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED HEARING HER NAME IN THIS CHAMBER, MOM, I SAID, THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME BELIEVE THAT I COULD BE ANYTHING I WANTED TO BE. BECAUSE TODAY, I SAID BECAUSE TODAY, I SAID 12 1/2 YEARS AGO, I'M A MEMBER OF THE U.S. CONGRESS. AND WHILE I MISS SHARING THE UPS AND DOWNS OF CONGRESS WITH HER, I HOPE THAT AS MY MOM LOOKS DOWN ON US TODAY, SHE BELIEVES THAT THE SERVICE IN THIS CHAMBER LIVED UP TO THE DREAM SHE HAD THAT DAY. THIS JOB IS NOT EASY. WE ALL KNOW THERE IS PLENTY OF PROGRESS YET TO BE MADE THAT SEEMINGLY MORE OFTEN WE FIND AREAS OF COMMON GROUND, WE GET CAUGHT UP IN BITTER, OFTEN VITRIOLIC PARTISANSHIP. WE FIGHT, WE DEMONIZE. WE CREATE BARRIERS TO SOME OF THE CHANGES OUR CONSTITUENTS RIGHTFULLY DEMAND. SOMETIMES WE FEEL VIOLENT THREATS FROM THE VERY PEOPLE WE ARE HERE IN WASHINGTON TO TRY TO HELP. I WAS HERE THAT DAY IN JANUARY, 2021. WE HAVE NO SHORTAGE OF DARK DAYS IN THIS CHAMBER. SOME VERY DARK ONES. LIKE THAT ONE. THE BATTLES HERE FEEL IMPORTANT AND OFTEN ALL-CONSUMING. THE TRAIL OF STYMIED PROGRESS IS INFURIATING. BUT WHAT THIS BODY OF GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO DO FOR OUR CONSTITUENTSY, AS INCREASINGLY RARE AS IT MAY FEEL, THAT IS IMPORTANT. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME, IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY SUCCESSOR, IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OF US. I HAVE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THAT IT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR. I'VE ALSO BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR ME. AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES, SO MANY OF WHOM HAVE BECOME CLOSE FRIENDS. THERE AREN'T TOO MANY MENTIONED BUT THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF WHO HAVE GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO FIGHT FOR ME AND WITH ME, WHO HAVE BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE OF MY EARTHS TO OBTAIN -- EFFORTS TO OBTAIN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS UNDER THEIR WATCH. SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER HOYER, CLAIREMAN MEEKS, -- CHAIRMAN MEEKS, CHAIRMAN NADLER, CHAIRMAN JEFFRIES, MY DEAR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ AND LOIS FRANKEL AND THE LATE ALCEE HASTINGS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE BACK ROW HECKLERS. SCOTT AND AMI, PETE AND DEREK, STEPHANIE AND DAN AND KATHLEEN.

AND I THANK MARIO DIAZ-BALART ABWHO HAS SO OFTEN FOUGHT WITH E AND REPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ TO CHAMPION HUMAN RIGHTS FROM CARACAS TO HAVANA TO TEHERAN.

AND THANK YOU TO THE U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT, USAID, OTHER EMBASSY EMPLOYEES WHO SERVE OUR NATION EACH IN THEIR OWN WAY AND EACH MAGNIFICENTLY. I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CHANGE IN CONGRESS OVER THE LAST DOZEN YEARS. OVER SEVEN YEARS AND NEARLY FOUR CONGRESSES HAVE PASSED SINCE JOHN DINGELL LAST STOOD ON THIS FLOOR. AGED WONDER IF HE WOULD BE SURPRISED BY THE BITTER DIVIDES THAT HAVE EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY SINCE THAT TIME. BUT EVEN NOW HIS WORDS ARE WORTH REPEATING. THEY'RE AS TRUE NOW AS THEY WERE THEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOR EVERY MEMBER WHO COMES AFTER ME. YOU'RE NOT IMPORTANT, IT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SENT YOU HERE. THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO HELP US DO THAT WORK, OUR DEDICATED STAFFS, THAT ARE IMPORTANT TOO. SO, THIS ONE -- SO THIS ONE'S FOR TEAM TED. THANKS TO MY D.C.

THOSE OF US THAT SERVE HERE CAN DO IMPORTANT THINGS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD FOR CONGRESS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS CHAMBER, FOR OUR COUNTRY AND FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. I AM NOT IMPORTANT. BUT I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND SOUTH FLORIDA, THE FAMILY WHO STOOD BY ME, THE STAFF WHO SERVED WITH ME, MY COLLEAGUES WHO FOUGHT ALONGSIDE ME, HAVE HELPED ME CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO OUR NATION ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO SENT ME HERE. AND SO TO MY COLLEAGUES, THE FRIENDS WHO HAVE SERVED WITH ME, INSPIRED ME AND COLLABORATED WITH ME IN THIS CHAMBER ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, THOSE WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED AND ALL THOSE I CANNOT, EVEN ON THE DARKEST DAYS IT HAS BEEN THE HONOR OF MY LIFE TO KNOW YOU, TO WORK WITH YOU, TO LEAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT BEHIND FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. YOU MAY NOT BE IMPORTANT EITHER, ACCORDING TO JOHN DINGELL. BUT YOU'RE STILL IMPORTANT TO ME. I AM HEARTENED BY HOW MANY GOOD AND THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE WILL STILL BE SERVING HERE WHEN I LEAVE. AFTER NEXT WEEK I'LL BE YOUR CONSTITUENT. I HOPE YOU KEEP PUSHING TO BRIDGE THE DIVIDES, KEEP PUSHING TO DO IMPORTANT WORK FOR ALL OF US AND I HAVE FAITH THAT IF YOU KEEP DOING THAT, DESPITE SOMETIMES EXTRAORDINARY ODDS, WE WILL BE JUST FINE. SO I THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER, AND FOR THE LAST TIME, I YIELD BACK

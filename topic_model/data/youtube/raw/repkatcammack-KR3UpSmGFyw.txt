General Eddie Ms kamek for her five minutes well thank you Mr chairman thank you to everyone for making the trip down here thank you to our Witnesses uh we'll jump right into it uh going down the line Sheriff do you believe that we have a crisis at the Southwest border yes ma'am doctor yep um I would say look I'm not as a healthcare provider I'm more of an expert about what happens when it comes over the Border um you know I can speak to if you know you personally yes this yes or no like I'm not an expert on board or immigration policies I think I can talk to what happens on the other side if we don't okay so I'm sorry I have to reclaim my time Miss Garza do we have a crisis at the Southwest border yeah we have a human humanitarian crisis yes thank you I don't just believe I know we have a crisis thank you uh Miss Garza how many shifts or ride-alongs have you done with Customs and Border Patrol agents or Texas DPS I actually a few um I have represented hundreds of children when did you do these right along um 2018 2017 it's been some time I spent some time I'm sorry I'm going to reclaim my time so you have not done a ride along or work to shift along Texas DPS or our border patrol agents since the Biden Administration has been in office ma'am I've been practicing in Corrections yes the Obama Administration that's just a yes or no yes or no ma'am I've been practicing immigration that's not answering my question I'm not I'm not a police officer okay I'm not an officer so then you haven't so you said earlier quote operation Lone Star has not resulted in any sort of reduction of fentanyl deaths in your respective districts talking about our districts end quote you referenced operation Lone Star more than three times today in your testimony and in answering questions saying that it's essentially a waste of taxpayer funds yes I want to look at the results of operation Lone Star to date since it took place in 2021 361 million lethal doses of fentanyl have been apprehended have been confiscated that's just operation Lone Star that doesn't include what CBP or border patrol has actually confiscated so going back to what you said that operation Lone Star is not stopping any fentanyl deaths that it's a waste of money how do you explain the 361 million lethal doses that have been confiscated and I guess in in your opinion what is the price of a life then we are talking about billions of dollars that have further militarized this region and the state of Texas it has been away 361 million lethal doses a waste of taxpayer dollars look we both care about a solution here we need to address the fentanyl issue I'm going to reclaim my time when I reclaim my time that means you have to stop talking 361 million lethal doses is a waste of taxpayer money in your opinion yes or no I believe that operation Lone Star is illegal so you think it is a waste of money you stated and you said quote I don't understand why we are here at the border there is no connection end quote let me show you what the connection is this is a brick of fentanyl that was found in my district in Florida in Marion County this is 958 grams of fentanyl the people who had that brick of fentanyl cross the border illegally that is the connection and it's not just my district every single one of these members here today have illegal illegal substances in their District as a result of the Biden open border policies that is the connection every single one of us has constituents who have been poisoned as a result to say that there is no connection that is wildly inappropriate unacceptable and to the families that have lost loved ones as a result of the open border policies you should apologize there is a direct connection it's right here in mind no no no no no on the backs of individuals that are seeking Asylum that is in my County Marion County and I represent 12 12 counties in Marion County alone over 70 percent of the 200 monthly overdoses are fentanyl these are fentanyl poisonings and as it has been made clear here today by my colleagues only five to ten percent of the fentanyl that is being smuggled over the border into the United States is documented that's what we know of this is a crisis I'm gonna I've only have about 25 seconds so I'm going to end with this do you agree because I I went through your Twitter feed I went through several of the things that you've posted you talk a lot about social justice do you believe that social justice is Biden taking 130 million dollars from homeless veterans programs under FEMA and redirecting it to the Border crisis here I believe that you're using the Border as a political talk please answer the question we do not appreciate that answer the question let the record reflect that the witness has declined to answer the question under oath all right well seven o'clock

the thing on guns on the Centers for days and I just want to throw this in quickly Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that their last report almost all national studies of defensive gun use have found that firearms are used in self-defense this was I think a couple of years old but this is never mentioned between 500,000 and 3 million times a year guns are used to save lives and that's never mentioned well the bottom line is it is a rush to the left to take our guns to corrupt our education system so that we teach people that free speech means I get to say what I want but if I disagree with you you're not allowed to will suppress that and take up all the guns give free healthcare free education to everyone which means no healthcare and no education for anyone it's it's socialism I mean the bottom line is they are following a path to take us to socialism take up all our guns so we can't do anything about it except accept their behavior it is amazing - but by the way the escapes on a CMA Curtis where he wants them who's back behind bars now can you imagine him knocking on your door and you know who he is and Joe Biden came and take your it took your gun two days before that if that's the only protection you have you know what frustrates me though is they wanna you know do background checks or do this and none of those things have they wouldn't have stopped anything that happened yeah and so we think that passing a law that says it's illegal to have a gun it's gonna stop somebody who just murdered somebody which by the way is against the law so why are they gonna abide by that law all they're gonna do is take up the guns from law-abiding citizens and and make sure that the criminals have easier access and you have no way to defend yourself let's look to 2020 and again congressman Trent Kelly's my guess are you worried about the amount of retirees again and and the possibility that you guys could maybe get rid of Pelosi again while you know I mean Mike Conaway my friend is retiring former chair of the AG committee buddy a member there now is it around 15 or 20 or how many is it I think it's around 15 right now but there's always that amount of retirements you know people think everybody stays there forever but the average length of service is 9.1 years in the House of Representatives so usually have some Democrats are also retired but they are they tend to be older and have stay there a whole lot longer as Democrats and we do as Republicans you look at if we do get the nomination of the democrats god forbid like Harry Reid Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama again which brought us Obamacare I think it's almost a foregone conclusion that they're gonna push through a medicare-for-all a program I mean they've said that which means health care for no one I mean goodness gracious first of all you can't afford a second of all do we really want the government deciding who gets treatment who doesn't patient and doctor is always where health care should be let me look at a couple of people Elizabeth Warren the top of a front-runner Medicare we've all been paying since I was 15 and if you have any care for life or government government health insurance got more benefits and Bernie's talking about the eyeglasses hearing aids everything will you pay more in taxes because it's not a Republican question the question is not do you have health insurance or not have health insurance the question is how much are you gonna have to dig in your pocket to pass no that's the answer that you'd like to there's no answer the question they've never been able to explain this now when tingle thighs ask that question is you can't answer there's problems there absolutely they don't want a government-run health care is not the answer I mean our VA system does a they try to take care of our veterans but it is government-run and go back to the over a year waiting list to get care that you need just think if you maximize that and do that with everyone in the United States you may wait two years to go see a doctor about a heart attack and guess what you're dead by the time you get there the other frontrunner let me mention him Bernie Sanders for senior citizens it will finally include dental care hearing aids and eyeglasses second of all let me give you some background this is during the debate and in when a modder word shows up or at least a moderate responds and this was one of the other candidates for president I forgot I think it's one of the governors nobody wore pro-union than me up here are now paying high deductibles and co-payments and when we do Medicare for all instead of having the company putting money into health care they can get decent wage increases which they're not getting today these union members are losing their jobs their wages have been stagnant the world is crumbling around them the only thing they have is possibly really good health care and the Democratic message is going to be we're going to go in and the only thing you have left we're gonna take it and we're going to do better I do not think that's a recipe for success cause it's bad policy and it's certainly bad pause all they got a lot of problems they got a lot of problems and where they gonna get the money to pay for this I mean I don't understand because we want to give out everything but you know someone has to pay taxes and and I'm one of those and you are too so we need we need to do things that make sense rather than just say we're gonna give people something to get votes also on your mind the us MCS us MCA yeah yeah maybe we need this try to gain McDonagh helps our AG folks you know and also are we any closer know the the leadership in the house has no interest in bringing it to the floor although it's already past Mexico and Canada and it's good there's no one they have no qualms with it whatsoever except they don't feel like it's theirs and they don't want to give the president a win so they put politics in front of this nation we need that 3.2 billion dollars from Mississippi in exports to Mexico and Canada bring it to the floor so this is hurting our farmers and it's not Trump who's doing it it's the Democrats they absolutely absolutely it's the Democrats and will not bring it because they refuse to give the president a win take a look at anything out there that we could point that there's been some bipartisanship in the house right now it's difficult everything even like this crazy election law they had which the bottom line is that they say it well it's election security what it is is they want taxpayers to pay for their campaigns in that crazy to pass a law that says we won't taxpayer taxpayer dollars to pay for our campaigns I'm out on that they want this wit did they put it in there and put the dormitories in so they hit a free housing than Washington too is that other part I don't know if that was in there but goodness gracious I know I don't want to live with those guys from my apartment tread Kelly's my guess I gotta ask you this I saw something this morning about some troops moving apparently into Hong Kong is and that that's heating up over there what do you think I think a lot of it has to do with China is suffering right now and they're hurting and they're doing everything they can in Hong Kong obviously there's ongoing things there but I mean that's an internal problem that we need to keep our eyes on and watch but that's scary but their economy is weakening and waiting if we could get behind our president we could get some of this trade stuff done instead of all US MCA is number one pass it and China the dominoes start to fall if at some point they knew that the President of the United States of America you're right I mean if if if Schumer I'm in the Senate and of course Nancy Pelosi said we're backing this let's get it done then they wouldn't wait till the next to 2020 and see if they could have somebody with a weenie spine on there they would go on to get it done they absolutely would but they're hoping for it sounds like everything so slowly everything's on hold for 2020 I hope not but that's exactly what it feels like up there the only things that are passed or partisan political that are good for messaging but are going nowhere will not go to the Senate will not pass final thoughts sir Wow we just got to find a way to get common-sense solutions on immigration we got we need immigration workers here we've got to figure out a way to get it to the floor rather than worry about things that don't matter in about the span of a week we could handle a lot of problems and we just had some bipartisanship we need bipartisanship thank you me appreciated thanks probably got to be about as rare as a snowfall in July or August as as far as we know here in Mississippi just it's not gonna happen absolutely

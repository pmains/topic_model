democratic congresswoman barbara Lee for my own state California she sits on the house budget and appropriations committee is good to see you congressman thanks for joining us I'm going to be with you today things i want to start without getting your expectations your reactions from this Intel committee hearing that's going to take place tomorrow are we going to get direct answers from FBI director James Comey on questions about Russia's involvement in the election well let's hope so and especially what congressman Adam Schiff said though I think we have to understand that a lot of this could be classified but I think the public has a right to know in terms of the Russian interference and possible collusion in our elections undermining our democratic process also I think it's extremely important that mr. Comey put to rest the lies that President Trump is putting out there in terms of President Obama bugging and and wiretapping Trump towering there's no evidence of that that needs to be put to rest but also I just have to say that President Trump needs to apologize to President Obama because in one of his tweets he said bad guy sick guy we have to remember that president Trump is the founder of the birther movement he has done this over and over again trying to delete it be legitimize our first african-american president and at some point he needs to keep his views to himself with minimally he needs to apologize at this point he said minimally the president should apologize to President Obama for his remarks on Twitter calling him potentially a sick man what else would you like to see from the President on that front well I think the president needs to really come forward and talk about who he really is and his agenda talk just a little bit now about the budget when you have a Steve Bannon in the White House a member of the National Security Council a white supremacist former editor of Breitbart news develop and national security and domestic security policy that's very dangerous his fingerprints are all over the Muslim ban and all over the budget remember he said he wanted to deconstruct the administrative state when you look at the budget that is exactly what he has done they have put millionaires and billionaires in charge of our federal agencies and each agency such as the Department of Health and Human Services headed by secretary price 15 billion dollar cut on top of that 24 million people are going to lose health care as a result of repealing the Affordable Care Act which the secretary supports this is what is meant by deconstructing the administrative state and so president truck needs to clean house he needs to remove see family from the National Security Council and from the White House well you know you talked about some of these cuts EPA thirty one percent cut State Department twenty-nine percent cut is there any area we're looking there Department of Agriculture twenty one percent cut is there any area in the federal budget congresswoman that you would cut when you look at the military budget you're talking about an increase of fifty four billion dollars now I fully strongly fully and strongly support a strong national security protecting our troops making sure they have everything that they need their quality of life issues are extremely our extreme concern to me but when you look at the fact that there's at least 125 billion in the military budget in the Pentagon that could be cut because it's part of the waste fraud and abuse that we see day in and day out in terms of the military budget and so I am extremely disappointed that they're coming forward now with another budget of 50 4 billion and we can cut that military budget by at least 150 to 200 billion and still maintain a strong national security and not not take away funding and resources verses from the most vulnerable my heart goes out to trump supporters because they're the ones who are going to lose out low-income individuals people who are just struggling to make ends meet the middle class poor people they're going to end up paying for this increase in the military budget and it is immoral let's talk tomorrow simply congressman sorry to interrupt you what specifically about one of those cuts Meals on Wheels is created an uproar across the country what would you say to the administration for their proposed cut that will directly affect the service that helps so many people who who can't afford these surfaces on their own meals on wheels the cut in Meals on Wheels is going to hurt Donald Trump supporters as well as my supporters and constituents and i must say that what I would say to the President and to seed Bannon is come forward and say I'm sorry we did not mean to do this to our seniors they don't deserve this they don't deserve the fear and anxiety that this is creating and so they should just stop this and they should go back to the drawing board put forth a budget that really reflects American values moral values as well as fiscal responsibility all right congresswoman barbara Lee appreciate it still

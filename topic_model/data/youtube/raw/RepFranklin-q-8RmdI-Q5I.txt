thank you mr chairman when there are so many topics and issues we could be digging into here as congress's committee on oversight and reform we are once again squandering the opportunity on something that is not germane to this body but i'm not surprised after all it was here on this committee that i learned the person i'd always considered my mother isn't a mother at all she's just a birthing person on multiple occasions when i thought we might actually conduct oversight and discuss reform with respect to the breakdowns surrounding the events of january 6th my democrat colleagues refused to require leadership of the capitol police to testify so i'm not surprised but i am truly puzzled why you all our witnesses have chosen to be here instead of being back home in your state of texas and doing the work you were elected to do you cut and ran to dc and you brought covert with you and you infected people while you were here at the capitol while you're out here and i object personal texts um mr chairman uh the gentleman has spoken of facts of the case and the gentleman is is speaking off publicly available information all right i appreciate that mr sessions you know what in the spirit of chairman cummings here's what we're going to do we're going to allow the gentleman to continue with whatever he wants to say whether it's true or false or something else and then there will be many opportunities mr chairman respond we're under an obligation to tell the truth in this committee and the gentleman is in fact responding to what would be publicly available information and we did not interfere with your witnesses and no one is interfering that's my whole point he can continue with whatever it is he wants to say he's got rights under the first amendment and the the speech and debate clause so please proceed mr franklin thank you mr chairman maybe this hearing is just an opportunity to give you all something to do while you should be back in texas as a freshman republican serving in the minority here in congress i've been on my share of a lot of losing votes i don't enjoy it at all but i think the democratic party has the majority has jammed through a lot of policies that are terrible for our country but here's the deal we cast our votes and we move ahead and sure on the republican side we'll message about how we think it's wrong and then when those bad policies bear rotten fruit like skyrocketing inflation crippling national debt a humanitarian crisis on our border our spikes in violent crime we can say we told you so but we still suck it up do our job and take the votes and we bite our time until we retake the majority we don't act like a bunch of spoiled cowards running away and refusing to vote when it's clear we don't have the numbers to get our way miss thompson and your testimony which we just received about an hour before the hearing this morning you stated that you support hr1 which the house of representatives passed earlier this year on straight party lines no amendments no opportunities for republicans to offer amendments to that straight party lines h.r 1 would essentially strip away authority the constitution grants to state legislatures for by federalizing elections in your oath of office for the texas legislature you swore among other things to preserve protect and defend the constitution and laws of the united states the framers of our constitution wanted the authority for determining the manner of elections to rest with the state legislatures not congress not appointed officials not other elected officials specifically and only the state legislatures i can't fathom why you would want to cede power granted to your state back to the federal government and i hope the good people of texas are watching this and really understand what our witnesses are trying to do they think the federal government knows better than you texans how you should conduct your elections the media and your liberal buddies try their darndest to paint you as heroes but you're not the truth is uh when you you know when you sought office in the state legislature you persuaded people in your districts that you were the ones who should represent their interest in the arena you signed up for it and texans put their trust in you and now you're failing them instead of being here you should be getting on a plane at reagan national and flying back to texas in coach like the rest of us and unlike the private jet you use to get here they're going to make you wear a mask i don't have any questions mr chairman but with a balance of my time i'd like to yield it to my colleague mr fallon

florida republican congressman michael waltz with us right now sits on the house armed services committee a former green beret commander you do not miss with this guy that's why i'm always happy when you have him on remote because if i ask a tough question he can't hit me congressman always good seeing you and thank you as always sir for your service um your thoughts on where this war stands now if it's a ground war it technically kind of plays to vladimir putin's advantage does it not and then what do the ukrainians need in your eyes well i think president zielinski is right it's about to go from awful to even worse the russians are concentrating their forces they put a new commander in charge that was responsible for many of the atrocities in syria including deliberately bombing over 50 hospitals and i think putin is going to take as much of eastern ukraine and as much of the black sea coastline as he can then try to go to the negotiating table and zielinski and gives zielinski a a terrible choice keep allowing your uh your country to be leveled and destroyed or accepted as a theta complete giving up uh his most industrial uh productive part of his country in eastern ukraine and in the black sea coastline and to do that the russians are going to continue to level cities to compensate for their lack of capability uh with just your brute force what should we be doing we should have been giving them long-range fires uh so there's a gold moment right now neil as the russians are reconstituting they are massing they're trying to rearm and refit we should be helping the ukrainians hit those forces in the rear and if zielinski continues to try to hit putin's logistics in russia itself we should allow him to do that and help him with targeting intelligence and and the weapon systems to to do just that the other thing neil very quickly we should be communicating to putin this is where biden needs to be crystal clear if you go to weapons of mass destruction that means nato and american direct involvement we have to deter putin rather than continuing to respond to him it's a very good way to look at it here oh we've been too beholden to not getting him upset michael waltz great seeing you again congressman thank you

and good Sunday morning President Obama is on vacation Congress is out of town and although we are in the dog days of summer the battle to win the hearts and minds of the American people on a range of issues is in full force the Obama administration is finding tough opposition to its agenda while the GOP is divided as well and how to move ahead on Friday President Obama announced changes to the US surveillance program so many people are talking about including a change in how the NSA collects phone records more transparency by the secret Foreign Intelligence this court that's the FISA Court and the creation of a task force of private citizens joining me this morning Barton Gellman of the Washington Post who has been writing extensively about Edward Snowden in the NSA special correspondent for NBC News Ted Koppel and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Republican congressman Michael McCaul bart gellman let me start with you has Edward Snowden one has he accomplished what he set out to do which is to not only get a debate going but force change in these programs he has accomplished you know far more than anyone in his position could reasonably hope to have accomplished I mean he told me that his greatest fear was that he would come out and do this and the whole story would be a you know roiling around for a day and it would be gone I mean now you have President Obama being forced to say that he welcomes the debate which he welcomes sort of like this CEO who gets a really angry letter ya ne ne writes back and says you know thank you for your interest in our surveillance probably you know programs but its top of the agenda now for two months the president spoke out about Snowden during his press conference on Friday and he said the fall no I don't think mr. Snowden was a patriot as I said in my opening remarks I called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before mr. Snowden made these leaks I actually think we would have gotten to the same place and we would have done so without putting at risk our national security chairman McCaul do you believe that that this administration really will did welcome the debate that he would have reviewed these surveillance programs were it not for Edward Snowden I I see no evidence of that I think Snowden came out leaked this information and the White House has been backtracking ever since I think when the story initially broke the president went undercover he just finally came out last Friday trying to come up with ways to salvage the program by window dressing you know forming a website for instance and outside a group and the problem fundamentally is he's failed to explain these programs which are lawful which have save lives which have stopped terrorist plots he has not adequately explained them or defended them and now he's in a bit of a mess and I'll tell you why because on the heels of the IRS scandal where people don't trust this government this administration with their tax records they sure don't trust this administration with our phone records theory and I think that's the dilemma the presence in right now there is a bigger role here Ted Koppel in terms of public concerns about government size of government intrusiveness of government but isn't the trump card on national security always what I've talked to intelligence officials about look if you back away from these programs people can die some of these plots that we could stop with them will will get through the filter look you've got a couple of problems here problem number one is that you've got the almost infinite technical capability these days of finding information by intruding into people's privacy once you have that capability it becomes very difficult to keep it in check that's what the president is talking about he's saying trust us we're not going to violate your constitutional rights we're only going to dig just so far it's unrealistic because as you say when lives are at stake when security is at stake which politician which national leader is going to say here we have the capability of getting that information but let's not do it right and that to me chairman McCaul raises another question and that's the issue of speed the reason why the FISA Court was was set up and Barton you can jump in on this as well is that if you identify a threat you've got data to run that against to determine if there's a plot against the United States you need a warrant and you need it fast government got to act fast to apprehend those people who might be responsible introducing privacy advocates and others who might dissent in this process is that realistic you think Congress your colleagues are going to vote to make that happen look I'm in a unique position to talk about this I actually applied for Pfeifer warrants is a counterterrorism prosecutor and I think the idea of having a public defender you know when you're really what it is a search warrant to the FISA Court which you wouldn't have in a normal criminal case would slow down the efficacy and efficiency of our counterterrorism investigations so I I don't think that's that's right way to go i will tell you again when i was doing this we would run the numbers through the private phone carriers we never really imagined that all this data would be warehoused under the NSA and i think that's what's giving the American people a lot of pause right now and I think that's what needs to be explained to the American people and Congress will be reviewing this issue and section 215 of the Patriot Act to see if this is expanded beyond the original intent of the law what actually changes Barton do you think there's much room here to fundamentally change these programs because all the NSA says is look maybe we could change who controls this metadata which is in this virtual vault and who has access to it and how it's kept which may be you know not enough for those who think there's a problem well Congress may decide not to allow the NSA or Mia the FBI to collect every single call record of every single American for this purpose that's not what the president's argument sounded like in his news conference he sounded like he wanted to as you say just put a little more oversight on an internal within the executive branch and to add to be slightly more transparent about how it happens that his Justice Department put out a long white paper defending exactly the way it works now and and honestly they put a lot of you know good smart minds to work on it but I think sort of nine out of ten Civil Procedure professors would have given that a less than a grade Ted Koppel let's let's widen this out a little bit this is against the backdrop of an ongoing war on terror and ongoing threat and it is reflective of a psychology of fear that you wrote about in the wash excuse me in the wall street journal this week put a portion of what you wrote on the screen America's chronic overreaction to terrorism with the headline you wrote we have created an economy of fear an industry of fear a national psychology of fear al Qaeda could have never achieved that on its own we have inflicted it on ourselves look fundamentally there are two sets of questions that apply in the war against terrorism the one set of questions deals with the where is going to go where is it going to happen what's going to happen when is it going to happen the other set of questions deals with what is it that our enemy the terrorists are trying to achieve what are they trying to induce us to do take a look at what's been happening over the past week with a conference call al Qaeda has effectively shut down 20 US embassies around North Africa and the Middle East we just had the president of Yemen here for a meeting with President Obama he goes back feeling wonderful about his new relationship with the president next thing the President does is says in effect sorry but we don't trust you Yemeni is to protect our embassies so in effect we shut down our embassy we have an emergency evacuation what does that do to our relationship in the rest of the continent in the rest of North Africa what does that do in our relationship in the Middle East with all of these governments the terrorists have achieved more with one phone call then we have achieved with all our response chairman McCaul well you know we'll listen I i think the threats real and they're what I call the narrative of the president saying that al Qaeda's on its heels the struggle is over let's go back to pre 911 mentality I think it's very dangerous narrative I get the same threat briefings at the president nited states does and I'm not seeing his rhetoric meeting reality and the fact of the matter is there is a spider web now we are just focused on pakistan afghanistan iraq al Qaeda's core al-qaida versus non al qaeda al qaeda other where distinction without a difference it's all al Qaeda but can I interrupt a chair pregnant and it's spreading it's gettin it's gettin worse not better and I think the American people need to know that and I believe it's very deceptive for this president to give a narrative that is pretty much over when in fact what I see is a spiderweb throughout northern Africa into Syria Egypt Pakistan Afghanistan this threat is getting worse not better but the interruption there was your assertion about a pre 911 attitude where do you see that demonstrated by the president the most recent example you had 19 embassies that were closed in the in the face of a threat that's what Ted Koppel is criticizing in terms of over reaction where is the the lack of vigilance that you see that says were in a different place mentally what is the hypocrisy that he wants this rhetoric that the war is going to be over he wants as he was a sculpt a legacy where he is a peacemaker any bushes wars with the same time he's ramping up drone strikes now I favor drone strikes but drone strikes are not going to kill an ideology and I think this is a war of ideology this can be a long-term struggle that we all have to be very adult about it and it's going to be around for quite some time and the threat is not getting again it's not getting less it's gettin it's gettin worse and we need to deal with it in a responsible way and not put our heads in and I think I think impacting the moderate Muslim the moderate Muslim community is an effective tool that we have wholly failed to engage him Ted Koppel ooh let me come back to this idea I think what the president would argue is that there's been a more targeted approach to dealing with terrorists killing Osama bin Laden and even this question of Al Qaeda's number two Ayman al-zawahri and he was written about in mark Boden's book the finish the killing of Osama bin Laden there was a meeting the president attended where he wanted more vigilant to get in this fight as Tom Donilon would tell me Obama said here's the deal i want this hunt for Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-zawahri to come to the front of the line I worry that the trail has gone cold this has to be our top priority and it needs leadership in the tops of our organizations you need to ensure that we have expended every effort to take down the top leadership of al Qaeda especially these two individuals if you if you in light in light of your your criticism about over reaction there is still a very specific threat and very specific operator who is atop these organizations and there will continue to be a specific threat and they will continue to be terrorism as there has been for as long as human history exists terrorism is simply the weapon by which the week engage the strong and what they do is they cause the strong and this gives us to overreact we are the ones who went into Iraq and spent about a trillion and a half two hours doing it losing what two and a half thousand young are four and a half thousand young men and women god knows how many tens of thousands of injured we are the ones who have created a bureaucracy what does TSA TSA has about 57,000 people operating in tsa can you imagine a day David when we will ever again be without that bureaucracy all imposed upon ourselves chairman McCaul final word on this debate I I would just say there's a rhetoric and a reality in this administration has a rhetoric that's winding down its pre 911 it's a dangerous rhetoric I think it's not good for the country I think we have to you know you can't wish this thread away as much as we hate al-qaeda and terrorism but the fact of the matter is the threat briefings I get it's real it exists there's a large plot brewing in the Middle East right now which is why they have closed these embassies and it also could directly impact the homeland and how it responsible would that be for us to do nothing and it with all due respect to mr. Koppel but I get these briefings and I would be derelict to my responsibility if in light of these threat briefings that I get to do absolutely nothing and just say that this whole thing is over and to deny it all right where it is a real thing we're going to leave it there chairman McCaul thank you very much Barton Gellman thank you as well Ted you'll be back a little later on to talk about the future of journalism great voice in that debate we are back in

well among many sins the green new deal is going to be bringing u.s higher costs and higher prices gasoline electricity cars who knows what else doesn't sound too promising joining us now south carolina congresswoman nancy mace nancy welcome to the show before we dig into the green new deal which is way too much fun i want to give you the congressional budget office has done its scoring of the infrastructure bill in the senate and it turns out nancy that the pay fors don't pay for and it turns out that over the next 10 years there's a deficit of 256 billion according to the cbo which is the official referee your thoughts on this is this going to upset the infrastructure apple cart oh absolutely but is any american surprise to hear politicians say just a week or two ago the infrastructure package will pay for itself and then come to find out it's not going to pay for itself and not only that but this particular infrastructure deal is going to cross i think all of president biden's red lines on taxes he said he wouldn't tax people like making less than 400 000 a year well there's 30 new taxes in this thing and it's going to tax people making less than 400 000 a year i mean we're going to see inflation's already troubling uh hard-working americans right now and the only way you can pay for this massive massive bill is to raise taxes on hard-working americans and that's unfair and i i was reading about it today there's 7.5 billion dollars in there subsidizing electrical electric charging stations for electrical vehicles in this thing like i don't think the american people want to sign a front of elon musk's paycheck with this package yeah well you got a point there i just uh on the infrastructure thing it's interesting to me that the pay fors didn't pay for and all these promises i went through the numbers myself i thought they'd be short 300 billion nancy so i was awful little 256. but i never bought the you know the the the narrative i just never bought it now let me ask you about this green new deal you know we would love to have you come back later and and comment on the details but look right off the top uh electric cars and batteries and subsidies and relying on china and the belgian congo today we got higher cafe fuel standards from president biden as you know i mean this to me spells more expensive automobiles more expensive fuel less safe cars it's like did anyone ask the american consumer about this whether he or she wants this revolution in the green new deal oh absolutely and this infrastructure package is a down payment on the green new deal and just wait till they get the 3.5 trillion dollar spending package that will have to happen in order for this trillion dollar infrastructure package to happen the cost of vehicles has already gone up exponentially i drive a 10 year old suv and five years ago it cost me 21 000 today that same suv actually a model a little bit older than that one would cost between thirty two and thirty five thousand dollars and over fifty percent increase in price over five years um i can't afford to buy the same car i bought five years ago right now uh based on the way the pricing models are and the way the cost of everything has gone up over the last couple of years and your gasoline is going to be a whole lot more expensive because they're not bidens don't want you to drill and they don't want you to pipeline this stuff and nancy i want to import it from russia and china well yeah yeah and the re the resources for the batteries for the electric cars i i guess biden uh drove an electric jeep around the grounds of the white house i didn't hear what the price tag was but here's the deal the critical minerals that are necessary for the batteries are made in china not all the nancy there's a small piece that's made in another great human rights country the belgian congo what do you think of that what do you think americans are going to think of that when they when all this stuff surfaces when the americans realize how not environmentally friendly it is to mine to make some of these batteries i mean it's sort of we're doing it completely backwards i don't i just don't understand how they think people are this dumb or the american people are this dumb they're not they're smart they don't like it guess what they don't like it i've seen good polls ibd techno metrica um other pollsters they don't like this stuff and they don't want to pay more nancy you're right we don't want to pay taxes i mean we're we don't want to pay any more taxes for this kind of bill and in this bill you know the cost of everything is going up but there's only 110 billion on roads on surface transportation roads and bridges 40 of that is on public transportation it doesn't help the american people the working people going back and forth to their jobs or getting their kids to school and it makes the cost of everything for them go up i'm counting on you and your colleagues to defeat reconciliation i think it's armageddon i think wish us luck pray for us i will pray uh i've talked to steve scalise i spoke to the republican ways and means committee members with kevin brady yesterday you need three votes i think a better chance of whooping it in the house than the senate but you're on message nancy i agree with you 100 just got to fight this thing through hope for the best thanks for coming on the show

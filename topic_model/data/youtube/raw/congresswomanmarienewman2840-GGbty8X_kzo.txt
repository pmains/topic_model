more is illinois congresswoman marie newman good morning to you good morning thanks for having me thank you so much for joining us so just off the heels of your victory in november you're sworn into office at the beginning of the month a newly minted congresswoman only to have to endure a siege on the capitol would you mind sharing with us where you were and what you saw so i was in an undisclosed location on the greater capital campus i was not in the capital although many of my colleagues were in the gallery and uh in the on the house floor when this all really erupted and they breached the uh capitol so you know there's a lot of finger pointing going on right now and a lot of it has to do about the police there and how they manage or mismanage the crowds that this ended up resulting in riots in your opinion what do you think needs to happen between now and inauguration day to make sure that everybody is safe well they have made uh a lot of vast improvements in how we're partnering with all of our many uh security forces and remember the secret security actually runs inauguration and they're that they've been doing it for decades and centuries now so let's be clear they know what they're doing um clearly clearly the trump administration said no to us many times when we ask for help i believe that the mayor of d.c the chief of police and several others asked for help several times through the course leading up to the actual uh january 6th event and then all day long finally we got the resources that they needed but i want to be clear the capitol police were heroes they were in hand-to-hand combat much of the day and they saved many many lives so these domestic terrorists that attacked our capital and i want to be clear enough they're seditionists they are domestic terrorists and white supremacists and there's no other way to describe them they attacked our capital and these very brave men and women held them off with very few resources for hours until the national guard was allowed to come in and gratefully the national guard did a great job too but this was at the hands of the trump administration administration clearly denying us what we needed well speaking of the trump administration congresswoman there seems to be debate among and file democrats with regard to how to handle impeachment i know your colleague congressman clyburn of south carolina wants a house vote yes but then perhaps pocket it until after joe biden takes office where do you stand this morning yeah that is a difficult uh discussion because there are a lot of good points on both sides of that discussion what i will say is the house is doing their business this president is dangerous and our critical and most focused effort is to remove him from office he is not well and he is not a patriot he is a senator sinister at the very least and has uh incited violence incited sedition and many other things we must remove him so we're being very laser focused so our work over the next day or two is to try to remove him as quickly as possible longer term we will go use the constitution how about that and allow for the senate trial to occur when the senate is ready to do so uh so i will leave it to the senate to determine when the trial is they are leadership of both houses are in constant contact on this topic and uh the biden administration will have say in this as well how much how concerned are you that going forward with all of this is going to be a distraction for joe biden when he gets into office and as he's trying to work on the you know the first 100 days which everybody kind of looks at as a benchmark of his ability to lead um how concerned are you that all of this will make that even more difficult for the new president well i have good news for everybody is the biden administration uh house leadership uh democrats uh house uh or excuse me uh senate rep democrats are all interested in unity we also have some great colleagues on the other side of the aisle that are being very reasonable and fair and supporting our efforts and we're going to get more of them because uh patriots of this country are interested in unity so guess what we can walk and chew gum at the same time we can make sure that we are crushing this virus and getting the vaccine distribution out equitably and expeditiously we can work start working on the economy right away and get people back to work and then lastly we can start going about the business of the country as soon as as we can uh it doesn't mean that because we're taking care of this traitorous dangerous uh president that we can't uh continue to crush the virus and continue to bring the economy back i just had discussions with a lot of my colleagues on transportation and infrastructure and small business we are starting meetings next week and we are going to bring the economy back and we are going to end this pandemic this is our first chance to speak to you since uh you were sworn into office and it's great to have you on good day chicago i got to ask you you know you pulled off one of the big upsets of the year when you took down dan lipinski and at the time you said i'm a real democrat i bring it up because boy you all all the uh the stars have aligned for you you've got the house you've got the senate you've got the white house what in your mind is goal number one once we get past uh all of this so it depends on what you mean by getting past things but we do have to focus and i think i'm like all americans we have got to focus on crushing this virus uh getting vaccine distribution out the door properly instead of this bungled mess we have from this administration so correcting uh vaccine distribution making sure that we take all the precautions around covid and very very importantly getting relief to small businesses to individuals direct cash payments making sure that we're supporting states towns and cities so that they can provide community services and social services to those in need so that's job number one and equal to that bringing back this economy investing in infrastructure transportation in very large scale green stimulus package that will in fact make our economy robust again and get everybody back to work all right we want to thank you very much for joining us this morning

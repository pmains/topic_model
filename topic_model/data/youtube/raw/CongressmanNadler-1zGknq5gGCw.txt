minam chair I regret that what I am about to say could have been and was said a year ago not much has changed but more lives have been destroyed and more billions of dollars have been wasted all to no intelligence purpose the whole premise of the Afghanistan war is wrong the rationale for the war is to fight al-qaeda but most of the day to day fighting is against an entrenched Taliban insurgency that will outlast any foreign fighters fighting in Afghanistan does not enhance the security of the United States in any way in 2001 we were attacked on 911 by al qaeda al qaeda had bases in afghanistan and at that time it made sense to go in and destroy those bases and we did but that took about three weeks we should have withdrawn after those three weeks the CIA told us a couple of years ago that there are fewer than 100 al-qaeda personnel in north of Afghanistan so why do we still have 70 thousand troops their troops will continue to risk their lives every day in the war that has already claimed far too many lives and why should we continue pouring billions of dollars into an intractable mess when we should be devoting those funds to our own economy our own jobs our own schools our own bridges and roads and highways their own housing and social programs and education Afghanistan is in the middle of what is so far a 35-year Civil War we do not have either the need or the ability to determine the winner in that war which is what we're trying to do if we continue on this course in two years there will be hundreds more dead American soldiers several hundred billion more dollars wasted and two or three more provinces labeled pacified but as soon as we leave now or in 2014 or 2016 or 2024 or whenever those provinces will promptly become unpaid the Taliban and the Warlord's will step up the fighting again and the Afghan Civil War will resume its normal natural course our troops are fighting valiantly but we are there in the wrong mission we should recognize that rebuilding Afghanistan there in our own image that's setting up a stable government that will last as both beyond our ability and beyond our mandate to prevent terrorists from attacking the United States we fulfilled the mission in protecting America from terrorists base in Afghanistan over 10 years ago we should have withdrawn our troops 10 years ago we should withdraw them now we shouldn't wait until 2014 we shouldn't have several thousand advisors or troops or whatever advising and helping the Afghan anees for another 10 years they have their own Civil War they have been fighting for 35 years I wish we could have wave a magic wand that ended but we can't we should not participate in an Afghan Civil War we do not need to pick the winner in that Civil War we do not have the ability to pick that winner in that civil war or we are doing is wasting lives wasting limbs wasting people and wasting dollars we ought to end our involvement in Afghanistan as rapidly as we can physically remove our troops thank you I yield back

i now call this hearing of the senate homeland security and government affairs subcommittee on federal spending oversight and emergency management to order the title of our discussion today is state and local cyber security defending our communities from cyber threats amid covet 19. in preparing for this hearing it's become clear to me that good cyber security practices require a near constant struggle to stay ahead of events and the real danger lies in getting complacent effective cyber security is an ongoing everyday line of effort the threat the threat landscape is diverse the best practices are constantly changing the information you get may not always be reliable the maintenance task can seem overwhelming and most importantly the stakes are high and in this context i have often found myself thinking effective cyber security cannot move at quote the speed of government by that i mean cyber security is a 21st century public policy problem just as not solvable or really even manageable by 20th century government means regulation mandates and centralized action in general these approaches are inadequate to match the pace of change that we have witnessed in cyber security realm in recent years congress needs to make sure that the government's role in detecting and responding to cyber attacks is clearly defined that they are focused first and foremost on the security of federal information networks today we'll hear from the department of homeland security and their cyber security work how it is evolving about their approach to this complex range of threats with respect to individual actors in industries that are at their greatest risk of cyber attack health health care education financial services retail critical infrastructure the proliferation of ransomware attacks over the past several months and years have made clear that these entities have to take on this responsibility themselves on a day-to-day minute-by-minute basis irrespective of what the government is or is not doing all cyber security is essentially local and so today we'll hear from experts in state government the health care sector public education on their experience with cyber threats and incidents and see the state of cyber security in these industries fortunately for both government and the private sector the marketplace for cyber security services is continuing to grow and mature we'll hear today from one such firm uh cover that consults with private and public entities on cyber security and works with them to respond to cyber incidents i'd like to thank ranking member hassan for suggesting this hearing and i look forward to hearing from our panelists senator hassan well thank you very much mr chairman for working with me to arrange this hearing and for your opening comments i deeply appreciate the opportunity to continue working on an issue that i believe is critical to our national security as well as to the economic security of our nation state and local governments have been prime targets for cyber attacks for a number of years but the stakes have only grown as covid19 has forced millions of americans to migrate their everyday activities to the online world many students now learn from their teachers on a computer instead of in the classroom doctors treat many patients through telemedicine instead of in person governments handle many essential services online instead of at city hall the massive increase in online activities over these past nine months means that the targets for cyber criminals have increased commensurately unfortunately cyber criminals have taken advantage one firm that tracks cyber attacks on schools and school districts report that 44 attacks have occurred so far this school year and many more likely went unreported we will hear from the superintendent of one of these schools today in the spring interpol warned that ransomware attacks against hospitals have grown significantly as hackers sensed an opportunity to extort more money in ransoms with hospitals overwhelmed with coveted patients and about a month ago a cyber attack hit the university of vermont medical center forcing it to divert patients to other facilities thereby jeopardizing the care of many patients especially those in nearby rural areas who do not have the resources to travel to the next closest hospital for treatment the federal government has a responsibility to help protect our communities from these threats while the cyber security and infrastructure security agency has done a commendable job helping our state and local governments the number and the severity of attacks on our communities continues to increase this hearing will help us identify ways for congress and the federal government to better assist state and local governments in fending off these cyber attacks on our communities we have a group of great witnesses who can help us work through these challenges including sisa acting director brandon wales who we are happy to have here today with that said we are missing our original federal witness sissa director chris krebs because he was fired abruptly by the president two weeks ago director krebs led sysa in a nonpartisan manner and he approached his agency's most important task securing the u.s election infrastructure with professionalism and tenacity he was fired for doing his job and we are less safe because of it it's imperative that we have strong independent leadership at cisa going forward as the biden administration seeks to fill this position in 2021 i would encourage them to look to director krebs example when considering his successor to all of our witnesses i appreciate your willingness to testify and i want to thank you all for the role you play in keeping us safe i look forward to learning from your experiences as well as your expertise thank you mr chairman and i will proceed with introductions if you'd like me to we'll start in this first panel with our federal witness i'm pleased today to introduce brandon wales acting director for the cyber security and infrastructure security agency otherwise known as cisa at the united states department of homeland security acting director wales was the first person to serve as the executive director of the agency before being very recently elevated to acting director in this role acting director wales oversees sis efforts to defend civilian networks manage systemic risk to national critical functions and work with stakeholders to raise the security baseline of the nation's cyber and physical infrastructure acting director wales thank you for coming before the subcommittee today and i look forward to hearing your testimony chairman paul ranking member hassan and members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding the cyber security and infrastructure security agency support to state local tribal and territorial stakeholders in mitigating a broad range of cyber threats facing our nation whether focused on election security responding to the digital transformation brought about by covet 19 or addressing the plague of ransomware i believe that enhancing and sustaining state and local cybersecurity capacity will be the defining cyber security challenge of the next decade this is my first appearance before the committee in my new capacity as acting director and i am honored to lead the men and women of our agency as we defend today and secure tomorrow i want to begin by thanking the sisa workforce and the entire election security community for their tireless work over the last four years culminating in the november third election our goal was simple to make the 2020 election the most secure in modern history we succeeded in building a robust election security community made up of state and local election officials key federal agencies and private sector election vendors in surging the technical capacity of cisa to improve cyber defenses nationwide and in harnessing the capabilities of cisa the fbi the national security agency the u.s intelligence community and the department of defense to identify threats respond to potential incidents and take decisive action when necessary as a result layers of security and resilience measures are put in place by election officials and the community reacted quickly to disrupt efforts by foreign nations to interfere in the election for example we were able to rapidly share information on russian intrusions into state and local networks and attempts by iranian government actors to send spoofed voter intimidation emails were publicly outed within 27 hours our election security mission continues and sisa will remain in an enhanced coordination posture until after election results have been certified in every state we also stand ready to support states holding runoff elections in the coming months such as georgia and louisiana this year has not only been focused on elections beginning in february we have been working to support the nation's response to covid19 including helping to secure the development and distribution of potential vaccines under operation warp speed since the pandemic's earliest days we have seen malicious cyber actors targeting vaccine research and development exploiting the dramatic expansion of remote work and using kovid to advance criminal schemes in response sysa ramped up information sharing efforts on emerging threats established a teleworks resource hub and surged cyber security services to high-risk entities in the healthcare sector through our project taken now under the hhs and dod led operation warp speed we are prioritizing services to companies deeper in the pharmaceutical supply chain to protect us vaccine development and distribution recently hospitals across the country were hit with ransomware launched by a cyber criminal organization looking to profit from disruptions of critical health delivery during the pandemic this was appalling but not surprising given the growth of ransomware incidents over the past six months ransomware is quickly becoming a national emergency we are doing what we can to raise awareness share best practices and assist victims but approving defenses will only go so far we must disrupt the ransomware business model we must take to fight to the criminals while election security a pandemic response and ransomware may all look completely different the one thing they have in common is a reliance on the networks the state and local level these are the networks that keep our communities running despite global challenges these are the networks that help us respond to emergencies these are the networks that run local hospitals and schools and they are in need of urgent assistance cisa is taking action to help by strengthening operational partnerships hiring additional cyber security coordinators to boost engagement in state capitals across the country in supporting cyber proposals in the fema preparedness grant making process and continuing to push sister resources out from headquarters to where our partners are in states and communities in conclusion i want to thank the committee for its leadership on legislation that has advanced the authorities of our agency and for your support for legislation still moving through congress that will push sysa even further this committee has been an essential partner in our mission and i look forward to continuing to work with you to defend today and secure tomorrow thank you again for the opportunity to hear before you and i look forward to your questions thank you um senator hassan had to go vote so she'll be back in a few minutes um you mentioned i believe russia and iran and it went back went by pretty quickly and i didn't really catch everything you had to say you said these were attempts to actually change votes or to interfere in the election somehow what did you exactly say sure so the activity was a little different in both cases uh in the case of russia russia had launched a fairly broad campaign to target state local private sector and federal networks using exposed vulnerabilities using what exposed vulnerabilities fairly well known vulnerabilities they were looking for those vulnerabilities and trying to get inside of networks we did discover that you're talking about election networks that count votes what are you talking about talking about general networks these could be private sector networks and things completely unrelated to elections it did include in one case uh where they compromised a a local county network and downloaded some information uh that it had to do with the election but this was not an issue this wasn't tabulation of the election absolutely not okay and then what did you say about iran iran sent spoofed voter intimidation emails okay so trying to disincentivize people to vote or something right to create a narrative that the election but to your knowledge there were no votes changed by a foreign actor in fact was that true no votes were changed by a foreign actor that you know you have no evidence that votes were changed by by an actor and really no attempts were directly stopped is there sort of an existing voting network you can't really hack into a voting network can you that's just sort of there well we have a numerous advantages in part because we have a highly decentralized system there is not an election network there are hundreds and thousands of election networks across the country in addition the actual vote tabulation systems those are not networked on the internet the places where we see the most activity tends to be those highly centralized internet-enabled systems for example voter registration or election night reporting but even in those cases we did not see any adversary capable of compromising those systems to what it sounds like as a general rule of thumb if we're looking for advice on how to protect ourselves the whole push of modern technology is to make us more connected and maybe part of the advice is that we don't need to be too connected uh having separate systems or separating is some of that advice taken within the federal government you said we're protected in the electoral system because we have states and then we have counties and there isn't they're not completely integrated so we probably don't want to completely integrate or federalize things with it with elections is it true within the federal government that there's compartmentalization on purpose to try to protect against hacking yeah i mean one of the major recommendations to any entity is to be thoughtful about how you network your systems where you should segment your systems where you should completely air gap your systems there's a reason why uh the classified networks that are operated by the intelligence community and department of defense are not accessible readily through uh through the internet you want to keep those things separate same thing for industrial control systems that operate the most sensitive uh critical infrastructure in the country you want to build additional barriers to prevent people from easily moving from small compromises onto parts of networks that could have much more significant consequences how much of the problem with attacking a network is coming through an email versus another way of attacking a network you know it frankly it varies uh coming through an email that normally includes things like spear phishing where you get a email that says click on this and you click on a link and all of a sudden they've had some malicious uh payload comes and compromises your computer i would say right now we are seeing well that has been traditionally one of the more significant ways we have seen networks compromised uh over the last year we have seen a dramatic growth in people compromising networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in virtual private network uh software in part this is as a result of the dramatic expansion of people teleworking remote working and a dramatic increase in the number what does that mean you're not attacking it through an email you're attacking it through the cloud somehow through software that communicates with the cloud or the not necessarily the cloud but for example if if you're connecting through a virtual private network which is the way that maybe you call into your company's network i'm at home on my laptop calling into my company's network i'm connecting through a vulner a virtual private network vpn software and there are vulnerabilities in some of the more common vpn software most of which have been patched but if a company has not patched that vulnerability an actor may be able to exploit that vulnerability compromise the connection they're not logging into your computer they're logging into your network and then bouncing back into your computer once they get into your network more importantly they want to get into that network so they're exploiting that vulnerability to gain access to that network and then once they're inside uh using a variety of other vulnerabilities they're they're trying to elevate their privileges so they have administrative capabilities so they can create new accounts and do whatever they want so what's a guess on the no on the percentage how much of this is an email problem is half of it email 75 25 just a guess a little bit hard to say right now i'd say probably at least half is still kind of spearfishing uh related intrusions because it seems like that there would be a technological solution to some of that in really trying to protect email networks from the network um almost as if maybe you have a separate complete network that never communicates it communicates with each other you know so you can talk to each other but never communicates with i mean almost somehow complete separation of your email network from the rest of your network i mean it's it's hard today given the amount of interconnection between the various tools that you use in terms of any business but most of the ways in which networks are compromised today are exploiting vulnerabilities that where patches are available and where the solutions to to mitigate these problems are readily available and they're just not being implemented by the i.t security professionals at companies so how rapidly how rapidly does it change how rapidly does someone have to figure out you know there's a brand new uh phishing or you know technology you need to stay on top of it i mean every day new patches are released for software now it may not be every single day for every piece of software but on any given day there are new patches that come out for software i.t security professionals need to stay on top of that understand what the nature of those vulnerabilities are prioritize their efforts to close those vulnerabilities obviously the bigger the network you have the more complicated this and when you come up with a patch are you able to keep that somewhat secret from the criminals or they immediately can see the patch and respond to the patch they can generally see it these patches are made publicly available so that as many uh individuals can can protect their networks and it's it's a cat and mouse game every every change we make on the defensive side an offensive cyber actor is going to look to see what they need to do to to get around that and are we able to when we have a state actor that's uh sort of going after classified and we have you know creative ways that state actors are using are we able to share them with the private sector or we're too worried that uh getting that knowledge out reveals that we know how to combat certain things but do we are we sharing on a consistent basis knowledge that you gain with the private sector absolutely so the the partnership that we have with the intelligence community in particular the national security agency um is better than any time in my entire 15-year history with the department we are getting a significant amount of information from them of things that they're seeing overseas um activity that they are seeing from from foreign nations getting that information to be declassified so that we can get it out to people whether that's a specific incident at a at an individual location or more importantly information that could benefit the entire community so a lot of the alerts that we are pushing out alerting the community to different tactics that our adversary is using are based upon intelligence sources that we are receiving from the intelligence community um and that process is happening quickly does it work both ways is private industry you're getting information back from private industry as well so there is a vibrant cyber security community right now that has grown up over the past decade and a half and they are there's a lot of information out there for everyone we we ourselves rely upon information provided by private sector cyber security firms to help improve our defenses of the dot gov and so there is a benefit to this community sharing as much information as possible because that's the way we're going to have a more secure right and a more defended cyber ecosystem as as someone like myself who's very concerned with privacy i've been concerned about having i'm all for telehealth and for allowing the internet to allow us to see doctors remotely as a physician i think it's a good thing but i am concerned about having like a uni a unique patient identifier where all of our data goes into one place and is stored in one place and it goes back to this idea of compartmentalization um you know the when opm was hacked 22 million people's records were released and i know that was a big mistake and hopefully we've learned from that but there is a danger and i think one way from a patient point of view and from a point of view that there are sensitive things you know whether you've got an infectious disease you know that's acquired sexually whether you've got psychiatric disorder that you don't want the whole world to know about there's a lot of things that could be very private um you know starting with my father 20 years ago and continuing today we've been trying to get away from a unique patient identifier that the federal government has and i think it would be nice if people could equate that not only with privacy but also with the idea of hacking that the more centralized your healthcare records are yeah it may be easier but it also might be easier for bad actors to get into your health community and extort people or you know damage them publicly with releasing private information um any thoughts on healthcare security with regard to unique patient identifier i mean i i think that the challenges that you're describing there are are the same challenges that we deal with in every cyber security challenge and that is how do you balance the need to create more efficient more effective systems with the risk that that poses uh because of the nature of connected systems being potentially vulnerable we encourage people to be thoughtful and take a really risk-based approach how much information needs to be centralized how much information needs to be networked and be thoughtful and then once you make that decision then put then go to the next step and say how do i defend the information that needs to be networked to the maximum extent possible if i'm going to have sensitive information that is internet accessible i need to make sure that my cyber security practices um are are going to be sufficient to defend that um so i need to make sure that my patch management is good i need to make sure that my configuration management is good and i would i would just conclude by saying that the moral i get from your your discussion on elections is there is some advantage to disconnectedness to compartmentalization to having counties states and federal government be somewhat separate where there's you can actually go to a county and verify an election you know it doesn't go into some sort of mass network or computer so we're very lucky i think that we have sort of this federal state operation with regard to elections but i think people need to think that through before the efficiency experts and say oh it'll be so easy to have your medical records everywhere they'll be at every doctor all of the time anywhere in the united states and they'll be centralized yeah it's going to be easy until hacker gets in there and all your private information is all over the internet so i say be careful what you wish for some of those who really want the centralization of things because there is a danger of losing your privacy senator hassan well thank you very much mr chair and um i thank you for what you just covered in your questions and um i want to start with a question really focusing on how we help state and local governments protect against cyber threats so acting director wales your agency is responsible for securing federal information technology infrastructure from a wide range of cyber threats it's widely accepted that your work to secure the federal space is critical however some might argue that it is not the federal government's job or responsibility to also try to secure state and local governments from cyber threats so just let me ask you does the federal government have an obligation or responsibility to also protect state and local governments from cyber threats so cyber security is a shared responsibility in multiple domains and cisa takes seriously the responsibility we have um to utilize the information the knowledge the expertise on cyber security to help all aspects of our critical infrastructure whether those are state local governments or those are private companies operating our power grids if those are hospitals if those are chemical plants we have a responsibility to help them now again every system owner bears some responsibility for managing the security on their networks and so i think it's trying to figure out where their responsibilities and our responsibilities intersect we understand that we have a lot of information we have a lot of expertise that we can provide we can make sure that they are armed with all of the information that we have been able to glean from both the intelligence community from our own visibility into into the cyber activity of our adversaries and the tactics that they're using and it is our job to provide that as broadly as possible to make sure that they are prepared um and then each of those individual asset owners needs to go through that process that senator paul and i just discussed that risk-based process to say how much security do i need in what parts of my network and how can i put that in place to be as robust as is required by the risk that i'm facing well thank you and just to follow up if a state or a community is vulnerable to cyber threats how does that broadly impact the security of americans who do not live directly in that state or community so the the state the the state governments across the country and local governments operate some of them some of our most critical infrastructure whether it's operating water treatment facilities in in some states and communities uh municipal power authorities in others the they also obviously at the state level distribute significant amounts of funds uh through which federal programs uh funnel money through so states are a critical part of our fabric for both our economic uh and our homeland security so it is it is an important interest of the federal government that states have as much of our cyber security knowledge and expertise as possible to help safeguard those critical systems thank you um various proposals have been introduced in congress that establish a stand-alone federal cyber security grant program for state and local governments that would pay for cybersecurity upgrades at the state and local level without specifically evaluating each bill can you please describe for me the elements and considerations that congress should be thinking about if we authorize a grant program of this nature are there any elements of a grant program that cisa views as being must-have items so you know i think we'd be happy to work with uh with congress on on what a grant program would be how a grant program could be structured to serve the maximum value i'd say until that time we have been working closely with fema over the past year as fema has required as part of its last round of homeland security grants that a portion of it go to a certain set of high priority items including state cyber security and so we spent the past year working with states working with fema to review the proposals that were submitted and i think this will provide us a good baseline to understand how states are thinking about investing in cyber security utilizing federal grants how we can provide additional information to them to better shape and focus those grants on the on the highest risk aspects of their networks um but grant making is obviously a complicated topic one that uh cisa is not uh has not directly doesn't have direct responsibility for managing so i would probably refer you to people at fema who know more about kind of the grant making sausage but at the more macro level i think that we have a lot to add to help shape grants so that they actually target those things that we need to protect the most and that it reflects the true partnership that exists between the federal government and our state and local governments on cyber security thank you um cyber insurance is an important tool that helps companies and entities prepare for prevent and respond to cyber attacks however an august 2019 report by propublica revealed that if an entity has cyber security insurance policyholders will use their cyber insurance policy to pay the ransom during a ransomware event which in turn serves as a further incentive for hackers to launch ransomware attacks the report also shows that hackers target cyber insurance policy holders because the likelihood of the victim paying the ransom is much higher during the clovid 19 pandemic our country's increased dependency on online services may increase the incentive to pay ransoms so that critical services can be restored more quickly does sisa or your partner agencies generally know when an insurance company pays out a ransom so as a general rule uh we have recommended against paying ransom in part because it furthers the business model as i indicated in my opening remarks ransomware is not going to go away as long as the business model is viable as long as ransomware operators can do it right cisa generally focuses our efforts on ransomware before an event happens helping companies prepare themselves helping state and local prepare themselves we are generally not involved in decisions related to whether ransom is paid that tends to be an individual decision at that company and they do not consult uh cisa as part of it so generally speaking you may not know if a ransom if an insurance payment has been made that is correct okay and additionally are cyber insurance companies working with you to tackle any of these negative incentives that seemingly drive more attacks i'm not aware of engagement with cyber insurance companies on that issue right now and do you think there's a role for congress to play to help address this i think that this is a incredibly challenging problem uh no one has has cracked the code on what the answer is yet and it is going to take uh more work between congress and the executive branch to figure out what are the right tools we have to to change the business model and to disrupt the business model on ransomware and make more progress in this space thank you and and mr chair i see him out of time if we have a second round on this witness i'll have one more question sure senator rosen uh thank you chairman paul ranking member hassan for holding a hearing on protecting our communities from cyber attacks you know during the coba 19 pandemic the number of cyber attacks is significantly increased and cyber attacks of course they're expensive they're debilitating especially for small organizations like schools hospitals and local governments i'm glad we're coming together in this bipartisan way to talk about how we can protect vulnerable communities of course in this challenging time but i want to focus on school cyber security because elementary schools secondary schools they face many challenges as they transition to online learning during the pandemic including the constrained budgets bridging the digital divide ensuring the health and safety of students and faculty and of course continuing to educate and support our students so a school struggle to meet these challenges they remain particularly vulnerable to hostile cyber actors earlier this spring the fbi warned that k-12 institutions represent an opportunistic target to hackers as many school districts they just lack the budget and the expertise to dedicate to network integrity so last august the clark county school district which is nevada's largest school district and our country's fifth largest school district was the victim of a ransomware attack the hacker published documents online containing sensitive information including social security numbers student names addresses and grades and this is absolutely unacceptable the federal government must find uh uh and help the schools obtain the tools and the resources to protect and combat these kinds of cyber uh threats something i've raised with both cisa and the department of education so uh mr wales can you speak to what steps this is taking to prevent cyber attacks including these ransomware attacks like i had at clark county school district against k-12 schools and uh and how are you ensuring that we're not having more of these in the future sure thank you uh senator and i know that uh some members of of the sisa team along with the department of education are uh planning on briefing you and your office later this week um on this topic uh but in the meantime the first thing i would say is we have uh expanded our focus on k-12 information from the beginning putting out additional information on how schools can improve their cyber security with their distance learning in addition we are encouraging schools to participate through the information sharing mechanisms that have been created for example the multi-state information sharing and analysis center the multi-state isaac which is a free resource available from uh that that we have invested in from the department for state and local governments today 2000 school districts schools and and i.t services organizations are part of that multi-state isaac and there are additional resources and tools that states and school districts can take part in that can help help them ensure their protection against ransomware and other attacks for example the sac offers malicious domain blocking so that known malicious domains that are used by ransomware operators uh would be blocked from activity on those networks um but only about 120 schools are actively using that service that's offered for free today what i want to see is much like we've done in the past four years in the election security context how do we build a national community with the school districts to get them focused on the security aspects related to related to their networks that's not going to go away even after the pandemic is over we need to arm them with the same information the same resources and that's going to start with them taking advantage of the no cost services that are currently offered across the country to state and local governments and the entities that exist within them this is obviously a big problem there's over 13 000 school districts across this country it is going to take time attention and focus but i'm confident that if we if congress work together we can find creative ways of leveraging the capabilities that we have and getting more school districts signed up for these services well i appreciate that because i was going to ask you i know you're you said 2 000 school districts are using it in some cases now only hundreds of schools or school districts out of the thirteen thousand but you talk about malicious wear ransomware we have small school districts uh rural school districts who may not have the capacity or any expertise to even take advantage of your free services are there grant programs what kind of support can we give or that you can give to be sure that the folks that are really sitting uh in those administrative offices can take advantage of what you're offering that then we need to get it out there to 13 000 school districts for sure but not all of them have somebody who who was even technically uh knows enough to really take advantage of it so what are you doing there what kind of programs you're offering for training for people who work in the schools sure you know i think we have recognized long that the small and medium-sized businesses and government entities have unique challenges what we had put in place earlier this year was something called sisa cyber essentials so these are the basic bare minimum things that you need to put in place to get some baseline level of cyber security it is geared for the small and medium-sized businesses and it's also geared for large large companies to to send down to their smaller suppliers to get them to a baseline level of security and over the past several months we've been we've been issuing monthly modules toolkits that are could be used step-by-step guides to take for how to put in place the baseline the baseline level of cyber security what are those things you need to do to make sure that you have uh challenging passwords or two-factor authentication how to set that up on your network to make it making it a little bit more clear and easy for you to walk through but if states if cities if communities push that kind of information out even to their smaller school districts this is the kind of information that is powerful in the hands of those small companies because the reality is ransomware operators are looking to make money quickly and so they're gonna find look for whoever is the most vulnerable and if you've done some of the basics if you've put in place uh the bare minimum level of cyber security there is a good chance that the op that that that that ransomware operator is gonna go on to the next victim and they're not gonna target you and so by investing a small amount of energy in putting in place cyber security at even a bear level you can have a significant impact and dividend uh for your overall level of security well i appreciate that and i was going to my next question i know i'm out of time would be the same we need the same kinds of things for our small businesses around the country as well and i look forward to speaking with you offline about how maybe we can uh get your message out for this training and the programs and all and all of the cyber hygiene to as many folks as possible because um we can't afford not to communicate your hard work and what you've been doing and people and give people the ability to take advantage of these programs uh thank you absolutely i think any help we can get in amplifying the work that's already out there the tools and resources that congress has already invested in through cisa are available for all uh of the country to utilize and we want more people to take up and use them uh so anything you can do to get that message out there and amplify the work that we are doing our agency is going to be grateful for thank you thank you mr wales and uh i hope you'll be willing to respond to any questions we have in writing if we have further questions from members uh i want to also thank you for reminding us that decentralization is a part of our defense against hacking of our elections and as a great fan of the federalist system that we had set up from the very beginning even in our modern age uh decentralization and compartmentalization are a big part of our defense and uh can make our elections more reliable but thank you very much for your testimony thank you i joined the chairman in thanking you for your testimony and for your service and please to all the women and men you work with please tell take back our thanks as well i appreciate that and so do they thank you ma'am um we're ready for other panel of whoever's in charge of that uh this one dr rodriguez and um mr siegel are you there i believe uh chairman paul and mecca member peters are ready to begin this second ban yep let's go ahead and get started uh who would you like to start we're doing the whole panel together this panel on one one panel if we can everybody can come in okay i misunderstood these are virtual so you can go ahead and do the introduction senator hassan please thank you very much mr chair uh to all of our witnesses for the second panel thank you for being here today and i will introduce each witness directly before your testimony so i will start with our first witness dennis goulet i'm pleased today to introduce mr dennis goulet who served serves as commissioner of the department of information technology from my home state of new hampshire commissioner goulet has served admirably since he was appointed in february of 2015. commissioner goulet also serves as president of the national association of state cios thanks for joining us commissioner dennis goulet and thank you for your exemplary leadership to strengthen cyber security efforts in new hampshire and across the country i look forward to your testimony good afternoon and thank you chairman paul ranking member hassan and distinguished members of the subcommittee for inviting me to speak today on the cyber security challenges facing state government that have been amplified during the covet 19 pandemic as commissioner for the department of information technology in new hampshire and president of the national association of state chief information officers nacio i am grateful for the opportunity to highlight the vital role that state information technology agencies have played in providing critical citizen services and ensuring the continuity of government throughout this public health crisis cyber security has remained the top priority for state cios for nearly a decade this is there is growing recognition at all levels of government that cyber security is no longer an i.t issue is a business risk that impacts the daily functioning of our society and economy as well as a potential threat to our nation's security state and local governments continues to be attractive targets for cyber attacks as evidenced by the many high-profile and debilitating ransomware incidents inadequate resources for cyber security has been the most significant challenge facing state and local governments the question of why federal government should be contributing to cyber security of the states is straightforward states are the primary agent for the delivery of a vast array of federal programs and services according to our recent national survey state cyber security budgets are typically less than 3 percent of their overall i.t budgets half of the states lack a dedicated cyber security budget as state cios are tasked with additional responsibilities including providing cyber security assistance to local government they are asked to do so with shortages in both funding and cyber talent almost all the cios have the authority and are directly responsible for cyber security in their state and have taken multiple initiatives to enhance the stat status of their cyber security programs these initiatives include creation of a cybersecurity strategic plan adoption of the nift cybersecurity framework development of a cyber disruption response plan obtaining cyber insurance and the implementation of security awareness training programs for employees and contractors these initiatives are crucial as congress considers the implementation of a cyber security grant program for state and local governments for the past decade nacio has advocated for a whole of state approach to cyber security we define this approach as collaboration among state and federal agencies local governments the national guard education k-12 and higher critical infrastructure providers and private sector entities by approaching cyber security as a team sport information is widely shared and each stakeholder has a clearly defined role to play when an incident occurs my written testimony covers legislation that nacio has endorsed during the 116th congress i would like to reiterate my appreciation for this subcommittee for its attention to cybersecurity issues impacting state and local governments if passed these bills would greatly improve our cybersecurity posture and create new dedicated funding streams the pandemic has exacerbated the cybersecurity challenges for state i.t since march my colleagues and i have rapidly implemented technologies to allow state employees to telework safely and effectively in this new environment we have helped our state agency quickly deliver critical digital government services to citizens including unemployment insurance in new hampshire i have worked closely with our public health agencies to ensure they have the necessary tools to improve capabilities in the area of testing contact tracing case management data analytics and ppe inventory my colleagues and i have been honored to play a role in fighting covet 19. we have taken on additional responsibilities and incurred new expenses while continuing to face an unrelenting cyber threat environment i am truly concerned about how crucial i.t and cybersecurity initials initiatives will remain funded in the coming months and years states have seen significant declines in revenue and will be forced to make difficult budgetary decisions as president of nacio i know i speak for all of my colleagues around the country when i say that a dedicated federally funded cyber security grant program for state and local governments is overdue additionally state governments should follow the lead of the federal government and begin providing consistent and dedicated funding for cyber security which will also require them to match a portion of federal grant funds i look forward to continuing to work with the members of this subcommittee in creation of a grant program to improve our cyber security posture this concludes my formal testimony and i'm happy to answer your questions thank you and i think we will move on to the next two witnesses uh three witnesses uh and then we will uh return four questions is uh dr torres rodriguez available now by okay she's back online so our next witness is dr leslie torres rodriguez who joins us today from connecticut dr torres rodriguez is the superintendent of hartford public schools one of the largest urban school districts in the state dr torres rodriguez was raised in hartford and attended hartford public schools she served as an education leader in the greater hartford area for more than two decades in september the hartford school district was the victim of a cyber attack dr torres rodriguez thank you for coming before the committee today and i look forward to your testimony doctor you might need to unmute yourself okay so she's having connectivity issues so why don't i do the other introductions and we'll see if she's ready in a minute or two um our next witness will be john ridgy senior advisor for cyber security and risk from the american hospital association mr ridgey is the senior advisor for cyber security and risk for the aha he brings nearly 30 years of experience with the fbi including serving as the senior executive for the fbi cyber division program develop developing mission-critical partnerships with the healthcare and other critical infrastructure sectors mr edgy i look forward to your testimony as well today and i think we should probably proceed with that uh while superintendent torres is yes so mr reggie please feel free to proceed thank you and good afternoon chairman paul and ranking member hassan and members of this subcommittee on behalf of our nearly 5 000 member hospitals and health systems the american hospital association thanks the subcommittee for the opportunity to testify on this important issue and we stand by ready to assist as needed the aha has a unique national perspective on cyber threats facing health care stemming from our trusted relationships with the field and government agencies the ongoing pandemic has resulted in a significantly increased cyber threat environment for health care providers for example this past october 28th cisa fbi and hhs issued an urgent warning of an imminent ransomware threat to u.s hospitals and advise the field to take immediate defensive action this threat remains ongoing as of today this threat also comes as hospitals and health systems were already dealing with what i call the covet-induced cyber triple threat first threat is an expanded attack surface in preparation and response to covert 19 the health care sector rapidly deployed and expanded network network-connected technologies such as telehealth telemedicine and telework unfortunately this also greatly expanded network access point and opportunities for the cyber criminals to attack the second threat is increased cyber attacks in conjunction with the expanded attack surface cyber criminals have launched increased and relentless attacks on hospitals and health systems hhs office of civil rights has reported a significant increase in hospital hacks since september uh 2020 september 1 2020 impacting millions of patients foreign intelligence services from china russia and iran have launched cyber campaigns targeting health care to steal covet 19 related data and vaccine research of all the attacks ransomware attacks are a top concern these attacks could disrupt patient care deny access to critical electronic medical records in devices resulting in canceled surgeries and the diversion of ambulances thus putting patient lives in the community at risk the third threat hospitals face is resource constraints due to reduced revenue as a result of cancel the so-called elective surgeries in patients reluctance to seek medical treatment during the pandemic pandemic this situation leaves limited funds available to bolster network defenses and to recruit and retain scarce cyber security professionals the above factors create a perfect storm of cyber threats for hospitals and health systems regarding ransomware attacks we believe a ransomware attack on a hospital crosses the line from an economic crime to a threat to life crime and therefore should be aggressively pursued as such by the government most often these attacks originate from foreign adversarial safe havens beyond the reach of u.s law enforcement combined use of military and intelligence capabilities along with economic sanctions to augment law enforcement efforts can reduce cyber threats to the nation by defending forward the government can deter and disrupt these foreign-based cyber threats before they attack we believe a hospital victim of cyber attack is a victim of crime and should be a prob should be provided assistance not assigned blame despite regulatory compliance in implementing cyber best practices hospitals and health systems will continue to be the targets of sophisticated attacks which will inevitably succeed the government often repeats the phrase it's not a matter of if but when unfortunately when a breach occurs the federal government's approach towards the victims of cyber attacks is sometimes inconsistent across agencies and may be counterproductive for example federal law enforcement agencies often request in need the cooperation of victims of breaches to further their investigations and disrupt the threat to the nation subsequently or concurrently a hospital or health system may become the subject of an adversarial investigation by the hhs office of civil rights this can be disruptive and confusing for the victim and stifle cooperation with federal law enforcement given the critical need to defend health care during the pandemic along with the increased cyber threat environment in need to incentivize cooperation from victims we strongly recommend that additional safe harbor protections from civil and regulatory liability be provided to hospital and health system victims of cyber attacks in conclusion hospitals health systems and patients are heavily targeted by cyber criminals and sophisticated nation states hospitals have made great strides to defend their networks secure patient data and most importantly protect patients however we cannot do it alone healthcare needs more active support from the government including consistent and automated threat information sharing to help us defend patients in their data from cyber threats conversely the federal government cannot protect our nation from cyber attacks alone either they need the expertise and exchange of cyber threat information from the field to effectively combat cyber threats what is needed is an effective and efficient public private cyber security partnership in a truly whole of nation approach thank you well thank you so much um and i want to turn now back to dr torres rodriguez if you are able to join us doctor we look forward to your testimony yes good afternoon we hear you loudly and clearly good afternoon uh chairman paul senator hassan and senators of the committee i am dr leslie torres rodriguez superintendent of harford public schools we are the third largest school district in connecticut with approximately 18 000 students i appreciate your invitation to address the committee and answer questions regarding the cyber attack on harford public schools that occurred in september the cyber attack had extremely disruptive effects on our school system our students and our staff we were forced to postpone our first day of school on september 8th following months of intense planning for in-person learning amidst the co-19 pandemic while our students have been attending school either in person or remotely for nearly three months now we are still repairing and recovering from lingering effects of the attack harford public schools and the city of hartford were informed by our shared i.t department metro hartford information services that early in the morning hours on september saturday september 5th we experienced a severe cyber attack specifically a ransomware attack which aims to take control of targeted servers and sell access back to to the owner back to us the the attack was unsuccessful overall because uh metro hartford information services regained control of its servers without complying with the attacker's demands uh thanks to recent cybersecurity investments and quick work by the metro hartford information services team based on uh initial analysis by the connecticut national guard and the uh fbi the attack was likely conducted by a highly sophisticated actor and so in one sense we were fortunate that we avoided the worst case scenario so our our district team metro hartford information services and our mayors bronin's office worked late into the night on labor day and in the early hours on tuesday september 8th to ensure that uh harford public schools critical systems were restored so that the first day of school could proceed our student information system was restored around midnight but as of 3 a.m our transfer transportation system was still not accessible our transportation company and our schools had no access to the student bus schedules um and so around four a.m in the morning i did have to make that difficult uh call to postpone the first day of school fortunately we were able to get our transportation system back online the evening of september 8th and we opened schools for the first time since march on wednesday september 9th uh however two weeks later our systems were still not yet fully operational and the costs to address the problem financially and in terms of resources and staff time have been significant while we have regained control of servers and data preventative measures are ongoing and present significant challenges to getting operations back to normal so for example all of our servers needed to be taken offline and reimagined or restored from backups the total amount of information that needed to be restored was over 70 terabytes across the city and school system which is a massive amount of information additionally every computer uh that had connected to the district net network before the attack just before the start of the school year had to be individually restored to factory settings before reconnecting with the network so this required a very fast deployment of new laptops to hundreds of staff members which then depleted the stock of laptops that we had to provide to students at a very critical time in the school year while we had ordered laptops with the intention of ensuring every student had a district device at the start of the school year that plan was set back as a result of a cyber attack this was an especially difficult consequence of this attack as many of our students are participating online on online learning from home and needed reliable devices to engage in their learning these preventative measures impeded our ability to operate normally and for our teachers to provide student instruction in pairing even basic functions like scanning and printing and having access to lesson plans i am proud of the work that has been done by our i.t team our city officials and district administration and thankful for the investigative actions and the support from the connecticut national guard and the fbi however we do need to protect our critical infrastructure by preventing such attacks in the future so i thank you again senator hassan for inviting me to testify before the subcommittee on this important issue while the attack was unexpected and damaging in many ways i am grateful for the way that our local state and federal agencies collaborated to address the cyber attack and assisted with the restoration efforts we are all committed to serving our constituents our students in the best way possible thank you and i will be happy to answer any questions that you may have thank you superintendent now now turn to the chairman for an introduction our final witness this afternoon is bill siegel ceo and co-founder of cove where mr siegel founded cove where in 2018 to provide services to small and medium-sized businesses threatened by ransomware they offer a full spectrum suite of services from identifying and closing vulnerabilities before an attack happens to decryption and navigation of an attack that has happened to recovery after an attack cover and other private sector firms provide solutions that keep pace with the criminals so we are excited to hear from mr siegel about the state of cyber security marketplace what what to do if your organization is attacked and about low-cost steps that organizations of all sizes can take to enhance their cybersecurity posture mr siegel you're recognized mr siegel if you're with us you are recognized is he disconnected all right why don't we uh begin around with questions with senator hassan and we'll get back to mr siegel's testimony when he gets back on thank you mr chair and i want to start with a question to commissioner goulet commissioner goulet you and i know all too well the challenges of putting together a state budget giving more funding to the state's information technology budget might mean giving less funding to emergency services education public transportation or other critical priorities moreover when recessions happen state revenues decrease which leaves budget officials with even harder decisions to make commissioner goulet can you talk about the challenges states face funding cyber security upgrades as they deal with reduced state revenues from the recent economic downturn do states have the ability to adequately fund their information technology budgets and better protect against cyber threats thank you for the question senator um you know we have some really recent data from the 2020 deloitte nacio cyber security study and i'll share with you the the top five barriers to overcome cyber security challenges in state government number one lack of sufficient cyber security budget number two inadequate cyber security staffing which really relates to number one number three legacy infrastructure and solutions to support emergency emerging threats the older systems tend to be much more vulnerable a lack of dedicated cyber security budget and finally inadequate availability of cyber security professionals so um i think that pretty well covers the gamut of the answer to that question thank you i appreciate that uh i'll go on just complete this round um so dr torres rodriguez uh i want to turn to you and i first just want to start by thanking you for participating in this hearing all educators are facing unprecedented challenges right now but to suffer a ransomware attack on top of everything else you're contending with means you are busier even than most other educators i want to start by getting a sense of where cyber security falls in the very long list of priorities that a school district like yours has you mentioned in your testimony that there is a metro hartford information service what sort of assistance uh do you get from them so you know do you think that there's enough cybersecurity professionals uh to help the school district with the system you already have and what sort of assistance from the federal government uh would be helpful and did you receive before and after the attack yeah so just to give you a little more context so we have about 18 000 students and 3 400 staff members here in in the public school system and the shared i.t department which is managed by the city of hartford has six field i.t technicians and all right and there is one staff member assigned full-time to cyber security and that is across all of the city um you know services and so there there is an opportunity uh if you will for additional support there and with regard to the assistance from the federal government uh you know harford police and the fbi liaison there um did uh investigate the attack and gather additional information um and and the connecticut national guard provided assistance with the recovery effort for for about four weeks uh primarily helping to mitigate um and re-image our district devices that was prioritized and we are deeply deeply grateful for that um they have you know the national guard has a team that specializes in defensive cyber operations and their support was critical in assessing the attack and helping um the metro hartford information system team recover operations and and help ensure security overall it was their assessment that this was a highly you know sophisticated and complex attack that uh the the information system team took a wide range of appropriate measures but nonetheless did impact school operations well thank you for that um i'm going to turn now to uh mr ridgie thank you for your work for our nation's hospitals both in terms of your current position and from your time working for the fbi as a cyber security professional who focuses on preventing cyber attacks to hospitals can you please lay out for us the type of attack that most worries you thank you senator um as i mentioned in my testimony the the attack that i'm most concerned about are ransomware attacks which have the ability to disrupt patient care and risk patient safety these type of attacks can can lead to medical records becoming inaccessible at critical moments in treatment even understanding drug allergies for a patient uh may not be available and in certain instances we've we've had ambulances being diverted to emergency rooms which were further away from the original intended destination so in the medical field obviously any delay in urgent treatment increases the risk of a negative outcome so ransomware attacks especially as we've seen the increase recently is the top concern the most significant concern that uh that worries us at the moment well thank you and if i have a chance i'm going to return to you with one more question but first i do want to turn uh back to commissioner goulet uh over the past decade cyber attacks have increased in both their frequency and their ability to threaten our national security just if we as we have experienced with terrorism the impacts of these cyber threats are not confined to far-off battlefields but to our states our cities and our communities however as the threat has increased federal support for state and local governments has not increased commensurately as you note in your testimony only four percent of homeland security grant dollars have gone to support state and local cyber security over the past decade can you provide your analysis for why you think that federal funding for state and local cyber security efforts has not been commensurate with the threat what do you recommend that congress do in order to address this thank you you've i so i still wanted to address that question in more detail myself and my colleagues around the country have a really a queue of of initiatives that we would do to help state and local governments and education and and really all of us the state um uh if we had access to more funds um so we've done a lot as much as we could with those um federal homeland security grant funds that we were able to access for example increasing you know building in new hampshire we built a nice cyber response program where we we did it take a whole state approach but but we really could do so much more with dedicated grant funding that flowed in cyber grant funding that flowed in in a separate stream and i think that it would although we're improved slowly improving our cyber posturing state we could very much accelerate the improvement of cyber posture with dedicated grant funding and i would also like to reiterate that that any such funding should include incentives for states to invest in a continuous manner as well thank you and thank you mr chair thanks i do believe we see mr siegel back online and you missed your great introduction and you only get one introduction but if you're there we'd love to hear your testimony okay thank you thank you mr chairman ranking member hasson and members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to share a cohort's perspective regarding cyber security threats to state and local governments and small businesses my testimony today is derived from covert's role in cyber security incidents and the perspective that handling thousands of these incidents has given us over the years um before we could try and solve this problem after we founded the company we recognized that something was missing there's no clean data on being collected on these incidents the analogy that we use is you can't build safe cars without visiting crash sites measuring the skid marks and figuring out what happened so accordingly when we founded the company we set out to build a large data set on what actually happens during these attacks uh our interactions put us right in the middle of these incidents we work with forensic investigators privacy attorneys restoration firms cyber insurance companies and law enforcement branches of all kinds uh the data that's exhausted and collected from these incidents which spans thousands of unique incidents has given us a fresh perspective we use our data for three principal activities first we use it to contextualize these attacks for victims of these crimes so they can understand how comparable companies have worked their way through these issues second we aggregate these data findings and we try and publish our research so to raise awareness of the very common attack factors that these actors use and lastly we provide a large subset of our data to law enforcement very regularly it's all about their active investigations a typical ransomware attack involves three phases first is access now today almost all ransomware attacks are manually carried out that means that the threat actor is inside physically inside the network of the victim typically using stalin or harvested credentials the second is encryption where the attacker deploys an encryption program that locks up computer servers delete or encrypt backups as part of that process and the third is extortion um this is uh where if the company is not able to restore from backups uh they're forced with a difficult decision of either having to pay a ransom or rebuild their their network from scratch while it may seem stark this is the decision that hundreds of businesses face every single day so who are these criminals that carry out these attacks and what drives them after thousands of cases and much study i have a pretty clear picture of who carries out these attacks and why uh by and large the criminals that carry out ransomware attacks are financially motivated cyber extortion is their business in the manner that they conduct their business follows economic power laws they seek profits just like legitimate businesses and accordingly they follow strategies that maximize the outcome minimize the costs and increase the percentage of their attacks that they're able to monetize so why is cybercrime proliferating so rapidly following the economic theme we estimate that a given ransomware attack can earn a single cyber criminal tens of thousands of dollars with almost no risk and profit margins well in excess of 90 percent economics 101 dictates that the more accurate more activity will occur until the margins are driven down in this economy it is simply too profitable and too low risk to be ignored by would-be criminals additionally the cyber crime industry is innovative and aims to attract new participants thus lowering the barrier to entry for new criminals we've detailed in our written testimony and ransomware as a service case on technical uh the the opportunity to participate this combination of a highly profitable industry with low barriers to entry growing population of participants is the reason that these attacks are proliferating so much there are many ways to apply pressure to the economics of cyber crime we offer one that we feel would be effective means of curtailing activity when we look at our own data one stands out for gear quarter after quarter for the last two and a half years a vector called remote desktop protocol or rdb is consistently the most used by ransomware actors properly securing rdp is free all it requires is a bit of time and effort as an example of how effective closing this vulnerability can be invite a recently published study that we cited in our written testimony where groups set out to proactively reduce the number of rdp-based ransomware attacks that occur they contacted these companies after proactively sustaining their networks advised them of the vulnerability and work to patch this issue the resulting four month period shows 60 percent in rates for attacks across these organizations this is a free fix and all it took was a little bit of elbow grease while this recommendation is just one example we feel that there are further ways to attack the economics of cyber crime while proactive security new policy initiatives and relentless pursuit of these criminals by law enforcement will never have substitutes in this fight we think working big to small on reducing the profitability of cyber crime can produce immediate and material results thank you to the chairman and look forward to your questions thank you for your testimony and i'm going to turn it over for further questions thank you uh mr chair i do want to return to our witnesses uh with some follow-up questions and dr torres rodriguez i'd like to start with you uh you talked about the ransomware attack that the hartford school system experienced now that it has been a few months since the cyber attack can you please share with us what steps you've taken so far to try to prevent future attacks what lessons have you learned yeah so prior to the attack the city of hartford had invested uh you know five hundred thousand dollars upgrading the security system for metric hartford information services which is the shared services so that alone um you know helped us actually not have as a significant of an impact as as we would have had and since then a new endpoint security software called carbon black has also been implemented and installed in approximately four thousand of our devices and what carbon black does is to leverage predictive security and is designed to uh detect malicious behavior and and help prevent uh malicious files from attacking an organization and can also assist with rapid restoration which was you know one of our lessons learned of of critical infrastructure should an attack happen again in the future thank you um and i want to talk uh again to mr origi as well uh you mentioned in your testimony some of the uh critical need for information sharing can you please lay out for us your assessment of cyber threat information sharing between the federal government and hospitals across the country and between hospitals is it adequate or could there be could more be done to improve cyber threat information sharing yes thank you senator well i i think i would characterize it as greatly improved from compared to when um one of the functions that i ran at the fbi was to disseminate information as we were just understanding how vital that information sharing is it is i think in one area that it is has been improved has been the timely and actionable notices uh highlighting the october 28th notice for for that information to be declassified and come out so quickly i think is very commendable and to come out jointly by all three agencies very commendable however i think there still needs to be more improvement in terms of regular cadence of sharing of cyber threat information sharing it in a more automated and broad manner and also the sharing of classified information where possible to trusted health care contacts so um it has improved but i think we still have a long way to go thank you can you also give it give us because i understand that you work with hospitals across the country to help secure them from cyber threats so can you give us the typical profile of a hospital cyber security staff and how do small and rural hospitals differ in terms of cyber security professionals and resources as compared with major metropolitan hospitals for example yes it there is quite quite the range and spectrum of resources available in the profile varies widely generally from small to large urban centers generally smaller hospitals have less resources in terms of less financial human and technical resources to devote to cyber security in many instances these smaller more financially challenged hospitals add on cyber security as the duty to for instance the chief information officer or i.t director larger systems may have the luxury of having a very large staff some may have multi-state systems may have hundreds of people devoted to cyber security however they have vastly more complex systems and networks to protect and defend so varies widely what i can say is that almost all hospitals now highly prioritize cyber risk as an enterprise risk issue and are seeking to bolster their defenses but they do struggle under the reduced revenue that they're facing under as a result of covet 19. and is that reduced revenue the major impact that you've seen with covet 19 on this particular issue or are there other ways that covet 19 has affected for instance the staffing for hospital security cyber security well i think the reduced revenue uh has impacted staffing in the sense that the air certain hospitals may not have the financial resources to recruit and retain individuals we have not seen a direct impact on uh covet 19 reducing hospital cyber security staff although there have been scattered reports of just general reduction in staff but ultimately i think that the i think that the the staffing issue is a challenge for all sectors um quite frankly there is a zero unemployment rate for cyber security professionals and hospitals are competing not only with other hospitals to recruit retain but with other sectors in the government okay thank you um and i i know that the healthcare sector has an information sharing and analysis center or isac can you provide an assessment of how effective the health isac has been in assisting hospitals and what are its limitations particularly for small and rural hospitals the health isac i think has done a pretty good job of getting information out i know the folks over there good folks they do as i said a pretty good job some of the limitations may be in their reach because they are a member driven organization and they do require a membership fee now that fee is a sliding scale and uh and maybe fairly reasonable depending on the size of uh the organization um but again i think that the the issue there is the reach uh in timely dissemination often the hi sac relies on the government for the threat indicators as well so i think part of the mission of the hisac and the government going back to the scissor legislation of 2015 is to increase automated sharing of threat indicators so because the the ability to share human to human peer-to-peer is just too slow to keep up with the adversaries so i think there still needs to be quite a bit of work done there from both the government side and on the private sector side to increase that electronic bridge for cyber threat information sharing well thank you um i am i have a couple more questions but i understand that one of my colleagues senator cinema is uh online and and ready to ask her questions so senator cinema i'll recognize you for your round of questions oh thank you so much senator hassan and i want to say thank you to our witnesses for participating today you know even before this pandemic cyber security was a critical issue in arizona with ransomware attacks on arizona medical education and government organizations during the coronavirus pandemic as more people go online for school work and social interactions we've seen an increase in system vulnerabilities and cyber threats across the country and in arizona spending has also gone up as state local and tribal governments work to support their communities information technology needs as such federal cyber security support for state local and tribal entities during this pandemic is critical so today i'm going to direct my questions to mr ridgy medical devices with connectivity features are becoming more common in hospitals in recent years ransomware attacks on the medical community impacted not just hospital computers but also storage refrigerators as coronas virus vaccines are approved hospitals and health care systems across the country will be asked to accept shipments and store the vaccines under very precise conditions has the american hospital association and its members hospitals created sound strategies to protect storage refrigerators and other systems that will be part of the vaccine storage and distribution plan thank you senator um i think what we our general guidance has been on concern in terms of protecting all medical devices and to ensure that when they are in fact if they are in fact connected to networks that any potential vulnerabilities be identified and that they be network segmented we'll be closely monitoring uh the vaccine development and distribution and we will certainly offer guidance to the field on how to protect uh those refrigerated devices one of the main ways to protect them is to ensure that they are not network connected and that they um that if they are network connected to ensure that they are segmented and uh isolated from main networks and potential threats no thank you and in 2019 as you may or may not be aware wickenburg community hospital which is a hospital in rural arizona was hit by a ransomware attack wickenburg is a small nonprofit hospital serving a community of about 8 000 residents the hospital's four-person i.t staff did not contact the cyber criminals to hear their demands instead they began rebuilding the hospital's computer systems from scratch using data the hospital had backed up onto physical tapes so the attack happened on a friday and by monday the systems were almost fully functional again now wickenburg was unique for a small hospital in that it had an i.t team with the expertise to rebuild the system you mentioned constrained resources and shortage of qualified personnel as challenges to hiring qualified health i.t security experts what needs to be done to overcome these challenges and how can congress help thank you i think further incentives perhaps for uh to recruit and retain cyber security professionals to work in health care perhaps modeling other programs across government and tight uh offering incentives for health care professionals for doctors to work in rural areas perhaps we need something similar to that for cyber security professionals as i said unfortunately there is a zero unemployment rate for cyber security professionals increased training perhaps of folks displaced from other services increased training perhaps or retraining of veterans as cyber security professionals may also be another plausible route to staff some of these positions thank you the university of arizona medical school has studied the vulnerabilities of medical devices and they've invited doctors security experts and government agencies to simulate a cyber attack on an infusion pump a pacemaker and an insulin pump in 2017 so as you know medical devices are regulated by the fda for both safety and effectiveness so what discussions have occurred between your hospital members government regulators and device manufacturers to prioritize the medical device security needs we've we've been engaged quite a bit with the fda concerning both their pre-market and post-market guidance uh on cyber security to medical device manufacturers although this still remains guidance our position has been that we would like to see most of that if not all of it made mandatory so that the manufacturers would have to comply with some of the guidance involving security by design making sure those features are built in that a software bill of materials is provided by the manufacturer to the to the end user so they can understand what the potential vulnerabilities may be in there and also to provide lifetime support for the medical device especially in terms of security upgrades so we're constantly monitoring that one of the things we advise our hospitals and health systems is to ensure that there is adequate communication between clinical engineering staff in the information security staff as well to to keep an accurate inventory of medical devices identify vulnerabilities which may be present in those devices and ensure that they are network segmented and of course the most precious life-saving life support devices like ventilators are the ones that are most protected and segregated thank you oh thank you so much um madam chair i yield back the balance of my time and i want to thank mr ridgie for taking the time to talk to me about these concerns in arizona my pleasure thank you and thank you very much senator cinema and uh i have a couple of more questions and then uh assuming we don't have any other senators join us uh we will adjourn but i wanted to take the opportunity uh dr torres rodriguez to turn back to you to get more of a sense from you about the impact that the recent ransomware attack has had on your community as you discussed it delayed the start of the school year but can you share with us how teachers support staff parents and the rest of the community have been impacted by this cybersecurity attack and how has the pandemic exacerbated these effects yes in terms of the ongoing operational effect of of the attack shutting down functions and servers did have debilitating consequences for a number of departments uh for example we did not have access to our financial management software for 17 days so this costs uh delays in numerous financial processes including our supply orders year-end filing with with our state um requirements grant filings payroll among other operations and you know when i think about the broader implications the disruptions to our uh school district including that sudden delay to the first day of school after weeks of preparation um was uh disruptive to our families given that already as part of our mitigation efforts uh regarding uh you know our coveted mitigation we did have a staggered phased-in approach to return back to school and so it caused you know disruption and confusion there and the process of restoring well over 10 000 devices right laptops and desktops for both students teachers and support staff was tremendous it did require a heavy lift in terms of human capital and time which is you know why the the role of our i.t department and the connecticut national guard and even a third party technical support that we have to contract out for um because otherwise we could not have done it it would have taken you know additional weeks to start our school year and so during this time our teachers did struggle to deliver quality instruction to both the 10 000 students that were learning online at home as well as the 8 000 in their classrooms as part of the planning last spring and into the summer we did make the decision to become a one-to-one district meaning one device per each student uh meaning that every student would have a district-issued device but um you know there were over 2000 devices that were no longer available for our our students at the beginning of the school year because we have to prioritize um getting our teachers to have their devices to deliver the instruction and as i think about those early early weeks some of our students did not have access to learning and and we serve uh communities that have concentrated levels of need and so every minute every day uh matters to us in terms of having access to instruction and uh the other social and emotional supports that our students that our students need to have thank you very much that's very helpful um commissioner goulet i want to follow up on on this issue of k-12 schools with you can you give us your thoughts from the perspective of state governments on how best to protect k-12 schools and hospitals what role if any should state governments be playing um thank you senator um well this really is uh a great opportunity to highlight some examples of the whole state approach that that we advocate um you know when i i want to start by going back to a concept that senator rosen brought up earlier which was this concept of making our activities consumable by those folks we want to help so if you have a small staff school you can't throw sophisticated stuff at them you know for them to absorb and have to do so i know we've been working with the msi sac multi-state information sharing and analysis center on how we scale out some of their programs that were originally designed for state governments but we need to be tweaked to be absorbed by uh schools and local governments um so that's a that's one one area but i think it's really being collaborative involving these entities and planning for for example in new hampshire on the school side is it is really being involved in the rollout of the minimum standards for security privacy in schools which was enacted by the state legislature in new hampshire on the hospital side we did involve um you know local hospitals in our cyber disruption planning grant fund the dhs grant funded cyber disruption planning and so when we had heard what was going on up in vermont at ubn medical center we were able to reach out to cyber professionals i.t professionals in in the hospitals in new hampshire and find out you know what they were doing and whether they were preparing for or watching carefully to avoid this uh this cyber risk of ransomware in the hospital which of course is as you've heard is is horrendous so um those are some small examples there where and i think it really it's that collaborative whole state approach and what i use in uh often when i'm speaking to people and trying to bring them under the tent is there's no eye in cyber [Music] well thank you very much for that uh mr goulet and thank you for your continued work for the people of new hampshire um i have a short closing statement and then i'm going to go ahead uh at the chairman's request and adjourn the hearing um first of all i just want to thank chairman paul for working with me to organize this hearing and i particularly want to thank his staff adam and greg for their work in making this happen and again i want to thank all of our witnesses for their testimony today and for the role that you all play in helping to secure our nation from cyber attacks cyber security at the state and local level has never been more important and it is incumbent on all of us to work together to solve the unique challenges posed it's clear to me that state and local governments our k-12 schools and our nation's hospitals all need additional resources and support to be able to achieve their missions in the face of cyber attacks i look forward to working with our witnesses and members of the committee on potential solutions such as a standalone state and local cyber grant program and improved information sharing between the federal government and schools and hospitals again thank you all for joining us today our witnesses i know how busy you are at this challenging time and uh your contributions today make a world of difference and we're very very grateful seeing that there are no other members seeking recognition i'll thank our witnesses today again for their participation in this hearing the committee record will remain open until december 16th for members to submit statements and questions for the record and with that this subcommittee stands adjourned thank you all very much

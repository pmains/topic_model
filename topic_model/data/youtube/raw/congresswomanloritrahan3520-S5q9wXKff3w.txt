well good afternoon everyone and thank you for tuning in uh if you received my invitation to join us for today's discussion you probably read that i describe the moment we're living in as a crossroads in the fight against covid19 not just for our community or our commonwealth but for our entire country i say that because cases are increasing at an alarming rate last week was record-breaking and not in the good way this past saturday alone massachusetts reported 5 356 new confirmed cases more than tripled the number of cases from just 30 days ago we've now exceeded 250 000 cases of the virus in massachusetts at the same time we've also seen an alarming surge in hospitalizations in recent weeks which has prompted the governor to begin reopening field hospitals including one in worcester and another coming soon in lowell from november 1st to december 1st the number of people admitted to massachusetts hospitals has nearly tripled and as of yesterday more than 1500 covid 19 positive patients remain hospitalized with one in every five in an intensive care unit you know that means that our health care workers our nurses and doctors medical technicians and support staff who have been doing incredible work under unrelenting stress for months are now under even more pressure working around the clock to save lives their efforts have been nothing short of heroic many are working 12 18 24 hour long shifts and that's been going on since march they're feeling the effects of exhaustion and these discouraging numbers are not helping i can't emphasize enough how important it is that we support them not just through our earnest words of appreciation the signs in our front yards and even the additional relief that i proudly cast my vote for down in washington but also through our actions that we demonstrate each and every day it's my hope that our discussion this afternoon will serve as an important reminder to each of us of the simple things that we can do each day to keep our healthcare workers safe and able to keep doing their job so that's why i am i'm just thrilled i'm i have two incredible guests with me this afternoon who know firsthand what our frontline medical workers are going through and what we can do to help them our first guest is congressman raul ruiz who has been an invaluable voice in congress over the past nine months as we navigate this pandemic after congressman ruiz graduated from ucla he went on to become the first latino to receive three graduate degrees from harvard university including a doctor of medicine from harvard medical school a master's in public policy from the kennedy school and a master of public health from harvard school of public health after overachieving exactly after over achieving at harvard congressman ruiz completed his emergency medicine residency training at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine before becoming an emergency physician at a non-profit hospital in coachella valley district uh where you know he and his parents emigrated and now represents in the u.s congress you know i've gotten to know him as a true champion for our community health care centers services that are extraordinarily important to communities like lowell lawrence and and fitchburg now heading into his fifth term congressman ruiz sits on the powerful energy and commerce committee which has direct oversight on health care issues and as of yesterday i'm proud to also call him chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus chairman ruiz welcome thank you so much congresswoman this is such a privilege and an honor to be on this live facebook with you for your constituents you have been an incredible representative an incredible advocate and what makes you incredible is not only your intellect but also your compassion and your genuine uh caring and empathy during this pandemic and it's just been a pl a privilege and a pleasure to serve with you uh as you said i am an emergency medicine physician i practice in the emergency department during the h1n1 pandemic and led a lot of post pandemic vaccination campaigns in the hardest to reach areas including my home area of coachella and the coachella valley uh i grew up the son of farm workers living in a trailer park uh and so i know the conditions of poverty and high risk uh medical illnesses that are under in underserved areas uh precisely like the ones that are rendering people most at risk of dying and being infected in fact uh farmworker communities to this day are being ravaged and i've been personally rolling up my sleeves going out into the farmworker trailer parks and out into the homeless camps under bridges by the railroads to conduct covet 19 testing during this pandemic as a congressman i know boston i know lowell i know chelsea i know jamaica plains i know brookline i know cambridge because i spent a lot of years in in your area nine years in fact and uh practiced at the brigham for a short period where nurse katie murphy practices as well and so i that is my second life home is the boston area and i have such great affinity for your constituents and for the area we are entering the eye of the storm we are entering the last bloodiest battle of this war in this pandemic this is going to be the worst case of this pandemic for the next unfortunately about two months two to three months but we do see the light at the end of the tunnel not only because our therapeutics uh have improved and we have better we are better able to keep people alive and help them leave the hospital sooner with medications but also because we have some pretty effective vaccines that are right around the corner now i when i say right around the corner i mean first for the providers and seniors and long-term residents then people in about two to two months people with chronic illnesses and that work in gen in high risk essential jobs and then finally in about four or five months from now you're going to see the general public having access to them but don't forget that these vaccines require two doses uh around a month apart so all those time frames that i've given you just add a month and that's when you would start to see the effects of these vaccines for those populations so at least for for providers and high risk nursing home seniors uh you will start to see the effects of the vaccine uh in january early february uh so that uh so that that's when we're gonna start exiting this storm but it's still going to take time uh maybe mid to late next year where we're going to really start to take some breaths of of relief so thank you for that in fact our governor uh sort of unveiled the the plan for our vaccine distribution today so we'll definitely talk about that more but really just thank you for for being here today um raul i i have to introduce our second guest who she's just as amazing clocking in with some pretty outstanding credentials in her own right katie murphy is the president of the massachusetts nurses association the largest union and professional association of registered nurses and health professionals in the state representing more than 23 000 heroes working across 85 healthcare facilities and before being uh elected president earlier this year katie represented mna members on the board of directors for 10 years and she's just been a lifelong advocate for protecting nurses and health care workers katie brings with her decades of first-hand knowledge which includes her night job not her day job her night job as a registered nurse on the front lines of this pandemic at the brigham and women's hospital she graduated with an associate of science in nursing from vermont college a bachelor of science in nursing from boston university and a master of science in nursing from framingham state you all know how to make someone feel like an underachiever katie welcome uh so good to have you today thank you very much congresswoman trahan and at least i didn't have to follow anybody of any accomplishments so you know it is so important in our representative democracy to have people speaking for us in the halls of power from across the country california massachusetts speaking for us worrying about your constituents thinking about your constituents and then going and working for our constituents we know that it is especially for you congressman ruiz traveling across country leaving your family and you as well congresswoman trahan leaving your family and going to perform this public service it's critical it's how we make decisions it's how we choose how we live how we die and everything in between and having people of your your passion and your caring and your skills i think is reassuring to so many of us and i want to thank you for the work you're doing and you know just you know keep on keep on doing this very important work thank you for that uh i now i know that folks who have tuned in they're eager to hear what you all have to say so i'm just going to dive into some of the questions uh that we've received uh in anticipation of today's conversation so congressman ruiz this first question is for you uh as i mentioned earlier you were already uh an incredibly important voice for public health in our in our caucus well before covet 19 and and your expertise as a physician has only become more instrumental as we've worked to respond to this pandemic can you just tell us what you've been hearing from health care workers in your district and their advocates in washington about the struggles that they're facing right now well lori you know i spent time in the emergency department about a month a month and a half ago in order to get my cme credits uh katie i still have to get my cme credits to maintain my medical license and pass those tests and do all the the things i have to do as a doctor so i went to provide teaching for the residents uh and and uh educating attendings and others about healthcare policy and emergency medicine disaster relief and so i had a good opportunity to speak with them uh and we are on the phone constantly with the ceos of the hospitals with nurses groups and and others and i have friends who i work with who text me almost daily and uh indeed they we are seeing a such a rapid rise in hospitalizations i we have not reached the point of over capacity we have about less than 15 percent reserve in icus and that is expected to be depleted uh the biggest thing that i hear is a sense of frustration and anxiety of being burnt out of doing everything they can putting themselves at risk as well i mean they have to wear their masks etc but you know there's always an element of risk and they're tired they're tired and some of them are quarantining some of them have been infected we've you know so so they they need relief uh and it is more demoralizing when they see people who are flaunting uh not wearing precautions who are still angrily protesting uh and bringing doubt on wearing masks on physically distance of not heating all these precautions because you know the risk is not only the individual who refuses to wear a mask or angrily wants to congregate uh the risk is spread to others in nurses and families and neighbors and the doctors and nurse you know in the hospitals uh and so that's that that's what i'm hearing uh is this sense of uh the you know in about a week which would be two two weeks two three weeks post thanksgiving um they're gonna be really busy right and then and it's not gonna stop because we have the holidays we have christmas and so that's why this is gonna go on till january feb january maybe early february and so that's that's what i'm hearing from them uh is a desperate plea to the public to really wear a mask and follow all the precautions stay at home as much as possible uh and hopefully folks who are tuning in are receiving that you know message and we do our part to distribute uh that message it's so important that we do what we have control over i mean katie same thing you know day-to-day basis especially as cases continue to increase across the commonwealth what are you hearing from mna members and are nurses getting the ppe uh that they need you know it's it's thank you it's so interesting to hear congressman ruiz say exactly what we're hearing you know so really the situation is the same you know nurses and health care workers are seeing a level of death and suffering that we don't think anybody has seen in a hundred years and nurses and health care workers are feeling exactly the same way um exhausted often being the only ones in the room taking care of patients that you performing tasks that used to be taken care of by a whole team so now you know we need to minimize the people in the room for safety's sake and so you have one nurse in the room taking doing these uh activities and then at the end of life there's the nurse holding the ipad so the family of the patient and can see the patient and vice versa you know sometimes as they draw their last breath and so nurses are and health care workers you know i can't stress it's the entire team physicians respiratory therapists everybody who's been there are exhausted and they're frustrated they're very it's very interesting they're very frustrated at the lack of robust leadership at the national level that could have minimized this could have had had a a great a great impact and if we had only been prepared for the for the pandemic um we wish there had been a national response and we also feel concerned i know that i'm hearing from my members that every time the cdc um decreases the level of the standards for safety we feel that we're even more and more at risk you know as you know it used to be we'd wear one and 95 for an interaction with the patient and then toss it away and so every time the seed and we know that that's the scientific standard for care so nurses and health care workers are feeling like now you know in our eighth and ninth month we're really in even you know even in greater apparel and the ability to get high quality and 95s is very inconsistent um you know you had said that are we getting the ppe we need um it was very very challenging in the spring um there there wasn't enough people were reusing it you know we were writing people were writing their names and unit numbers on the n95s so they could be decontaminated decontaminated and returned back to us which um many people felt was was was very very dangerous and so um we wish that there had been again both a a response on the national level to address that you know a full implementation of the defense production act in march to you know address some of the shortages yeah the shortages don't seem to be quite as acute right now but it is just early december and i think congressman ruiz made such a good point we're not even two weeks post thanksgiving right and then we have the uh other winter holidays and um [Music] you know we we're still we still don't know how many are out there what's available you say you have some how many what are the numbers yeah yeah no there's there's no question there's been a flurry of uh legislation um that's been you know drafted and uh worked on uh to ensure that we never are that reliant on a foreign supply chain again that we actually have the capability here in the united states uh and you know i i uh led the pandemic production act which is modeled after the dpa but for a you know pandemic and takes some of that decision-making authority puts it in the hands of hhs so it's not politicized you know katie you brought up a great point you know the stress of dealing with the exhaustion the anxiety and the and the daily exposure to patients dying from this disease it's unimaginable uh to most of us you know wondering if you can speak to that and what m a has been doing to support nurses you know struggling with the mental wear and tear of this pandemic and and is there something that folks in our community uh could and should be doing to support them as well you know thank you um well you know we often have like very good teams at work and we we certainly do re rely on one another but you know from the very very beginning we have been um listening to what nurses are saying and taking those concerns and we've been writing actually a weekly letter to the governor and also including letters to the secretary of health and human services in massachusetts and the legislators to tell them what's going on on the front lines and how we feel that they can intervene you know we've been uh so that what we can so that we can protect our patients but also protect our caregivers if you don't have physicians and nurses if you don't have a robust robust team then patient care is going to suffer so we have been trying to let people know we've been sharing this you know in the media and on social media so that our members know how we're advocating for them on the state level uh you know every possible way and then when you were talking about um you know caring for the nurses we've actually been bringing in psychologists and therapists like really from the beginning to try and process some of the trauma and you know i'm you know i'm sure congressman ruiz and i'm sure you are as well congresswoman truhan in your communities you know seeing you know how you know some some parts of the population have been absolutely devastated and um being able to kind of process that has been i think um a goal of the m a to to reach out and have conversations and acknowledge this um moral distress that people are feeling yeah uh and yeah i know it's so important for um for folks in the healthcare community that know to know that we are like 100 supportive uh you know they are our frontline heroes right now and uh i know that what we can be doing is taking those precautions to ensure that we contain uh the spread but uh you know it's um you've seen a lot of uh beauty i think on the community level in terms of you know bringing meals to hospitals and just showing uh the appreciation uh for a job that is something you know like i said we can't imagine so congressman ruiz you and i both proudly cast our votes for hundreds of billions of dollars in aid to hospitals and community health centers across our country including in our respective districts and i know i've heard from hospital and health care administrators as well as from individual doctors and nurses about how more relief is needed but sadly that relief you has been stalled because we haven't had the partnership we need from the senate would you mind just talking a little bit about the la how about what the lack of additional relief has meant for hospitals and health centers in uh in your district well it seems like it's more of a comprehensive public health response or lack of that really hurts the providers and the nurses that work either in the clinics or in the emergency department's icu or throughout the hospitals you know the the front line workforce has been hurt uh they're limping right now for several reasons one of the first reasons is because as we had these sudden rapid um stay-at-home orders at the very beginning when we really didn't know uh much about this virus and it was really our epidemiological numbers and projections showed that it would have been very devastated if we could devastating if we would have continued life as usual some of those hospitals and those wards and those clinics also had it closed down uh and so that means that they didn't get the revenue that they needed so those practices those hospitals were hurting now some hospitals uh the emergency departments the icu's the the hospital floors were busy uh and so they were moving but but they're just a part of a larger health care system uh so that was difficult once those stay at homes were relieved people were still afraid to go see a doctor because they didn't want to take up space that they thought they didn't need or they they wanted they didn't want to expose themselves to other patients that might have copin 19 so a lot of the chronic illnesses uh a patient stayed home until they were severely sick and then they went to the emergency department and icu etc we've done a lot better job of reassuring the public that they still need to take care of their diabetes they need to take care of their heart issues their lung issues everything for health maintenance because in order to survive coven 19 they need to be at the best health possible and so we really want them to still see their cardiologists pulmonologists internist family physician etc and maintain all the routine health appointments that they can and all the hospitals and clinics have been have been retrofitted and have been sterilized and have been uh managing their workflow in addition to that you won't believe this lori but right now in the middle of the pandemic this administration and hhs and cms is going to go have a cross-the-board cut to reimbursements uh for all the um specialty physicians uh so that's not good uh and we're also dealing with a a an issue with surprise billing that would greatly um hurt physicians if we don't solve it the right way which is uh the discrepancy of insurance payments to the physician and nurses uh to have an independent uh arbitrator resolve that dis that difference and not just allow the uh insurance companies to set a low low payment uh benchmark that because that would be very devastating for hospitals and physicians as well so they are still under threat of even losing their revenue so we passed 175 billion dollars for the provider relief act that went to hospitals for their to pay their employees and nurses and went to doctors etc the heroes act that we passed had billions more for the providers including hazard pay to precisely deal with the traumas and anxieties that they are the highest risk essential job uh employees in our nation right now because they're actually taking care of patients who have cover 19 uh and uh but but of course we passed it in the house mitch mcconnell has not wanted to take it up in the senate uh and now we have other proposals but it's not only that lack of funding that goes directly through hospitals and nurses it's also the lack of funding for testing contact tracing incentivized quarantining because if we give the resources necessary for a containment phase and surge phase apparatus uh to decrease the transmission to decrease the patient load on our physicians and nurses then they decrease the risk of getting infected themselves decrease the risk of burnout decrease the risk of having post traumatic stress afterwards and overall it'll it'll be better you know my county is soon to run out of the cares money that we pass and we fought for we put care's money into into some states the county receives 500 uh a million out from those money and they're using it for mass for incentivized quarantining now which took a long time but now they are uh where they're using it for contact tracing testing etc and it's about uh it's that those funds are uh will not last forever so we really need this robust uh comprehensive aid package now that also includes stimulus monies that also includes unemployment insurance extension that also includes small business extension why because if you don't have support the families to keep the precautions to maintain staying at home for example uh and to be able to feed their family or incentivize quarantine and isolate if they can't if they are at high risk or get infected then it's just going to augment the patient load and the risk for providers yeah there's no look i grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck and you know if my if my father had ever been uh you know sick or or laid off i mean he would have gone back to work because what choice uh do people have when they uh are faced with having to feed and house their family right so it's so important that these direct disbursements this unemployment insurance you know be extended for uh families who are just really hurting and i'm going to stick on this topic because you know raoul i represent cities like lowell and lawrence and haverhill which have strong cambodian black and hispanic population struggling with that disproportionate impact kobe 15 has been having on communities of color across our country yes many of these uh folks are also our front line workers in our hospitals our community health centers our long-term care facility facilities and in our in our homes uh so and this both i'll you know we can just uh both jump in here but you know would you mind talking about the importance of keeping these disparities at the forefront of all of our policy decisions when it comes to supporting our our medical personnel and our support staff it is so vital so vital because if we don't then we are only delaying our recovery economic and and we're only uh delaying and minimizing our ability to safely get through this pandemic as quickly as possible you see it is because of underlying systemic inequalities in our health care system not only in resources within communities but also in in people who cannot afford health care or not have access that have rendered certain populations more at risk and that suffer more from cardiopulmonary diseases diabetes uh and other illnesses that now uh are the most at risk of dying from kova 19 furthermore the inequalities in housing rent render them living in substandard conditions and overcrowding and the jobs that they have are those essential uh workforce jobs where they cannot work at home they have to go into work and interface with other people uh it especially in the food production chain the farm workers the grocery store the meat packers etc and any manufacturing type jobs where they're where they don't have the space to keep their distance and set etc so in order to get through this pandemic we need to take a public health approach and in a pandemic it is a health equity approach meaning that those that are at highest risk of getting infected and those that are at highest risk of dying from cover 19 need to get the attention and the resources first and foremost uh and because if we don't this is the thing about pandemics if we don't eradicate and alleviate this this transmission and the surge from all communities then it is still going to be around and it will still transmit and therefore it will delay this pandemic as much as possible california has tied resources uh and the ability to to open businesses to uh the most vulnerable populations it's like an equity measure because sometimes what happens with these communities is that the pot the counties are so large but these pockets of very underserved very vulnerable communities are just being devastated so the overall county's uh ability to progress from a a more restrictive tier to a less restrictive tier is tied into their ability to address those most vulnerable populations and i think that's a smart idea because we can't just we can't leave our highest risk most vulnerable populations aside we just can't do that it's morally wrong and it's public health-wise it's wrong so i think and i think honestly also this population also suffers from a great deal of challenges from climate injustice as well easily they come from areas where they're exposed to dirtier air dirtier water dirtier land and this is having a huge impact i mean certainly i've seen that with my own population that i'm seeing that is being devastated by this so so this is a whole another aspect that you know fortunately there are two congress people here you know just pollution plain old pollution is devastating these communities as well and it has to be having um an effect on the re on what one be one of the aspects of why they are so terribly affected by this pandemic sure sure that's uh uh well i think that um at least in our caucus that message is uh brought to the forefront every single day uh one you know with the pandemic and our health care decisions and uh our priorities in the form of of budgets uh but also when you know we're talking about you know food insecurity and housing and you know our sick building and investing in our infrastructure in our school buildings and all of it is so uh it's so interconnected and when you were talking if i could just jump in again you're both talking about the stimulus package that you're working on in washington and people are hungry today mitch mcconnell people are hungry today they'll still be hungry in mid-january but they need to eat today they need to eat their feet they need to feed their families and so the we just need a robust package to uh perform exactly the actions that you're saying support our businesses so that people can stay home who need to stay home yet somehow we have to we have to feed our children and our elderly we just have to feed everybody in our community somebody was telling me that um it's somebody who's active in um food insecurity and just it was telling me the hundreds of pounds of food they're collecting to send to the food pantries i mean can you right if you're hungry then you're at greater risk for this pandemic yes and you know and we know uh we know what the cost is of of doing nothing uh we try to make that abundantly clear to mitch mcconnell but it means that 50 more 54 million people in our country are going to be food insecure uh you know what does that say about our country the the richest country in the history of the world it's just it's unacceptable and i know that we're running out of time and i'm so grateful that you're hanging in there with me i've got one last question for the both of you you know as work continues on additional relief packages both this week and as we prepare for the new administration what is it that you all uh see being absolutely necessary in order to get our doctors nurses our health care staff on the front lines of the uh the pandemic the support that they need to do their jobs as safely and as effectively as possible and um and you know anything else uh in terms of closing on policy that we uh that we can gear toward our hospitals and our and our health care workers heroes i'll go ahead and start i think we we need another robust funding like the provider relief assistance fund for hospitals and for doctors especially not only for their business we need to help them with hazard pay we also need to create a coordinated workforce so that when there is a kink in the front line in our defense against this when there are too many who have been quarantined or sick or people need to sleep our nurses need to sleep our doctors need to sleep and recuperate you know they have families they still have a lives and often many times just sleep in their garage when they're so stressed because they and because they're concerned that they're going to infect others in addition to that we need to help contain the virus before it gets to the hospital so we must have a robust contact tracing incentivized quarantining uh apparatus where individuals can actually stay quarantined we need to have good methodology for testing that works in our vulnerable populations like ones that go into the workplace into the underserved areas into the community to get tested and we have to develop a paraprofessional workforce that i call promotoras model or the community health worker much like was developed there uh with partners in health in massachusetts i used to work with partners in health in in in different communities uh internationally as well and so if you get people from the community who understand the patient the culture the neighborhood the resources and know how to finagle and hustle through uh those limited resources plus with caseworkers uh who are professional to get them incentivized care to manage their their uh illness uh to get them the aid that them and their family need to ensure they can go back to work and protect them that way and to find locations uh where they can be uh quarantined with assistance economically then we can get this done quickly and done right you know that's and you you really do bring your partners in health experience to you to your work every single day but you know what you're you're absolutely right um we include that in testing um when we are saying to everybody just please maintain the meticulous protocols that many of us have been masked at all times limit those social gatherings i had to tell my 93 year old mother she could not go to a party saturday night and we didn't have thanksgiving and people are going to be have much smaller groups at their hanukkah celebrations and at christmas don't go anywhere wear your mask hand sanitize and i agree with you testing that is that is so important but i think like having our national leaders i mean when i see them on television and um in the news wearing masks and appropriately physically distancing this sends a strong message it says you know we're your leaders you know we have the greatest scientific advice and this is what we're doing you know i think the um president-elect saying just wear a mask for a hundred days you know then you feel like it's kind of finite you think gee you know what i could do that i could do that so i mean i think that that kind of that kind of leadership could have a huge impact and i i would really hope that people would take it to heart and um and and really try and um put it into practice and i think what you're suggesting with your stimulus bill um if you know looking at every aspect of american life really says to the american people you matter you matter it doesn't matter in what state you live or how big your house is or how many apartments your building has you matter that's exactly right i can think of no better message uh to leave everyone with um and i know how busy you both are i want to be mindful of that so uh we'll let you get back to both of your very important day jobs uh but i have to just say thank you again for taking the time to be here i know that folks tuning in greatly appreciate your um one everything you're doing uh but also to hear your uh you know your unique perspective uh perspectives i also want to thank everybody who's watching right now you know whether you've had the opportunity to join us live or uh you're watching this later on your commitment to staying informed and staying healthy and doing your part to slow the spread of covet 19 has never been more important than it is right now you've heard how much our heroes are fighting to save lives in hospitals and health centers across massachusetts and across the country and they're relying on each of us to continue to do what's in our control wear a mask maintain a safe social distance wash our hands stay home don't have those informal gatherings in your home we've also heard about what kind of support is necessary from washington to ensure that our health care workers have the tools and the resources that they need to save lives while also keeping themselves safe so negotiation surrounding additional covert relief it's in progress and there's no question that the next aid package must absolutely prioritize another round of assistance for our nurses and our doctors and our support staff they deserve to know that their elected officials are looking out for them the same way that they've stepped up to heroically look after all of us during this pandemic so i'll keep fighting alongside chairman ruiz to make sure that we fulfill that obligation but i want to thank you all for taking the time to tune in and to thank you to our incredible guests stay healthy stay safe and be safe at home wonderful job thank you thank both of you and best of luck and stay safe and we appreciate the work you do every day thank you thank you this was a pleasure thank you so much thank you

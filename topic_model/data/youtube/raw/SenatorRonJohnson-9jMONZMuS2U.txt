all i can ask is the viewers to share this tell your friends i know this is long this is this is a five hour long panel and we didn't even scratch the surface of what we need to discuss this shouldn't have been necessary as our information grew as we became better and better educated less ignorant about the coronavirus cove the cobra vaccines this should have been made public every step along the way but it wasn't so again i'm just asking the viewing public to have an open mind respect these individuals who have paid a significant price professionally reputationally how many of you in this room recognizing that our doctors they're our phds they're are attorneys media experts other scientists public citizens how many of you personally have witnessed censorship intimidation or professional reprisal and damage as a result of your advocacy for patients i want this to be recorded that is eighty percent of this room have experienced something negative in their life in trying to promote and help compassionately something positive for patients suffering with a potentially fatal illness i'd like to start really quick with the story so a high risk individual approaches me uh 50 years old obese type 1 diabetic calls me i have covid this is about a year ago what do i do help help i'm going to the er my oxygen's 86 i have excruciating pain in my lungs so i said you're going to the pharmacy don't go to the er i called in some early treatment medications of the drugs which shall not be named said individual calls me a couple hours later says you know that excruciating 9 out of 10 lung pain it's now 2 out of 10 six hours later while i know the mechanisms of the medication i prescribed a few hours later in the next morning calls me says you know that oxygen saturation of 86 it's now 98 percent i said isn't that fantastic early treatment works that individual is my brother i am my brother's keeper this warning says fda cautions against the use of hydroxychloroquine and outpatients outside of the hospital setting but then in the justification it says we base this on information to treat hospitalized patients hospital disease as we'll hear and as we know from two years of dealing with covid is a completely different illness treated with different drugs different medications in the hospital outpatient disease is flu-like hospital disease is a fluoride pneumonia and so the fact that the fda would base recommendations and warnings on hospital disease which is a totally different disease than outpatient disease is a fraud this website is still there today and constitutes an outright fraud again i'll point out there's so much we don't know i would have liked to see a much larger dose of modesty coming out of our federal health officials and the legacy media and big tech when it came to we would we would be so much better off if if there was robust debate and discussion i have to say i'm gonna call it out and i'm known for this i call it like i see it i'm calling attention to the corruption if you look at these innumerable failed policies there's only one way to understand them they are literally written by pharmaceutical companies almost every single policy serves the interest of a pharmaceutical company however if you look outside the united states and look around the world there have been numerous successes as one of the world experts on ivermectin let me just talk about some programs which used ivermectin my colleagues here as dr risch just pointed out there are a number of compounds that we've identified that are effective in early treatment almost all of them are repurposed or generic but let me just say a few words about ivermectin and what it's doing around the world not in the united states in the united states it's a horse dewormer it's horse paced and only the illiterate ignorant and and or unvaccinated use it that medication has been shown to literally solve the pandemic in numerous regions around the world and as time went on they were told in no uncertain terms if you use these drugs you probably will be fired and nobody had to tell them they're smart people you don't have to draw a map is why is an ophthalmologist treating because patients were languishing at home and i've treated over 1600 patients because patients were languishing at home with no treatment for inflammation with no treatment for respiratory distress with no treatment for blood clotting it's absolutely absurd and i wasn't going to let it happen and i and i think as you see in this room all of us feel the same are african-americans are they denied early treatment in the community well yes they are my dad just died right he died friday couldn't get a test couldn't get monoclonal antibodies we treated him at home unfortunately we had an oxygen machine that didn't work so he blood saturation went down to the point where he was incoherent we called ems they said your problem is your oxygen machine doesn't work they put oxygen on him he went to 98 saturation we moved him to the hospital he recovered all his cognitive functions he was doing quite well but he was no longer getting medications that reduces inflammation he was no longer getting medications that blocked the histamine response he was no longer getting the medications that he needed and he was no longer getting you know lung steroids and he just declined and declined and declined until he passed away on friday and i say he passed away from lack of appropriate care so in the last six months i've really evolved into a early treatment advocate i've used a combination of medications and up until recently i was using monoclonal antibodies and sadly we can't get those anymore but you know i just hear so many stories at first it was you know my my pcp won't see me so they came to see me and ent i became the pcp uh now it's people are terrified to go to the hospital so i'm i've become the emergency room i'm giving high-dose iv steroids i'm giving you know 25 grams of iv vitamin c but i am keeping people out of the hospital and i've kept over 2000 people out of the hospital if you look at current statistics 20 of those people should be dead and they're not so and the turning point for me when i really got angry was a patient that heard his wife reached out to me trapped in the icu father of six sheriff's deputy refused to give anything but you know these these hospitals give them low dose steroids they give them six milligrams of dexamethasone you know three times a day a lot of these hospitals won't even give breathing treatments it's ridiculous they won't give them the vitamins i mean and so basically she called me in desperation and i testified she sued the hospital to try to get her husband the medications he needed i testified we won the hospital refused to grant me privileges even though i have a spotless record and i was furious because that's when it all changed for me and i became you know i became thrust into the public because of methodist hospital but um it's just you know we i've seen a lot and i'm angry and i'm exhausted i mean i have one hospital i can send patients to that i feel safe too some of those heart-wrenching stories i'm hearing where a loved one's in the hospital and they're the family's begging the hospital to do more trying to save the person's life and they're just being told now you're you know your loved one there's not much hope you know get ready for the worst and they just won't do anything so the question is why why have cheap safe and effective drugs been ignored for the treatment of covet 19 which could have saved maybe 500 000 lives and i think dr corey has told us exactly why i want to talk about medical ethics because i'm concerned that many of our pandemic policies have ignored foundational principles of medical ethics we effectively abandoned patients that were suffering from other conditions and had other medical needs the disastrous fruits of this myopia include an unprecedented 40 percent increase in all cause mortality among working age adults 18 to 64 over the last year most of which two thirds to three quarters depending on the state was not related to covid actuaries tell us that a 10 percent rise in all-cause mortality is a once in 200 year disaster this was a 40 rise in my opinion we should not have politicized the public health response to cyrus kobe 2 and kobet 19. this is a bipartisan issue and the physicians represented here are truly a bipartisan group i'm not although i've been characterized as a right-wing proud boy i've previously supported both president obama and president biden's campaigns but the course of events have forced me to rethink a lot of my positions and i think that's the case with many of my peers if i may quote in may of 1995 nelson mandela said there can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children in my opinion our public policies in managing this have had a particularly strong adverse effect on our children and vaccine mandates for our children are completely unjustified at this point so my friend called me a week ago he said watch this new movie it's called don't look up and i told him listen i don't need to look at this movie i've been in this movie for the last two years we have better treatments and we should be investing in in in research to continue to improve our treatments um and and strategies to make sure that we have treatments available everywhere where someone vulnerable especially gets sick if you put these strategies together our society can continue to function in a much more healthy way than we have functioned these past two years while at the same time working to protect older people the strategies we followed basically by ignoring the possibility of early treatment by not focusing our efforts on the protection of vulnerable populations and worst of all these restrictions on on on human behavior on human connection have reeked enormous damage and it's far past time that we stopped those policies and instead followed followed an alternate plan so dr brad acharya was joined by colleagues from harvard and from oxford and put together the great barrington declaration i'm pretty sure they published that in it was october 2020. we've since seen emails between dr collins and dr fauci head of nih and niaid basically with a concerted effort to destroy reputationally destroy dr barachari and his co-authors now i'll ask the listening audience did does that sound like a crazy individual sounds me like a highly qualified very reasonable person as we have in this we've assembled in this room one worry that public health officials have mentioned is well if we acknowledge that natural immunity is a reality um which of course it is and it's it's it's been it's epidemiology and immunology 101. they're worried that people would go out and deliberately get coveted rather than getting the vaccine but of course the the issue around acknowledging natural immunity is what about the people who already have had covet that's what we're talking about here right um and we can give people advice on you know avoiding infection and so forth but ignoring all the folks that have already recovered from kovid is not a good public health policy this acknowledging natural immunity would lead to the next uh very basic question how many people have it and the fact that two years into the pandemic we still do not know exactly how many americans have had covid is astoni it's an astonishing failure of public health to do basic epidemiological research the two most basic facts that every medical student learns first about every new illness that they learn about are incidents and prevalence how many new cases and how many total cases over a given period of time right one very important fact about natural immunity is that there has not been a single reported case of someone getting reinfected and subsequently transmitting the virus to others which we know is not the case for vaccines vaccines don't offer against covet that kind of sterilizing immunity so we foid the cdc and say please show us any evidence of someone with natural immunity getting reinfected and transmitting the virus to others they couldn't come up with any data we actually put that in our lawsuit the university's experts could not come up with a single counter-example it's a very dangerous thing to say right because almost nothing in medicine and science is 100 you can always find outliers but natural immunity people with natural immunity are the safest people to be around you're not going to get covered from somebody who's already had covid so we are seeing actually the vaccinated carry a high volume of virus because they don't have the secretory iga so this false construct from our federal agencies that this is a pandemic and the unvaccinated are spreading is a pathophysiological lie the vaccinated are carrying high volumes in their nose their tears their mouth a virus because the vaccine does not neutralize in that location of the body where the virus comes in so this is very important this is why mandates are absolutely now moot irrelevant and out the window and need to go away worldwide like most of the world has done already this is the funny uncle this is not sars kobe 2 kova 19. this is kobit 22 meh zero randomized controlled trials that show mass stop the spread of respiratory disease and that's including n95 and for everyone n stands for non-oil resistant 95 stands for 95 percent airborne particles of which all viruses fit through so i usually tell people that you know wearing an n95 also has not been shown in randomized controlled trials to be effective um but more importantly the the capsule on these viruses are an oil capsule and i tell people it's like peeing in a pool it goes right through it doesn't stick to water water molecules it it's an oil capsule virus at the end of the day the data is what it is there's zero repeat zero randomized controlled trials at all showing that mass stops better upper respiratory disease so so you've treated through telemedicine yes 100 150 000 covet patients yes sir yes with the team we have a team of volunteer free doctors that donate their time to help treat these patients that come to us they go to myfreedoctor.com and they answer our questionnaires we deliver the early treatment protocols to them as early as we can and we have a 99.99 survival rate so i believe myfreedoctor.com the volunteer free doctor team we have settled the science on this early treatment works period but the key answer is to find a a doctor who is going to treat you and then that doctor is going to be cognizant that a lot of his scripts will not be prescribed like i patients in virginia i treat them i have to figure out where i can get the relevant drugs and that often means independent pharmacists but these are crimes you know what's going on in this country right now is that the cdc has been captured by the pharmaceutical industry they sent out a memo in august of 2021 they sent out a similar memo back in the spring of 2020 telling the nation's physicians and pharmacists not to use generic medicines we are now in a state in this country where senator johnson asked the question how can we get the average u.s citizen to treat or get treated we have pharmacists across the land who are refusing to fill these because they've been manipulated and brainwashed into thinking that it that the fda hasn't approved the use as if that matters off-label prescriptions and prescribing has been going on for decades it's encouraged when there are no effective treatments yet i have to when i try to treat uh my patients and dr marble can attest to this we have pharmacists who refuse to fill some of the safest and low-cost medicines known in the history of medicine all the different drugs that there have been some research on and what was interesting about this chart is dr corey circled the ones that are recommended by our health agencies they all range from 700 bucks up to 3200 all the ones that are not recommended are the ones that are you know a couple bucks go figure i've lost a third of my business because insurance con contracts have pulled away from me for unprofessional conduct for using these dangerous drugs ivermectin for the which my patients have had no adverse reactions i've treated 500 000 patients are diagnosed 500 000 patients diagnostically in my career i have not had one single complaint against me i have four complaints against licenses in four different states for saving lives so the adverse reaction from these drugs is being attacked for being a good doctor that's the bad adverse reaction and i know many of my colleagues on this panel as well and i can tell you 201 the patients that i've lost it's because we've gotten a late start on early treatment i've recently published a paper with fazio and colleagues from italy we have shown the golden window to treat covet 19 is the first 72 hours and the patients that i have lost and they've been very few but if if people listen to this out here they will recognize that it's a late start at treatment that is in a sense the failure of early treatment if we start early we have uniform successes i've reviewed hundreds and hundreds of reports of hospitalized patients and of those who've died of covet 19 and in those reports the clear observation is the determinants of hospitalization and death are the lack of early treatment i am completely agnostic when it comes to whatever drug will end this pandemic vaccine whatever i don't care i want this pandemic over i want people to live we also had the wrong bodies leading the vaccine program remember the fda is supposed to be the safety watchdog the national institutes of health is the government research body and the cdc is the outbreak investigation body right now the cdc and the fda are the named sponsors of a vaccine program if american can learn anything we should never have the fda and cdc be a sponsor of a public program in administering a product it has been a giant and colossal mistake we should have had a separate body a government body be the sponsor of the vaccine program the vaccine manufacturers can supply the products and then we needed the separate data safety monitoring board clinical event committee and human ethics committee there in oversight and if this would have happened based on the emergence of unexplained deaths i am testifying today that the program would have been shut down in february because of excess mortality they will attack you they will threaten you they will put you in a state of fear and say you can only do what we say but don't save a life and by the way the vaccines are expired because omicron is here and now they still want to mandate them so they threaten us and threaten us and threaten us and we're hunted for caring and being compassionate and empathetic and wanting to help humanity is it you know logical to think that if you've been harmed by the first dose then you shouldn't get a second dose and if you get the second dose in you're harmed with a booster potentially do more harm and if you were on the seventh booster would that potentially cause more harm of course you don't have to be a physician to know the answer to that question a four-year-old knows the answer to that question yeah and i just want to partner off of what dr mccullough said i don't think people realize that all these people who had covert were excluded from the trials all of them so we're going to take our five to 11 year olds that there's 28 million that means 14 it was about half and half it's probably more 60 percent have had coveted already so let's say 12 million have had not have coveted so if those 12 million had the vaccine and it was a perfect vaccine it's 0.1 per 100 000 myself 12 children what's going to happen to the 16 children 16 million children who haven't who've already had the virus who already have immunity and we're going to subject them to something that wasn't even tested in that group it's literally absurd and that's the thing i would say senator is that it's we're not here about civil liberties and mandates we're here to save lives and this group of people should be excluded absolutely there's an achilles heel to the program of natural immunity natural immunity denial should not be happening it should be a major focus of what we're trying to do here because you're going to harm i don't know how many children by force vaccinating 16 million children it's absurd i'm listening to my colleagues call out all of the inanities the insanities the absurdities okay these departures of our policies from what we know are to be scientific truths these things like denial of natural immunity we have to understand why to sit here and point fingers and they're doing this wrong and that wrong why are they doing this there could be multiple reasons the simplest and most easily understandable and provable is every vaccine every these these you know these novel patented high-cost drugs is profits they're putting profits ahead of patients you know we can call attention to all of these policies they are non-scientific they are they're failing at having scientific support yet they're being carrying out and they're being distributed across the country and and doctors and states and health departments are willingly accepting these without question without critical thinking and that's what i want us to be clear that we're calling attention to today this is corruption plain and simple it's corruption why are they vaccinating our children because once it's on the vaccine once it's on the childhood schedule they are no longer liable for injury so they're going to get off that eua put it right on the childhood vaccine schedule and then have no liability going forward i'll have to tell you read you a quick little news story out of vietnam just got this today a ninth grader in the northern province of futo died tuesday after getting her second pfizer vaccine dose the local medical center said thursday the girl had gotten her first pfizer dose on december 3rd 2021 after which she experienced dizziness and had difficulty breathing she was taken to a medical center for treatment and later recovered she had her second dose last monday her mother told healthcare workers about the girl's side effects following her first shot but they asked her to get the second shot anyway again this is a ninth grader he doesn't have much risk from covid reaction to the first dose but let's give it a second dose anyway 20 minutes following the second shot the girl experienced tightness in her chest dizziness difficulty in breathing and seizures she received emergency treatment on the spot before being transferred to a district medical center on arrival she began to vomit blood fell into a coma and her heart stopped her family received news that she died tuesday morning now i guess this isn't evidence that a death might be related to the vaccine but it certainly would concern me more than it's concerned dr fauci dr lewinsky dr collins dr woodcock dr marks i know one of your favorites uh bran this is reality this is reality that's being ignored by our head by our federal health officials by the legacy media but every patient is a new textbook every patient is a unique human being that has unique factors that only we in the patient really understand with sufficient depth to make difficult medical judgments and this is the first time in my career i think the other clinical physicians in the in the room would agree where i've worried um about is somebody going to be looking over my shoulder asking me why i've prescribed fluvoxamine for this indication rather than that indication i prescribe it for depression no problem are you giving this to treat covet why should it matter to you um so it introduces so you're saying this is the first time in your ma in the last two years is that is that true the last two years now there's there are things that hospital administrators do that have annoyed physicians for years but the kind of hamstringing of physicians in terms of doing what we believe to be the right and best and good for this vulnerable patient in front of me right now that is my only responsibility as a physician this patient who has placed their trust in me as their physician to do what is best for them and not p not be acting as the agent of a social program or a state program or any other interest that could compromise so i can tell you what happened to me so i was using our protocol to treat critically ill patients in the icu with a whole host of repurposed drugs i then this is a memo this is a memo sent to the entire health care system but they targeted me personally and what did this memo say this said i can use rem deserve and then i will quote there is an added section do not endorse section which includes medications that may cause harm and efficacy is not supported in peer-reviewed published rcts these medications will not be verified or dispensed for the prevention or treatment of covert this list includes either mectin picalutamide etopsicide fluvoxamine dutesterite and finasteride and then just to stick it to me they added ascorbic acid otherwise known as system was effectively preventing me treating my patients according to my best clinical judgment and then how did this progress i objected so the first week i was in the icu i don't know what to do what was i to do my hands were tied as a clinician for the first time in my entire career i could not be a doctor i could not treat patients the way i had to be to treat patients i had seven covert patients including a 31 year old woman i was not allowed to treat these people i had to stand by idly i had to stand by idly watching these people die i then try to sue the system and you know what they did they did something called peer sham review it is a disgusting and evil concept they then accused me of seven most outrageous crimes that i had committed and that i was such a severe threat to the safety of patients they immediately suspended my hospital privileges because i possessed i posed such an outright threat to these patients ignoring the fact that under my care the mortality was 50 percent those of my colleagues i then went on through the sham peer review i went to a kangaroo court where they continued this and the end result was i lost my hospital privilege and was reported to the national practitioner databank so here i was standing up for patients rights and this hospital this evil hospital ended my medical career so that's what they do it's an outright outrage it's evil to the core you can use safe effective off-label drugs for other conditions outside covington absolutely if this was pneumococcal pneumonia this wouldn't be an issue this is specifically for covert i'm still a nurse but i was fired from houston methodist i'm the one you might have seen all over the news we were the first one mandated with the covet shot so i blew it up on the national media we have a huge state and federal lawsuit because we didn't want to be guinea pigs we saw for ourselves in the hospital people coming in with adverse reactions after getting the pfizer shot and the crazy thing is is let me tell you a couple things about methodist hospital down in houston texas when they first started with covid i did that coveted unit on and off the whole time till they fired me in june right they started the first two months with hydroxychloroquine they actually used it in the hospital then they cut it back real quick switched it to rem deserve and all these other expensive drugs and we're like why and we would ask these doctors no one could give us a reason they just said well the hospital policy changed but they didn't know why and you know most of those doctors in that hospital would not even go in those coveted rooms there was maybe two that would they would stand outside make us dress up head to toe and go in with an ipad so the only form of communication those doctors would have at houston methodist with the covid patients was through an ipad so literally we'd go in there they'd be talking to them never assess the lungs never look at them nothing go to discharge them i would come back out and be like no have you listened to them they can't breathe like the wheezing's horrible they had no clue for 80 of us are misdiagnosed with anxiety initially and then months down the road we get appropriate diagnoses and that's when we are able to find doctors that are actually willing to go against the directive because like these physicians were discussing their licenses have been threatened and because their licenses have been threatened we cannot get medical care they are afraid to treat us we have had patients who are severely injured and are dying who cannot get in the door to get seen by physicians because physicians are afraid of the word covid vaccine so instead what they're doing is they've made us like kyle warner and myself and our membership of over 12 000 coveted vaccine injured we are ground zero to take care of the covet vaccine injured when we have highly qualified practitioners across the globe that have been silenced and threatened if they even so much as see us for what's going on there is uh the father of a boy here in this room who's died of myocarditis one death is too many one one we have 21 000 cases of myocarditis and climbing in the united states that the cdc is verified one was too many under no circumstances under any circumstances should a young person ever receive one of these vaccines let alone ever be pressured to receive a vaccine let alone ever be mandated to take a vaccine this is crystal clear the fda agrees there can be no controversy over this we are seeing unprecedented numbers of athletes dying on the field in europe unprecedented of these cardiac arrests half of them don't come back we now have a report out of the heart group in the uk where actuarial mortality for those under age 15 mortality in the uk is higher than expected and i am concerned about our children i'm concerned about all of those effects brain heart blood coagulation reproductive system immunologic system and furthermore they're not at risk for this virus why are we doing this in in mandating these vaccines for children just breaks my heart this is this is what we get when i investigate i mean this isn't to do with this but this is after a couple years trying to get information out of another agency and we finally get the information and it's all redacted this is this how the the administration you know the federal government the agencies comply with congressional oversight work this dose that was tested in a major trial which made corticosteroids the standard of care worldwide and i also want to i also want to give praise to senator johnson you know senator johnson invited me to give testimony in the senate in may of 2020 and i remember my first conversation with him when he reached out he was so he was so um enthusiastic about hearing about the work that dr merrick and myself were doing that we were putting out protocols and we were trying to treat this disease you know and he said he couldn't understand why the system wasn't reacting why the entire system wasn't reacting the way we were and i remember he told me he was you know i want the doctors to take their gloves off and they're not they were sitting idly by the bedside institutions were paralyzed waiting for randomized controlled trials to be done and then finally a randomized control and so and at that time i testified to the world that corticosteroids were critical in the treatment of this disease nothing happened until a trial came out eight weeks later and proved the life-saving properties of corticosteroids but that dose that was tested was ridiculous it was the lowest dose and the dose that's being used helps the few and fails the many i want to personally thank you in the past medical schools and conferences would like this would take place we debate uh how to treat these kind of diseases and you know i it's kind of strange that we this meeting has to take place in the u.s senate um you know given the current state of affairs um that's what's where we are but in the past we would think that somehow the fda the cdc the nih we would have basically maybe a message board exchange ideas and i really want to reach out and say thank you for what you've done to dr mccullough and dr risch who initially uh set all this up um you know the extreme censorships and attacks have have led us to come to this place and so i want to just thank you for what you've done um you've really pushed this all forward you know as a you know you've been yourself become a researcher and a scientist over those last two years so thank you very much uh these are highly qualified individuals they speak from experience we've got to fix this problem we can't let this continue we can't let it happen in the future so again thank all of you for coming thank you for being doctors for being nurses for being accommodations for being medical researchers and thank all of you for viewing this share this with your friends god bless you all

thank you madam chairwoman i'm proud to lead our co-lead this important legislation with my colleague congressman the goose we've seen many examples of cyber attacks on the u.s government that reveal weaknesses in our it systems one of those weaknesses exists in the software products purchased by our federal agencies these agencies these agencies operations rely on global supply chains for goods and services but this makes them increasingly vulnerable to threats for malicious criminal actors foreign nations and other adversaries in the aftermath of such cyber attacks these major cyber attacks we've seen such as the one that targeted solar winds the committee must pursue avenue avenues to exercise robust oversight of agency supply chain security h.r 5962 aims to ensure the federal workforce understand supply chain risks and associated policies the bill tests the general services administration with developing a training program which will then be issued government-wide by the office of management budget it will prepare federal personnel to identify and mitigate security risks throughout the acquisition life cycle of products and services including information and communications technology this soft this program should help our federal agencies avoid purchasing software products vulnerable to malware the bill also requires gsa to coordinate with the existing federal acquisition security council an interagency council established by the 2018 secure technology act to develop policies and procedures addressing federal supply chain security risks relatedly h.r 6497 the fisma modernization act of 2022 which we also addressed previously in the committee today recognizes the central role the federal acquisition security council and supply chain issues have in federal cyber security by extending the council's authorization through 2031. i'm a proud co-sponsor of chairman maloney and ranking member commerce fisma reform bill despite existing work to address federal supply chain risk management there's currently no federal workforce training requirement to ensure these policies are properly and consistently implemented the national security stakes are too high to leave such a strategic gap in our federal defenses and h.r 5962 addresses the security gap with education and training i appreciate congressman the goose's leadership on this issue and i look forward to seeing the supply chain security training act advanced through congress i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill and i yield back

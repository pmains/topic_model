I learned very quickly that the longest distance between two points was my dad's shortcut because we never seem to get to wherever it was we were supposed to be going to I can tell you this a lot of people think that Vermont is a French Canadian word that means Green Mountains but after a lot of research i found out that Vermont is actually an old old Abenaki Indian word and it means windy roads with no rest stops when you've got eight kids in the car and a dog named mr. bean's it's inevitable that mother nature will come to make her call and it was just as inevitable my dad would not stop to answer that call so you can see the predicament but my mom as moms were and those olden days was always prepared and she reached into a giant huge haka book and she pulled out an empty Maxwell House coffee can this she would pass to the back seat usually to my brother Michael my brother Michael couldn't hit the broad side of a barn but for some reason he had no trouble hitting me so we're gonna try this next little tune it's called the Sunday Drive let me get situated all right hi you ready we had an old Ford was a rattletrap painted green and white yeah like with house paint every Sunday after nine o'clock mask my father take the car he'd go fill it up with some gas he would pile us in and flip on the radio turn the key and on down the road we go we were taking ride sunday died in the station wagon taken rise Sunday dive in the station wagon now in the summer we go searching for secret swimming holes dressed in calm jeans eating leftover casserole someone would always ask we almost there yet I got really bad and I hold it I win the wave every day expand across frozen lately slip n slide giant snow snake slippery side I look spinning round and round like an old song circa we were taking a ride a Sunday Drive in the station wagon taking a ride so plaguy news station where well my mother would bring this enormous purse containing all things known strings you would burst it was a portable shopping mall with a shoulder strap and it barely fit in that old Ford rattletrap my father would get lost that went without question to this day he still has a master directions somehow he always made it home okay god works in mysterious ways when you're ten or I'll Sunday guy in the station wagon taken around a Sunday Drive in the station way now every Sunday after nine o'clock mass I take my car and I go fill it up with some expensive gas and I pile in my tribe I call him the great unwashed and I say don't worry kids I never get lost and we'll take an around a Sun daytime station way you can praise the Saints if we make it home alive the station way and you know I can still hear my father saying all right pipe down max understand it's not fighting with you brother don't make me stop this guy

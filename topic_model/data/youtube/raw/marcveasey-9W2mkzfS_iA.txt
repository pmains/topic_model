joining us right now Democratic congressman mark BC of Texas congressman thanks for being here okay Al Green a fellow Texan filing articles of impeachment he says it's not about obstruction of justice it's about racism and he says he expects a vote in the House today is that going to happen it's unsure whether that's going to happen or not I believe that under house rules of course he can bring certain you know privileged motions to the House floor but what I will tell you is that there have been lots of different presidents over the course of history that have been racist I mean you know you think about the white eisenhower literally when he brought Chief Justice Warren to the White House during Brown versus Board of Education and told Brent and told Justice Warren later in the evening that southern southerners were typically good people they just said what their daughter sitting next to black in classroom so you know racism in the White House is nothing new the question no reason to impeach a president a I'm saying that the white there that that is it's not new it's been around a long time we've had lots of racist presidents I don't think that I think that that members of Congress want to know if this president obstructed obstructed justice and of course we're going to have Mueller here soon to be able to answer those questions are you going to if this comes for a vote are you gonna vote for it if this comes for votes you know obviously I'm going to you know have to weigh all of my votes like I do right before I get on to the House floor I look at all the facts and make a decision and we'll do so at that time you don't think this is the right time to be voting on impeaching the president I do not think that this is the right time to be voting on impeaching the president we have a process we want to make sure that this is not seen as political if it's seen as political it's going to backfire and it's only going to favor President Trump and we don't want that right now we need this guy out of office come January the 20th 2021 this does not need to be seen as a political process we need to listen to what Mueller has to say next week and move forward from there congressman you're on the whip Timur you're gonna be whipping against this since you don't think this is the right time I'm on the whip team and so again I haven't gotten any instructions from our chief whip our head whip Jim Clyburn as soon as I get instructions from his office on whatever we're working on I'm going to be happy to wait for it whether it's this or another piece of legislation that we're working on but are you still considering whether or not because look if you're asked to vote on this you're faced with a real question you're going to be like you would be forced to be on the record on impeaching the president on the grounds of well let's say Al Green says it's on the grounds of his racist remarks which side of this one you're going to be on if that's what you're faced with tonight you know again we'll see how you know you never know how something is going to be work once it actually makes it to the House floor I've not had an opportunity to read anything that representative green has put into writing of course you know him being a fellow Texan whatever he does submit I know that that he's taking it very seriously and that he's put a lot of thought into it and I'll and I'll read it and I'll go through it and I'll make my decision when we come on to the House floor on the president's attacks and the impact that they are really having my colleague Randi Kaye sat down with eight Republican women in Dallas part of your part of Dallas is your district yeah absolutely they told her that they don't see anything wrong with what the president said about the for democratic congresswoman let me play you some of this please he was saying that if they hate America so much because what we're seeing out of them and hearing out of them they hate America if it's so bad there's a lot of places they can go I'm a brown skinned woman I am illegal immigrants I agree with you everything that's racist to say not at all actually I think I just know it's a demonstration of how their ideology spills over even though they're American now so to speak they're not acting American look Congre I don't know if these are votes that are ever get a bowl for a Democrat and that group of Republican women that we're sitting there but they're not being convinced by what Democrats are saying on this what does that mean for Democrats heading into your reelection oh look you know I actually had an opportunity to watch that entire segment this morning and I will tell you that that first of all didn't surprise me at all I mean that's the story of my life as a black person growing up in Fort Worth Texas not too far from Dallas where those women live you know oftentimes because people forget I mean I'm a gen Xer I'm in my 40s Gen Xers we were the first generation of kids to go K through 12 in the Dallas Independent School District Wirthlin dependents school district which I went through we were the first kids to actually go through that school system completely integrated K through 12 and oftentimes in school kids would use the N word over and over again and they would always say oh it's not that big of a deal you're just overreacting you're being too sensitive you guys call each other that all the time anyway and so the fact that those women are basically repeating what I heard in school is not that big of a of a surprise to me first of all I mean that that's actually pretty normal thought amongst a lot of white people in the dallas-fort Worth area I don't want to generalize than everybody but for a lot of people that is that you you would hear that at any social setting so do we have our do we have at up a very tough battle to win back the white house it's always tough to beat an incumbent but what I will tell you is that if you look at the 2018 election results and you look at how we're doing and some of these battleground states right now that are going to be key to us getting those 270 electoral votes that I think that we're going to need in order to win back the white house I think that we're going to have a good Canada that's going to have a good unifying message to beat Donald Trump and I can tell you you know I know that CNN that likes to focus on a lot of things that activists and what-have-you are saying out there and things that you that you guys hear on Twitter but if you come to Fort Worth Texas or you go to Dallas or Irving Texas other cities that I represent in the 33rd congressional district the average guy that's putting seats in a car at General Motors plant over in Arlington or woman working at a cafe in the Metroplex that will tell you that they just want this guy gone and we have that working at our advantage and we're gonna take full make full use of it well first and foremost there's an opportunity to move that process along maybe today let's see what happens in the house with if the vote does happen with articles of impeachment Congress

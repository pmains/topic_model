we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw hey folks welcome back and uh today we are going to continue to the discussion on military whistleblowers got a great guess to really talk about that today i think this would be uh one of our best whistleblowers uh his name is lieutenant colonel matthew lomeyer you may remember this story back in may when you heard of a space force commander being fired for speaking out against marxism so uh i'm gonna go with matt matt uh thanks for being on and sharing your story thanks congressman i appreciate it and um let's let's tease out that story let's unpack that a little bit so you you had just taken over command and as the story goes as the public knows it all of a sudden you're fired just for speaking out against marxism is that oversimplifying it i mean what what what really happened here well first off i'm always saying this in every interview or podcast that i do these are my views not those of the defense department of course but uh you're you're right i took command a year ago it was july of 2020 as your listeners would recall that was in the aftermath of the george floyd death there were still riots taking place in the country and of course there was a lot of you could call it social related social issues related dialogue throughout the country and a vision that was occurring and i came into command at that point in time and the covet pandemic was also a new thing for us that we were sorting out as a country and there were a lot of crises and issues over which i think people could get emotionally involved and divided but that's the climate into which i come into command take command of the space-based missile warning unit and uh one of the things that i do right after i take command is i scheduled an interview with every member of my unit so that i could have a one-on-one dialogue with folks learn where they're from what their background is how long they've been at the base and any stressors they might be experiencing and because it was a tough climate i was interested in kind of taking some really good notes on on folks that i was sitting down with what that turned into is me starting to learn about um some tension that was being generated at the ground level based on trainings that were occurring that i walked into or stepped into in command when i came in july that i began to pay very close attention to from that point forward those trainings are labeled diversity and inclusion trainings uh most often sometimes we had down days uh or or virtual wing man days as we would call them to discuss issues of race in the country um and it was from there that i began to branch out and and reach out to other friends who were in command elsewhere uh friends who were serving at different bases around the world to ask if they were noticing some of the same divisive tension that was occurring uh at my own base that they're at their bases as well and uh you know every base is a little bit unique but there was a common thread that i began to pull on and it was that there was a lot of emotion and division that was starting to appear and military speak we refer to that as the undermining of good order and discipline or uh it was beginning to impact morale and so that's when i come into command it's july and that's kind of the setting and that's when i start to pay very close attention to issues that i had studied for a long time but didn't really appreciate until july and august of last year were actually starting to really dramatically affect the culture of our armed forces so but how does that lead into into being relieved of command um is it because of the book that came out yeah that's the question you asked i guess and i i was starting back there and forgot to go to where you asked so because of what i was seeing and this is the important point that i was actually wanting to make i did my best to delicately use the chain of command at first the internal mechanisms available to all service members to point out my concern that our incessant focus on race discussions was starting to be quite divisive and i when i say i use my chain of command i use the chain of command like from my immediate supervisor on up and uh when i felt like that wasn't getting much now my leaders to be clear were sympathetic to the issue and they listen carefully they're good leaders in so many ways and so i'm not denigrating the leaders they they listen carefully president trump in september of last year came out with an executive order banning uh race and sex stereotyping it was an executive order issued on the 22nd of september and after that executive order came out there was a sigh of relief that was essentially briefed by many service members that i've been talking to thinking okay this is gonna simmer down a little bit and i think in many ways it did however one thing that i noticed was that there were base leadership sanctioned discussions that were continuing to occur they were not base wide down days let's say but they were reading clubs that were beginning to be established and advertised by base leadership encouraging people to show up and discuss books like idioma or luoz so you want to talk about race which talks about the white supremacist united states denigrates the constitution and the declaration of independence and demonizes people based on the race specifically whites and so i attended a training discussing that book not only does it do that it was exceptionally partisan because it recommended to these young impressionable service members to which organizations they should be donating their free money wow uh organizations that have a very specific political bent as you can imagine and so with that happening still even after the executive order i filed a formal complaint with the inspector general's office of the space force detailing not only some of the issues specifically which i do detail specifically but also pointing out that it was in violation of an executive order from the commander-in-chief yeah also pointing out that it was rooted in critical race theory and talk about just how dangerous that was and uh i can't pretend to understand following the filing of a formal complaint exactly the conversation that takes place behind the scenes uh so i won't i won't insist that one thing did or did not happen any particular way but what i can say is that after several months of waiting for a response the response came back once the writing was on the wall and we saw it was very seemed to me it seemed to me very politically charged the decision there was an acknowledgement of receipt of my complaint and the appropriate action had been taken and then the new administration came in and it was all around that same time it was actually the day after the january sixth insurrection so-called that i got a response saying that uh that my complaint had been taken care of uh and when i when i saw that um just how politically charged all of this is and uh then you know the current administration for example this isn't a criticism i'm stating a matter of fact but uh repealed or i should say abolished that executive order by executive order that president trump had issued on 22 september and essentially came up with a new policy that allowed for critical race theory based diversity and inclusion trainings to begin thriving uh in our in our defense department and i just sense that there's not going to be any end to this anytime soon we're going to continue to see division in the ranks unless we draw greater attention to this problem and have a really high level dialogue about this and so uh with that motive essentially and and understanding just how dangerous the path is that we're walking on a this identity politics path that's rooted in marxism i was feverishly scribbling out a book in my free time which isn't much as a commander and uh secretary of defense invited all service members to draw attention to extremism when they saw it within the ranks and that was kind of a that was the last uh encouragement nudge i needed uh in addition to counseling with public affairs and legal before i published the book but that it was important for me to publish the work and so i published the work in may uh it was publicly available on the 10th and i was fired on the 14th and i was and my book was not cited as a reason for being relieved of command a podcast that i had done with todd wood at cd media was cited and it was alleged that i was politically partisan while acting in an official capacity and that's the reason i was being fired and um i deny that to the state i wasn't acting in an official capacity and i'm not interested in partisan politics being in armed forces i'm in fact i don't care what people's politics are what i what i want to see as a non-political military institution that allows people regardless of their politics have a welcoming environment we're always talking about inclusion and yet there's a lot of people feeling not included at the moment depending on what their political persuasion is so yeah that's that's the finally the answer to your question yeah yeah uh yeah it's good to unpack that um it does seem to me in in as we've looked at through these some of the more egregious sort of woke whistleblower whistleblower complaints they overwhelmingly come from the air force i mean so what the hell is going on in the air force in particular um they already screwed up by not putting navy ranks in the space force uh because that would have been the obvious choice for the rank structure and i don't see i'm sorry but lieutenant colonel shouldn't be manning a spacecraft it should be captain it should be the captain of the ship but uh hey you know that's a space lord space or a space lord or something instead of guardians it should have been space lords that would have been better uh that was actually an amendment that passed the house to make the space force use navy ranks but it couldn't get through the senate because air force generals were uh were all upset about it and all of our boring senators wouldn't fight for it so i'm really don't worry it'll be in the next ndia and uh the american people will get their way eventually uh there's a long history in american pop culture of space force having navy rank structure spaceballs star wars star trek it's it's deeply ingrained in american culture you can't escape that um but anyway the more serious notes although that i think that is pretty serious uh why why the air force i mean why do i keep hearing all of this woke stuff come from the air force it's not like it's only the air force but it's overwhelmingly in the air force well that's news to me actually um now so i can't answer that question specifically in fact since being relieved of command and being on podcasts and doing shows and things uh it's it's only been since then that i've become overwhelmingly aware of this issue across the services and not just in the air force in fact and when i wrote my book while i while i traced through at the latter end of my book um examples from all of the major service academies of this kind of think permeating our service academies our military institutions uh i didn't really have a good picture that this was in fact something that was uh what i'll use the term systemic across all the services and a good example of this is a book that i've just started reading a little more carefully and it's ibrahim kennedy's book how to be an anti-racist uh kenny's book is on the navy's reading list for example now it's one thing to learn about critical race theory marxism history of all bents you know read my comp read mao zutang read you know these are important things to understand and grapple with because we have we have a different ideology in america that is rooted in a very particular philosophy that all men are created equal and the individualism has has merit as a political ideology and it leads to greater outcomes and so learning is one thing it's a different thing altogether to infuse our institutions with the tenets and vocabulary right of the of the woke religion and this is what i've told them this is what i've told the chairman of the joint chiefs because he made this big defense of it uh in congress mistakenly so and you know trying to come up with this this reasoning like no no we're just teaching it so people understand it just like i read all of these other ideologies and it's like sorry but that's not what's happening okay he's he's making a point or he's he's countering a point that we aren't making because the reality is as you've seen is that these these teachings are being propagandized they're not just being taught for situational awareness yeah what for example to your point candy's book in the introduction uh denigrates the u.s constitution right right away i i i yeah and and it gives you a good flavor so not only does it denigrate the constitution it calls the constitution a colorblind or racist constitution for a white supremacist america uh but it also says that if you think you're not a racist now that's the key i mean you're stuck you're damned if you do damned if you don't right if you think you're not a racist then you are like and this is a direct quote the trumps and the other white supremacists of the world now when military leaders not mid leaders that's not what i meant to say when military service members are asked and this is an important point to have dialogue so called about touchy or politically charged or emotionally charged topics like race at the moment dialogue in and of itself isn't a bad thing in fact if it can be done respectfully it's a great thing it's part of the greatness of of america is the fact that we can have dialogue and not resort to violence let's say but the context however matters a great deal in which that dialogue is begun and so if the context is uh hey go watch these two videos first before you show up next friday to discuss race and those two videos happen to be very left leaning in their political bent and they demonize whites based on race and they insist that we have 400 years of white supremacy in this country uh and therefore the birth of the country is in 1619 and it's a push for the 1619 project i mean all of that context then creates an environment of at least hesitancy if not fear where service members then show up and they're all these are unique diverse individuals who have any number of thoughts about any number of topics but the precedent has been established for what the acceptable uh viewpoint is going to be coming into the dialogue and what the unacceptable viewpoint will be and therefore people don't speak up out of out of fear of retribution or being labeled something right and so that's what i've more than anything i think that's that's what i've seen happen in many of our trainings and discussions is that the context is awry and the context happens to be created by those who are not uh i'll put it more directly the context is is a parrot of of those uh narratives that have been created by enemies of this country people who hate the country and are trying to divide people deliberately and that's where i have that's where i i had to draw a line and say we have to talk about this very openly otherwise it will it will sneak its way in and it will take us unaware and it's so disingenuous right like because the the defenders of critical race theory you know because it's this is really blowing up in our school systems i mean parents are getting pissed and rightfully so and it's awesome to see um but the defenders of critical race theory say why do you why won't you teach about slavery in this country and it's like that is not the point that we're making at all there is not a single american that that that has grown up in the last 50 60 100 years that didn't grow up knowing everything all about slavery we do like learning the story of harriet tubman in elementary school these are the things that stick out to me you know of course we learned about it like stop lying to us you're trying to propagandize a totally different story of america this isn't about teaching history it's just it's an absolute lie so i want to ask you about marxism uh the book's called um an irresistible revolution i kind of like that title because that's what as a conservative that's sort of what we contend with right is this is the irresistible nature of socialism right because at first like many democrat ideas at first they seem to be nice and they at first it seems compassionate first it seems like you hold some sort of moral high ground if you would just feel this way and so i i saw the title and i like it but but maybe expand on that why you chose that title and why is marxism so irresistible yeah thanks it's actually a part of a quote when i first became aware and made a connection to some of the social activism that i was seeing across the country in the past calendar year with marxist ideology it was actually as best i can remember tied to my learning of an interview that was done with one of the founders of black lives matter movement patrice khan colors she did an interview in 2015 where she said that she was a trained marxist yep and she said that another one of the co-founders of the movement alicia garza was a trained marxist and so i looked into that and i uh verified that and learned about where they were where they learned to be trained organizers for example and then i went to the black lives matter website under the what we believe section and under that section it talk it used the the language of critical well it used marxist language which is which is where we get our critical schools of thought or the critical pedagogy and it talked about dismantling cisgender privilege it talked about disrupting western prescribed nuclear family structures it talked about the communal education of children so long as the parents are okay with that they've since changed the language and softened it quite a bit because it was getting a lot of flack but one of the i think she uh goes by they is the uh co-founder of the toronto black lives matter movement is a future khan i don't think that was a unintentional name choice future khan future khan says that the role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible it has to be a fata complete because the people that you're trying to cause to join the revolution have to buy into the causes of the revolution almost as a matter of uh they have to truly buy into a basic set of uh underlying assumptions or beliefs about reality in the world they live in if they're going to coalesce and revolutionize uh the country and i thought that was such an apt description of what organizations like black lives matter are trying to accomplish use compassionate language uh use the fact that you care about groups of people use words like freedom and liberty and justice because who doesn't like those things right and you get people to buy into these values but they're redefined values they're not just not racist they're anti-racist and that has a very particular meaning and so at once you're able to identify who is part a participant in the revolution and who is an enemy of the revolution depending on what language they use in their social circles or on their social media pages and so what i see in our military's diversity and inclusion trainings unfortunately so often was the language of the revolutionary and we didn't know it i think a lot of us did this unwittingly but when we talk about dismantling things we talk about privilege and we talk about unconscious and implicit biases that we have to rid and systemic racism within the services that starts to over time create a a new culture by and by because people start to change their their belief system that changes their purpose and their values that they adopt uh and here's the dangerous part there are many people that will never buy into that and so the force is fractured and they start to be very skeptical of one another and and um that has to be undone if we're going to have good order and discipline yeah it is strange how it infiltrates it's very frustrating for conservatives to contend with because it's it feels so organic right it's like it's you're contending with this almost religious like movement that speaks a different language i mean and they really do like you said the words words are very carefully chosen and then and then people are sort of inculcated into this culture and manner of speaking which which which feels like they're almost it's canonic it's very religion religious it's like singing from a hymnal um it's it's confusing and you're like well where does it start and you kind of grapple with trying to find out where it starts and and where the source is but it's but it's very diffused and it's it again it infiltrates these diversity and inclusion trainings in a very profound way because the diversity and inclusion training and who wouldn't want to know you know if if it but if it's done honestly and in the right context i suppose now i suppose that could be somewhat beneficial and i've seen no evidence that even if it's done right it would ever be beneficial i think i think these things honestly just need to happen organically and through the course of human history um but i think the military is already very inclusive in the sense that everybody has to do the same thing yeah i agree the military uh i've been in for 15 and a half years uh my experience in the military as far as inclusion goes has been remarkable um now someone might say that's because your wife unfortunately because you're a white man that it's your that's your white privilege speaking right and but that's not been my experience it really hasn't uh it's not been many others experience either until they were trained to believe otherwise uh it didn't matter for the longest time if you had a black leader or a white leader leading troops for example no one paid close attention to that because if they were professional and and were a good leader people would listen uh there's a rank structure for a reason we were the same uniform for a reason so that those things don't matter and you mentioned the religious nature of this i mean it's awoke the woke religion some are calling it james lindsey who focuses on uh he's got that book cynical theories that he wrote with helen pluck rose but he recently just published on his new discourses website how the woke religion is essentially potentially even a violation of our of our bill of rights because you've got government cozying up with the kind of religion that it's imposing potentially on its own on its own uh people in the federal agencies these are my words and i'm not james lindsay's but we would never push christianity we would never push islam as a government down people's throats and insist that unless you believe this way you're on the wrong but the woke religion that you're talking about essentially it prescribes a certain kind of belief system uh it talks about who the good guys are and who the bad guys are so who the enemies who's evil and who is good it tells you about how to gain salvation essentially and it's to admit your racism for example uh and to become an anti-racist at least i mean that's one example of how you do it whereas uh say judeo well let's say christianity says you need to sacrifice the individual self in order to gain some eternal reward uh marxist ideology is completely the opposite is it's that you need to sacrifice other people for a peace and a paradise now in this world in this country you need to revolutionize the government it's such an important point it's a religion yeah such an important point the left likes to say well jesus was a socialist you know because he believed in charity he said no jesus the bible teaches self-sacrifice okay marxism teaches the sacrifice of others and it here's another very important philosophical point the bible teaches um that you are guilty for your actions okay the the marxism teaches the opposite that the group guilt and generational guilt which is not not the bible's teachings i mean our government and our western civilization takes so much from the bible so much more than i can even know really i'm not a theologian by any stretch but i'm i'm still mesmerized by how often i can find bible verses that relate really well to our founding documents and the philosophy that creates prosperity and so you know the bible is divinely inspired and it does create outcomes that are superior nobody ever said perfect okay and this is this is again why is it an irresistible revolution because they promise utopia you know maybe that's that's another way to answer that question because if you're promising utopia well how of course it's an irresistible revolution um i want to ask you too about the sort of confession um the sort of like the false confession culture that that materializes from this sort of marxism and like how have you seen that play out in the military so one of the difficult problems in addressing culture broadly speaking is that every base is unique every service is somewhat unique now we do share some similar values in a similar mission which is the defense of the nation and our and our allies but um you know i might be having a very different experience at my base than someone is having down in colorado springs right down the road or is having out in alabama for example now so i i i won't pretend to know exactly what it i mean you've probably seen more uh of these complaints whistleblower complaints now of course than i that i have although people are sending me examples as well i've not experienced the forced con forced confessions where i've worked um i've read of others that have uh and it's been but outside of the military just to speak about society as a whole one of the things that you could you read about all last calendar year is that is that there's this there was an effort underway by some people to get people to essentially bow down and apologize for the privilege to admit their guilt uh that's not something that people get away with at a military installation uh that i that i could think of and uh it it brought me right back to mao's cultural revolution 1966 i read a book by fanshawn who is a a professor at a technical college in minnesota and he wrote it 17 years ago about his time when he was 12 years old participating in mao's cultural revolution and if you read his book called gang of one what you see in there looks an awful lot like usa 2020 and it's unbelievable and and the tactics are the same because the ideology that was fueling it is is the same uh and so whether it goes by you know regardless of what name it goes by what face or mask it puts on the under the underlying impulse is one of i've been treated unjustly uh i'm angry about it and by violent force i can take what rightly belongs to me for example this this victim mentality there's an oppressor class that has to be overthrown those ideas are at the heart of marx and ingalls communist 1848 section one specifically is where that that narrative is developed and so if once people wake up to the idea that that's in fact at play it starts week after week to completely change the way they view everything that's going on right now in society in my view i've had dozens and dozens of people write me some of them are old i mean they served in the vietnam war and they said hey i fought in the vietnam war i had no clue what i was seeing take place was communist or marxist in nature socialist you know call it what you will and they and they say but now that i've read your book i'm i'm starting to see very clearly what's been going on and that's not because my book is perfect it's just because when your eyes are open to certain ideas you start to see things a lot more clearly well and yours and you see where they've taken place in history and that's that's what a lot of young people just don't know you know they again it's this this game has been going on for a long time you know it's not new um but it is but the tactics are the same and it's easy to persuade a vulnerable and ignorant population that that doesn't understand that these that these words actually mean something that they're rooted in in a much more sinister ideology that results in well tens of millions of dead people to be perfectly honest right um what would you suggest for service members uh who want to speak out but you know military whistleblower protections aren't very strong um obviously you drew attention to yourself and and we're punished for it uh i'm doing my best to to take people's voices and amplify them and i think we're doing a good job i i know for a fact that the leadership in the dod has been paying very very close attention to this and they're they're kind of panicking over it um and look and to be and to be fair to some leaders they don't really like this stuff but they're also in denial that it's even happening to the extent that it is and i think they're maybe realizing that with these with these very specific examples and and i'm hoping to see some real some real policy changes take place although it should you know i wish it happened more under trump um because at least there was top cover um and now there's no top cover so we'll see how that goes because i think the body administration loves to see uh more crt taught but that's but in any case i i think a lot of military leaders even some of the ones that have been sort of defending this stuff they don't actually believe it so it's been very frustrating for us to kind of deal with that but what can what can service members do um how should they react to this and how can they speak out without getting fired or in trouble well i'm a really i'm a firm believer that our military services should be non-politicized organizations first off and i believe in the importance of our service members remaining apolitical okay so i want to say that up front it's unfortunate to me that critical race theory for example which is rooted in marxist ideology has become a partisan issue in this country i was fired for being politically partisan but while it was a political ideology that i wrote about and have spoken up about to me it's not partisan to defend the constitution of the united states to defend the ideals and our declaration of independence and to not be ashamed of whatever your political or religious views are in this country so every service member should feel at liberty to believe how they would like to politically and religiously and to stick up for themselves if they feel like they're being uh discriminated against illegally or unfairly based on their political persuasion based on their uh religious views or their race that's illegal to discriminate based on those reasons so do you think they should go to the inspector general's office um specifically yes well i think they should talk to their chain of command you know i had and and they should also file an ig complaint um that's what it's there for i hope they'd listen yeah uh one of the points that i've recently made is that not a single senior leader in the military has reached out to me in the past six and a half weeks since publishing my book to ask me any question whatsoever about examples of extremism that i've teed up in my book now i didn't mention people's names for a reason i wasn't interested in damaging people's careers but i'm hoping that will start to hold people accountable for their activism while in well in uniform well maybe we should mention their names i mean i'm not i'm not opposed to mentioning names uh frankly we we've we've been pretty vague in how we've released our whistleblower complaints but right i can always change my mind on that and uh and i think i probably will to be honest if we don't see changes yeah well i figured you know from where i sit and i was a commander of a unit i thought some things are told to me in confidence and privately uh and i didn't want to betray confidences another another thing was i didn't want to come across as vindictive i start dragging people's names through the mud it was more important to me to discuss the ideas so that others could take courage and say you know what i will not be discriminated against for my my political outlook my worldview or my religion or my race all of those things we are entitled to believe and actually express or speak openly but it doesn't mean we need to turn our workplaces into a politicized environment that's divisive and and i think it's important so like if service members are listening to this right now and they're like okay well how do i how do i file an ig complaint and like what do i write in it and you know because it's probably not something they think about every day and i think based on this conversation the proper thing to be writing in it is this training uh makes me feel makes me feel like i'm being attacked from my race makes me feel like i'm being attacked for my political beliefs uh it forces me to share things uh and admit things in sort of this false confession a way that i i don't feel i should have to um so so and we do have like complaints about that like that you know it's called sharing of significant significant emotional events and some of the complaints were along these lines like i'm being forced to say i'm a racist when i'm not you know and that's and that's that should go against dod policy i mean the the methods being used here rooted in crt should go against dod policy what's frustrating is the defenders of this stuff will say it's not crt we don't believe in crt we're doing diversity and inclusion training it's like you know you're just renaming it you're just renaming it you're just being clever uh but but if but if you're if you're telling people that they have to see race first then that is that is rooted in crt ideology yeah language makes things pretty tricky um [Music] it's hard to see things clearly when the words are all a mess and and people it's like you need to get caught up in all the lingo year after year if you're going to make sure that you're aware of what's going on in the world unfortunately but yeah i'd encourage service members to uh use their chain of command i had someone email me just the other day uh didn't forward this to you guys but uh they said hey i want to share with you an email that i just had with my inspector general at the base this was a senior enlisted leader at a particular base and he wrote a couple of paragraphs to the inspector general at his base and said uh i'm offended at what i'm seeing reading and hearing right now and uh the first line in the response from the inspector general was you shouldn't concern yourself too much with this that's not the kind of response that our inspector generals need to be giving to our service members it's certainly not uh the kind of response that commanders need to be giving to their their personnel and then write your write your elected officials get them involved talk about your experience if you're not getting any traction uh and and i just i can't i'm not trying to advocate for people to cause more division i'm actually trying to heal the division but you got to speak up i mean you can't just stay silent hoping the problem's going to go away there are activists who will ensure this will never go away unless people speak up and stand their ground and stand up for their rights i think that's absolutely right and it's one of the reasons that we've decided we needed to to make such a hard push for this because we we did see these complaints sort of bubble up i mean you know obviously lots of ties to the military still and it it started well before this administration took place but it really accelerated it seemed to me and uh the military being one of our last trusted institutions in america it's so important that i think we save it and we just we stop this trend in its tracks you know that's why we're doing this again i don't think the problem so far is irreversible okay i think a lot of our institutions i think is irreversible a long time ago um or will take decades to reverse i mean look at our universities um a lot of our federal institutions as well um are just are just you know i imagine the political leadings of the state department right they're like it's trust me it's like 90 democrat but the military has long been nonpartisan long been a meritocracy long been inclusive in the right way and this is about saving it i mean these efforts that i appreciate you doing it's much harder for you being active duty to be to be going on shows and actually speaking out about this um and uh you know we're not gonna let anything happen to you at least at least we'll do our best anyway um but i i think it's important for voices like yours to be heard and you bring a good example too i mean like you still active duty you're still allowed to talk about these things um you just can't do it in uniform right and uh so it does seem to me like on the left they're they're happy to be going on cnn and talking about their transition to a different gender as an active duty service member but you know more conservative or moderate members of the military you know think they're not allowed to say anything ever and it's just not true you got to speak up um and uh the i think the future and the readiness of our military is at stake here because you know the reality is we've got much worse things to worry about with the rising china and um mostly china and i and i think we need to be prepared for these for these kind of potential threats and uh we can't do it if we're hyper focused on woke bs so yeah i'll agree i'll agree with you that this is this is uh i should be more specific what i'm saying this has the potential to be a terrible distraction to us but fortunately uh for your american listener my entire time in command uh this past year despite some distractions i've we've got excellent service members who always strive to be very focused on the mission that they're trained to do and be experts at and keep that confidence but there's just some political confusion and swirl and energy and emotion wrapped up in these issues at the moment and so they've got to navigate that too all the while being told that they're supposed to remain apolitical and so when you find yourself in a politicized work environment and you're told you're supposed to be apolitical but then you start to recognize that some political views actually go unchecked and it's okay to be political if you have the right leanings that that's when you start to see this this tension that you and i have been talking about so but i'm really grateful for our service members they work very hard to do their mission defend the american people and do what they're asked regardless of who's elected to office or who's in their chain of command yeah i think that's absolutely right and yeah and people should people should understand that right it's it's it it's not like our military looks like uh you know a yale classroom but but it's but you know we see those first signs of it and we're gonna put a stop to it and and i think that's and i think that's what this is all about um matt appreciate you appreciate you being on um and uh writing that book and kind of helping people understand the roots of marxism and how it's in it's been infiltrating our most precious institutions and uh you know what you've made personal sacrifice for your views so thank you for that and thank you for being on yeah thank you congressman i appreciate it

madam speaker i rise in strong support of hr1 and i commend the speaker of the majority leader chair lofgren and representative sarbanes for their unwavering leadership we live in a cynical age some of this is due to the fact that the wealthy and well-connected have been granted access and influence in the halls of power far beyond what is fair and the results speak for themselves massive economic health and wealth disparities it's also due to the fact that we have seemingly entered a post-truth era in which facts have less of a grip on public debates particularly on our social media platforms and so the race to the bottom continues whether it's the big lie about the election or gaslighting the american people about the political leanings of the insurrectionists or the denial of climate change the roots of these problems cannot be solved unless we reform our government starting today hr one is needed to help dissolve the cynicism and ensure that facts and honesty have a place at the table once again i urge my colleagues to join us in passing hr one thank you

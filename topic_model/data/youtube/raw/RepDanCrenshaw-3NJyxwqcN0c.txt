I deployed to Iraq twice to Afghanistan once and after getting blown up I deployed back to the Middle East in Bahrain I have seen the Iranian threat Network studied it closely I've seen what their export of weapons does to our soldiers in Iraq over 600 killed by IEDs specialized IEDs that were exported there from the Iranians Iranians are experts at surrogate warfare they create sleeper cells in Bahrain right next to our Navy base they stoke civil war in Yemen and Iraq and in Syria they're experts at creating chaos now the Democrats arguments rely on two false premises one is that history began with Donald Trump's strike against Soleimani that is of course not true history began long before that the Iranians have been escalating against the United States for a very long time started in 1979 well recently they embarrassed our US Navy sailors after they boarded a US Navy vessel they've shot down US drones they put limpet mines on oil tankers they've attacked Saudi oil facilities they put rocket attacks towards our bases and they orchestrated an attack against a u.s. embassy history began long before Donald Trump finally took action and stopped letting the Iranians punch us in the face the second false premise is that there is this false choice between doing nothing and all-out war the president is not taking us to all-out war there is a lot in between and we have to be more honest about that fact we have to set a red line and say that as the United States of America we will not be punished indefinitely we have to take action and we had to respond and the president did just that and it's time to be unified behind our president instead of casting partisan stones

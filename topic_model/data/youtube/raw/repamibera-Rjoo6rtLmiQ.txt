Joan from California is recognized the speaker i rise in support of this measure and yield myself as much time as I may consume gentleman is recognized for as much time as he might concern mr. speaker let me thank chairman Royce for his leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee and also mr. Zeldin for bringing this bill forward violence in recent months has shown us that the threat of violent extremism isn't isolated to particular countries or regions more and more we see the danger posed by terrorists and foreign fighters when they can cross borders unimpeded so the United States along with our allies and partners need to do whatever we can to stop those dangerous individuals as they cross from country to country this bill would help us move in that direction here at home this legislation would ramp up coordination among government agencies dealing with this problem I would call the administration for i would call on the administration for a specific plan laying out how we're going to meet this challenge around the world it would help governments by speeding the transfer of software and technology we can use to track people entering a country to collect biometric data and to figure out what sort of risk they might present it would prioritize the sharing of specific border security systems with foreign partners and it would put a particular focus on countries where this danger is particularly acute it would establish minimum standards for international border security and makes it clear that governor governments that don't take this problem seriously are putting their american foreign assistance at risk this legislation provides common-sense steps to ensure our own security and that of our allies and partners I again want to thank mr. Zeldin for all his hard work I'm pleased to support this bill and I urge my colleagues to do the same I reserve the balance of my time Jennifer Calif

uh more developments surrounding dr doom and gloom flip flop fauci kansas senator dr roger marshall published falci's unredacted financial records which get this aren't available on the searchable database of the u.s office of government ethics website so it appears fauci was being misleading during this exchange last week take a look my financial disclosures are public knowledge and have been so you are getting amazingly wrong information so i cannot find them our office cannot find them where would they be at their public knowledge where it is totally accessible to you if you want it for the public is it accessible to the public senator marshall dr fauci has answered you to his public information and he's happy to give it to you if you would ask senator moran oh really well the great dr fauci anyways it turns out fauci's records can be requested from the nih but they are not searchable database like everybody else and of course fauci isn't the only one under fire for his never-ending failures as former president trump had this to say about joe biden's broken covert promises over the weekend remember he said i'm going to shut down the virus yeah we have the highest number of cases we had more deaths in 2021. great job joey take a look and it's a very sad thing the streets of the democrat run cities are drenched in blood with record high murders and drug deals and human trafficking there are four times more coveted cases remember i'm going to get rid of covered i'm going to get i'm going to come here four times more cases than ever before today the hospital set a record brand new record here with reaction kansas senator dr roger marshall dr marshall um turns out you are correct and it turns out that there's some interesting developments in those records uh we know he was less than honest thanks to the intercept thanks to the nih his own materials and thanks to the emails we have from dr fauci uh that in fact he knew more about the wuhan virology lab that he led on and the origins of the virus and nih money went to that that wuhan virology lab uh what did we learn about his investments yeah sean was i think we're over the target you know based upon dr fauci's uh defensive posture and just visibly shaking during that this weekend we were able to prove that dr fauci was wrong that he lied to congress he lied to the american people about the public accessibility of his finances but now we know why dr fauci and his spouse made almost 2 million dollars during 2020. so during 2020 you recall if you were a bartender or a barber you couldn't make a living but dr fauci managed to squeak together almost two million dollars um and and as you you know and you alluded to earlier in your show a significant amount of these investments are investments in china and hong kong so we're over the target we're drilling down and you bought up you know another great issue on dr fauci funding viral gain of function and hope to get to talk with you about that someday as well did he or did he not have investments in china senator yes yes he did he had significant investments in china through one of his mutual funds did he or did he not lie to rand paul and a senate committee under oath punishable up to five years in jail on the issue of gain of function research did he have knowledge of that and did in fact nih money go to the eco alliance that in fact funded that you absolutely and he lied again when i asked him about gain of function dr fauci is the cash cow and the head cheerleader for viral gain of function going back to at least 2014 when president obama's administration put a moratorium on it dr fauci continued to fund viral gain of function in north carolina with dr xi to build a protein spike that took a sars virus and allowed it to stick to human lung cells like glue and then in 18 and 19 19 continued to fund the wuhan lab via the eco health system to develop the the furon cleavage site which allows that virus to dump its guts into the cell so yes yes and yes last question isn't dr fauci one of the highest paid government officials on in in the united states government kind of close to the president right so he's making more money than the president according to forbes uh fauci dr fauci's making some 420 000 a net worth of over 10 million dollars uh and again somehow despite the economy being shut down he and his wife made almost 2 million dollars in 2020. all right good work um i think he owes you an apology senator but i wouldn't hold your breath thank you for being with us

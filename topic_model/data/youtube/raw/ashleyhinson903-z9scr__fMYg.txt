arizona senator kirsten sinema still has not said whether or not she supports the 740 billion dollar reconciliation bill axios reporting the 369 billion dollar climate and energy part of the bill is not enough and on taxes she has issues with the structure of the 15 percent corporate minimum tax and whether that could get passed down to the employees a lot to break down there a lot hinging on that as republicans have noted there will be no republicans on board with this that according to mitch mcconnell there the minority leader for reaction we welcome a republican congresswoman from iowa ashley henson congresswoman good to see you thank you so much for taking the time good morning sean good to be with you absolutely you are on the budget committee and appropriations committee what's your take on this bill the inflation reduction act um the name of it if you will you can start with that but also the breakdown of really what's inside of it and the promise that it will not raise taxes on those making four hundred thousand dollars or more um talk to me about that yeah well iowans can see right through president biden and speaker pelosi's lies about this bill the title is completely misleading it does not reduce inflation in fact through 2024 it will actually drive it upwards i think we all learned our lesson when the democrats last year were touting their 1.9 trillion dollar spending bill saying it was going to help the american economy when instead republicans were raising alarms that it would contribute to inflation and that's exactly what we've seen so raising taxes and spending more money during a recession is not a good idea in fact it just places more of a burden on iowa working families and american working families and that's exactly what this bill does it targets them it supercharges the irs it targets our manufacturers and our small businesses with higher taxes um i don't know what kind of rock the white house is living under or speaker pelosi is living under but i can tell you the stories that i hear from my constituents and inflation is hurting them that pinch at the pump the pinch at the grocery store they feel it every single day and that's why they're going to come out and turn out in record numbers and vote for republicans in november yeah just the overall inflation at 41-year high 9.1 percent gas is still at four dollars and 14 cents on average according to aaa again that being touted as a win from this white house because they're coming down from five bucks where they were again that's just the average some hit seven um but again talk to me about the the disparity between republicans and democrats in terms of messaging on this bill if you talk to democrats about the inflation reduction act they say hey this is going to lower taxes it's not going to do anything or it's going to lower the deficit if you look at that analysis report that was put out it says the opposite it says that anyone paying or anyone that makes below 200 000 a year in 2023 that's where some of this money is actually going to come from it's going to come from the middle class but why is there such a disparity between the understanding of what this bill will actually do well i think if there's anything the american people have learned in the last year and a half with this triple threat of democrat leadership is that they can't trust anything the democrats say they say this is going to come in and revive our economy it does the exact opposite it tanks our economy that's exactly what we've seen with the trillions and trillions of dollars in spending that they have proposed you mentioned student loan debt earlier you know that's a proposal that they're talking about wiping away that debt well we all know uh debt cannot be wiped away it can only be transferred to someone else to pay for it and that someone else is the taxpayers that someone else is the people who didn't go to college who may be saved and went to an apprenticeship program instead and went right into the workforce why should someone use an apprentice electrician a plumber pay for someone else's fancy degree it makes no sense and again this administration could be not more out of touch with the american working family i'll go to that the uh the student loan cancellation i know you're mentioning that forbes reporting that the biden administration is ready to implement mass student loan forgiveness with a decision coming any day now again this has been back and forth of its complete forgiveness if it's just ten thousand dollars if it's for this amount of income or less you wrote a column in the washington times titled student loan cancellation is a slap in the face to working class families biden hasn't decided on it but if he does what did you mean in your your in your article here and what would that mean for the working class yeah well plain and simple this inflation tax is a tax on every single working family and you add student loan debt forgiveness on top of that all that does again is transfer that cost to other people who right now are spending almost all of their available income just to be able to put food on the table and put gas in their car we encountered a woman who hadn't filled up her gas tank fully she was on her way to the free health clinic she hadn't filled up her tank fully in over a year and she um was crying at the pump i mean this is a situation that is facing our families here in iowa and rural america gets hit even tougher right we have further to drive to get to our gas and our groceries we have further to drive to get to our child care and our work um so that is a huge challenge and a huge burden for our families so you talk about this it seems like they're just pandering and they're it reeks of desperation and in my mind when president biden is trying to again only transfer this debt um taxpayers will end up paying for it plain and simple taxpayers voters talking about a different topic if we can and we'll move to abortion white house press secretary she was asked karine jean-pierre was asked about president's executive order yesterday that he went on to sign made a statement on camera let me play this for you she went on to say this from the white house there has been an urgency from this president from day one when uh when the supreme court made this extreme decision uh to take away a constitutional right uh it was an unconstitutional unconstitutional action by them the supreme court has taken an unconstitutional action again that from the white house your thoughts they need a lesson in how government works apparently and we need to respect the supreme court as a separate and equal branch of government and they did return that right to the states right the states are the closest to the people and that was exactly what our founding fathers intended when they set up the constitution i'm pro-life and i'll continue to work on advancing pro-life policies in congress that means helping support working families helping support families who've experienced stillbirths and making sure we're fighting to protect the unborn at the same time but when i look at what the message is coming out from the white house again these are all issues that the american people are not talking about around their kitchen tables right now they are talking about inflation they're not talking about abortion and so i'm gonna do what my constituents sent me to washington to do which is to fight for taxpayers uh stand up for rural america and make sure that has a strong voice and then safety and security for our country which is the other issue the top issue i hear most from my constituents about i did want to wrap up but i just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on the death of indiana congresswoman jackie walorski died in a deadly crash here along with two of her aides flags will be flown at half staff today um just your thoughts this morning on that yeah and jackie was a dear friend of mine as a freshman woman coming into congress she just she was a great shoulder to lean on a great shoulder to cry on sometimes a great friend to me and so many other members um in our conference and she will be very missed her presence was felt every single day in in the halls of the capitol and she just was a dear friend and my thoughts are with her family right now absolutely grieving family very sad so we continue to follow that iowa congresswoman ashley henson joining us live on the program congresswoman good to see you thank you for that thanks sean

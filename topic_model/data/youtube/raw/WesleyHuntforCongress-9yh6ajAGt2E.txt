what's your advice to veterans that are looking to get into politics and and to be a leader after they've come home from war my advice to them is that we as a country we need them and we get to wake up every day and put our feet on free sovereign american soil and breathe free sovereign american air because joey as you and i know people died for it brother people died for it and we understand this intimately this is still the greatest country in the world in every generation it's incumbent upon us to protect our liberties protect our values and to protect our constitution the blood oath to us is real we know it we feel it and today we are still willing to die for our country and if you're out there and if you're thinking about what's happening in our country you're seeing what's happening in our in our country we need you to serve in a different capacity get in office fight for our country fight for our constitution so we can take back our country for the future

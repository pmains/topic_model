  KINZINGER AND CHENEY FOR THEIR  WORK INVESTIGATING.  >> THE JANUARY 6TH ATTACK.  CONGRESSMAN KINZINGER JOINS US  NOW. GOOD MORNING. GOOD  MORNING. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION  TO THE CENTER AND WHAT DO YOU  MAKE OF THE DIFFERENT  MESSAGING COMING OUT THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HOW THAT  MIGHT IMPACT THINGS GOING  FORWARD TOWARDS THE MID TERM.  >> YEAH, THE CENTER ITSELF  DOESN'T BOTHER CENTERS LOST  ALL MEANING. I'VE BEEN  CENSURED BY. IT'S PROBABLY  ABOUT A BAKER'S DOZEN  DIFFERENT. I GOP COMMITTEES  NOW. AND NOW THE RNC. AND I  THINK IT SHOWS THAT THE RNC  HAS LOST ITS MIND AND IT'S  LOST ITS WAY. IT SHOWS THAT,  YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LIKE RICHARD  PORTER TO MEET YOUR TO MONTE  WHO WERE THE THE COMMITTEE  COMMITTEE WOMAN FOR THE GOP  FROM ILLINOIS PUSH VOTED FOR  THIS AND THAT SHOWS WAY MORE  ABOUT THEM THAN ME. SO IT  DOESN'T BOTHER ME PERSONALLY.  I DO FEAR AND I'M SAD FOR THE  FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY AND  THIS PARTY BECAUSE TRUTH  MATTERS. AND SO OBVIOUS. THAT  THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE  DEFENDING LIES AND CONSPIRACY.  I GOT TO TELL YOU, IS  SELF-GOVERNANCE DOESN'T HAVE A  FUTURE. IF THAT'S THE CASE,  WHAT DO YOU SEE GOING FORWARD.  IF THERE IS IS IS THERE A  DISTINCT SPLIT.  >> ROBIN BAUMGARTEN: IN PEOPLE  THAT ARE STILL FOLLOWING A  DONALD TRUMP IF HE MIGHT RUN  FOR REELECTION AND THERE'S  ANOTHER ALLIANCE IN THE OTHER  DIRECTION OR THOSE NUMBERS  SMALL.  >> JOSH FRYDMAN: I THINK  CERTAINLY THAT IS THE TRUTH.  TELLERS AND THE GOP ARE WE'RE  BEING OUTNUMBERED. QUITE QUITE  HANDSOMELY, IF YOU WILL, BY  THOSE THAT. ARE, YOU KNOW,  PLEDGE THEIR LOYALTY TO DONALD  TRUMP OVER THE CONSTITUTION.  SO WHAT'S THE FUTURE? I DON'T  KNOW. I THINK MIKE PENCE  SPEAKING OUT. GET SOME PEOPLE  IN OFF-RAMP. I'LL TELL YOU  THIS, THAT THAT THERE'S NO WAY  THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED. THERE'S  NO WAY THE LIES AND CONSPIRACY  CAN BE BECAUSE A COUNTRY CAN'T  SUSTAIN THAT. I THINK, YOU  KNOW, IF I WAS A LAWMAKER  RIGHT NOW TRYING SELL THE BIG  LIE DEFENDING DONALD TRUMP'S  I'D BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT  MY KIDS AND 5 OR 10 YEARS,  YOU'RE GOING TO THINK OF ME  WHEN THEY READ ABOUT WHAT I  DID FOR ME. YOU KNOW, I JUST  HAVE A NEW CHILD. WHAT, 3 AND  A HALF WEEKS AGO. I JUST WANT  TO MAKE HIM PROUD. I WANT TO  MAKE THE COUNTRY PROUD. I WANT  TO DO THE RIGHT THING.  CONGRATULATIONS THE BIRTH OF  YOUR THOUGHTS ON. DO YOU HAVE  A STRATEGY.  >> JOSH FRYDMAN: TO PRO TRUMP  CANDIDATES IN THE PRIMARIES.  >> YES. SO I HAVE THE  ORGANIZATION COUNTRY FIRST  COUNTRY, ONE ST DOT AND WE  HAVE OVER 100,000 MEMBERS. NOW  IT'S GROWN. BEYOND MY  EXPECTATIONS. AND I THINK IT  WILL GROW IN THE MORE THE NEXT  YEAR WE'RE WATCHING THAT FOR  CALLED PRIMARY FIRST AND IT'S  ENCOURAGING PEOPLE IN  REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS. YOU  KNOW, YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO  HAVE A REPUBLICAN  REPRESENTATIVE SO DISAFFECTED  REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS AND  DEMOCRATS TO SHOW UP AND VOTE  IN THIS REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES.  IT'S MADE A DIFFERENCE. WE'RE  GOING TO FOCUS ON SOME OF  THOSE RACES BECAUSE GOT TO  TELL YOU WHAT ONLY 5 OR 10% OF  THE COUNTRY IS PICKING YOUR  COFFEE, YOUR CONGRESSIONAL  REPRESENTATIVE. IT'S TIME TO  TURN OUT AND VOTE IN PRIMARIES  TO MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE. YOU  HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT YOU'RE NOT  RUNNING FOR REELECTION IN YOUR  DISTRICT. WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR  PLANS. ANYTHING IN ILLINOIS.  A.  >> TELL TELL US.  >> WORK OUT. YOU FINISH OUT  HIS TERM. I'LL BE HAPPY WHEN  I'M DONE. IT'S BEEN OBVIOUSLY  A DIFFICULT A FEW BUT I'M  GOING KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO  CONTINUE AND NOW BROUGHT IN  THAT FIGHT AGAINST LIES,  AGAINST CONSPIRACIES AND  AGAINST THOSE THAT WILL STAND  IN FRONT OF THEIR  CONSTITUENTS, THEIR DISTRICT  AND TELL THEM THINGS THEY KNOW  ARE FALSE LIKE THE ELECTION  WAS STOLEN OR JANUARY 6 WAS NO  BIG DEAL. THAT'S WHAT I WANT  TO FOCUS ON WHERE THAT LEADS  TO ANYTHING ELSE IN POLITICS.  THE POSITION WILL SEE. BUT I  AM MORE AND MORE COMMITTED,  PARTICULARLY AFTER THE RNC  CENTER AND SEEING PEOPLE LIKE,  YOU KNOW, RICHARD, PORTER, THE  NATIONAL COMMITTEEMAN FROM  ILLINOIS FOR THAT. YOU SEE HOW  FAR WE'VE SLIPPED, HOW FAR  WE'VE FALLEN. QUICK, QUICK  QUESTION ON RUSSIA. RUSSIAN  NAVY MOVING IN 100,000 TROOPS  ON THE BORDER. IS SOMETHING  WHERE THERE'S JUST GOING TO BE  THIS RUSSIAN PRESENCE THERE  FOR MONTHS.  >> IS THERE. ARE WE ON THE  VERGE OF A WAR. WHERE DO YOU  SEE AN OFF RAMP HERE.  >> YEAH, I THINK AS OF TODAY  THERE TRULY IS IMMINENT. I'M  GUESSING. PROBABLY WHEN WE GET  TO THE END OF THE OLYMPICS.  KIND OF MID FEBRUARY TIME  FRAME. GROUND IS FROZEN. IT'S  VERY LIGHT. AND I BELIEVE  RUSSIA DOES NOT ATTACK. IT  WILL BE A RESULT OF CHANGING  CALCULUS BECAUSE I THINK THEY  HAVE MADE UP THEIR MIND TO  ATTACK. AND SO WE'LL SEE WHAT  HAPPENS. CERTAINLY IT WILL  COST PUTIN A LOT. AND I WOULD  ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION  TO MAKE

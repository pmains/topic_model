half hour and we welcome one of his colleagues now longtime friend of mine from New York's 10th congressional district congressman jerry nadler congressman good to see you morning good to be we go way back to crossfire days yep well they were good times then and talk about almost deja vu so we had i just remember you so well from the Judiciary Committee during the impeachment oh yes were you just to shred those anti-clinton witnesses with your great legal skills well what was very interesting there was when I realized it was going to be an impeachment attempt I started reading everything I could get my hands on and what is it a teachable offense there was a book by rober ger called impeachment going back to the 16th century and by far the best good analysis of that was that I found in red and based everything I said on was the majority report of the Senate Judiciary Committee from the 1973 written by Hillary Rodham really yes her report when she was working for on that committee that is fascinating yeah right so now we're talking about hood Pietschmann trial again for the head of the IRS this is insane it's purely insane even the Republicans ready most of them recognize it is insane this is the crazies the the freedom caucus so-called who want to just punish it was so crazy is that the alleged misconduct by the IRS all occurred before this fellow was there I just I thought that's what I thought yeah and so the impeachment would be based on the fact that he supposedly this isn't true but he supposedly was not forthcoming enough and giving them material they wanted about what happened before he got there and that's nonsense it's no basis for her you know the original draft of the impeachment provision of the Constitution said you could be impeached for treason bribery high crimes and misdemeanors and maladministration they took out the maladministration because they didn't want in the feature for that impeachment was supposed to be only to defend only against misuse of presidential power or misuse of your own power if you're not the president but the power the office to to destroy liberty or to destroy the the separation of powers to destroy this function destruction functioning of government in which liberty dependent it was not a punishment for a crime it was what I just said and this is so far that's ridiculous right now uh as a member of the White House press corps I go the briefings almost every day and monday I was there this was the first briefing since the president's Asia trip and a lot of the talk was about the so-called September 11 legend asia and josh earnest was on his on his high horse saying if Congress passes this bill we are going to veto it because it threatens our national security it puts our military at risk very very strong and he said we think we can even override a veto what is the story on this legislation were to use what does it do and where do you stand on well I was when I was the lead Democratic sponsor in this bill there you go in the house yes Chuck Schumer in the Senate Peter King and I did it Peter's Republican did it in the house so I supported obviously I think it's a very good piece of legislation and it's been what my widely misreported as to what it does if a foreign government let's say Saudi Arabia if a foreign government commits an act of terrorism against an American in the United States then you can certainly sue that foreign government in an American court without question a collecting maybe I mean they have to have some sort of assets here which you can collect against but but the jurisdiction is and they have to have some sort of presence in the country but the jurisdiction is clear you say if under existing along existing law I'm there three points that that's point one point two if the Saudi Arabian government decided to to finance al Qaeda committing an act of terrorism in the United States and the Saudi Arabian agent met the al-qaeda terrorist in a cafe in New York and said and hand them a bag of money and said here use it for what you want to do there's no question you could sue the Saudi Arabian government the question arises if the Saudi Arabian government wants to finance that terrorist attack in the United States but instead of handing the bag of cash in a New York Cafe does so in a paris cafe that's the question can you then sue the saudi arabians for an act that that occurred abroad into a terrorism here the courts have gone both ways on this the courts have been it's been it's been going up and down in courts for years what this bill does is to clarify that one point that you can sue a foreign government for supporting an act of terrorism occurs the United States even if they're active support they're handing the bag of cash occurred elsewhere not only if it occurred in the United States that's what the bill does and why shouldn't we but such a clear explanation of the bill right I could remove all the BS that you hear about right like that's right to the heart of the bill no I mean I'm I submit i just looked into this because to me on the surface of it it just made sense from the beginning and now suddenly all this weapon and then it's got bipartisan support so if we ask unanimous lee in both houses okay I did realize unanimously in both houses obviously it has a lot of Appeal it makes a lot of sense why is it were so why is the White House so out of bounds on this thing well is it the Pentagon I i'm speculating here obvious okay i don't really i mean there are two levels of attack that's been made I think the White House has only made one I'm not sure and that and that is the Saudi Arabians are furious yeah clear we are right and they've made a all sorts of threats they would withdraw investments in the United States all sorts of things etc etc and they own a lot of American paid they yes they own a lot of American paper and they'll dump the paper etc I don't believe this for a minute the Saudi Arabians in fact I'm about two-thirds of the way through a book by Dennis Ross called dunes to succeed which is a history of the American Israeli relationship from Truman up to date and one theme in that book is that the Arabs including the sortie specifically we always worried somebody in every administration in the State Department and the Pentagon somebody in every administration and sometimes the more powerful the administration sometimes less sometimes to listen to sometimes not but somebody always argues that we shouldn't do this we shouldn't help these realities with this we shouldn't do this because the Arabs will get really angry and take it out on us and Ross's argument which he shows consistently to be true is that that is never correct or almost never correct the the Arabs and the sortie specifically will do what's in their interest mm-hmm and while they may yell and scream about Israel or in this case about this they will do what's in their interest and what's in their interest is we are their largest arms supplier in fact they're one of our largest arms customers we are supporting them they regard themselves than they are in effect fighting a war is cooking for dominance in the in the Arab area in the Arab world it's right Sony's versus Shiites headed by Saudi Arabia versus Iran we are their allies in that Russia is the allies with Iran they're not going to upset that they need our help they need our help with tremendous ways and they're our interests align they will huff and I'll puff and I'll scream about this and then they'll forget about it all right so that's one possible reason why the White House would be imported well that is one major reason probably damaged we do the other reason which I've heard expressed against I'm not sure the White House has said this to be fair is that this would subject the United States this might subject the United States the suit abroad we we we launched a missile a drone attack in Pakistan yeah and unfortunately some innocents are killed they can sue us right now that's the argument that Josh earnest was using the other day and in the White has been putting the military at risk I don't really see that argument at all for the following reason depending on Pakistan well let's assume as Pakistan depending on the foreign law I mean it's the fart our law determines what what jurisdiction our courts have and what this bill does is it clarifies a question of the jurisdiction of an American Court depending on the Pakistani law if if we if the United States launched a drone which killed an innocent in Pakistan that's a direct action in Pakistan by the American government and if Pakistani will also provided they could sue us today mm-hmm again what we're dealing with would be if if an American agent again if an American agent went to Pakistan and paid somebody to commit an act of terror if Pakistani law so provided they could sue us now the only thing this affects really is if we in American agent met with the Pakistani agent in Paris or in New York and gave it and said why don't you do this and here's some money to help you so I don't you know the parade of horribles that they talk about is all there now depending on the foreign law do a by the way my memory of fuzzy memories come what I remember now Josh earnest kept repeating the phrase national sovereignty that this would sort of undermine the National South national sovereign immunity sovereign immunity of a nation which would put our sovereign immunity at risk well which is we had our we we have every nation enjoy sovereign immunity you can't sue a country unless it can sense to be sued the United States passed the study we have passed limits on our own sovereign immunity so people can sue us if a if a truck owned by the federal government runs a red light and God forbid hurts somebody they can sue the federal government because in the we have consumed our law provides exception to sovereign immunity right this question is only a question of a specific with respect to one of those exceptions to sovereign immunity we have consented to a lot of that but and Saudi Arabia has consented to some of it and some other countries that more or less all right so where is this legislation it's passed Congress not passed the Senate unanimously gases house last Friday unanimously so it's it's it's a wonder presents deskanses he says he's going to be taught with glee if you if it passed unanimously in both houses you'll be able to override his veto are you confident of that confident yeah probably I suspect I suspect me would because it's it's even if those maybe political forum on that play okay the political pundit for a moment even if the White House were right in its arguments which I don't think they are that even if the White House to write in its arguments they're hard arguments to defend public oh yeah if I understand sure so I think politically yeah I I do expect we probably would you don't have any qualms about overriding a veto of a Democratic president I'd rather not but but I but you have to do it on the merits I think on the merits is an important bill are there 911 families who have told you that they plan to sue Saudi Arabia haven't told me personally but certainly we know I've spoken to some of the lawyers yes that there will now let me be very clear Saudi Arabia may very well win in court I mean I've seen no absolute proof or a real proof that Saudi Arabia was behind this all this does is clarify a jurisdictional question that the American court can hear the case and they have to come up with proof and I don't know that they have the proof maybe they do maybe they don't 19 of the 20 @ hijackers were Saudi citizen services and that's suggestive but it also simply shows that there's that's suggest well that doesn't show the Saudi government literally write it it shows that there's an element in Saudi society maybe a large one that is very bad do you believe the Saudi government was involved I don't know I read those so those 28 pages before they were released and they're suggestive there's a lot of its raw intelligence oh there's a lot of stuff about the aim at B & B was a friend to C&C was inherent and maybe maybe not the 911 Commission which had reviewed that said that there was no real evidence or proof but again I think that this is for court these people does the relatives the 911 families deserve the opportunity to try to prove that in court and that's what this bill does showdown between the Congress and the White House over the September 11 legislation co-author of it in the house here in the studio with us congressman jerry nadeau from New York you have a question or comment for the good congressman 866 55 press quick break we'll be right back get social with bill press like us at facebook.com slash bill press show this this is the bill press show we go down with 25 minutes after the hour from New York Magazine Marin Cogan joins us at the half hour congressman jerry nadler here in studio with us come join I want to ask you about it a maybe a lame duck issue which should not have maybe but should not been told off for the lame duck but and that's about Merrick garland the Supreme Court nominee first of all I'm I can anticipate your take on the fact that the Congress has just refused to confirm him not doing their job unprecedented a well I well they've staged delays and it's not just Merrick garland it's something like 96 pending federal nominee federal judgeship nominations at all levels but the idea of someone in February of the president's last time saying that that's the entire year that I can even consider his nomination this is and you're going to have an eight-member Supreme Court for an entire term and maybe term and a half is unprecedented and and wrong obviously and what do you think the chances are that no matter how the election turns out that they will nominate but particularly if Hillary is elected that they'll nominate that they will confirm Merrick garland before january i suspect that they would they would reveal themselves although they've been revealed long long long times about this as total hypocrites because they swear they won't lease where this is about american people the right to decide to elect a new president who gets on the supreme court but they will look at merrick garland who is about as moderate or conservative a candidate as a democratic president would nominate pretty liberal on some issues but on criminal justice issues for example fairly conservative or at least moderate yeah and they'll figure he's probably more conservative than anybody Hillary would nominate assume he might not doubt put him back and they might might do that not regardless of the fact that they've sworn they wouldn't with just about a little blossom in a lot but if I meant to ask you in September 11 about the air quality in September I remember this is a big issue at that time and now christine Todd Whitman well Christy Todd Whitman store two days after the attacks of the air was safe to breathe when she said that there was no scientific evidence one way or the other she kept saying that when we had all the scientific evidence which we which which said the air was not safe to breathe and I remember in the weeks and weeks after it they the mayor who went along with couldn't really do gotta reopen Stuyvesant High School which is right there and I was telling parents do not send your kids back as telling people do not go to work you're going to get poisoned air is toxic and we knew it and we had weak emission tests from individuals we sent from God got us out there but now she admits she was wrong as you're right except she says that she was simply following the advice of the EPA scientists very why is the bill press show

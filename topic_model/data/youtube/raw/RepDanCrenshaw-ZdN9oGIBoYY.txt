congressman you've been there you know what it's like i i know you are angry about what's happening and it's not political for you you warned against the withdrawal when president trump announced his plan now you are very unhappy with how the withdrawal is playing out can you explain to us why we needed to stay that's a great question and it's fundamental this to this entire debate because like you have a lot of people who've been using emotional slogans to drive foreign policy they say bring the troops home no more endless wars and that's fine but here's the reality on the ground there's two choices that we have okay you either have a residual security force or you have an islamic authoritarian uh emirate that is killing people and providing a safe haven for terrorists and bringing us right back to the situation that was pre-911 and this was always going to happen if we withdrew in a hasty manner and even if we were even if the mind administration had done this better which they certainly did not it probably would have happened in six months from now and the question would be what do we get out of that i mean we make some people feel good because again they like to repeat those slogans and it makes them feel good to bring troops home but we would get no other benefit from it and in fact we've made the world a lot more dangerous as a result i think people have been unable to distinguish between nation building with a hundred two hundred thousand troops which is i think we all agree is a waste especially in a place like afghanistan but they've been unable to distinguish between that and a residual security force that does that does limited counter-terrorism operations like to call this an endless war is a little bit strange because we haven't had a combat casualty in 18 months you know there was no there was no political need to do this there was no strategic need to do this in such a hasty way and it's just so disappointing

I'm just so proud to be his sister because he is Mike Lee and he will always stand for good and for truth every once in a while you you sort of Wonder you know is he going to be knocked off of what he really believes in because of pressure that he's feeling it's just not going to happen because he's so focused and driven and the principles are rooted in the United States Constitution he also told us about my own party are going to be basically throwing things at me and telling me you didn't go along with the party line you didn't do this you didn't do that I do it because I know that I voted my conscience he's a man of integrity he's not going to change his core beliefs when I talk to him about other people that he you know is friends with in the Senate it will be people that believe opposite of him politically but he respects them for their deep beliefs in what they believe as much as he feels deeply for what he believes they maybe polar opposite from him and believe completely differently than he does but he finds a way to find a connection Mike Lee would be my favorite Senator if he weren't my brother there is not anybody who I respect more in terms of the way he approaches the job of the United States Senate the way he treats his colleagues the way he treats all of the people that he works with the fact that he's also my brother just gives me such pride and joy and love

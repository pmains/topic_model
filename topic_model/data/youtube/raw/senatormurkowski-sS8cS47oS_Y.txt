thank you mr chairman um i wanted to turn to mr hennig and i appreciated gary what you have outlined in terms of of how these these run of river hydro projects have have made a community more sustainable but also allow for some some growth opportunity um if you're if you're the if you're the processor there and your power costs are so high you can't afford the the cold storage you don't have much opportunity to do much in terms of business development so you've you've not only had the one hydro project but you you've got both delta and and the waterfall hydro project so you've you've kind of lived through uh the gauntlet of how you access support through the agencies through through doe through their loan guarantee can you give any insight to the committee in terms of the things that were helpful and good to build out these renewable energy projects or or the the known barriers there can you just speak a little bit to the experience there sure thank you senator murkowski for that question um i think the working relationship that the local government again being dominated by aleuts along with the two tribes and the king cove corporation together felt like we can find the solutions to fund these projects and if we are successful in developing them then who knows what the future might hold and what that is trying to say is that now with the new owners of the seafood processing plant in king cove they want to purchase the surplus power that we have now but they also know like the city that we have the potential for a third hydro facility along with knowing that we have class six winds and for those of you who are familiar with wind generation anything over a class three wind is commercially viable so the new owners of the seafood processing company the two tribes the king code corporation and the city are now all looking at taking yet another step to add more renewable energy and not so much that we need it for the residential part of the community but for the industrial part of the community so that our economic survival with greater processing at the seafood plant that can be done by renewable energy can be another win-win for the community for the fishermen for the processors and for all the people who get to eat the wonderful products that come from this very remote region of alaska so so clear benefit with regards to building out the economy um but in terms of impediments that you had and so far as accessing the the necessary capital to move forward can you speak a little bit to that sure um our ability to access capital for the two hydro projects was fairly reasonable in terms of i guess the process we had to go through certainly with your support senator murkowski and congressman young's we were able to work with the department of agriculture the rural development folks back in the early 90s and early on we thought that process was going to be very difficult but it turned out to be a fairly smooth process so that has given us the incentive to believe that as long as we have a good business plan and that we can show the results that we can now show that our ability to find the next level of capital funding for more renewable energy development should not be so insurmountable that uh that that we can't make it happen i mean we're very positive that that our experience gives us the potential and the lenders the comfort of knowing that we know what we're doing when it comes to harnessing mother nature well i think you you have demonstrated that so thank you um i wanted to ask a quick question probably to ms monica iv and and possibly to ms holden as well and this is the micro grants for food security program um it's something that i had worked really hard to get into the the last farm bill we have seen great success in the state of alaska these are small small loans that's why we call them micro grants so it's not for big ag by any extent but what we're trying to do in alaska is is kind of reintroduce farming growing your own food this whole concept of food security and before you can you know the the daunting thought of a big project big agriculture is too much for for so many but you got to get started somewhere so whether it's seeds or or whether it's the the high tunnels to allow for a longer growing season whether it is fencing to keep the moose out so that they don't eat your crops these have been hugely hugely important so can either one of you share with me whether um these these micro grants are something that you feel are are helpful i know that they're already over subscribed um with the money with the funding that we had appropriated either one go ahead oh i i would love to um say that we were a beneficiary but i'm i'm just glad that that program is oversubscribed yay um uh our our our manato has always been investing in um young people and uh so you know today we have over 90 people um reconnecting to their land learning uh agri-ecological practices um understanding the ike kupuna the deeper reason of their why i mean their purpose and and through language through only through hula um and and to be able to create that future ancestor that understands the foods um that comes from you know them their work and their intention to feed um that's really the gift and so whatever we can do to kaka or other organizations i know we we do work with several uh tribes um and and and also several of the programs um that have been uh initiated and started by many of you here on the call today um that is where i think we need to continue to work is helping to elevate our youth to to be a part of this mahalo thank you mr chairman

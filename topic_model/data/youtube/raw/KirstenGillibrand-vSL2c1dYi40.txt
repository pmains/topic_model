why not run on National Public Service asking every young person in this country to commit a year of public service in exchange for two years free of Community College or state school or if you're willing to do two years of public service you get four years of public schooling through community colleges state schools or other job training and what you've just created is is that John F Kennedy ask not what America can do for us what you can do for America ask what you can do for your country it's right there you say I will give back and you can make it available to do health care to do education to do these green jobs to do first responders or military service it's basically an expansion of the GI Bill so this might be an idea that my base never heard of or could even imagine but this is a better solution I think to making college more accessible and affordable than other ideas out there

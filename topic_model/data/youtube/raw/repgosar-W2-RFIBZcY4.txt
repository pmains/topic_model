I yield to the gentleman from Arizona mr. Gosar Thank You chairman chairwoman mr. bean and mr. Raja you just talked a minute ago about a lot of your data comes from the Department of Defense and that that data is restrictive on their direction so my question is as any NGO environmental or conservation group was initiated sue and settle been privy to that information that would otherwise not be disclosed to anybody else not to my knowledge sir no mr. rauch no mr. Rainey are you familiar with anything would you go back and I would like all the members of this panel to come back and answer that post operatively I'm a dentist so if I speak in medical terms I like to have a conversation in regards to that because I actually think there is so mr. bean last month the Fish and Wildlife Service designated over 700,000 acres of land in southern Arizona as critical habitat then you know see where this question came about in regards to the rarely present Jaguar I think DoD has a big overlap with that aspect Game and Fish Assistant Director for wildlife management Jim DeVos stated at the time I find it difficult to justify designated critical habitat for a species that's so rarely found in Arizona and looking at the available data on the presence of Jaguars there's been no documentation of a female Jaguar in Arizona for nearly a century you would agree I don't have any independent knowledge sir I'm sorry okay such designation should be based on good science and effective conservation which are both lacking with this designation this designation does nothing to further conservation act of the Jaguar what best available scientific and commercial data was used to justify this listing I don't know the details I have to supply that to you postoperatively as you say okay I would expect that miss mean last night the Fish and Wildlife Service announced that they were reopening a comment period going to a pursuing it designating a critical habitat for the New Mexico metal jumping mouse commonly known as whipper and Winkle the sleeping Mouse this proposed rule sets seeks to stifle economic development harm grazing on over 15,000 acres in New Mexico Colorado state of Arizona wilder with guardians reports that this road and typically hibernates for ten months out of the year environmental groups have been pushing for this designation since 2007 is your agency pushing for the designation of critical habitat for the sleepy mouse based on actual science or to appease and extremist groups that are threatening lawsuits let me answer that this way sir I don't know the facts of this particular instance but I can assure you that in no instance is the Fish and Wildlife Service proposing critical habitat to appease the interests of in streamis groups I can assure you of that so we'd like to have a review on soon and settle so we'd like once again going back to the zoo and subtle aspect and privy documentation dr. Amy can you provide examples of work data sharing has been beneficial for species conservation an examples of where it is needed certainly the delta smelt case is probably the first and foremost and in my mind because we just published on that about a year ago identifying the threats is extremely important to allocating conservation efforts on the boreal toad there was a were able to obtain data on the genetics and the distinctiveness of the various groups and we found large amounts of missing data in the datasets and the lines were basically arbitrarily drawn around those groups and so that independent reevaluation allows for refocusing of research needs and conservation effort in terms of the California condor peregrine falcons there had been previously thought to be human disturbance of nest sites as being a problem however when the data were in that was not the issue DDT and predation were and so having open access to data allowed for that kind of reanalysis like I said that greater sage-grouse is an example where it's sorely needed I mean we don't have the basis of the data that was cited 64 times in the 2010 listing decision on the Gunnison sage-grouse there's no measurement data there's no color data the supposedly historic range is entirely based upon speculation no data so those are k2 very relevant recent is where that is needed sounds mr. mr. bean is there a case that we've made mistakes in regards to restrictive habitat I can think of one that I kind of want to hedge my bet on this that would be the spotted owl Mexican spotted owl sorry sir I didn't hear your question and we made in the States in regards to habitat restrictions in regards to endangered species the Fish and Wildlife Service has on occasion delisted species that it originally listed on the basis of error taxonomic air or other informational defects they're relatively few of those but yes there have been some of those Mexican spotted owl would actually be one of those wouldn't it be because we have an overgrowth of timber and Mexican spotted owls really don't like that do they I'm sorry sir I don't have the facts I think it's really rates the common Barnell and what we've done in Arizona and a lot across the West is we've actually allowed these forests to be over occupied and even in Arizona have become victims of these catastrophic fires because of this I hope that you would really reconsider yourself and look at some of this critical habitat in a conscientious way and utilize state and local Maps thank you

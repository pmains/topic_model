senator from Illinois Madam President I come to the floor today to honor some of the founders of our nation who all too often don't get their due founders whose gender or skin tone may not be represented on Mount Rushmore but whose brilliance whose resilience helped ensure that the that the democracy we have today is strong and true because this democracy wasn't just built by George Washington or Thomas Jefferson it wasn't perfected in the 18th century when the ink dried on the four original pages of the Constitution it was shaped by women like Abigail Adams who I named my first daughter after it was strengthened by suffragists like Sojourner Truth who worked tirelessly to better the country that had kept her in Chains who used her emancipation took off of freedom and a voice for all women black white you name it it was formed by Illinoisans like Ida B Wells who demanded that women of color have a place at the forefront of the suffrage movement it was forged by women like Mary Livermore who channeled her frustration over women's inequality into action spearheading Chicago's first ever suffrage convention a hundred and fifty years ago and marking Illinois as a leader in the fight for women's rights our democracy was sharpened by the group of Illinoisans who traveled to Washington DC in 1913 joining thousands of other women in their march down Pennsylvania Avenue protestors who were vilified berated jostled and tripped and even jailed but who withstood it all to call for a constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote and this union was made more perfect when the 19th amendment finally passed Congress 100 years ago today these women raised their voices on the picket line so we could make ours heard at the polls they risk safety and security withstood hypocrisy and overcame misogyny refusing to stay silent so that their daughters and their daughters daughters would inherit the democracy they deserved for that we are forever in their debt but of course every American's right to vote wasn't Fuli secured that day in 1919 nor was it secured later that week when Illinois became one of the first states to ratify the amendment or in 1965 when lyndon b johnson picked up a pen and signed the Voting Rights Act into law and it still is not secured today not when voter suppression tactics still blocked so many people of color from the ballot when voter roll purges are still common and in some in power are still fighting to install modern-day poll taxes so we can't get complacent what began at Seneca Falls continues with us today I said now Falls to our generation to keep alive the work of yesterday's suffragists to keep pushing for bills like the voting rights advancement act to ensure that bigoted state laws don't disenfranchise any American it falls on us to keep fighting for that more perfect union to keep making our voices heard whether that's here on the Senate floor or anywhere else so that finally someday soon every American can make theirs heard at the ballot box thank you I yield back

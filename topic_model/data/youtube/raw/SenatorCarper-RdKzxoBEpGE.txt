i used to be governor i used to be uh senior selfie i used to be somebody but as governor you had to propose i just had to propose balance budgets you had to be able to balance the budget you had to work you know work with the legislature i followed my castle as governor he followed pete dupont and we focused very hard on the fiscal responsibility uh the eight years i was governor we had eight balanced budgets in a row seven years we cut taxes a couple years we actually paid down some debt we ended up with a aaa credit rating for the first time in the history of the state of delaware so i feel like i know something about about this bit this issue so do a number of my colleagues we uh we're having a lot of debate as we should over what uh our spending plan is going to be in this continuing resolution to try to fund the government for uh whether it be another two weeks another four weeks or another six months that's all well and good it's important we need to get started and demonstrate that we're able to reduce uh this deficit and reduce our debt but uh we need to keep in mind that while it's important what we do in the first or the next six months what's really important is what we do in the next six years uh beyond that we had a commission put together the bunch of us supported creating deficit reduction commission co-chaired by erskine bowles and former since uh senator alan simpson they've given us a pretty good road map to how to get to a more fiscally responsible place over the next 10 years getting some cutting some four trillion dollars out of the budget deficit and what they've said is uh pretty much everything needs to be on the table domestic spending defense spending entitlement programs and the tax expenditures tax credits tax deductions and that kind of thing tax rates and uh what they've suggested is a proposal that cuts the deficit by four trillion dollars over ten years and there are about two thirds of that on the spending side maybe a third or so on the uh on the revenue side i actually think that's pretty good approach and i commend the eleven of eighteen members of the commission that who who endorsed that to that approach i uh i like to one of my core values is everything i do i know i can do better uh i think the same is true of all my colleagues and frankly the same is true of federal programs and what we need to do is to to replace what a lot of people think of we have here in washington a culture of spendthrift we need to replace it with a culture of thrift we need to look in every nook and cranny of the federal government and all kinds of programs and say can we get a better result for less money and just about everything we do or can we get a better result for uh at least not spending any more money and as we do that partnering with the gener uh general county accountability officer gao with omb with all the inspector generals with nonprofit groups like citizens against uh waste just all of us be focusing on what can we do to get better results for less money and that's part of what we need to do uh long term we're still gonna have a lot of tough decisions but at the end of the day we need to uh as we save some money carve out some money if we have the ability to spend an extra dollar or two where should we invest that money where should we invest that money in a guy named john chambers who i'm presiding officer knows some of us met with him earlier today the fellow who's ceo of uh of cisco big successful technology company and uh he uh likes to say there's two things we need to do if we're gonna be successful as a nation 21st century economy number one invest in people so we have the most productive work for smart workers whether they happen to be postdocs or they happen to be people with high school degrees productive workforce number one number two uh invest in our infrastructure last year our transportation infrastructure in this country got a d as in delta not good a d it's in dumb not good that's where our infrastructure is in this country we need to invest under infrastructure not just roads highways bridges rails port but broadband water wastewater all that broadly defined infrastructure the third place we need to go is to invest in research and development so we can be an innovation economy continue to be an innovation economy the president says if we're going to be successful in the 21st century we need to not educate out innovate outcompete the rest of the world if we're not educate people we need to invest in our workforce very young kids and folks that are off to a college and post-secondary training the the other thing that we need to do is invest in our infrastructure not just roads highways bridges but infrastructure uh describe broadly and finally invest in r d so we can innovate and outcompete the rest of the world at the end of the day if we have a uh having a successful economy we have to create what i call a nurturing environment for job creation for uh for job creation for job preservation we need a nurturing environment and part of that is is our obligation working with the private sector and working with others states and the local governments across the other country if we continue on the track that we're on uh right now gross domestic pride rather debt as a percentage of gdp has climbed up to about 65 percent i'm told 65 percent our debt is a percentage of gdp last time it was that high was the end of world war ii it's the only time it's been that high 65 and uh other countries that are getting that kind of territory like greece and ireland that's not smart and they found out the hard way we need to learn from them and this is the time to do it requires uh all of us to stand up and and do what we know we need to to do sharing a sacrifice everything on the table let's use the deficit commission as a good role model ask the from the executive branch to provide the leadership that they need to provide

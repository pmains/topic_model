you senator Holly surgeon Duckworth Thank You mr. chairman um mrs. Shanahan I'd like to follow up on the line of questioning from my colleague from Arizona Senator Max Ali you know I think there's no doubt we'll continue continue to see tensions in North Korea on the Korean Peninsula after the latest breakdown in talks between the president and chairman Kim how do you plan to use your position is acting secretary of defense to reassure our allies in the region we know our great friends the Republic of Korea and Japan have a much more tense and complicated relationship with each other for example there were questions about them sharing Leo plant neill plans with one another what do you plan to do to work on bridging that gap thanks for that question senator that gap could be bridged at also three different levels there's a relationship level and I have relationships with the defense minister for Japan as well as the Republic of Korea so it's important that I play a role in keeping the two countries together there exercises that we'll do together technology that will develop together particularly in the area of missile defense as you well know that's a sizable investment by the government of Japan is to put Aegis ashore as well as develop other I'll say a defensive capabilities in the event of an escalating situation on the peninsula so you had answered I'm Cedric Sally saying that there would not be any degradation of our relationship and readiness as it pertains through military exercises but are you changing the nature of those exercises to for example simply being tabletop exercises or just computer exercises as opposed to how they've been conducted in the past soon if you don't mind taking it the way I would describe it and you're quite familiar with this we have changed and I want to be clear is we've changed the method of training to focus on a mission essential tasks that each of the levels of command needs to be proficient in what we haven't changed the GI come and the readiness to fight tonight so the way you characterize it is is in part through that some of our large-scale exercises have done now with simulation CP exit command post exercise and so forth but what's really important to highlight is that at the battalion and the squadron level and below there's been no changes to training and the ability of our men and women on the peninsula to train in the integration of combined arms where we've made adjustments for large-scale exercises and what we've done is very quickly I'll just start a highlight we've shifted from certifying our readiness based on the conduct of an exercise to a much more complex system that general Abrams and Neville Davison have developed which identified all the mission essential tasks for every level of command and making sure that we have a proven method of developing proficiency and the other thing I can assure you is that as soon as general Abrams and Admiral Davison have any concerns about their ability to maintain readiness and right now we're executing their plan they know that they come right back to the secretary and I and we will work with the Koreans to make adjustments but I can assure you from a military perspective right now I am quite confident in our 2019 training plan and confident that that will deliver the level of readiness that we have historically done accomplished in large-scale exercises so you're saying that for brigade them below or battalion below there's no change as far as the the leaders that that see what's happening that that is correct that's an important point so no that is correct so above brigade that's where the changes that's where the changes are and in some cases it's it's dialing down the volume of the exercises as you know well those exercises had two purposes one was deterrence one was proficiency I'm confident right now that our exercise program does deliver the latter proficiency and our mission essential tasks have those exercises take into account the role of logistics in sustaining any type of a fight that we would have to engage in I do think that we we focus on what's happening on the peninsula but sustaining that fight long term and getting whatever we need resources there is a real challenge at the Pacific is many people I don't even realize how vast the Pacific Ocean is and you speak a little bit to the Logistics and in fact this past year we did what we call a career readiness review and we played out the first 60 days of a Korean conflict to include the detailed logistics planning that was necessary to support operations for the first 60 days we needless to say learned a lot during an exercise but our exercises absolutely include the logistics factors associated with our ability to conduct operations thank you our national defense strategy outlines a shift and primary focus on countering violent extremism to great power competition as acting secretary mrs. Shanahan what specifically do you plan to do in areas perhaps less obviously impacted by either of these priorities for example SOUTHCOM or AFRICOM SOUTHCOM and africa are critical in terms of defeating Isis dealing with with regional threats the chairman in his role is the integrated global campaign planner we make sure that the risk in those areas and the resources required to manage are properly delivered both to SOUTHCOM and Africa Thank You mr. chairman thank you

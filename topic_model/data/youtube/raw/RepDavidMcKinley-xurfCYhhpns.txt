thank you the opportunity to participate with this committee i think the previous speaker just what said it all what we're here for there's always electricity in the in the air when people try to divert our attention from what we're supposed to be talking about here today because that's uh that's what they do a lot in in washington um i i'd just like to start by i'm one of maybe three or four people in congress that have a construction background and i've dealt with permitting agencies for 40-some years when they grant a permit you work with that permit if you change if the science changes and you change the requirements the gentleman suspend i'm going to ask all committee members to to respect the time that other committee members have if we need to have sidebar meetings we've got a room or a hallway that we can take it to i'd appreciate that thank you go ahead sir but when they change that when they change the rules that on the next permit you make that apply but you don't go back retroactively so that's one of the reasons i came here to particularly was to learn from the epa and the other administrators what was their grounds for this justification if it were science then let's let's build on the science um but i but unfortunately they chose not to be here or not to send any representatives within their organization so i'm a little i'm a little surprised with that but but let's let's stay focused on why we're here about a permit permit was given and and if and if what i'm told they said they they they want to revoke it because i believe the science they felt there was new more science that they caused that to be considered so i i'm i would like to ask that i i suppose miss miss gano to try to give an analogy for you if in your house you probably have plywood in your house you have drywall perhaps in your house are you aware that the epa is considering changing the standard on the resin used in plywood to such a level of a tenth of a part per million and if they if they do make that change would you how would you feel after you've been given a permit to own and build or locate in your house they knock on your door and say you have to leave your home because we've changed the standard and your house is no longer in within standard would you leave your house willingly i absolutely would if i thought my house was making me sick i would leave and i'm sure you'll pay that if i could reclaim my time but and the same thing with with concrete uh there's there's in your house you have you have fly ash in your concrete and the epa is now adopting standards that will say that that's a hazardous material so i i suppose what you're willing to say in in a very humble way that you're willing to face bankruptcy uh for your standards and your principles and and i admire you for that but the bank probably isn't going to like that after they've loaned you the money and i really respond to what you're saying or you're just talking about if i could continue with my time is that you may lose your home and the bank may have to be foreclosed on it because you can't your house doesn't meet the standards of the epa so that's a real that's a real threat as to when we keep moving the goal post for people to be able to make a decision so i particularly missed miss arbor uh i i like your comments and i i wonder whether or not you had any other comments about the report if i but before we get to this report in a real short time frame i want people to understand that since we got off game i'll play in this court for a little bit uh when he won't acknowledge that in in the other committee but let's go back to carbon capture and sequestration i've asked time and time again for the epa if you're going to set the standard for carbon capture sequestration that that's under the new source standards show me one facility that has carbon capture that the commercial commercially available technology and there isn't one we cannot do it in america today either even in a laboratory setting but yet the epa has set that as being the standard to where we need to be they know very well this is a war on coal there's no question about it when we look at that fly ash being called a hazardous material greenhouse glass is climate change new source standard utility mac train act we could go on and on and on we understand they don't want all the above energy sources so can you just in the time time frame can you say is there anything more in this study that we need to review that was done by dr sunlin i think the the take away from that report is is that the impact on the broader business community and the investment community will be huge and that it changes the business model for infrastructure in america and was that the intention of the clean water act uh it certainly was not the intention of congress to change the business model for the american economy and that's ultimately what this could mean okay thank you and apparently i've run over my time i did want to ask our senator from west virginia about the fact that longview coal mine coal company in in west virginia we're actually producing power in mont county is actually producing power and notwithstanding the remarks from our senator from massachusetts it's been at a rate lower than than the gas production on the heat rate so the at the innovation is there it's just got to be the ability for mr mr mckenzie chairman would the gentleman like to ask unanimous consent for another minute to pursue that i'd be great i'd be glad to grant another minute if he could if he could expand if something on that i would ask her for another minute to for the uh without objection he's aware of the fact that there are coal companies that are providing innovation but they're being held back because of the threats of the over-regulation are you aware of the longview mine in mont county yes that's that's producing at a heat rate of 8 700 btu per kilowatt uh so for those on the other side of the aisle that that aren't aware of that um what would you say to that that that that the coal companies are innovating i think they're innovating to to the best of their ability uh kilty company utilities and as far as the economic ability to do so yes thank you very much thank the gentleman for yielding back we'll go to mr duncan from south carolina

good morning everybody I'm Don Clavin the town of Hampstead supervisor and I'm joined by a myriad of my fellow colleagues in government as well as some of our leaders and the AMT here in the town of hempstead to discuss a couple of updates for the residents first off we just want residents to not be scared we just want them to be prepared there is a lot of concern regarding coronavirus going around and we just want to reassure the residents in the town of hempstead of some of the steps we have taken and continue to take to reassure for their safety as well as the safety of all the the town residents and while Nassau County houses the local health agency we have been taking steps here in the town and we want residents to be reassured of some of the protocols we've put in place not only for them but for our co-workers in the town of hempstead is the largest township in America we've responsibility some of the simple measures we have taken have included additional cleaning of our senior facilities in fact we are the implementing starting tonight additional steam cleaning of all 14 of our senior centers why to reassure residents that we are being proactive we are just taking the necessary extra steps so our seniors who utilize our senior centers on a regular basis for you know community meeting for for lunch for simple coffee no they can be reassured they're coming to a facility that is being properly maintained if not above and beyond it just doesn't stop there in addition and our regularly scheduled meetings we've instituted a couple of other protocols including additional cleaning of senior buses with our commissioner we're very grateful for that we also have dr. new Bert and his team going out to senior centers to talk to our residents who have questions that's part of the process is in educating people lastly we actually have had so much positive feedback from dr. new Bert's meetings at the senior centers that we are putting forth to Facebook town hall meetings the doctor will sit and answer questions via the internet of residents the first one will actually be this Sunday at 12 o'clock on Facebook we have a second one already scheduled for March 20th at 2 p.m. in the afternoon the idea again is to give residents the comfort they can talk to the doctor via Facebook submit questions and he will address them our offices are open because we provide services to those we serve and I think the goal of all of us and the goal that we've had since day one of putting this taskforce together was to continue to make sure that we can provide those services and to keep everybody calm I think if we all work together we keep that line of communication open like Don mentioned we're gonna have a Facebook Town Hall on Sunday with dr. Dave nubert so in the comfort of your home you have the opportunity to ask a qualified medical doctor any questions or share concerns that you may have and that's what this is all about opening the line of communication keeping everyone healthy and safe and making sure that as America's largest Township we continue to provide all the services necessary to keep our town moving forward it you know it is most important that people do not panic we are here we are monitoring the situation and we are making sure that everyone has the the proper information that they need so they can keep themselves safe they can keep their family safe and that they can still continue to go about their lives that's the most important thing that we can do here is have the education that they have let our seniors go and get the meals that they get and have the social interaction but do it in a safe manner that that they don't need to worry and they can take the steps to protect themselves um it's also important for us that we make sure that that our employees feel safe and that they feel empowered that they can do their jobs and keep their families safe we have a hotline set up if there's any department or if there's any employee that has a concerned and they bring it to their supervisor it is relayed through our EMS department and then relayed to me as the town's medical director and we make sure to follow each one of those up let people know if there's a concern if there's anything that we need to handle we coordinate with the health department thankfully nothing has had to be handled in that manner everything has been more just concerned than any a true problem but that is something that we have set up to make sure that we're keeping all of our employees safe we're keeping all of our employees healthy I do want to remind residents you have a concern you know a couple of important phone numbers we always remembers you know emergency 9-1-1 york state also has an informational coronavirus hotline at

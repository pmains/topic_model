well I'm grateful and uh for the opportunity to work on this legislation and to partner with Senator Warner a number of our colleagues are as he said our team's staffs have worked closely together over the past several weeks refining this legislation it is widely acknowledged that tick tock's a threat to our national security which is why Congress took steps last year to ban the platform on government devices and before Tick Tock as as Mark pointed out Congress had to take steps to remove Huawei ZTE nzt from our telecommunications Networks in my view we do need a an approach that does away with this whack-a-mole with this particular technology and uh with adversarial Nations and come up with a more systemic process in which to to examine these risks and to act on them I've long been concerned about how every social media company uses the data collection users and I've introduced a number of bipartisan pieces of legislation to bring more transparency to Big Tech but I'm particularly concerned about tick tock's connections to the Chinese Communist party which repeatedly repeatedly spies on American citizens it was reported last year that china-based employees of bite dance have repeatedly accessed non-public data about users in the U.S despite Tick Tock saying to the contrary and as Senator Warner pointed out both the Trump and the Biden Administrations recognize the need for a robust process in place to evaluate the threats that are posed by by Foreign technology this legislation builds on those efforts by establishing a comprehensive process within the Department of Commerce to mitigate and which ultimately could lead I would I would add to Banning platforms like Tick Tock the Chinese Communist party has proven over the last few years that is willing to lie about just about everything that likely won't end with Tick Tock which is why it's an important it's important to establish a holistic and methodical approach the challenges that are posed by technology from foreign adversaries it's safe to assume that if the CCP is willing to lie about its spy balloon and cover up the origins of the worst pandemic in 100 years they'll lie about using Tick Tock to spy on American citizens it's a high time we address this issue I think this legislation goes about it in the right way and and deals with some of the attacks have been made in the past constitutionally about how you approach specific or individual companies but I'm pleased to be working with my colleagues on this and I hope that with this is one of those issues that we can work in a bipartisan way to solve to get something on the president's desk and start to attack this problem thank you

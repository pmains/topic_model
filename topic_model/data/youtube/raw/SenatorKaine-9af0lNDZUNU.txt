senator from Virginia mr. president I applaud my colleague for reaching out to see if we could work together on this important resolution a resolution that coming to the Senate in 2013 as did my colleague neither of us believed we would need to stand on the floor of this body to introduce in August of 2017 students and their families had just arrived in the town of Charlottesville to move in to the University of Virginia a close friend of mine rabbi Jake Rubin as the Hillel rabbi at the University of Virginia and the students and their families many were coming to Charlottesville over Virginia for the first time excited to begin their college career gathered with other Hillel students and families on campus on a Friday together with members of the Charlottesville Jewish community to fellowship and worship soon they heard chants outside of the place where they were worshiping and they saw individuals dressed in a sort of a uniform of khaki pants and white shirts carrying torches and marching they were marching at something that was a two day rally billed as a unite the right rally but it was the words that were coming out of the marchers mouths that terrified these worshipers and students because what they were chanting were slogans from Nazi youth rallies from the 1930s Jews will not replace us blood and soil other horrible and chilling statements to terrified these young people and the adults who were with them in the next day this rally / riot continued white supremacist white nationalist neo-nazis neo Confederates an individual and a vehicle ran his car into a crowd injuring many and killing Heather hire a paralegal from the Charlottesville area two state troopers both of whom I knew because they were part of the governor's security two-tail during my tenure as governor and also the tenure of then Governor McAuliffe who were patrolling to try to provide order in a difficult situation and a helicopter their helicopter went down and both of them were killed trying to protect public safety we didn't think that would happen in Virginia we didn't think that would happen in the hometown of an archetypal American political leader who believed that the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion was one of the most important things about our country that you can worship as you like or not and be and not be preferred or punished for the choice that you make and yet it did happen Virginia it did happen in our country this day was a day that extended a long history as my colleague mentioned of anti-semitism in the country lynchings the Leo Frank lynching in Atlanta Georgia in the early 1900s Jews wrongly accused of crimes and then killed crimes that they didn't commit American boycotts of Jewish businesses in Michigan in the 1930s restrictive covenants that prohibited Jews from moving into certain neighborhoods restrictions on access to country clubs educational institutions bars that made it difficult to become members of certain professions and even in addition to formal restrictions a culture of intolerance a culture of segregation that treated Jews as not fully equal in this land of equality I had hoped that those days were behind us but it's not just Charlottesville there's a Jewish day school the guess your day school a few miles from here in Virginia that experienced bomb threats in 2017 and 2018 the Jewish Community Center and Fairfax Virginia has been repeatedly - faced with knots graffiti and anti-semitic graffiti and they and in a heartening sign when that happens the faith communities of Virginia Christian Muslim Jewish Hindu Baha'i gather to scrub the graffiti off and yet this hasn't happened just once it happens over and over and over again the shootings at the synagogue in Pittsburgh in California the assassination of Jewish senior citizens at a Senior Center in Overland Park Kansas near where my parents live the uptick in reported hate crimes against Jews as my colleague mentioned the biggest source of victims of hate crimes directed against any religion in this country are directed against Jewish Americans and so we stand at a time where regardless of where it comes from regardless of who perpetrates it we have to acknowledge that it's real that it's dangerous that it's growing and those of us in leadership positions have to be able to stand against it as firmly as we can and so I applaud my colleague for reaching out to see if we could work on this together this is a topic that could be used for partisanship that one side could point at things that folks on the other side said that they didn't like and senator Cruz and I talked about that but what we realized is this is just too important an issue to get it bogged down in partisan politics that the clear and present danger felt by members of the Jewish community and the escalating rhetoric against Jews in many parts of the country and around the world is something that would call for a bipartisan response a clear condemnation and also a Senate commitment that as the Senate we will do all that we can to combat anti-semitism so that we can be true to the Equality principle that's our nation's North Star so that we can be true to the freedom of religious worship that is enshrined in the First Amendment and it's in the First Amendment for a very important reason and so I applaud my colleague and I hope it is the pleasure of this body to accept the motion that he will soon make that by unanimous consent we passed this strong statement of where the Senate is on this most important topic and with that mr. president I would yield the floor back to my colleague from Texas

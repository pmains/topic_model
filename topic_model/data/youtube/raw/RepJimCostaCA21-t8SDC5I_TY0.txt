thank you madam speaker gun violence as we know is plaguing our nation in 2022 this year there have already been 200 mass shootings in the united states think about that absolutely horrific and so when is enough enough we ask ourselves our constituents across the country ask us how many more innocent people must die before any reasonable common-sense gun reform legislation can pass and add more protection for the american public let's pass the protect our kids act which raises the purchasing age from semi-automatic weapons from 18 to 21 a common sense idea let's also deal with the subject of ghost gun purchases and background checks again common sense ideas and cracks down on gun trafficking and straw purchases will we totally eliminate the threats to to the public of course not but there are common sense ideas we can do to improve and increase safety for our schools for our churches and for people that are just going to shop for groceries one afternoon these are things we can't do and we should do as chair of the congressional crime survivors and justice caucus i am advocating for resources for survivors of gun violence to cope with their trauma whether it be in sacramento or fresno or anywhere else around this country i support the second amendment for responsible gun ownership let that be clear but america deserves better and i call on all house members to join me in this effort let's put partisanship aside and take action to address the gun epidemic once and for all

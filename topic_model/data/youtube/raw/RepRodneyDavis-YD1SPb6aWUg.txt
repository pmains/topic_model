mr. speaker it's been one year since an ef3 tornado ripped through my hometown of Taylorville Illinois more than 700 structures were damaged in 33 were destroyed that night but yet not a single life was lost I thank God for looking over Taylorville that night and I'm thankful for the critical decisions made by our former fire chief Mike Cruz and our current mayor Bruce Barry their actions likely saved countless lives it's a night I will never forget not only because of the destruction I saw when arriving back into my community minutes after the tornado ravaged it but it's also the damage I saw the next day in daylight but I'm also amazed by the generosity that we saw from so many people from outside our community hundreds of volunteers came out to assist with the cleanup and donations poured in from across the state in the nation to help those in need I especially want to thank ed leg and those others who make up missions for Taylorville for coordinating getting these donations out to those families in need we gathered this past weekend at the Taylorville VFW post as a community to remember that night to thank our first responders and volunteers for their work and also remind everybody that many families are still in need of help one year after this devastating tornado I want to again thank all those who continue to help my Tom my hometown recover and pray for the families still in need we are all Taylorville as strong

its rightful place in the u.s capitol statuary hall amelia stands as in a symbol of daring determination to defy the odds that led her from her little hometown atchison kansas to become one of the most admired women in the world it's an honor for our foundation too to be entrusted to lead for the monumental project that finally got done as jackie will talk about a little bit in a little time i

colleague and really dear friend jackie pajant [Applause] thank you karen it has been uh the honor of a lifetime to bring amelia to the u.s capitol with the responsibility for the statue for the state of kansas amelia's words echoed in my mind often when a great adventure is offered you don't refuse it amelia also famously said it's far easier to start something than it is to finish it and she was right and one of her most notable quotes the most effective way to do it is to do it and emilia we finally did it many people helped us make this day possible first of all the the amelia earhart statuary hall selection committee for their time and dedication in helping choose the absolute perfect statue thanks also to the beautiful work of the sculptors george and mark lundin who diligently researched images of amelia and visited with the earhart family thanks also to carthage stoneworks for amelia's beautiful pedestal made of cottonwood limestone that was quarried in kansas and finally i also want to thank matthew smith exhibition design manager at the nelson atkins museum in kansas city for his expert guidance it would not have happened without matt the foundation is grateful to all who helped us bring amelia earhart statue to the capitol where her timeless legacy we hope will continue to inspire generations to come with that senator moran uh it is such a pleasure to be here on a day that is we've long waited for and there are those who've waited even longer than i have and you've heard from two of them already we are delighted as kansans to have a statue amelia earhart representing our state you add dwight david eisenhower president and general to amelia earhart and you have two of the most iconic respected figures in our country's history representing our state uh you compare that i shouldn't compare to other states but we are at the top of the list as far as folks who are recognizable uh and worthy of being honored and i would just highlight that while i have the honor of representing so many wonderful communities across kansas there is this place called atchison that is unique and different a set of community leaders that are amazing when they set their mind to doing something it gets done and it is a pleasure to have such a team that has worked so hard to bring this day to occurrence a lot of bureaucracy in this place and raising a lot of money across the country led by karen and others to make sure that amelia earhart their hometown girl is recognized in the capital so congratulations to atchison congratulations to kansas it's been an honor to be part of this process and we're glad that this day has come [Applause] well thank you for being here today uh and thank you particularly to jackie and karen for uh all of the hard work you've done uh you know as the uh the representative of uh uh south central kansas and their capital of the world how can you not talk about amelia earhart as as an inspiration and a key figure in aviation history you know of course uh amelia through her her work and and activities was such an inspiration for uh so many boys and girls and men and women in terms of if you see a challenge you can still put yourself to the task and still step up and and get the job done of course i think like a lot of other people including amelia's now statute mate you know president eisenhower who also has an aviation first he was the first president to fly in a helicopter uh and so it's great that the statue of amelia earhart has joined president eisenhower here in in the capital you know uh i think unlike a lot of people uh amelia was you know uh promoted the values in kansas having flat planes having wide open skies having the the mindset that you can have endless possibilities to do things and where you go and and how you promote that so we want to thank everybody that's that's uh here and been involved in this process i know uh amelia uh persevered in a lot of activities which also isn't reflective of this statue in terms of the process that it took a long time to go through and get that job done i also want to give a a little bit of a uh recognition of uh former member uh representative todd seahart who actually started the process back in the 90s to get the ability to replace statutes and now kansas has replaced both of our statues in the capitol uh the first state to do so with uh modern contemporary uh representatives of our state so uh thank you all for what you've done particularly karen and jackie and and you know all of the uh earhart family members that are here today it's it's great to be able to uh to recognize what's going on uh and honor amelia earhart with her statute and so now i'd like to turn this over to representative sheree stevens uh well good uh afternoon everyone okay it's afternoon now good afternoon everyone thank you so much for being here i i don't know if folks know this but i am a self-proclaimed infrastructure nerd and uh because of that i signed up to be on the transportation and infrastructure committee and immediately wanted to be on the aviation subcommittee uh because kansas has this amazing legacy of uh leadership and innovation when it comes to aviation and certainly uh amelia earhart is uh a pivotal and critical piece of that uh legacy when it comes to uh her spirit determination drive um and frankly her uh inspiration of of so many others i can say that uh the folks in kansas and across the country are uh are so happy that now people are going to be able to participate in that see that and be inspired by the statue that that we saw today being unveiled amelia earhart is known for a number of things but you know particularly for me and and certainly for my mom who is a 20-year army veteran her fight her tireless fight for gender equality uh her ability to overcome the seemingly impossible her ability to be a true agent of change is something that um i know uh has has impacted so many of us across uh across kansas and across the country so i'm excited for the like millions of people that are now going to see this beautiful uh statue as they come to our nation's capital and uh we have long considered amelia earhart to be a a hero certainly for kansas and i think that uh now the u.s capitol is recognizing uh the hero that she is for our country so i will once again say thank you all to the the family to uh the amelia earhart foundation for all your tireless work and to my colleagues who helped navigate the bureaucracy um so thank you so much i am going to now turn it over

all came together and you worked hard like you do on a lot of projects in your in your town atchison is a great place with great people and this is a victory and a celebration for all of them today

so proud that amelia earhart is from atchison kansas and proud that her statue is going to be in this capital building from here on she personifies the kansas spirit she's smart she's tough she's always looking to the future so today is a day to be celebrated for the people of atchison for the amelia earhart family for the people of our great state very proud to be a part of it thank you all [Applause] thank you congressman turner i'm congressman tracy mann represent the first district of kansas um proud day for atchison for the earhart family and for all of kansas you know i live in salina and at our kids school every year for kansas day they go all out and they do a parade but all of the kindergartners every all the kindergarten girls dress up like amelia earhart and it's nothing is more fun than to see all these little girls with ravior goddard aviator goggles thinking about and talking about amelia herrera who continues to inspire generations of kansans it's an honor to have the last word here and i'd like to give it to amelia herself kansas values include hard work and personal responsibility and i came across this quote from amelia earhart that i wanted to read to you all amelia earhart said some of us have great runways already built for us if you have one great take off but if you don't have one realize that is your responsibility to grab a shovel and build one for yourself and for those who will follow behind you representing kansans is an honor because they know how to grab shovels and build their own runways for themselves and for their families it's our job in congress to protect their basic rights to life liberty and their pursuit of happiness while they do that i'm so glad to see this brave pioneer honored with the statue in congress because i know that it'll be an inspiration to generations to come amelia earhart you have and continue to make kansas proud with that i'll turn it back over to senator marshall right thank you gracie thank you thank you thanks so much karen and jack you please both come back up here we're getting ready to do questions and answers and if the other members want to kind of gather in first so we're going to put the two ladies right here one on each side i get the first question though i get the first question karen i get to stand by the two ladies because i'm the junior i'm the junior senator [Laughter] so karen when they pulled down the veil from the statue today what was your emotions what were you thinking today it was so exciting but i think the most fun of the whole time was laura kelly our governor going oh my gosh her belt buckle is kansas yeah that was so cool it was really fun she noticed it right away right away she noticed it jackie any emotions from you was it as it went down i think relief is my biggest emotion it's just been such a long ride and a lot of ups and a lot of downs and a lot of frustration um but to finally see that fall off was just it it's breathtaking i think she's absolutely gorgeous and i think she can just take your breath away and and the impact that she can have on people and what's wonderful is now this the uh architect of the capital wants to patent our design yeah because it was so easy to put up record time i get i get one more question i'm sorry karen what what does amelia earhart mean to you personally personally personally you know amelia personifies everything i try to do you fight for what you believe and you go to the death to do it and she did unfortunately but i think uh she's always been a mentor to me for that reason she didn't give up and i don't give up there you go all right we'll start here in the in the conference room any questions from the press for senator moran about about the subject yes sir so just like you it's a jigsaw puzzle go ahead jack yeah um the base was designed by matthew smith because we wanted to have a limestone kansas limestone base and then uh the the engineers at the architect of the capitol decided that they needed something that would be easily um balanced because the floors in the capital have become so uneven with all the heavy statues so matt actually designed a steel frame and it is like a puzzle and then all the the limestone things go on it um he texted me when our phone calls with the architect the capital said the installation excuse me could stick until two or three in the morning he texted me at 9 30 and said she's in and i said you're kidding he said no i'm not kidding she's in it was the fastest easiest installation they've ever had and so they though the people there just said you should patent that we should use it for every base going forward because it made things it made things worse yeah it just made things work easier they didn't get done until two o'clock last last week yeah so all right anything else in the the audience i know the earhart's family is here do we have what is it great my grandma my grandmother's sister was minnie so my grandmother was her sister right so we have we have klutner's here and we have morsi's here and we also i don't see her in the room right now but we have one of george putnam's relatives also here and senator uh portman's wife's grandmother was married to amelia earhart i just found out today as well yeah yeah well you found out about a week ago yeah actually anything online will yeah update yourself and um your question go ahead yes thank you so i i know that today is about here but do you have any information on what happens to the john angle statue that she replies i know that when eisenhower replaced george click that statue yeah it disappeared right we we do have a plan for senator ingles he is coming back to atchison and our what's now our middle school used to be the ingalls high school building and it still has his name on the outside of the building so um i have had conversations with our superintendent of schools and the principal and he will go in that building as soon as they can determine where a 12 000 pound statue can sit yeah are both from atchison glick was a governor and ingalls was senate pro tem leader in the early 1900s but unfortunately you lose sight of who they are and what's exciting about what we're doing now is i don't think you'll forget eisenhower or amelia earhart and that's very exciting but i don't know if all of you know that when you replace a statue you have to have you have to take it back the one that you're replacing you have to pay to take it back to kansas and you have to have a place for it or where they will not let you replace the statute they want a plan they want a plan uh methodology of asking you for contributions god no it isn't well that's not funny maybe you could sell that patented device there you go well that's matt i think matt gets to do that though i think matt it's your your patent right okay anymore nobody else online coming back one more time in here as well anything final remarks anybody okay congratulations i'd like to say like i know my grandmother would be very proud today she dedicated her life for her sister she really helped raise me with a very very important person in my life she was and life after what was muriel's life after amelia's death what what was she well i mean she was a school teacher a wonderful school teacher we're from boston and i it doesn't go a week goes by that i don't run into something that says that she was such an important person you know and i i i need to comment on that because muriel is the name of our lockheed electra tenney and the restorer of our plane said and she knew your grandmother very well and she yes and she said she was in the shadows of amelia because of what happened and then when the paparazzi of the time we're looking for what happened to amelia that muriel deserved her place in history too and she is the name of our lockheed elector kenny yeah i think i want to close by just by saying i want to invite everybody this is one of the greatest school trips you could take is to take kids to the amelia earhart hangar museum not only do they have the twin plane uh but they've got some inter incredible stem statues twin statues stem stem interacting 14 stations we'll be fighting to go sir go ahead about amelia's sister muriel in addition to all the other cool stuff she did she also co-founded the local chapter of the naacp that's true they were both activists weren't they yes all right absolutely okay thanks everybody thank you well done thanks for coming thank you ladies

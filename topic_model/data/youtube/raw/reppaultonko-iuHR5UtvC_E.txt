I thank the gentleman for yielding Mr Speaker I ask why are we not addressing gun violence people who aren't allowed to fly because they are suspected of terrorism should not be allowed to purchase firearms I can't believe that in 2015 this is a problem that needs fixing Democrats have tried three times over to open debate on a bill a bill by the way authored by a Republican that would block people on the no-fly list from walking out of a gun shop with their firearm of choice and three times the republican house majority has blocked that opportunity ninety-one percent of the time suspected terrorists pass a background check because the system we have in place does not check to see if a potential buyer is on the no-fly list this is absolutely unacceptable I ask leadership in this house to immediately bring to the floor Republican Congressman Peter King's bill to close the loophole that allows suspected terrorists to buy guns and if they won't I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to sign the discharge petition a petition currently before the house to force a vote on this bill we must allow the house to work the will of the people instead of those in Congress who are more concerned with losing their a rating with the NRA than keeping Americans safe let us address gun violence bring the bill to the floor Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back the balance of my time gentlemen

i i'm just acting and it's like well if you're acting you still have to be doing the job [Music] i love oversight not only am i a member of the house oversight and reform committee but i even got a custom license plate ovr s-i-t-e oversight for my minivan and there are few people who understand the importance of oversight better than you walter one area where we need stronger government oversight is around vacant positions president trump says he is in no hurry to name permanent replacements for his acting cabinet members well i'm in no hurry i have acting in no hurry to have nominees grilled in confirmation hearings perhaps something in acting doesn't have to endure until nominated for the actual position is this a partisan problem so it absolutely is not it's an issue of the separation of powers and the importance of congress conducting meaningful oversight and the vetting process is exhaustive but it's intended to be that way so we can make sure we have the best people in the job and leaving those vacant and putting unqualified people in acting positions just undermines that and that should be a concern of all americans and all members of congress i'm really proud that the accountability for acting officials act recently passed out of the house oversight and reform committee where i serve from your standpoint what is my proposed legislation the accountability for acting officials act what problems does it solve why is it so important so what i like about this in particular is that it clarifies a lot of ambiguity in the vacancies reform act and i think it provides some real certainty putting people permanently in those positions through the constitutional process is really crucial to government and i think it does it in a way that creates pressure without unnecessarily impeding your president the goal here is to make sure that the president whoever that person is whatever party thereof is doing the work of identifying qualified nominees putting them through that vigorous vetting process that you described and then putting them before the america the senate where americans can hear their answers to important questions about how they understand the job what they plan to be doing you know what their ethical obligations are how they plan to meet them those are answers that the american people need to get yes absolutely and i'm so glad uh that you're doing the work of taking up this bill it's probably not the kind of bill that gets everyone excited but it should if they truly understood the impact that it has on the functioning of our government and accountability to the american people

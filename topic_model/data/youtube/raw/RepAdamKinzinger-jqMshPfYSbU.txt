[Music] good evening everyone and thank you for joining today's forum event hosted by the institute of politics and public service at the mccourt school of public policy known to many of you as geopolitics my name is matteo caulfield and i'm a junior in the college studying government and classics from whedon illinois i had previous involvement with geopolitics through its student strategy teams last spring i worked for geopolitics fellow sarah sendeck the former public affairs director for the cyber security and infrastructure security agency who helped secure the 2020 election i'm also proud to be the president of the georgetown bipartisan coalition it is a student-led organization dedicated to bridging the political divide in this country and on georgetown university's campus we conduct roundtables host debates and create social events in order to keep college republicans and college democrats in dialogue with each other as an illinois republican myself i have seen my local party leaders have a spectrum of reactions to today's speakers but personally remain in proud support of a representative who chooses to put country over party tonight we are joined by representative adam kinzinger for an important and timely conversation given the moment we find ourselves in as a nation tonight geopolitics is proud to launch how to heal a series on pushing through polarization we all have seen how polarization can impact our lives far beyond the ballot box this era of deep cultural and political division has also translated over into our views of justice opportunity freedom and society so here at geopolitics we want to focus on the issue of polarization we want to explore its causes how it impacts our collective sense of unity and community and what we can do to move past it and come together for the common good featuring guests from diverse perspectives and different walks of public life how to heal explores ways we can move past polarization that defines our politics our public health and so many other aspects of society join us as we welcome our first speaker to launch the series representative adam kinzinger this event is being co-sponsored by the georgetown university college republicans and the georgetown university bipartisan coalition please join the conversation on social media by tagging geopolitics using at geopolitics and the official event hashtag how to heal now i'd like to welcome on to the stage moalithi and representative adam kinzinger hi guys look at this crowd hoya saxa everyone yeah um thank you all for joining us tonight thank you congressman welcome back thanks welcome back to georgetown welcome back to gu politics we were just reminiscing backstage that the last time you were here was for a panel discussion we did back in the day on uh the politics of syria back when people were actually still talking about syria so um thank you you were great then and we're excited to have you here tonight for our inaugural event in our new how to heal series um and look here's the thing like the last couple of years have sucked right they've totally sucked you've had you know between a global pandemic and the summer of 2020 and all the racial upheaval that we saw and then a 2020 presidential election that we are still arguing over and that led to an insurrection at the united states capital but i will say when we returned to campus last fall in september there seemed to be a new energy it was almost as if there was a mental turning of the corner for many of us that maybe we can start to move forward maybe this is a chance for us to heal socially culturally politically so that's what this series is going to focus on and we are so thrilled to have you here to help uh begin to set the table for this conversation so i'm gonna we're gonna talk amongst ourselves for a little bit and then we're gonna i'm not even there yeah we're gonna actually be talking about you and then we're going to open it up and ask you to join the conversation um and my first couple of questions are really broad so you can take it wherever you want to take it but you know here's the thing i we've always had sharp elbows in our politics right and sometimes worse we've had a war with ourselves over whether or not we should keep people in bondage the 1960s were an incredibly tumultuous decade with with riots and protests and political assassinations and the national guard shooting college kids on college campuses is it worse now does it feel worse now give us your assessment before we talk about how to heal help us diagnose the problem how bad is it well i mean i think it feels worse for all of us because we're actually living it right you know and it's not reading the history books about it it is interesting though if you look back into the 60s and you know you recognize i forget the number but the number of political assassinations and attempted political assassinations is insane and you can see when you see those numbers like how people thought you know we may be at a point of society falling apart and somehow within that it just kind of magically seemed to heal almost i mean i'm sure there's a whole number of things that the historians here can say why did we heal but i think it's a lesson for us in terms of that to say okay society and life is always a bit of a pendulum there's always moments you look and you say things are really bad and then there are people that come along and it heals or maybe it's just a natural kind of social tendency to heal and that's my hope by the way is that in the depth of kind of this terrible moment we're in and i think we have to be honest about it you know you opened up and said it sucks yeah it does suck i mean you know it's like we're living a new chapter of revelation every day here and and so i think we have to recognize that and say what is the answer is the answer for us going to be you know we're going to sit back and wait for somebody to magically come along and fix it or are we going to be part of that solution and i'm sure you'll get into these questions but i want to kind of have a little teaser here and say i don't know if it's worse than it was in the 60s or not but that is our choice that's our determination do we want to do we want to make this time be like the end of the story of america or the story of american democracy or do we want this to be one of those things that say you know it was dark before the light came and that is a choice we all get to make that's the awesome thing about self-governance that's what you're seeing in ukraine right now or people that are willing to defend to the death their ability to determine their own future their ability to say we want to you know we want to be who we want to be you know for us we thankfully are not at a point where we have to give our lives for that cause so actually the price is fairly easy at this moment even if it doesn't feel that way and i gotta tell you it is gonna be your generation um that will make that difference because there are too many kind of old people in politics that that are still fighting the same battles they've always thought you know they're arguing the same stuff they were arguing in the 60s right or you know same solutions to the same problems and you guys will be the one that are going to have to come along and fix problems and also change how we deal with each other and make the determination that this is not going to be worse than 1960 and it's going to be the beginning of really an american comeback and renewal just another quick thing on that and if you look back to and i don't i don't know the details of this as well because i actually am stealing this from somebody who's uh if you guys remember hearing about pineapple express so back in afghanistan i know the movie so this is like the one where they rescued everybody in afghanistan like a different pineapple express so back when afghanistan was falling apart in august there were a bunch of basically former special operators that had all these relationships in afghanistan and it led to basically thousands of people being rescued not by the us government by by but by these kind of organic movements and so a guy named scott mann has an organization called rooftop and and he keeps making the point and i did his podcast actually about a week ago that it was in the worst times like right prior to you know world war ii there were some real social problems in this country and that's when you saw the rise of future farmers of america a little organization called alcoholics anonymous where two people got together and determined that they should you know come up with a list of principles and steps to sober up that's where you saw this massive social movement from the ground up and that's what changed society and that's the moment we're at now and it's our determination so there are a couple of different threads i want to pull on there you've talked a lot about in the past toxic tribalism and how dangerous that is to democracy and i agree with you i actually believe that these filter bubbles that we live in and that you know through a series of conscious and subconscious decisions that we make every day are isolating ourselves from one another one of the things we talk about a lot at the institute is the need to pop those every now and then and just try to see one another and hear one another but here's the thing that scares me i sometimes wonder if people want to hear and listen and understand one another right like you guys know i'm a democrat and i my side gig is i'm a democrat on payroll at fox news and i get so many trolls that come after me after my hits and said you're democrat i'm out of here and there it is um but you know they come at me and they say i don't know why fox employees are you should go to cnn or msnbc where you belong you're not welcome here you don't belong here this is you're invading our safe space talk a little bit about that like how do we get past that are the america do people really want to get past that you know it's a great question and there's real comfort in whatever your social circle is so if you think about when i was a kid your friend group was kind of um who lived in your neighborhood right that was my friends that i played with but that was also my parents friends they had friends obviously outside of that but you know if you're out mowing your lawn and the neighbors out you may have a beer with the neighbor that becomes kind of your social circle that doesn't happen anymore uh and i think it was particularly accelerated too with covid but now people find their social circle on the internet so let's say you're pro second amendment here and so you decide gee i'm going to get my social circle in a pro second amendment group or anti-second whatever it is whatever the issue is and so that becomes your social circle on facebook so you go home you're on facebook you're on whatever and you're typing you're angry you guys are all agreeing with each other you feel like you belong to something right and we all want to belong by the way i actually think people fear and this gets into a whole thing of like why are politicians scared to take tough votes i think people actually fear being kicked out of their social circle and isolated more than they fear death and i think that is what you know part of the driving on that whole separate issue but when it comes to things like now you're on facebook you're in a let's say a second amendment group let's say you're pro second amendment but you say you know i think the uh age to purchase an ar should be raised from 18 to 21 because it's 21 to buy a pistol and let's say you say that on that social group well what's going to happen well they're going to call you a rhino i've been called a rhino before you know they're going to call yeah that's right yeah that's a that's a nice day for me um but you will be kicked out of that circle you'll be kicked out of that group you don't belong here and so i think people have gotten to the point where you know thinking through things like how do i understand a problem from somebody's eyes how do i empathize with them it is hard work to do that by the way the easy thing is just to find the group because we have it with technology now where you can belong you don't have to think too much and you can just sit there and feel good so yeah i mean i think what you're saying is a real problem how do we get there is another question to where people want to change that and i think some of that social pressure just social movements but the baseline is this and i would encourage all of you if you don't have a friend that disagrees with you politically i mean don't just go make a friend that you don't like right but like try to find somebody that thinks differently from you and try to have a just a see if you guys can just talk to each other and understand from each other's eyes i'm going to tell you this you take the furthest right the furthest left person and you boil down what is their fear okay the only reason conflict exists is conflict arises from fear so if you talk to somebody on the right and the left and you say what is your fear and they give you an answer you go no deeper than that what's your fear what's your fear for the most part in a political setting people are scared that this country is not going to accept them or leave them behind okay that is when now both people who have very different views recognize and look in each other's eyes and say your fear is the exact same as mine that disarms everybody and it begins you begin to see things sympathetically so get off the internet but i mean such it's such a great point because you know i've i'm i'm a believer that we're sort of in this populist era you know because of that because peop everybody feels like they in their communities are being left behind and you you go and you talk in a rural community or in an inner city and you're hearing the same challenges right you're hearing the same concerns but we're sort of conditioned to just assume the worst of of the other we've been doing some polling at the institute over the past couple of years on the issue of civility and polarization right like what we want to get at is how bad do people think it is who do they blame but do they really want it right and so how bad is it everyone thinks it's bad who do they blame they kind of blame everybody including their own team but they kind of blame everybody but it's that last question do they really want more civility do they really want to tackle the polarization if you ask them do you want more civility in politics like 93 say yes right that's the easy answer yeah but then ask the question a little bit differently agree or disagree with these statements number one common ground and compromise are noble goals we want our leaders to aspire to like 78 say they agree with that that they want common ground that they want compromise very next question agree or disagree i'm tired of leaders who compromise on my values i want them to stand up and fight the other side 74 say they agree with that right of course i want common ground as soon as you're standing where i'm at will be on common ground and you look at this manifest itself with you know members of congress who say crazy stuff and then can raise three million dollars in 25 increments overnight or people on cable news saying crazy stuff and the ratings go through the roof so it brings me to the incentive structure right for those of you in the arena like how do you walk that line when people are saying no i want you to get stuff done with the other side just you know don't compromise on anything that's important to me go ahead and say crazy stuff yeah it's funny because i'll always say stuff like you know civility common ground that kind of stuff and then you always inevitably if you look at twitter it's like oh i thought you were different because i'm actually a conservative republican and it's like oh i thought you were different you thought what i was a liberal democrat i'm not i just think that we ought to be able to co-exist and make each other better in this process and so yeah i mean i think i think there's moments where you either have to have mature leaders or a mature population okay and i don't mean mature like pejoratively like you're immature but mature in terms of how you're looking at a political system at the moment you can have crazy leaders like we have right now you have crazy leaders but if the population demands differently or demands better then the country's fairly stable if you have people with these passions like this kind of populism is on fire and i think this is more of what we've had in the past but you've had leaders that then say look we understand what's what you know the division that's being stoked and the anger but we're still going to work together to achieve these things then you can survive that unfortunately we're at a moment where both are lost and so you talk about the incentive structure so you know washington dc and like the whole capitol building as cool as it is and ornate as it is it was created for one reason it's like a steam pot like a pressure cooker so you take all the anger and the division and the differences that exist in society you distill them into that building into political arguments you have your political arguments you let the steam out and you have a solution that's what that was all created for was to prevent violence out here and that allowed us to solve our problems but what's happened is and that's what the founding fathers kind of had in mind with this idea of a republic and not a direct democracy well what's happened is with the new media environment with the fundraising incentive structure people now believe they know more than members of congress and members of congress on whatever issue members of congress raise a ton of cash on fear on fear because if i tell you that i am the one that's going to protect either nancy pelosi or mitch mcconnell from killing your family right it's almost that bad in fundraising you will part with anything including your money to prevent that from happening if i truly believed that you were gonna kill my wife and kid i would give you every dollar i had right anybody would and that's in essence what's been happening in politics because every difference every issue now we have laid out as a life and death thing for 12 years at least or as long as i've been in politics and it's just gotten worse and worse so how do we change it well that's the big question that's the one i don't have the answer to and i think we also need to be we need to be able to recognize we don't have the answer to everything and say but there's somebody out there that does i don't know who it is maybe one of you which is how do we within the within the constraints of free speech in the constitution change the incentive structure so saying something crazy doesn't raise you you're three million and you go out and win i think there's gonna have to be some version of campaign finance reform first off but secondarily we need people to recognize when they're being swindled okay how many of you here are on some you signed up for some campaign thing and now you're getting like 30 spam emails a day now by the way that's doing more to radicalize people than just about anything because when you look at the headline in your inbox and you're seeing 30 different messages a day of this person's the devil this person wants to kill you everything that has that that messes with your mind what we need is people to throw to vomit that out and say no more right so i have this organization country first and uh you know it's it's it's trying to change this toxic tribalism but one thing i refuse to do is to raise money on fear so when we have to raise money we do it in a way that's optimistic and hopeful because i don't want to be part of radicalizing the country further you put out a video today on twitter a little angry today yeah um check it out it's on twitter uh he was getting ready to to do a whole tweet thread and he's like you know what let me just let me just record this uh it's a fun rant but you the the the crux of it is your colleagues are children yeah right that's what you said that that my colleagues are children talk about that yeah i mean you know the one the one thing i would do differently if i if i kind of went back in time to this morning and recorded is i'd i try to end it on a more optimistic message which is like here is how we can make a difference because it's one thing to point out a problem and i think we have to do that i think we need to be clear about what the problem is but i was sitting there and you know look russia is invading ukraine on fox news you have tucker carlson that you know just asks questions sometimes and he's he made the comment about why shouldn't i root for putin or why is it that you why are we told we can't root for putin is it you know did putin whatever his list of issues were we have members of congress that say like oh yeah i mean sure we want ukraine to win but zielinski's corrupt no he's not you know and and all this kind of stuff when this is a serious moment none of us in this room unless there's a world war ii veteran here has ever been at a moment in the world so important geopolitically as right now because for 80 years we have all benefited from the fact that you know the united states has been at least in the top couple countries at any moment we live in a fairly secure world our biggest threat is nuclear weapons but you know that's kind of yes it's existential but we know nobody's going to really start launching nukes at each other and we know that nation borders pretty much stay the same this is the first time in 80 years that we have seen for the sole purpose of a land grab or to exterminate a country something like this happening this is a very serious moment i've been to the country of georgia a couple of times and i got to tell you too they've been sitting there with a third of their country occupied and we've pretended like it didn't happen in 2014 ukraine so all this is going down and i'm hearing about the latest outrage that's being provoked is that disney came out opposed to the florida law and so now there's all this boycott disney outrage of the day it used to be dr seuss and look i hate cancel culture on the right and left by the way i hate all of it but what i also hate too is this like stoking cultural anger and division for the sole purpose of ratings and money and so i just sat down and said look at the most important moment in world history that any of us have ever been alive in and hopefully will ever be alive and because i don't want it to get any worse like we are sitting here debating the latest cultural issue the cultural fight you are being governed by a bunch of children look there are good members of government clearly there really are but a lot of people getting the attention are a bunch of kids that don't understand the gravity of this moment to an extent i think we're we're we're we kind of suffer from an embarrassment of riches of sort like of living in such security of of you know being as in essence wealthy as we are as a nation that we have the ability to sit around and argue about walt disney but i was furious this morning and i think it's important for us to put that message out to folks to just say demand better right when we talk about compromise and common ground i'm not talking about somebody giving up what they believe and going and becoming moderate or squish or not arguing like keep that but recognize you live in a society with people that are different than you and by the way if you get married that's something you gotta learn too you're gonna have to co-exist with somebody very different from you and uh and that's a good that's a good art and a good skill yeah there's just that last point reminded me of this polling that i've seen that shows it's been asking for several years um would you be offended if your child married outside of your fill in the blank yeah and um for the first time in recent years outside your party offends more people than outside race or religion yeah so i guess in a way but i want you to think about that too for a second like actually the most arbitrary thing in the world that you should pick a friend on if you really think about it is their view of government like it's like the most arbitrary like i want to pick a friend on who i like to hang out with you know who has common interests your view of government is actually the stupidest reason to go find somebody as a friend but that's what we all use um in a few moments we're going to open up the conversation to all of you so start thinking about your questions um so like we're painting a pretty bleak picture here right in this conversation like our motto at the institute no joke our motto is public service is a good thing politics can be too yeah like is there a reason that we should keep that motto like based on this conversation i don't know i mean what where's the where is the optimism that we can turn the corner and that through politics affect the kind of change you're arguing we need the kind of healing that you're arguing we need so that's a great point is recognizing you know the first step right to recognizing your problems admitting you have a problem we have a problem now why am i optimistic and how can we kind of heal and why is politics still an honorable thing to get in well first off for me i represent 750 000 people so i was flying home my freshman year i'm looking out the window flying back to chicago and i just see this you know i'm a pilot you know how you know if you're in the room with a pilot he'll tell you um or she'll tell you but i'm looking out the window and i see this giant city and i realize that's probably a city of a hundred thousand people and i'm like i represent like seven times that and and so from whether it's on the city council whether it's congress whether it's anything you recognize that no matter what the environment is in politics you're the voice for people that are angry they're upset or they're happy but you're the one that has to take their voice from a staff perspective if you're working for a member of congress you're actually like the congress person because staff is so important and so that is where we can make real change that is where we can make a real difference and until we actually put good people in this business that are willing to put their careers on the line by the way to say the right thing to say what needs to be said then it's going to get worse but that's why i'm optimistic because your guys's generation i gotta tell you is so interested and engaged in this stuff and they're so fed up that we're not gonna see a generation of people that are fed up and say we're just not gonna pay attention you all are fed up and you're gonna you're gonna be spurned to action so that's why i really do believe otherwise i wouldn't even be doing this i mean honestly i'd go like you know figure out how to live the rest of the time in a secure country as best i can until we all fall apart i really believe that we're at the end of those dark moments and that we're going to come back pretty strong from this but that's that's literally in your guys's hands there are two standing mics one in each aisle we're going to start taking your questions now so just start lining up at those microphones and when when it's your turn i'll call it you tell us who you are your school your year where you're from and then your question as succinctly as possible so feel free to start taking to the mics and let's start right over here hi hi is this on yeah yup um i'm kesley i'm a freshman in the college i'm studying biology although that is another issue we can call my mom about that but my question is that you guys have painted this picture of everybody who thinks that their issue is life or death and i want to know how we make the decision of who has to compromise and who feels like who gets to choose like which issues have to give or where we actually have to compromise because like i can say like yeah there are issues that i would compromise on but i can say that because i'm not a member of necessarily the groups that feel like they're being under attack if that makes any sense that's a great question and uh by the way just so you know as you're trying to figure out biology i failed out of college my first year because i was in a fraternity and i worked in a department store for six months reapplied to the college then got all straight a's but changed my major in that process so no matter what you challenge with you too can be a congressman even if you my second semester gpa was a 0.8 listen you got to work hard to get a 0.8 okay all right so that's a little about me in terms of how to figure out compromise this is the art this is the art of human interaction there's no science to it there's no metric you can put on an issue and say this is x important to you it's why important to me here's the mathematical solution it is human interactions you know if you're if you're married or you're dating somebody how is it that you figure out if you go to applebee's or chili's the two best restaurants in the world right there's not necessarily a science behind it but there's you have interactions and you figure this out there are going to be tough issues that will never come to a solution on probably you know guns abortion all those ones that nobody wants to talk about at the dinner table including me um and so you're going to have differences on those but there are also things like let's take the issue of immigration there are some people that say we just want border security some that say we just want you know amnesty or a legal path to citizenship actually i tell you what if we secure the border we put a legal path to citizenship and uh you know xyz that's a 90 issue that americans agree with we could solve immigration easier than any issue but we're not doing it because i both sides have kind of set back in their corners and that's where when it comes to compromise there's going to be some things you don't solve but i always say if there is a you know if i have to vote on the floor for a spending bill or whatever the bill is and i say neither side likes it usually it's a pretty good compromise and so yeah the the bottom line is there's no scientific thing it's art but that's what all human interaction is um if my future partner picks if the options are applebee's and chili's we're divorcing yeah that's probably smart pretty smart no compromise there clubhouse grill at applebee's is pretty good though let me let me just follow up on that real quick because you know i was thinking back to what you said just a couple of answers ago where you said um your views on government are the stupidest reason to pick a pick a friend right there are some people maybe in this room who would say i don't know about that who would say you know what like after charlottesville that was a legit reason to pick a friend that after an insurrection that's a legit reason to pick a friend and i had some students who who came into my office right after the insurrection and we were calling for civility and accessibility is not the issue justice is the issue fairness is the issue and i didn't really know what to say right when you feel like your way of life your identity is under assault how do you approach healing in that case and i don't know that any of us have figured that out yet no i don't think so and you know but i i would say this like it's one thing on the macro level to say an insert i mean i was in the insurrection i wasn't part of it i'm on the committee investigating it um on a macro level that's a huge deal i also know that some of my friends that in congress that have voted differently than me on these january six issues some of them think they're actually voting the right way i don't agree with them but i think there's a difference between the macro and the micro but i would encourage you the more you sit at home filled with hate filled with anger filled with fear the shorter you're going to live and the more miserable your life is going to be all right thanks so much for your question let's go over here um okay uh hi i'm luke i'm a freshman in the college um from boston looking to major in math and i just want to say thank you so much for coming to campus um and so my question is how do you recommend us having these conversations with family members because we don't want to well because you don't want to isolate like your grandparents or your aunts and uncles but you also love them and don't want them to fall into this trap and so to what extent do you recommend us having these conversations and like how far should we go how should we approach it i'm glad you asked that question it's really good first off you know i i think a lot of times with family you don't need to um i think in some cases if mom or dad has been you know radicalized by this tv station or the other there's really no benefit to trying to convince them otherwise i think in that case it's just to show love um at the same time you don't have to subject yourself to abuse you know this the recent one of the recent uh january six rioters that was uh convicted and put in prison his son had to testify against him and said my dad threatened to kill me if i taught if i told the law enforcement about his involvement in january 6. that is a toxic relationship a year ago i got a letter from my dad's cousins and it started out with oh my what a disappointment you are to us and to god and it went through how i've lost the trust of mark levin i'm like oh great good and uh but it was my dad's cousin's disowning me because of my position on january 6th i didn't try to convince them i forgave them in my heart and i cut off all contact with them and i have no desire to ever see or hear from these people again so i think to the extent your parents and stuff whatever the like you don't need to um and i know it's hard sometimes if you know but just try to love them the best you can but if something's toxic and it's harming you then then cut it cut it off thank you thank you thanks thank you oh thank you so much for coming to talk with us to be honest that was kind of my question but i just kind of wanted to dig in a little deeper on that um so maybe not when you're talking with family members but say peers or people on the internet who maybe even make it explicit that they are not willing at all to budge on a certain point of view like are there rhetorical tactics that you can use to like maybe lead them to piece apart their own argument or what's worked for you yeah i mean look i and i'm a victim of getting too involved in twitter sometimes too right so i don't have it all together i want to be clear um i think the problem with the internet with twitter stuff like that twitter is a fantastic thing if you're a public servant to be able to get a message out like the video today 400 000 views i wouldn't have had that any other way um but the problem is you're now faceless so we have something i encourage you guys to go look uh country first we're doing something called a unified challenge and what the point is to get somebody who two people who think very differently from each other they're gonna meet on like zoom and it's a moderated discussion between them where you go through things like what's your fears what's your view how would you compromise here and and we have never seen an example as far as i know where two people have gotten off of that and hated each other usually you see the humanity in each other so in terms of that i think whether it's a friend it's showing your vulnerability and your humanity and your fear to them hopefully they can show that back to you and to understand on the internet rhetorically i don't really have an answer because i think i don't know if too many people have ever been convinced of anything on the internet but i also do think it's important to represent your position there but the best you can do and again this is me giving myself advice as well is when you're going to be in an argument on the internet for instance is to try to see the face and the human person behind it humans are complicated uh and awesome you know but everybody is is not this kind of flat avatar you see when you're on the internet could i do a quick follow-up to that like okay would that tactic then work with relatives per se like asking maybe i think i think if you're talking to a relative and you know their issue bothers you or whatever um i think showing yourself to be human showing your concern and understanding their humanity and and not going into look if your dad is you know a hardcore trumper or whatever it is whatever you don't like your dad's not evil right or or you know if your dad likes loves joe biden and you can't stand them your dad's not evil right he thinks that's right it's it's part of what military stuff you guys know i'm a veteran you always have to think about the fact like al qaeda for instance thinks they're right they think they're the ethical ones you have to think about it through that perspective so yeah thanks alcott is not right though [Music] hey congressman uh thank you so much for your service on all levels in the military and what you're doing in congress right now my name is drew margulis i'm part-time ssp masters and i work in a defense industry full-time um and i'm from your neck of the woods naperville oh cool that's where i grew up yeah um and actually you're you're where my roommate who's a conservative and it's like a blue dog democrat bond you know we we look at you for leadership and appreciate that great oh you guys are both of my supporters that's awesome yeah absolutely i appreciate it yeah but i think it's a testament to like two people with very different views who can live together and have a hell of a good time you know and scream at each other but then hug it out after but what i bless you for bringing up alcoholics anonymous i have a soft spot for that and i'm just curious how you think we can leverage those types of organizations today and for the type of benefit they brought back then and still to this day and like how do we revive a lot of those to bring society back into you know appreciating family values and other uh institutions like that yeah i mean it's a great question and you know i don't have the magic bullet answer but you know back in when aaa whatever the year it was formed whatever it was that was there was about a one year to two year period where a.a future farmers of america the lions club kiwanis all this was formed and it was formed because government was failing people and you know people realize nobody else is coming like we have this view in america that there's always going to be somebody that's going to come and rescue us from whatever moment we're in because there kind of always has been that's not happening like we are the people that have to come and rescue us there's no magic you know person that's going to come down on a unicorn and say here's the here's the solution and and i think so what you saw then was people that felt disconnected depressed and they said nobody's coming we have to be the ones for change that's that moment we're in now and i think one thing you see in the men the skyrocketing mental health crisis the the stuff we're coming out after covid where people feel isolated they hate each other there is a desperate need for human contact even for those of us that don't necessarily love human contact all the time right there is a desperate need for humanity and i think when people understand that and when the answer to the mental health i mean seriously like being able to talk about mental health is extremely important but recognizing some of that solution also is just reconnecting people with people that's how i think it comes back organically it's not going to be a bill in congress you know and and people look because it's the only thing that's on tv or on the internet people look to dc to solve everything dc solves only a few things we're good at you know building a military and building your roads everything else we pretty much suck at and it's your guys's job to do that so yeah that's my rant appreciate it thank you for service congressman my name is carlos jacon i am a foreign service grad student and i used to work for a company in rockford your district and i know some people they call you a rhino yeah well i know a lot of people that call me yeah so i am venezuelan-american and i know how dangerous it is when a political party is keeping up by populism and hate so my two questions are first what is your plan to work against the republicans being kidnapped by mega populism trump etc and how do you do that can you bring some optimism towards that because it's very hard to see it and second following on your words about staff how do i intern for you you got a resume drop in the back right yeah uh no we're happy to we're happy to chat with you about it uh just reach out to the office on that um yeah look i mean in terms of the in terms of you know the party look i i mean the republican party is going through a bad moment right now in my view um and and i think my hope is that's a cycle my hope is that you know sanity prevails there's i know there's people in this room that probably would not consider themselves pro-trump but would consider themselves moderate to conservative you're going to be part of that solution of remaking that and i think i personally think if the republican party continues down this road it'll cease to be a party eventually because i think it's unsustainable so all you can do is just be just be honorable to what you believe like that's it by the way that's the hardest thing to do is to take a step the very first time melissa could share this with you as well because when you speak out that's when you lose your social group that's when your social group turns on you and that is sometimes something worse than death and i've been through that for a while and i know she has and some of that too um but that's where you can look at yourself in the mirror and feel pretty good about it in terms of uh you talking about where are you from i'm again american okay you know one of the really dangerous things that we see in central and south america is when a new government comes in and then prosecutes the old government and then you know it's based on fear darkness lies stuff like that my wife is salvadorian and you know we see a lot of that as well and that's why we have to be very careful when we talk about prosecuting prior that's why i was so against all this locker up chant in the election right there is a difference however in when you have an attempted insurrection on the country and i think a country then requires accountability self-governance is really hard it's much easier to have an authoritarian trust me it is much easier you don't have to think about anything self-governance is hard but there has to be a basic level of trust among everybody in self-governance and that also includes that if you lose you're going to lose honorably thank you i know you can't get into a lot of the details of the work of the january 6th committee but do you think accountability is achievable as you define it i do so we're not a criminal investigation so we're not going to we can't throw anybody in jail certainly doj can look at our work and make decisions off of that it's public it will be public when we when we produce it for me accountability is less about you know we put out the report we have our hearings that next day being accountable and it's about historic accountability i'm going to tell you anybody that is out there pretending like january 6 didn't happen or it was tourists or whatever in five or ten years they're going to they're going to be very embarrassed about their role in history i don't think i'm going to be embarrassed about my role it's not why i do it it's not why i've chosen to be on the committee i don't care if i go down to obscurity nobody ever talks about me again but i know that my son's not going to be embarrassed i can't say that with all my colleagues and i know in 5 or 10 years with all the disinformation that's out there on january 6 today in five and ten years there will be an accurate depiction and portrayal of what happened and who is responsible and that'll be because of the work of the january six committee so for me that's the goal and to make sure that you all can see what went wrong and how to never have that happen again and hopefully doj then can take some of that and make people criminally accountable that deserve it um hi uh my name is cole i'm in the sfs and um i think we can all agree that you know depolarization and compromise is a great thing especially when it's when it's um when we have the same values and it's just different ways of getting to those values but what do we do when those values are contradictory they can't be put together and i'm gonna ask about something that happened yesterday there was an anti-trans protest that happened near or on campus what do we do how do we decrease polarization with people who are like oh you shouldn't exist or like oh um like your religion doesn't matter like how do we what do we do about that you just move on with your life i think i think you know if people won't accept you if people you know have values that are completely that you can't coexist and there's some of that right like i i could not find compromise with vladimir putin right i mean you know in some cases that's the case and that's where you have to be accountable to yourself and your own life and try to move on from it you know now i'm not saying if somebody's doing an anti-trans protest that you shouldn't go out and counter protest maybe you should right but you shouldn't go home if you can't control it and try to replay that in your mind so much that it hurts you uh look i mean compromise guys is not is not mealy-mouthed you know let's all just get along it's really just understanding that the other side of a political argument is human and they're also not your enemy and i think if we can get to that basic level then we're going to be in a really good spot thank you yup hi congressman how are you um my name is john i'm a freshman in the school of foreign service um and i'm from long island new york i also work part-time on the hill for representative andrew garberino who like yourself takes some tough votes sometimes and as an intern i hear a lot of it on the phone yeah you guys have the hardest job i appreciate that so my question is when certain elected officials have consistent public disapproval with their party the examples i that come to mind are now representative republican representative andrew and former representative justin amash a lot of people will throw their hands up and leave the party so my question is what has made you stay with the republicans through your disapproval and the natural follow-up to that being what about the 2022 republican party is is so redeemable as we approach a midterm election you know look it's a great it's a great question and i answer it with this the party that i joined when i became a republican i was six years old when i started paying attention to politics probably some of you in here were like that um the party that i believe in that's missing today i still believe i hope can be fixed and solved that's my hope and uh look the republican party's been here since the 1850s it's probably going to be around for a long time so is the democratic party and what you have in the past we really had four parties you had liberal republicans conservative republicans liberal democrats conservative democrats we really have gone from four parties to two and that's where i think you have to fight within the soul of the party now i will say though um that if this goes on for a while and i see that there's no redemption for the republican party i'm not wed to being a republican i'm not a democrat i don't i don't believe in you know 99 of democratic policies doesn't mean i think they're bad it's just not who i am um but yeah there will certainly if without change be a point at which i would no longer consider myself republican but i think the party's worth fighting for at this moment particularly when it's being taken over by authoritarians thank you very much appreciate it let's go over here congressman thank you so much for being here tonight and thanks for all that you do um that's kind of the perfect segue into my question oh also um i'm jack i'm a freshman in the school of foreign service and i'm from pittsburgh um so that's perfect segue into my question which is as you talk about tribalism um i start to think about um some of the other democracies in the world like germany and new zealand um that are sometimes considered some of the healthiest democracies in the world and they typically have about four to five parties and so my question is after you just talked about how we used to have somewhat more of a four-party system than a two um is now the time for a breakup of this two-party system and if not um what do you propose we do about it where do you look i would love to see it i i mean i would love to see competition um the problem is the barriers in place are really high and let's say let's say let's say i decided to run as an independent right for president sounds great to everybody it's like oh good and then we start getting into issues we have been brainwashed to believe there's only two sides to every issue so then somebody asked me are you pro-gun or anti-gun and i answer that question oh well i'm the other side so i'm gonna go vote for this person that's what we've you have been programmed by the man and the deep state to believe that there are only two sides to every issue there's actually a bajillion sides to every issue even on the really controversial things there's like different increments of stuff that's the problem so how do we break that mindset and then the institutional barriers if you want to run as an independent in illinois for instance for congress you have to have like 10 000 signatures from people that have never once voted in a primary or if you want to run as a republican or democrat you need 300 right so those are some of the institutional hurdles but i would love to see competition happen i would love it and if you don't mind me asking is there anything that this current congress and this current system can do now to facilitate that because there are people on both sides that like that would like to see it yeah i mean look i don't think we can do anything to facilitate it i think you guys can and i think you know if there is ultimately a movement and understanding that we like let's say for presidential candidate as an independent we want somebody that's going to change the system we don't care what they personally believe and it's not even about issues it's about saving democracy and come hell or high water we're going to make sure this happens you can make it happen but if we get back into our yeah but the thing that's most important is where do you stand on taxation where do you stand on these tired issues we argue all the time you'll never break the two-party system but if we can get to the point where people are thinking a presidential candidate for instance that says we're going to let congress decide these issues my job is to sign them if it's a bipartisan agreement and to protect you because you know our president is obviously very powerful when it comes to foreign policy we could change a system can we get there i don't know good question thanks good evening congressman my name's charlie i'm a sophomore in the college um so you're the first speaker in this how to heal series and my question for you is this who should be the next three speakers in this series who else should we be listening to either in academia or in journalism or on the other side of the aisle in this conversation can you guys get jesus in here that would be good we need some jesus in here um no look i uh um somebody i really really really really admire who i think you guys should have is arthur brooks um arthur brooks used to be american enterprise institute he's uh he's conservative but you never necessarily know it he talks about human empowerment human you know the importance of humanity he's actually written a new book about the second half of your life basically and how your career peaks way before you realize it and how to embrace that uh one of the smartest that's who i know on the conservative side i find the equivalent of him on the democratic side and either put them together or have them separate but those are a couple i'd say offhand i'll keep my answers short because i know we're running low on time and a ton of people got a couple thank you questions yeah thank you thank you thanks for being here congressman hi my name is gabe i'm a sophomore in the college i was wondering you're talking a little bit before about the direction of your party you know obviously just today congressman fred upton your colleague announced he won't be running for reelection you've also announced you won't be facing primary voters in the next election and four of the 10 republicans who voted to impeach president trump last year have announced that i'm curious what message you think that sends about that kind of fight for the party you were talking about about which kind of faction the party has the strength right now yeah so the question is this like what's what's the better message not taking on an unwinnable fight or taking it on and getting crushed which one does trump gloat moreover right look in my case personally even if none of this was happening i probably wouldn't run again anyway i've been in 12 years 12 years is a long time in this job i have a new kid right fairly new marriage my i am so passionate about fighting for uh healing in this country and the political stuff that i think it actually it hinders me being in the house right now because i have to take all these controversial votes while then talking about some of these other big things and you lose audiences um but look i i think it sends it doesn't necessarily send a message about the people it sends a message about the party and the party is look you have you you say you want honorable people to go and vote their conscience and then when they do you throw them out um so yeah i mean i i think i think it's not the best message but i think it's the reality of where we are which is hey you know we're in a moment where if you vote to impeach the president for an insurrection it's tough to survive thank you thanks let's take two more and then i've got a closing question because i know you got yeah and anybody behind the two front ones you were slow so don't blame us got a fast one then uh yeah um hi there congressman thanks so much for being here uh my name is zach i'm a sophomore in the school of foreign surface and my question sort of segues from the previous one which is we've had a great conversation today obviously about the origins of polarization and division among the american electorate and the public but i guess going into this on the electoral level um you know one of the main reasons for polarization in congress has been uh gerrymandered congressional districts and the fact that yeah i'm sure no stranger to this but the fact that you know the number of even districts has been dwindling you know year after year and i guess on a practical level how do we foster you know candidates who are more moderate or open to compromise or more you know ideologically heterodox considering the fact that these districts are just becoming more and more polarized vote in primaries so i have a uh you know country first the organization we've got a movement called primary first where we're encouraging people if you live in a republican district for instance you may be an independent or a democrat and you're like i'm not a republican i'm not pulling a republican ballot you should because if you're going to be represented by a republican you have no voice then in who that's going to be um and and so i think on the on the near term it's that vote in a primary pick on the long term yeah i mean i think you know redistricting reform sure i don't know if that's necessarily going to happen i think it's it's uh you know changing in the financial system and i do think there's real merit and things like ranked choice voting yeah thank you thanks we'll do one more here congressman thank you so much for being here um my name is ken searing i am a masters of policy management student here at the mccord school and i come from a bit of an unorthodox background of being a peace corps volunteer who became a police officer for the past 10 years dang man and what one thing i noticed over the past several years especially getting up to 2020 was a growing belief in the big lie a lot of the election disinformation that we saw happening i mean in fact we saw that uh police officers um off-duty from around the country some of them are in trouble for assaulting the capital yeah and a lot of this that i that i heard was because they uh didn't many of them didn't understand how things worked or were supposed to work and i'm wondering uh what your opinion would be on the state of civics education in this country and you know like forms of national service and how more of those could be doing a good job to bring that's a great question look civics education needs to be reprioritized you know the question is can we agree on what civics are now you know i don't know um but i think that has to be reprioritized you know the importance of voting the importance of paying attention um you know the importance of being a citizen right of of being a good citizen uh i think that is important what was the second part because you mentioned the civics and then uh national service so americorps peace corps teacher yeah so look i would love to see something similar to the gi bill for things like americorps peace corps i don't want to see a draft in the military i still want you guys to have to register for the draft because we may need you at some point but the one thing i don't want to do i'm a lieutenant colonel in the military i don't want anybody working for me that didn't want to be there um that's why we're so good because people are there voluntarily but i think you know if you choose to go to the military or americorps peace corps there's got to be some real incentives for that i think that changed the other the thing it does beyond just taking you out of your shell is if you're raised in a like a rural white town and now all of a sudden you're working with somebody from the inner city that you've never met anybody like that well that that that is game-changing and life-changing for you as you all know when you've come across people that are from very different backgrounds so i think you're right and i'll say too quickly on the police officer side of things one of the biggest tragedies my buddy is michael fanon now who was the officer that was drugged down the stairs and beaten you know he went into this like a hardcore conservative republican right and he's like all his friends have disowned him his cop friends because they thought that you know what he was doing was you know feeding the democratic narrative like this is an officer that do was doing his job was almost killed and between police and the people wearing military uniforms or veterans that were at that have done more to discredit the military thankfully you know it's still bipartisan appreciated and i think polices too uh but yeah that was a big disappointment thank you i want to close out with two super quick questions um and they kind of are on the same theme individual responsibility right this is all about how to heal we can talk about some of the big systemic changes we we need to make but we all need to play a role so my first question about individual responsibilities you you're stepping down we've talked about you've talked about how you're stepping down you're you're jumping into to country first what does the fight uh look like for you moving forward and uh does that include a presidential run you know i had to ask look so when it comes to like individual responsibility your responsibility is to be a good citizen right to be a good person don't put this is something this is a mistake i made early on and a mistake that i think everybody makes early on in politics is you put the weight of the world on your shoulders and you put what's going wrong on your shoulders and you carry that burden you can't i mean i can't stop until i'm president someday maybe you know this is the second question unless you're president you can't stop you know russia from invading ukraine even if you are you probably can't stop it so don't bear that burden but know what's going on and understand the importance of that in terms of for me i mean look honestly it's funny i have no plans on running for president i haven't this isn't like some and it's hard when you politicians because they're all cold and calculated out like 20 years but by the way everybody in politics that has a five or ten year plan always fails to achieve it right everybody fails to achieve it they're all going to be this chairman or they're going to be that person i think the key to life is just do the right thing be conscious of the future and then see what opportunities open up or where that look my faith tells me that if there is a moment at which i'm needed to rise to some occasion i'm willing to do it but i'm not planning it so when it comes to president look i'd never rule it out um if this if country first explodes and there's a demand for people that are speaking differently and i'm that guy sure but i'm not going to sit back and and plan my way to that all right um congressman um first of all i want to thank all of you for coming i want to thank georgetown college republicans and the bipartisan coalition for co-sponsoring with us i want to thank our fantastic spring fellow alyssa farah griffin for helping to bring the congressman i said to her you know listen we want to do the series on how to heal and she's like oh i know a guy and and here you are so thank you um and you know congressman the jesuits here at georgetown teach us all from day one of our freshman orientation that we are all women and men for others your entire career has exemplified that and so along with everyone else thank you for your service your continued service whatever that may look like in the future and for helping us kick off this this incredibly important and sadly to timely conversation yeah thank you guys thank you appreciate it

STATES MARSHALS HAD NEVER IN  HISTORY DONE BEFORE. >> HISTORICALLY FEDERAL JUDGES  HAVE HAD A HARD TIME DEFENDING  THEMSELVES. IT IS NOT JUST LIMITED TO THE  OUTSIDE PARTISAN -- THIS IS A  SPEECH BY A UNITED STATES  SENATOR CALLING THE JUDGE A LIFE LONG RIGHT WING ACTIVIST  PARTISAN IDEOLOGUE AND  ANTI-APPORTION ZEALOT. I WONDER IF YOU WILL JOIN ME IN  CONDEMNING THAT SORT OF ATTACK. >> I'M AGAINST DIVISIVE RHETORIC OF ALL KINDS BUT I DO NOT HAVE  AUTHORITY IN THIS MATTER. >> Harris: JOHN CORNYN OF TEXAS  IN "FOCUS" NOW ROUNDING OUT THAT MONTAGE. A MEMBER OF THE JUDICIARY  COMMITTEE ALSO YOU SIT ON THE  FINANCE AND INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEES AS WELL. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT WAS THE  HIGHLIGHT OF THAT HEARING  YESTERDAY WITH THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL WOULD YOU SAY? >> HARRIS, I THINK MORE IN TERMS OF LOW LIGHTS RATHER THAN  HIGHLIGHTS. BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED. MERRICK GARLAND SERVED FOR MANY  YEARS AS A FEDERAL JUDGE. BY ALL ACCOUNTS WAS A FAIR  JUDGE. BUT HE KNOWS THAT THESE ATTACKS  AGAINST THE JUDICIARY, WHETHER  IT'S THE SUPREME COURT OR OTHER  JUDGES, IS UNFAIR AND IT IS  DANGEROUS. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE PERHAPS  UNSTABLE PEOPLE CAN BE INCITED  TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND  INDEED IT WAS JUST LAST YEAR  THAT JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WAS BEING THREATENED WITH ASSASSINATION. I WOULD HOPE THAT MERRICK  GARLAND AS THE CHIEF LAW  ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE  UNITED STATES WOULD CONDEMN IT  BUT HE WOULDN'T DO IT. >> Harris: IT TOOK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MANY DAYS  TO EVEN MENTION THAT WAS GOING  ON. YOU KNOW, I HAD JUST TOLD  VIEWERS THAT A LOT OF HOT TOPICS CAME UP. THIS WAS ONE OF THEM. A NEW REPORT FROM THE  "WASHINGTON POST" SAYS  TEMPERATURES WERE FLARING OVER  THE RAID ON TRUMP'S MAIER LAG  OWE PROPERTY. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OVERRULED F.B.I. OFFICIALS HESITANT TO  CARRY OUT THAT SEARCH. IT LOOKED LIKE A RAID FOR  CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS. HERE IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON  THAT. >> MY QUESTION IS HOW OFTEN DO  YOU OVERRULE F.B.I. FIELD AGENTS FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES? >> THAT IS NOT AN ACCURATE  REFLECTION OF WHAT A ARTICLE  SAYS. I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE  INVESTIGATION. AS A GENERAL MATTER AT A HIGH  LEVEL OF GENERALITY IN MY  EXPERIENCE, LONG EXPERIENCE AS A PROSECUTOR, THERE IS OFTEN A  ROBUST DISCUSSION. >> Harris: ROBUST DISCUSSION. IT SOUNDED LIKE IT GOT TEMPERS  FLARING. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? >> WELL, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  UNFORTUNATELY IS UNDERMINING  TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE  F.B.I. AND WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE  DIFFERENT TREATMENT IN DIFFERENT CASES WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS  INVOLVED OR THE VICE PRESIDENT  PENCE AND THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP,  THEY COME TO THE CONCLUSION IN  THE ABSENCE OF OTHER  INFORMATION, THERE MUST BE A  DOUBLE STANDARD. INDEED THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A  DOUBLE STANDARD AND IT IS  DICTATED BY POLITICS, WHICH IS  UNACCEPTABLE. >> Harris: ALL OF THAT IT BLEW  UP. EVERYBODY KNEW THE RAID HAD GONE ON, SO ON AND SO FORTH AND WE  SAT FOR MONTHS WITHOUT KNOWING  THAT JOE BIDEN HAD CLASSIFIED  DOCUMENTS IN AT LEAST ONE  LOCATION. IT STARTED AT THE PENN BIDEN  CENTER NAMED FOR HIM. HE GOT A MILLION DOLLARS TO USE  HIS NAME FOR THAT. IT IS DIFFERENT TREATMENT. WHY? >> WELL, I THINK UNFORTUNATELY  WE DON'T HAVE AN ATTORNEY  GENERAL THAT HAS THE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER AND THE WILL TO STAND  UP TO THE POLITICS THAT ARE  COMING OBVIOUSLY FROM THE WHITE  HOUSE AND DIRECTING HIS ACTIONS. BEING ATTORNEY GENERAL IS A  TOUGH JOB BECAUSE YOU ARE THE  CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT YOU ARE ALSO  A CABINET MEMBER FOR THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND WHAT WE NEED -- WHAT THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT AND WHAT  THEY DESERVE IS IMPARTIAL  JUSTICE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT  FEAR OF FAVOR REGARDLESS OF  WHETHER YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR AN AVERAGE  WORKING FAMILY. THEY JUST DO NOT HAVE THAT TRUST BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT TREATMENT  LIKE THIS. >> Harris: BEFORE WE MOVE ON  BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY  TOPICS THAT THEY GOT TO GARLAND  ON. SINCE I HAVE YOU, I HAVE TO ASK  THIS. YOU ARE ON THE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE. THE FIRST DOCUMENTS. TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS THAT BIDEN  HAD HAVING TO DO WITH AT LEAST  IRAN, CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES, UKRAINE WAS ONE OF THEM. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT ANY  CONNECTION POINTS THAT THE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WOULD  LOOK AT BETWEEN SOME OF WHAT  BIDEN HAD AND THE INVESTIGATION  THAT'S GOING ON WITH HIS SON,  HUNTER BIDEN, KNOWN TO MAKE SOME PRETTY SHADY BUSINESS DEALINGS  WITH 1 OR 2 OF THOSE COUNTRIES? >> THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE WE HAVE BEEN STONEWALLED BY THE  BIDEN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. I AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS  HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL  RESPONSIBILITY TO DO OVERSIGHT  OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES AND NOT ABUSING THE POWER  THAT THEY DO HAVE, WHICH IS  SIGNIFICANT. AND SO FAR WE'VE BEEN  STONEWALLED BY THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL. HE SAYS THIS IS -- HE DOESN'T  WANT TO JEOPARDIZE AN  INVESTIGATION. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ACCESS AND  CARELESSNESS, FRANKLY, WITH  CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS HAS  JEOPARDIZED OUR NATIONAL  SECURITY. WE CAN'T ASSESS THAT WITHOUT  GETTING ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN MATTER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT BOTH  REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE  BEEN CLEAR ABOUT AND SUPPORTED  BY ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SEEKING  ACCESS TO THESE DOCUMENT, AS IS  OUR RIGHT. >> Harris: YOU TALK ABOUT THE  ARTICLES AT BIDEN'S HOME PARKED  NEXT TO THE CORVETTE AND HIS SON DRIVING THE SAME CAR IF  DELAWARE. SENATOR ALSO PUTTING A.G.  GARLAND ON BLAST OVER THE CRISIS AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER AND  MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF FENTANYL  POURING INTO AMERICA. LINDSEY GRAHAM POINTED AT  MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS AS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. >> MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS, SHOULD  THEY BE DESIGNATED FOREIGN  TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS UNDER  U.S. LAW? >> I THINK THAT'S THE SAME  ANSWER I GAVE BEFORE. >> WOULD YOU OPPOSE SOME OF US  TRYING TO MAKE THEM FOREIGN  TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS? >> I WOULDN'T OPPOSE IT. WE NEED THE ASSISTANCE OF MEXICO IN THIS. >> IS MEXICO HELPING US  EFFECTIVELY WITH OUR FENTANYL? >> THEY ARE HELPING US BUT COULD DO MUCH MORE. >> IF THIS IS HELPING I WOULD  HATE TO SEE WHAT NOT HELPING  LOOKS LIKE. >> Harris: HE SAID THE ULTIMATE  DECISION FALLS UNDER THE STATE  DEPARTMENT. YOU ARE LEADING A DELEGATION TO  THE SOUTHERN BORDER TOMORROW. TELL US ABOUT THAT AND YOUR  REACTION TO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM  THE A.G. YESTERDAY. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL SAYS IT IS NOT HIS JOB,  IT IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO  DEAL WITH THESE MATTERS. I'M FOR GIVING THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT EVERY TOOL NECESSARY  TO COMBAT THE CARTELS SMUGGLING  PEOPLE AND DRUGS INTO THE UNITED STATES. AS WE'VE SAID, TAKING SO MANY  LIVES AND ADDING TO CRIME IN  COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS OUR  COUNTRY. I'M TAKING A GROUP OF SENATORS  TO THE BORDER STARTING TONIGHT  SO THEY CAN SEE WHAT I'VE SEEN  ON MANY TRIPS TO THE BORDER AND  LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS, THE  PEOPLE WHO I HAVE LEARNED FROM,  AND THE COMMUNITY LEADERS BEING  OVERWHELMED BY THIS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING  MORE INFORMATION AND I'M  INTERESTED IN GETTING SOME  ALLIES TO HELP US IN THIS FIGHT  AGAINST THIS CRISIS, WHICH IS -- SITS AT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S FEET. IT IS THE BIDEN BORDER CRISIS. >> Harris: YOUR PRESENCE THERE  WHENEVER THERE IS SOMEONE WITH A BULLY PULPIT IS SO IMPORTANT AT  THE BORDER. IT IS REALLY TOO BAD THE WHITE  HOUSE WON'T GO AND THAT THEY  WON'T GO MORE AND MORE AND MORE  UNTIL THEY SOLVE IT.

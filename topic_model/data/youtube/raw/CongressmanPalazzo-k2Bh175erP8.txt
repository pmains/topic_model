IN ORDER TO FULFILL THIS   RESPONSIBILITY, WE MUST SECURE   OUR BORDERS AND END CHAIN  IMMIGRATION AND MANDATE E-VERIFY AS THE NATIONAL PRACTICE.  WE DON'T NEED TO PROMOTE THE   PRACTICE OF REWARDING ILLEGAL  ALIENS BY PROVIDING JOBS AND   SAFE HAVENS. OUR OBLIGATION IS TO LAW-ABIDING AMERICAN CITIZENS. WE CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THE REST  OF THE WORLD IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TAKE CARE OF AMERICA AND ITS   CITIZENS FIRST.  MR. SPEAKER, I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPOR

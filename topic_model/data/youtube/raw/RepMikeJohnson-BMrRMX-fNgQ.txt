hello welcome back movement show great to have you with us eight four four seven six six six six oh seven there's a matthew james retirement hotline we're joined by congressman mike johnson mike how you doing moon i am uh as frustrated as everybody else is this morning this what's happening in washington is just absolutely outrageous yeah i wanted you to console brandon brandon uh paid about 60 70 000 worth of student loans and he paid him off himself him and his broad and they uh they want to know why they got to pay everybody else's too so brad brandon's having a tough day today and i've tried to help a brother out no i i feel you and i did the same thing you know i was first person in my family to go to college and i uh racked up quite a bit of debt and it took me many years to pay it off and there are so many people in in that boat and you know when this was first proposed we started raising the alarms um biden's been talking about this since he ran for office and what they're doing what they've done this week moon is they're they're taking money from plumbers and electricians and laborers to pay the debts of lawyers and academics there's there's no other way around this this is not student loan forgiveness it's a student debt bailout and the american taxpayer picks up the tab it's not fair it's wrong and all of those emotions that everybody's feeling right now are entirely appropriate oh it's no doubt about it but but the problem is mike as i see especially come from the democrats we're probably gonna do it sometime too but uh you know the middle class is getting ready to get squashed and we don't even we don't have the we don't really know what's happening to us but they're making everything dependent on the government you know when obama was told back in 2010 or eight or whatever this was that this is not good this isn't and he said oh no this is gonna help the family it's gonna help them pay it back well two things happened college universities doubled and quite drippled and went don't tell how much higher with their tuition and then people didn't pay their loans back because they had even borrowed more money to pay for school and they defaulting on their loans and so it did quite opposite of what the legendary barack obama said it would do that's exactly right and it also is creates a real moral problem because you know if you if you forgive student loans one thing that you're going to do for certain is you're going to encourage colleges to keep raising tuition even higher and and uh i mean the graduates are going to expect you know why would the next generation of students not expect that they can rack up whatever amount of debt that they they want because it's just going to be forgiven in the next you know bailout program i mean you're sending a message to people to be irresponsible and at the same time of course it's an illegal wealth transfer from you know the working class to the elites you're paying off you know people make a decision to go to college and to you know major in you know 18th century french poetry or whatever and they get out of school and they got tens of thousands you know sometimes more than a hundred thousand dollars in debt they made those decisions why should someone who acted responsibly and went to work have to pay for the decisions of that other person it is not right it is not moral to do this but joe biden doesn't care moon because you and i both know he's trying to buy votes that's what this is right out in the open he's attempting to buy votes in the light of day there's a reason we have separation of powers in this country there's a reason we have a constitutional system if every president who was up for re-elections could just write checks and give out goodies they'd always get re-elected right you can't do this without an authorization of congress and it's i think it's unconstitutional well we just played mary landrieu i'm not married nancy pelosi maryland what the hell is the difference yeah we just played pelosi saying it's unconstitutional the president can't just spend 300 billion dollars or just take debt from people and apply to the federal deficit you know all this deficit reduction act in the inflation reduction act which is another lie this made it even worse i don't i don't now she turns around said it's a great idea i mean from one and i know nancy pelosi is she might say something one day and the next day say something else she act like her and dr fauci come from the same family yeah it's it's madness they they're not tied to the truth in any way they can say one thing one day and the opposite the next they know the media is not going to hold them accountable you know all this is we have the receipts it's all on video it doesn't matter you know they say whatever they need to to hold on to power and that's what this is it's just a raw abuse of power i do think it's unconstitutional but here's the thing i was explaining this to a group i was with this morning they said if they know it's illegal why would they do it well because they know it's going to take us a year or so to unwind it in the courts and by that time the election cycle has already passed so they can run around the country and tell all these you know people who have student loan debt if they're their savior you know we're the government's going to help you we're going to bail you out and we're the ones that are going to do it even though they know ultimately it probably will get struck down in court it won't happen anyway but who cares they're not tied to any morality on this at all that's what's so disturbing about it you know and the message it sends to to the next generation of students it's really really dangerous reckless public policy and by the way the inflation rate of course this is the worst possible thing you could do in a recession with inflation numbers the way we have right now one point over almost 1.5 trillion dollars of of outstanding student loan debt is is federal okay and so if you if you just wave all that off by the way i don't think it's going to be 300 billion dollars i think it's going to be way more than that because that 300 billion figure is calculated at the ten thousand dollar amount that they're going to forgive but don't forget if you're a pell grant recipient your number is 20 000. okay so the numbers much higher i mean it will it will they always do that mike they always say it's a number it also ends up being a lot higher now than it was supposed to i mean it's always that's just the way the federal government is working we give a price and that price sounds good and then but it's it's it's a lot worse than what's coming down the pipe and i i'm just i mean as a citizen of the united states of america what they're doing in the uh in the country now is absolutely outrageous and i was mentioning that earlier they're making it where the middle class is forced to depend on government you have to have a tax credit to buy eevee where they are obamacare obama hurt us so bad i keep telling that people people to see it one day he put the medical when they did obamacare all these doctors had to go into the hospital so they had to listen to whatever they told him when colby came along you know what i'm asking i mean all that stuff and then they run that and that's gonna be a big blow up coming and then you look at uh a student loan and there's gonna be a big blow up coming but it's like we don't care federal government's gonna give me a check i'm gonna take the money i mean who ain't gonna take the money if you stick up you stick money in their in their face who's not gonna take it right they're gonna be rational economic actors and they're gonna take the money that's offered to them and meanwhile all of those who are pursuing this european style socialist utopian dream which is madness okay this is part of the agenda as you say they really do truly want big government socialism to rule the country they want centralized power they want just a handful of very powerful people to control all of the masses i mean this is the basis of marxism and communism and socialism socialism is a step towards communism you know we talk about this all the time but it's happening right now this is not theoretical we're watching it play out and it is infuriating well it sure is i've just hoped the american people and the only other thing i want to visit with you before i'll let you go was your feeling on the uh uh the elections up to this point i'm still worried if we even have elections uh all the states ready to stop which people say well how did cheating go on because they changed the rules in the middle of the game that's how you that's that's cheating but we don't call that cheating anymore so my question to you is i don't pay anything to the polls i don't pay anything to well this poll says the red wave is gone i don't care about any of that because it really gets down to who's going to vote and his election fair in every state so with all that what do you feel like what's going to happen in the house in the senate at least on the house side i i still believe we're going to have a red wave in the house and and uh i don't know the size of that wave there are a lot of factors that are outside our control but i'm very confident that we're going to take a sizeable majority in the house and it cannot happen soon enough the senate you know is uh is tough to call right now because it comes down to just a handful of you know five or six races and around the country and all the dynamics are different in those states the senate's a hard one to predict but i i believe as we are talking this morning moon that we are going to take a a big majority in the house and that we are going to have at least a one to two vote majority in the senate i think the american people have had enough i don't i'm with you i don't care what the poll says no i don't worry about that but there's my question if you if you i hope you get a big majority house because that helps you in the senate i'll give you an example let's take georgia okay that that's nick and tuck depending on what you look at but kemp's got a fairly good lead on abram now he remember gonna try to pull out all the stops but if kemp can win that seat by four or five points that helps herschel walker no doubt it helps it but i think kemp needs to win that more than just by ten thousand or twenty thousand votes i totally agree and george is a great example in terms of election integrity and security because the legislature went to work rolled up their sleeves there was a republican-led legislature and you know in 2021 they went to work and they cleaned up their election laws to make sure that the abuses of 2020 could never happen again so we have a high degree of confidence that that's going to be a reliable vote count and stacey abrams is going to be hurt by that because of course they manipulated the system in 2020 which is what gave us the result and and the mess there but it's not going to happen again and that is true in most of the states because we had a good election cycle in 2020 for the republican party in spite of the presidential laws and the republican-led legislatures went to work and cleaned up their election security laws and so we have a high degree of confidence what the debacle of 2020 is never going to be it's never going to happen again it's not going to be possible because the state's cleaned up their roles now there's some states we're very concerned about we have to watch them very closely pennsylvania's charge right exactly right but there will be a lot of eyes on it and i i hope and pray we'll be able to trust the results this time yeah it's it's just uh we got to stop the madness they got to stop the madness i mean this is this stuff is sick what they doing in this country this really is but absolutely you can't tell some people mike they don't see it yet i don't understand that they don't see it yet but anyway mike johnson congressman mike johnson who by the way has already won his elections i know you've been all over helping people we appreciate it thanks brother

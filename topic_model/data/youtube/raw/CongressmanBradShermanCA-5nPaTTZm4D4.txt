hello I'm congressman brad Sherman known as being from America's best name city Sherman Oaks you're so ago we moved up to porter ranch where I we live in the renaissance community and it's been interesting to bond with neighbors as we live with this up this challenge that faces us now I'm not here to recommend any course of legal action and certainly not here to represent or encourage you to retain any particular law firm Lisa and I have have not taken any legal action we haven't retain any particular law law firm I'm here to talk about public policy and but I do want to thank the law firms involved for inviting me here giving me a chance to speak to so many of my constituents now there in person are two very important staffers from my Sherman Oaks office one is John Alfred who's my adviser on the environment and transportation and I hope that you'll give him your ideas on what we can do as a matter of public policy what additional regulations how we make sure the Aliso Canyon leak is the last leak that affects people in this country also there's my legal counsel Carolina quick craig whack who heads our constituent service operation she works on individual cases if somebody isn't returning your phone calls talk to Carolina and they the thing is with our constituent service operation that's available to those who live in our in my district and as it happens Porter Ranch is divided between two members of Congress I represent about a third of Porter Ranch where as congressman steve knight represents Aliso Canyon and represents about two-thirds of the Porter Ranch community and so if you live in Steve's district I invite you to contact him I have we've reached out to congressman night to ask him to join with me and some of the public policy efforts that were engaged in some of the efforts to involve federal agencies he's put up on his website that he doesn't think federal agency should be involved at this stage and in any case if you have constituent service problems and you live in his district be sure and give him a call we can't we have my staff there will give you his phone number now John and Carolina will be circulating a list i hope you'll sign up or just give them your business card so that we have your email address i want to keep you informed of what the federal government is doing and what is being proposed i want to invite you to my town hall meeting including my telephone town hall meeting on the twenty-sixth of january and i want to make sure that you're notified of the committee hearing the assembly committee hearing that's going to convene on january 21 where i'll be testifying but it's being put together by Assemblyman Mike Gatto who's chairman of the of the assembly utility committee and of course my god o ran my constituent service office back in his prior life and will also keep you informed if we get your email address of whatever help is available from the Small Business Administration we are trying to argue to the SBA that low interest loan should be provided to both businesses and homeowners affected by by this by this incident I want to talk about the past the present and the future aliso canyon is America's fifth largest storage facility and we are now experiencing the largest natural gas leak in the history of the United States there are some 115 wells that were drilled mostly to extract oil from the sandstone creating a vacant pocket that has been used for natural gas storage for many decades of those hundred and fifteen wells one of them developed this leak that still leaves 114 others that we need to be concerned about as we go forward in 1979 this well was inspected and they decided to remove the sub safe subsurface safety valve what they should have done of course is replace that valve with one one of the modern valves whether they did that in 79 or some other time if they had just done that by 2014 we wouldn't be talking together today and we're going to have to be concerned not only with this well but in the future the other 114 now this one well I believe it's called SS 25 was tested in late 2014 but they used what I would describe his primitive testing they tested to make sure that a leak was not in progress they did not use any of the sophisticated techniques including ultrasonic testing to determine whether there were anomalies in the pipe that could develop into leaks later obviously SoCal gas should have installed on every one of these wells a deep subsurface positive pressure modern modern a sub safety subsurface safety valve that wasn't done obviously a modern testing should have been done on every one of these wells it wasn't but it's not just SoCal gas that did not act government did not act as well state regulations and federal regulations apparently didn't require that subsurface safety valve unless the wells were within 300 feet of a playground school or home and they're not and the state and federal regulations did not require the kind of sophisticated testing as we go forward we need work nationwide to make sure that natural gas is transported safely and stored safely so let's look at the present this leak started as you know on october 24th of last year they are on target to stop the leak sometime in March in the meantime SoCal gas is agreed to relocate those families that need to be relocated and to provide filters to those who remain the EPA the leading federal agency did not think that they should get involved they cited to us regulations that they said deprive them of jurisdiction in this area we did the legal research and responded to them that there was a statute that did in fact give them jurisdiction since then since the late last year the EPA has been involved both to provide technical assistance from the federal level and hopefully to learn from this incident how we need to change natural gas storage nationwide at my urging and the urging of many others Governor Brown has issued an emergency declaration the chief effect of which is to give state agencies the power to order people to do what needs to be done they have ordered that natural gas be pulled out of this facility as quickly as possible but only to the extent that the natural gas can be sold or stored elsewhere now the storage elsewhere is almost impossible not only is Aliso Canyon the fifth largest storage facility in the country but it in the greater LA basin area it constitutes about eighty-five percent of all the storage there's all very little storage elsewhere and so really SoCal gas is only willing to extract what they can sell and in order to meet to deal with other system problems that will arise this summer they're even reluctant to do that as we move through through leaks and withdrawals the working gas and we may be down to the to as little as 30 billion cubic feet of working gas but in addition to that there's 60 billion cubic feet and that's that's an estimate i'm getting i get a little conjecture on that but roughly 60 billion cubic feet of working gas which socal edison and frankly the governor's office is reluctant to see removed from aliso canyon because their focus is on gas reliability in the future in socal gases also views this natural gas as an asset that they do not want to a draw unless they can sell it at full price I don't regard this this gas and aliso canyon as an asset it's a toxin and it needs to be removed as quickly as possible that will and and a lot of my efforts are to try to persuade the governor to order that natural gas be withdrawn as quickly as possible sell it at full price if you can sell it at a discount if you can't get electric generation facilities not only to generate the electricity we need in Los Angeles but this being winter they're not generating electricity as quickly as they can they're a peak electric demand is in the summer with air conditioning so they can produce more electricity and sell it at a big discount on the grid socal Gattis is SoCal gas should be willing if necessary to provide additional natural gas to its customers for free to increase usage and to pull this natural gas out as quickly as possible the more you pull out the less pressure there is the less pressure there is the slower the leak and also the less pressure there is the more likely it is that the efforts to cap and seal this leak are going to be successful when we go on to the future we have in this country a natural gas transmission integrity protocol or system we do not have an equally sophistic natural gas storage protocol and what this what this incident has proven is that natural gas and the mercaptan that's added to it and the volatile organic compounds that are traced parts of it collectively that's a toxin and it's not just a matter of worrying about what might explode we have to also worried about the effects this has on the human respiratory system and that's why we need as we go forward to have a nationwide system that requires the subsurface safety valves and the and the modern versions with the positive pressure that will go off automatically if there's an earthquake or any other disturbance we need to see the same level of sophistication used in dealing with the pipes that go down into a storage facility as we use for the transmission pipes and whether that means a smart pig or whether that means Tran subsonic testing needs to be worked out but the idea that we should just have monitoring to determine whether the pipe is leaking is insufficient we have to know about anomalies and we have to look at the Aliso Canyon facility should the the plans of most involved using that facility to store natural gas well before the hottest summer months and the peak use of natural gas for electric generation should natural gas be stored Aliso can are we going to continue to allow a hundred and fourteen wells that have many of the same problems as the one well that caused the leak are we going to continue to not have subsurface safety valves just because the wells are not within a hundred feet or 300 feet of a home are we going to I just rely on pipe that was put in the ground in the 1950s uh are we going to continue to put mercaptan in the natural gas that is stored in aliso canyon these are questions that need to be addressed and we as residents of Porter Ranch can't go to sleep just when the leak is plugged we need to be active and involved and make sure that nothing unsafe is happening on the near our homes or anywhere else near homes in in Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley so I look forward to getting your input you can please contact john alfred and carolina cray whack there right there they're probably waving to the crowd right now don't hesitate to send me an email at brad Sherman at mail that's ma IL dot house gov the houses for house of representatives and I look forward to to working with you to protect the residents of Porter Ranch to both those in my district and those just outside and to make sure that natural gas storage in our area and around the country doesn't pose a threat to human health thank you very much on brad Sherman

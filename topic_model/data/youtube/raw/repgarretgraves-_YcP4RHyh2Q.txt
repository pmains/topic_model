want to thank you for having us hearing today and i want to thank the witnesses for for being here before i jump in and talk about the topic of today's hearing this aviation subcommittee and i do want to want to make note uh the the hundreds or perhaps even thousands of phone calls and emails and contacts we've received from folks expressing strong concern about their experience in aviation and over the past few months we have heard countless stories about folks experiencing horrific problems traveling trying to take a summer vacation trying to help resume the economy by by doing business travel and experiencing problems at the airport experiencing problems going through security experiencing problems with weather delays air traffic control and of course the airlines this is something that is is having an incredible impact let me say it again not just on folks trying to take their their families on vacation and enjoy a relaxing summer summer vacation before school starts but also uh those that are trying to help with uh resumption of economic activity across the united states and this is something that we must make sure that we tackle and get to the get to the bottom of this issue um like chairman larson the chance to join many of you at tokyo and i think the panel today looks a lot like the one we had had over the weekend and and i enjoyed it i enjoyed the conversation i enjoyed the panel and looking forward to today's today's discussion general aviation is a is a critical part of our of our nation's economy particularly in um in rural areas like like tokyo where i wasn't sure tokyo was ever actually going to show up i thought it was just going to keep being dozens of miles of farms but um uh but but it but it plays a critical role in the economy and what we're talking about today and many of us spoke about over the weekend is how we're going to incorporate new technology into the the the national airspace system and and as the the chairman mentioned right now we're already seeing the faa struggle from an organizational struggle from an experienced perspective struggle from a regulatory perspective dealing with their legacy mission much less the complexity of bringing new technologies into our airspace and i'm very concerned about what that does to commercial travel what it does to general aviation and of course what it does to potentially thwart or impede the ability that an objective i know we all share which is incorporating drones and aam into advanced air mobility into our national airspace system while maintaining something that i think is really important to emphasize while maintaining this amazing record of safety that we have in the aviation industry which of course is that air travel is the safest mode of transportation in the united states and we must continue to maintain that gold standard um the the united states has an incredibly robust network of uh of general aviation uh airports and heliports that touch uh virtually every american not just not just uh the airport in tokyo um and and i imagine that it would be we'd be hard-pressed to find a member of congress that doesn't have a desire to incorporate uh new technologies into uh the aviation system in fact my home state of louisiana and the district we represent houma airport which is the base for much of the offshore energy operations uh they also have been leaning forward embraced new innovative technologies and i know that they're excited to continue moving forward aggressively in aam again advanced um aviation systems advanced air mobility operations and on the horizon and are trying to plan accordingly accordingly for the new entrants but i think that some of the regulatory uncertainty has challenged even then we've got to continue to contemplate what this regulatory structure looks like for advanced air mobility but we must also think about the infrastructure needs that are there it's not just about the regulatory structure particularly technologies like evital thinking about the infrastructure that's needed for for those um how general aviation is going to be affected and making sure that we have the proper infrastructure to facilitate all the brainstorming and problem solving is uh pivotal to the to the safe and successful operation of aam and of course ensuring that the united states maintains its global leadership role thankfully last month the house passed two critical bills on this and we're we're hopeful that the uh senate takes a similar path and gets these to the president's desk as soon as possible future uh regulations must contemplate new entrants into the into the market and i'm looking forward to hearing y'all's thoughts about the safe integration of those systems into our indoor nas thinking briefly about drones and the ultimate full-scale integration into the nas i also want to hear your thoughts on on issues that are either of interest or more likely a concern and how we can start bridging the gap between the general aviation industry and this growing drone in aam industry so mr chairman i want to thank you for for holding this hearing today and look forward to hearing from our witnesses you

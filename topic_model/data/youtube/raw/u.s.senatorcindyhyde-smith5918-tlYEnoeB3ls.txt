thank you chairwoman baldwin and ranking member hoeven for having this hearing today and i'd also like to thank commissioner calif for being here to discuss this budget with us and appreciate your efforts and willingness to step up earlier this week we had a very good conversation together and i really enjoyed learning about your experience in rural whitman county in mississippi and helping the folks there that are medically underserved and that really hits home since mississippi is a very rural state that you do have that interest but i look forward to finding ways to advance rural health and to work on issues together in your new role one of the other issues we spoke about on our call was the fda's decision to remove the in-person dispensing requirement of the chemical abortion drug myflipperstone and to how this change would expand the distribution of products like this that can be delivered directly to someone's mailbox effectively permitting mail order abortion in this country and in february of this year i sent you a bicameral letter requesting that you immediately rescind the removal of in-person dispensing requirements for this drug and your response which i did get last week said that you had conducted a comprehensive review of the rems program and that you concluded that even without the in-person dispensing requirement this drug would be safe and effective and i and many others disagree with that there's plenty of evidence showing this chemical abortion pill they're dangerous to women who take them and can be extremely dangerous in certain situations it is the job of the fda and your job as commissioner to protect patients by ensuring the safety of drugs and the stronger rims that had been in place since 2019 included safeguards to protect patients from an unnecessary risk posed by the strugg and given your belief that your review was fully comprehensive i will request full information on all literature reviewed by fda during this process and other information related to that specific review and i will be following up with both the letter and questions for the record for this hearing about the review so i'm just asking can you provide full and complete information on this review to me in a timely manner well senator first of all thanks for the noting the places where we will work together [Music] and and on this matter um of course we'll be responsive to your um concerns in a in a timely manner um i have great confidence in the fda staff who did this review and um it involved a variety of materials and as we also discussed there's still a requirement for reporting adverse events related to this and they will continue to look with due diligence and do you commit to answer all the questions that we send you well i'll commit to being responsive to your requests and additionally you said on our call that data showed chemical abortion numbers were going down and you were certainly glad about that in favor of that but however data analyzed by the charlotte closure institute shows the opposite and chemical abortions now make up more than half of all abortions in the united states in this country i did not realize that and in 2019 chemical abortions jumped 11 in mississippi and this is obviously a very serious concern of mine from talking to my ob gy and friends and as you said you want to see the number of abortions going down what are you doing to reverse this trend of increasing chemical abortions and actually helping to lower those numbers well just just to be clear i hope i didn't misspeak on our phone conversation the total number of abortions is going down uh the proportion of that total that are chemical abortions um is going up you're correct and um i think we all would like to see as few abortions as possible um in our future um [Music] as a general goal so i i hope you didn't take it to mean that i was saying that the chemical abortions were going down because i didn't intend to say that it's a total number of abortions okay but you you obviously you're correcting that of what we thought that it was going down and you're stating that chemical abortions are going up do you the proportion i actually would have to go back to the record to see about the total number because if the total number's coming down in the proportion that are chemical are going up i actually don't have the number in front of me about the absolute number i hope that makes sense to you oh yeah okay thank you very much

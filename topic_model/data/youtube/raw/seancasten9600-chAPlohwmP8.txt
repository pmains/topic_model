um i got some questions about um discriminatory lending and i want to go through just ridiculous hypotheticals to start but um so bear with me but i wanted to leave enough time for the substance on the back end as as you know the equal credit opportunity act of 1974 prohibits lending institutions from discriminating on the basis of all the usual protected classes race religion national origin what have you um so i wanted to start with just a completely softball hypothetical if a lending institution was to intentionally or unintentionally but effectively market their products to groups of people that had the practical effect of reducing minorities certain religious groups access to to loans would that constitute a violation of the ecoa as i'm sure you know um all of us in the banking regulatory area like to avoid these type of hypotheticals but i'll i'll speak to i'll try my best to answer the equal credit opportunity act um implicates not just underwriting decisions but in in across the entire credit transaction so it can affect collections it can affect marketing and advertising you may be aware secretary carson issued a complaint against facebook for violations of the fair housing act that related to some of these issues about advertising there is some corollary uh between the fair housing act and the equal credit opportunity act and we're happy to follow up with some of the specific regulations um well i've been able to i appreciate the nuance i appreciate the nuance and and that's the challenge of these five-minute hearings so sometimes there's not a time for nuance but the stipulate that that there are some things that within that nuance are indeed problematic is does the cfpb under your leadership have the authority and or the obligation to investigate and prosecute crimes under the ecoa of the type we just talked about yes okay um and if a company was violating those is knowledge that their that their marketing techniques were discriminatory um a prerequisite for for prosecution or if they are if if if they're loaning if the lending practices are discriminatory but we're not intentional does that absorb them of liability yes so the supreme court um there's jurisprudence on this it's also in the regulation um there's there's disparate treatment um and disparate impact and so in the disparate impact context um you you need not necessarily uh prove intentionality um to get to liability okay well that's consistent with my understanding so here's now the substantive reason for the question um it has been brought to my attention that a number of folks in the in the lending industry when they make a decision whether or not to advertise on facebook facebook cannot share and has refused to share any information about whether the algorithms they use to boost their ad tracking are in fact intentionally targeting certain racial groups certain you know classes of people and could have the practical effect especially in light of all this news over the last you know weeks that facebook's algorithms have a habit of you know targeting and amplifying and boosting signals from white supremacist groups like the proud boys um given your prior answers is a lender that is advertising on a platform that uses algorithms that may prove to be discriminatory or maybe have already been proven to be discriminatory is that lender potentially guilty of an ecowa violation it really depends on the facts and circumstances but in fact facebook in your circums in your hypothetical may be liable for that um and would you have liability or the jurisdiction to pursue a claim against the platform as opposed to the lender or both you know i it depends on the exact activities but just in like secretary carson's complaint where um facebook was making those decisions um in your hypothetical um when a tech company like that or is making the decision uh they may in fact be liable okay so um last just a question for as we sit here if the platform cannot guarantee that their marketing channels are not in some fashion discriminatory in a way that would violate the ecoa would you advise a lender to continue advertising on that platform well i i'm happy to take you know i'd rather take this question for the record because it's a complex one to answer in nine seconds but i am very worried about black box algorithms that we have no accountability as to how decisions are made this is the opposite of relationship banking and we need to make sure that they that firms cannot dodge fair lending laws and anti-discrimination laws under the guise of their secret algorithm thank you very much i'm out of time look forward to following up with your staff gentlemen

I Thank You mr. chairman let's be clear here the purpose of us global health and economic development programming is to recognize promote and protect the dignity of all individuals and to extend a helping hand so that the marginalized poor and vulnerable around the world may build a better future the promotion of abortion is incompatible with this mission abortion is not health care children and families should not be enumerated as barriers to prosperity but sources of strength and beauty purpose meaning and potential I am proud that the United States has recommitted itself to global health policies that recognize the inherent worth of all people and leverage the boundless human capacity for generosity cooperation and ingenuity to overcome global poverty we will not make the challenge of ending poverty a little simpler in the short term by pushing women to end the lives of their children that is not a compassionate position for either mother or child we will not tell women that they must choose between their children and prosperity instead we will work in partnership with countries around the world to ensure that all women and children have access to opportunity and success the president's protecting life in global health assistance policy ensures that American tax dollars are used for actual health care not awarded to global organizations that push abortion on women instead of doing the hard work of helping these vulnerable and to have both their baby and their dreams we must continue to build health care capacity in communities to fill any gaps left by these funding changes and in this way we can best serve women and children around the world abortion is both a symptom and a tool of the oppression of women research by the United Nations Population Fund indicates that widespread access to prenatal testing and abortion in countries with patrilineal and patrilocal traditions is linked directly to gender side the global epidemic of violence against women 126 million women are demographically missing around the world due to sex selective abortions female infanticide and gender-based violence against young girls sex selection abortions have been banned in many countries uest notably not included in those but social pressures on women to eliminate their baby girls remain in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand for example a hundred and thirty two villages reported that no girls were born over a three-month period in 2019 and the UK medical journal The Lancet has found that as many as 12 million baby girls were aborted in India between the 1980s and 2011 ms bas what is the role of abortion in accelerating the global gendercide in our experience and we actually had a programme on the subject in Armenia that we were very proud of where really we did want parents and families and communities to understand both boys and girls have value that they deserve love that their lives had meaning and so we really did have an approach that worked with both the government of Armenia and the Armenian Church to address those challenges of a really equal value of boys and girls and address that issue of sex selective abortion week so we were very proud of that work I think it's it's something we continue to look at ways we can contribute to both both of those issues really hopefully reducing sex selective abortion and just lifting up the value of girls thank you very much my time is about to expire I have many more questions that I will submit for the record mr. chairman thank you

senator wyden a very valuable member of the Senate Budget Committee is here on the floor no senator I might say has proposed more serious solutions to America's problems than senator Wyden and he's done it without the benefit of having a committee staff that he controls he does it based on his own hard work and the work of his office staff he has proposed major tax reform major health care reform and he's done it in a bipartisan way in many ways I think he's set an example for everybody in this chamber

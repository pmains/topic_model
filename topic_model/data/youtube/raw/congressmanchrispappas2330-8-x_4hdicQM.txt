it's important for us to be together here to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 340b program we know that it's helped to ensure that rural communities and low-income individuals and districts like mine and across the country have access to the life-saving healthcare and prescription drugs that they need i'm also here in strong opposition to what these drug companies are doing they're undermining the 340b discounts i believe it's a violation of the law and it's hurting families in my district there are at least 13 pharmaceutical companies right now that are unlawfully withholding or limiting discounts under the 340b program and it impacts providers and patients in new hampshire including our hospitals our community health centers and other providers who serve our most vulnerable neighbors i've heard about this from my constituents who have talked about the importance of this program and i think their words tell a pretty powerful story in rockingham county in my district one of my constituents requires daily medication and without 340b not only would she not be able to afford her medication she'd be forced to choose between affording her home or affording her own health in stratford county in my district there's another new hampshire resident who uses 340b for insulin for their diabetes they pay just forty five dollars a month for three vials of insulin instead of four hundred dollars a month for just one vial and according to them quote everything would get turned upside down for me if the program ended and because of 340b staff at a community health center my district has been able to reduce the cost of treatments significantly specifically for one patient who's lived with a condition since they were 12 years old costs were reduced from 400 to just about a hundred dollars they shared this with me quote i can't imagine what i would do if it weren't for the 340b program helping with the price of my medication please do everything you can to protect this last year i signed a letter with over 220 house members to protect the 340b program and oppose the actions of these drug companies we called on hhs to take action to stop these companies from denying these 340b discounts and in february i was very proud to join so many of my colleagues in co-sponsoring the protect 340b act this would stop health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers from discriminating against 340b providers and it would protect the health and well-being of my constituents and so many others across this country that depend on this program so look at a time when farms pharmaceutical companies are reaping record profits when the cost of prescription drugs continues to skyrocket it's just unconscionable that there are corporate actors who continue to ignore the law and to stick it to our consumers our constituents to patients across this country and hand them an astronomical bill so we've all got to join together and commit ourselves to fighting to lower the cost of prescription drugs this is one area where i think republicans and democrats can come together and pass something meaningful and i really hope our colleagues will heed the stories that they've hear heard here tonight so thank you again representative spanberger for your leadership and i yield back

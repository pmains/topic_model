the American people and car sometimes it's entirely possible the report won't speak for itself because as the rules suggest it can be a really minimal report simply saying here are the prosecutions we brought and here's why here are the prosecutions we declined to bring the so-called declinations in that rule and here's why and those that could be basically written in shorthand ya know that's right and Lawrence I mean there's there's two reasons why these types of reports are generally kept private one is and in this case this would be true you don't want to disclose sources and methods anything that would damage our national security the second one of course and this is typical in the prosecutorial realm if there is somebody whose reputation would be damaged but who's not being charged with the crime you want to protect that reputation now the point here of course is that we have an overwhelming public interest and and we can deal with those two issues but we have an absolutely overwhelming public interest in further understanding the two elements of this investigation understanding exactly what Russia did we have a public interest because we need to be prepared for them to do it again and of course we have a public interest in finally having resolution to the question that has divided this country politically and torn it apart and of course you know and up with mud on the Department of Justice and attacks on the character of the Special Counsel and that is the question of whether there was any collusion by the President or the president's people the answer may be no in which case the president should have a real interest in getting it out there the answer may be yes in which case the American public has a very real interest in knowing whether that is true would you expect your committee to also subpoena the malla report could there be multiple subpoenas from multiple House committees yeah I think there could be I mean that might be redundant you know the Congress does have the power to subpoena documents from the executive it'll be sort of interesting because on my committee of course the former chairman Devin Nunez pushed the boundary of what Congress would ordinarily demand of the dust of the Justice Department Devin Nunez established a whole new frontier in terms of demanding actual investigative material around the Clinton investigation in a way that made the Department of Justice and the FBI very very nervous it's gonna be pretty hard for Republicans to all of a sudden say oh you've got no right to go to the Department of Justice to ask for investigative materials particularly given the overwhelming public interest in finally getting some closure on what actually happened here Andrew McCabe as he details in his new book worked with robert muller knows robert muller very well in robert Mahler's a previous job as director of the FBI and this is what Andrew McCabe said today what he told Ari member about what he expects in the Mullah report I expect that director Miller's team will produce an all encompassing report that details exactly what they found and exactly what they think about it I think it's unbelievably important that that information is shared with Congress and I'd also like to see it shared to the greatest extent possible with the American people encouraged and jeffries that's someone who has worked closely with robert muller knows his work methodology most incredibly important because we know a few things presidents men are going down in flames from Manafort to gates to Papadopoulos to Cohen to Flynn and now Roger stone is often said where there's smoke there's fire there's a whole lot of smoke emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue we need some clarity the Mulla report can provide that there appears to be a triangular relationship between the Trump campaign WikiLeaks and Russian spies Rogers bone stone may be the link between the three hopefully the mullah report will clear all of that up for the American people there the other view of what the mole report could be is written by Neal Katyal in the New York Times and he says the report is unlikely to be a dictionary thick tome which will disappoint some of us but such brevity is not necessarily good news for the president in fact quite the opposite a concise mullah report might act as a roadmap to investigation for the Democratic House of Representatives and it might also lead to further criminal investigation by other prosecutors a short mullah report would mark the end of the beginning not the beginning of the end and so Carson Hynes there we see the two possible versions of the malla report the extensive one all encompassing as Andrew McCabe says he expects and Neal Katyal recognizing the possibility that could be it could be something much shorter yeah and that's right and I mean who knows we could we could get into an awful lot of speculation by how big how small what it'll contain one thing is for sure and and and I say this because one of the real tragedies of this whole experience has been the president United States and the president's people damaging the reputation of robert muller a man who was wounded in Vietnam combat veteran a lifetime of service to this country besmirched and attacked and smeared by the Trump administration by the president self one thing is for sure bob Muller's interests will be the interests of the American people and doing the right thing so my guess is a mauler will have figured out a way to either establish the facts or as mr. katiyal said if those facts point in questionable directions that are beyond the jurisdiction of investigation he will point to them in such a way that other prosecutors or the Congress of the United States could pursue them now we've had a New York Times report indicating that President Trump called up Matthew Whitaker the acting Attorney General to try to get him to take action involving the prosecution of Michael Cohen in Southern District of New York let's listen to what Matthew Whitaker's said to your committee when he testified about this at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsels investigation or any other investigation did the president lash out to you about mr. Cohen's guilty plea no he did not mr. Whitacre did the president lash out to you on or about December 8th 2018 to discuss the case before the Southern District in New York where he was identified as individual one no congressman looked like he was trying to calculate that date on that last answer because a more general version of that question according to New York Times he did indeed contact him about that case yeah and Whittaker was an extraordinary witness cuz he was both arrogant and incompetent at this time so it was quite something to witness and experience but we are going through that transcript with a fine-tooth comb and we'll process additional information that is coming to us to determine whether he stood in front of the Congress and the country and lied there's every reason in the world to believe knowing this president that he was alike ly to have pushed the envelope with Whitaker and that's probably the reason that he placed him there in the position in the first place and car sometimes I think we know what you're gonna be doing on Wednesday of next week I assume you're gonna be watching as much of Michael Cohen's public testimony as possible before you get him as a witness behind closed doors the next day what are you expecting from Michael : next week publicly and then how will that differ from what you'll be pursuing privately yeah that's a good question and and I'm not sure that his testimony will be dramatically different in private than in public Michael Cohen was not employed by you know the CIA the NSA the military he doesn't he hadn't spent a lot of time in classified environments so I don't imagine that there will be material that he can't speak about an open session that he could in front of the intelligence committees what is really remarkable though now I think we're up to three different committees in which he will be testifying and I've got at least two questions number one is you know does he have evidence of criminal wrongdoing that for whatever reason wasn't pursued by the special counsel and number two this I think is going to be primarily a political event you know all we know about what Michael Cohen told the special counsel is what the special counsel has told various courts in sensitive sentencing memos and that sort of thing Michael Cohen is going to tell stories and we know this president's behavior in public is behavior that we would not tolerate in our teenage children can you imagine the stories that Michael Cohen has to tell about the president's behavior in private I have to assume that the White House is very nervous not so much about the legal implications here but by the political implications of somebody who knows the president and intimately and telling those stories Carsten Jeffries quickly before we go the house resolution to block the president's emergency declaration is that going to be voted on tomorrow or just introduced tomorrow it'll be introduced tomorrow it will be voted on next week it'll be supported by every single member of the House Democratic caucus and we expect some Republicans will support it as well that leads into our next segment which is about a very important lawsuit that's being brought against the border wall in the declaration of emergency congressman Hakeem Jeffries and Carmen Jim Hines

for the millions of Americans on food stamps their struggle could become even harder Congress is expected to vote on the bill that would cut funding for food stamps by 40 billion dollars over the next 10 years standing in line at a grocery store behind people with a food stamp card and they look in their basket as one individual said I love crab legs smokey you know the big king crab legs I love those and then sees the food stamp card pulled out and provided he is actually helping pay for the king crab legs when he can't pay for them for himself so everyone on food stamps is apparently I've seen crab legs and it appears to me that the goal of this administration is to expand the roles of people that are on SNAP benefits and their purpose for doing so to simply expand the dependency class if you have enough money to buy drugs you do not need taxpayer money to buy food he says it's 50 we miss our people on American today I disagree with that I think there's three members may be starving police dude three times they fell apart respond to them

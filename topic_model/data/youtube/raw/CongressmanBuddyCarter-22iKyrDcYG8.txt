thank you very much indeed now joining us this morning in New York as a matter of fact is Buddy Carter he's a republican from the state of Georgia Congressman only two of these people those arrested 23 only two of them are from Georgia what does that tell you about this group well obviously this is a calculated performance on behalf of this group and I'm glad that they labeled him as a domestic terrorists because these thugs you know the the irony that I find in this is that this proves just how important it is that we have good police protection that we have proper training for our police because of incidents like this but this is the first time that I can remember Maybe I'm Wrong here but I think it's the first time that I've ever heard of this kind of violent protest with the arrested people who are arrested facing serious charges domestic terrorism we've not seen that before and and they should and we've got to send the message here and and you know you can make the argument that and make the case that this is a result of all the defund the police rhetoric that we've heard over the past few years and and you know the the the problems that we've had and keeping the morale up of our Public Safety officials particularly of our police there's no question that that we need to be backing them more and that's you're going to get some serious response from the state of Georgia I can assure you of that we take Law and Order very serious in the state of Georgia you got that look on your eye it tells me there's some serious consequences all right now President Biden is talking about increasing taxes on billionaires and we know that he's raising taxes on Medicare soaking the riches what he's doing you're in the house budget committee yes yes what can you do about this can you stop it well you know this is the irony again of this president who says he's not going to raise taxes on anyone making under four hundred thousand dollars you're not going to audit them at all he did but who's he going after he says he wants to go after the billionaires but he's really going after the waiters and the waitresses and trying to get to their tips and other things we've got to stop this you know I'm starting to interrupt you but taxing the rich is popular it is popular there's a majority vote in favor of that in America absolutely and I get that and I can tell you how we can do that we can do it with the fair tax because the fair taxes consumption tax is fair it's flat it's simple but you're not going to get it yeah well you are well under what circumstances would you get a flat tax well you've got to run the house the Senate I understand and I get your message but uh my point is is that Washington is about Big Ideas and we need to have these big Ideas we need to have this discussion about changing the makeup because people people don't like paying taxes they don't like paying income taxes they don't like paying um payroll taxes but given the choice they would prefer a consumption tax because they have control and that's what we have to do I'm going to take you up I've got that much time but I'll take you up on that a consumption tax is a sales tax it would happen in the neighborhood it'd have to be 20 percent sales tax to bring in enough Revenue it would be 23 as opposed to the 33 percent that you're paying currently yeah but they did that in Britain when I lived there that brought in this huge consumption tax but they didn't get rid of the income tax so well that didn't and there's a danger in that that's what we've got to make sure happens but but you know the the problem is is that the administration and and that the people in control they don't want to lose control right now they can control you they can tell you what you can pay taxes on which you're not you get to make the decision if you have a consumption tax uh Congressman buddy Carter I have no idea what you're doing in New York City because you're from Georgia yes enjoy the city please we will it was great

County students are taking part in a program that takes learning math science technology and engineering into the cornfields WDBJ sevens Justin Ward shows high schoolers are learning about 21st century farming in this unique program in fenced in fields beside route to 21 in Carroll County is what you'd expect corn and cattle but it's what students just a few miles away at Carroll County High School are doing with the plants and animals that's attracting national attention so we got the sequence from Virginia Tech Bristol upchurch is part of the stem lab for agriculture where students take science technology engineering and math and apply it to forming in today's world with a focus on biotechnology the use of living or once living organisms to meet human needs such as insulin the students are learning just that more than 300 were part of the program last school year that was created by instructors here and in part paid for by a grant from the USDA this program is amazing and you know it's not so much working we've done is actually seeing our kids perform students look beyond the seed into its DNA discovering diseases or any real life problems farmers encounter every day but with a scientific approach with help from Virginia Tech in Food City that's going to be the push in the future is for AG education to be more science-based can we put them in this jail Thursday u.s. senator Tim Kaine visited the school to congratulate students on their work and find ways to expand the program working in the lab then helps them over on their academic coursework like the biology and chemistry suddenly comes to life when you're working in an AG lab every day instructors say they're teaching the class as if it were college level which means students like Bristol upchurch will be even more prepared for their career I want to go into biochemistry and the lab gives me a lot more opportunities to practice with that in hillsville Justin Ward WDBJ seven new

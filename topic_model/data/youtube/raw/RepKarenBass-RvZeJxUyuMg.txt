was going to be a day of explosive testimony in the depositions and I think he did that to throw us all off he has done this time and time again but how dare he compare our constitutional obligation for oversight to a hate crime I think sometimes that he knows so little about the United States history that he doesn't realize that thousands of people who were lynched that these were actually social events that they were advertised in the paper bring your kids come out and watch us burn to death a black person watches disembowel someone these were social events that it's a horrific part of our history but frankly it's not that long ago I mean Texas just a couple of years ago executed a man because he had lynched another man and this was within the last 10 years so the idea that he would trivialize and everything is always about him that he would trivialize such an egregious moment in our history and compare it to what is really my constitutional obligation

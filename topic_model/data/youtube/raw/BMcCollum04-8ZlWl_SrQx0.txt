Mr Speaker I rise and supported this omnibus appropriations agreement this agreement reflects a truly bipartisan compromise that fills Congress's most basic responsibility to fund the operations of the federal government as a ranking member of interior environment and propriate subcommittee I am thrilled to be supporting our subcommittees section of the bill I want to remind everyone that in July our bill died on the floor was underfunded and it was loaded with bipartisan run with it was loaded with partisan writers that harm the environment and failed to meet the needs of the American people this is not a perfect bill but it is a remarkable improvement this bill provides critical resources to important programs ranging from clean air and water natural resources Native Americans and the arts and for the first time in five years the Environmental Protection Agency is not being cut the agreement provides 93 million dollars increased support to the national park service programs and funds the national parks Centennial Democrats and Republicans are equally committed to fund Native American programs which received an increase of five percent over 2015 important increases for education health and tribal government programs the Land and Water Conservation Fund is reauthorize highs for three years and funded at 450 million dollars the highest level funding since 2010 and the national endowment for the arts and humanities are funded at the President's request which is terrific the real victory is here for the American people is that this agreement removes policy writers that were bad for the environment bad for our air and our water and bad for our families those writers are gone from this bill and that is a victory I want to thank chairman Calvert for a very positive working relationship this year and I appreciate the courtesy and the respect you and the Republican staff has shown me and my staff the Democratic appropriation staff worked incredibly hard to protect our priorities in this bill I thank you and I and I urge support JS x expel

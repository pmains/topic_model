and why don't Democratic Congress make us think about it and why don't Republicans don't Republicans like cutting taxes I honestly what is the deal the Republicans never liked the payroll tax holiday in the first place the Republicans have always been against tax breaks for low and middle and conceived and there were a whole bunch of them last year that they were opposed to remember what they are at this point Democrats some of us did raise our voices against that the problem is he had a two front war because we were posing the President on the on the chained CPI and for a time on the possibility of Medicare breaks you can only fight so many words at the same time you doin president I'll say you know politicians always want to go for the low-hanging fruit and you know the change in the cola is is a low-hanging fruit and pretending to reform entitlement and the payroll time the payroll tax is also one of those low hanging fruit but more importantly I actually think it is the right thing to that the payroll ties to go up especially if you are insistent on the idea that the American people are actually paying into the peril into surgery that's a very important point and and and wean itself was never like the payroll tax yeah so explain why I'm never there were never basically there were never any fans of this thing so it was basically orphaned and now it's gone it should have been eliminated but it should have been substituted for this should have been an equal tax cut on low and moderate income people we always say that the the Social Security CPI whatever should not be on the table as part of the deficit discussion Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit and that is basically true however when you put in this payroll tax holiday you took 110 120 billion dollars a year away from Social Security trust fund and you substituted a direct check from the Treasury and you from the general fund in the gym to the trust and that robs you of the ability to set say that Social Security is nothing to the deficit so we wanted to get rid of the payroll tax cut to restore our ability to protect Social Security but we should have substituted something like the network pay tax credit in an equal let me clean it expired raise taxes on the lowest income Americans right in the make work pay his part was part of the Recovery Act it was incredibly it expired and there and the payroll tax credit was a substitute for it burning Republicans wouldn't but under that system enhancement I didn't get the payroll to the the making work pay credit right Chris you probably didn't get it right but it was a better not I thought we got a huge tax cut during those two years my wife and I because we both pay the maximum tax right and that's upside down and dumb way to do this so remember the Republicans are not averse to raising taxes despite what they said they retroactive and raised among teenagers in 2006 they took away Obama's making work pay credit which hit people at the bottom anybody you made under 20,000 single or 40,000 married got a tax increase saying there is the right which and this gets in my ideology point right because it's just none of this stuff makes sense if you're looking at this like oh this is all ideological xela tree it is about power because teenagers don't have a lot of power and then working people

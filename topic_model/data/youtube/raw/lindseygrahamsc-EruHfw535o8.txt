and good morning again south carolina republican lindsey graham is in cottonwood arizona this morning and senator thanks for coming i want to start with some of these details more details now coming out on the the russian bombers and their family it now turns out that not only was one of them was on a u.s terror watch list but also his mother as well what do you make of this and where are we in all of this well i don't know if his mother was on the watch list but the warning letters the fbi received in march of uh 2011 and the cia i think in november 2011 included the mother as someone to be worried about i think information sharing failed the fbi investigated the older brother but never shared the information with the fusion cell in boston so people in the boston area could be on the lookout when he goes back to russia in january 2012 the system pings at dhs but dhs doesn't share the information with the fbi or the cia and when he comes back in 2012 he creates a youtube channel of his own making where he got radical uh extremist videos that he's watching and interacting with so it's a failure to share information and missing obvious warning signs we're going back to the pre-911 stove piping well where do what do we do what needs to be done here a postmortem we need to find how could you miss the fact that the guy you you were informed by foreign intelligence service you got a radical in your midst we can't track him to russia we lose him going to russia and coming back far as an interview and when he goes on the internet for the whole world to see to interact with the radical islamic websites how do we miss that so we're going to have to up our game and when when these guys goes into the system and they leave the country we've got to make sure we know where they're going and interview them and when somebody in the database like this begins to openly interact with radical islamist websites an fbi agent should knock on his door and say you told us before you wanted to be an olympic boxer you love this country what the hell is going on here we're watching you let me turn uh to syria and the situation there where there are now reports that the syrian government was using a chemical weapons on its own people the president said last week this could be a game changer are you satisfied with the approach the administration is taking no i haven't been satisfied for a long time but having said that syria is difficult after the briefing was secretary of state kerry which was powerful four things are going to happen if we don't change course in syria it's going to become a failed state by the end of the year it's fracturing along sectarian ethnic lines it's going to be al-qaeda's safe haven the second thing the chemical weapons enough to kill millions of people are going to be compromised and fall in the wrong hands and the next bomb that goes off in america may not have nails and glass in it the third thing i worry about is the king of jordan he's had 500 000 refugees flood his country from syria they could be up to a million to three million in the next six months to a year and his kingdom could fall and he's a moderating influence a good ally to us in syria and the fourth thing if we keep this hands-off approach to syria this indecisive uh uh action towards syria kind of uh not knowing what we're gonna do next we're gonna have a war with iran because iran's going to take our inaction in syria as meaning we're not serious about their nuclear weapons program we need to get involved and there's a growing consensus bob in the u.s senate that the united states should get involved well some of the things that are being suggested a no-fly zone uh that could be pretty dangerous for the united states could it not because we understand the syrian government is setting up any aircraft weapons in those populated areas this will not come without some cost yeah there's nothing you can do in syria without risk but the greatest risk is a failed state with chemical weapons falling in the hands of radical islamists and they're pouring into syria the longer this goes the more likely you have a failed state and all hell's going to break loose in the region it's a disaster for the region it's going to be a disaster for the world one way you can stop the syrian air force from flying is to bomb the syrian air bases with cruise missiles you don't need to go deep into syria to do that if you could neutralize the air advantage the syrian government has over the rebels i think you could turn the tide of battle pretty quickly as to arming the rebels there are more radical islamic fighters there than they were last year and if it goes on six months more they're going to be more let's give the right weapons to the right people there's two wars to fight one to get a side out of there he's really a bad guy dangerous to the world the second war unfortunately is going to be between the majority of syrians and the radical islamists who poured into syria so we we need to be ready to fight two wars you don't need boots on the ground from a u.s point of view but you sure do need international actions to bring this thing to close quickly if it goes on through the end of this year the whole region's going to fall into chaos all right well senator graham thank you for being with us and sharing that this morning i want to

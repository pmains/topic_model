THE PRESIDING OFFICER: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. BENNET: THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. I WANTED TO SHARE A FEW WORDS ABOUT NINA WANG, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S NOMINEE FOR THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO. JUDGE WANG COMES TO THIS FLOOR WITH A COMMITMENT TO THE LAW ROOTED IN HER EARLIEST MOMENTS AS A CHILD, EARLIEST MEMORIES AS A CHILD. NINA'S FAMILY IMMIGRATED FROM TAIWAN TO KANSAS CITY WHEN SHE WAS JUST 2 YEARS OLD. LIKE MY GRANDPARENTS WHO IMMIGRATED FROM POLAND, NINA'S PARENTS HAD VERY STRONG ACCENTS. THEY KNEW ENGLISH BUT PEOPLE IN THEIR KANSAS SUBURB COULDN'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. SOME OF NINA'S FIRST MEMORIES WERE ORDERING PIZZA FOR THE FAMILY OR SPEAKING TO STORE CLERKS ON BEHALF OF HER PARENTS. HER FAMILY APPLIED TO BECOME PERMANENT RESIDENTS, BUT THE I.N.S. LOST THEIR APPLICATION. ONCE THEY RESOLVED THAT ISSUE, THE LAW HAD CHANGED AND THEIR PATHWAY TO LEGALIZATION WAS GONE. THEIR FAMILY SPENT YEARS IN LEGAL LIMBO RICOCHETING FROM ONE COURT TO ANOTHER. AND IF NOT FOR AN INTERVENTION BY LATE SENATOR ROBERT DOLE, NINA'S FAMILY WOULD HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS. AT THE TIME NINA MADE A PROMISE. IF I CAN STAY IN AMERICA, I'M GOING TO GIVE BACK TO AMERICA. THIS EXPERIENCE GAVE NINA FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM'S POWER TO CHANGE LIVES BECAUSE IT CHANGED HER OWN. IT MADE HER CHERISH AMERICA'S LEGAL SYSTEM WHERE EVEN NONCITIZENS HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT, AND IT INSPIRED HER TO PURSUE A CAREER IN LAW. SHE GRADUATED FROM WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SUMA CUM LAUDE, PHI BETA KAPPA, SHE EARNED A J.D. FROM HARVARD LAW SCHOOL AND SERVED AS EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS LIBERTY LAW REVIEW. SHE WORKED AS AN ASSOCIATE AT INTERNATIONAL LAW FIRM AND CLERKED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND. THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN COLORADO RECOGNIZED NINA'S TALENTS AND HIRED HER AS AN AUSA IN THE CIVIL DIVISION WHERE SHE MANAGED FEDERAL CASES RANGING FROM EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION TO BANKRUPTCY TO CIVIL RIGHTS. AND NINA WENT -- THEN WENT INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHERE OVER THE NEXT DECADE, SHE ROSE FROM ASSOCIATE TO PARTNER AT A TOP FIRM IN DENVER. IN 2015 NINA BEGAN SERVING AS A MAGISTRATE JUDGE FOR THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN COLORADO. JUDGE WANG NOW COMES TO THE COMMITTEE AND THIS FLOOR WITH 25 YEARS OF LEGAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPOSURE TO VIRTUALLY EVERY ISSUE THAT MIGHT COME BEFORE THE COURT. SHE ALSO COMES WITH A REPUTATION FOR FAIRNESS AND IMPARTIALITY. HER COLLEAGUES TELL ME SHE DOESN'T GRANDSTAND. SHE TAKES THE TIME TO LISTEN TO EVERY LITIGANT, WHETHER THEY HAVE REPRESENTATION OR NOT. SHE HAS REMAINED COMMITTED TO THE AMERICAN IDEAL THAT EVERYONE DESERVES THEIR DAY IN COURT JUST LIKE HER PARENTS. AND I FOR ONE AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL THAT SHE'S DEVOTED HER TALENT TO REALIZING THAT IDEAL IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. JUDGE WANG IS AN EXCEPTIONAL NOMINEE WITH UNIMPEACHABLE CHARACTER, INTELLECT AND EXPERIENCE. OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE APPRECIATED THAT ABOUT HER. THAT'S WHY THEY SENT HER TO THIS FLOOR WITH A STRONG BIPARTISAN VOTE OF 14-8. I EVEN THIEWSICALLY ENDORSE HER -- ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSE HER NOMINATION AND ENCOURAGE COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO VOTE FOR

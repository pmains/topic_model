Thank You mr. speaker rise today to discuss the life-saving impact of the Affordable Care Act this week I have heard from dozens of constituents who have been calling my office and reaching out on social media to tell me their ACA stories I heard from one constituent whose mother had two devastating lung diseases while she had good insurance unfair lifetime spending caps priced her out of receiving the life-saving treatment she needed when the Affordable Care Act passed we ended the cruel practice of lifetime spending caps with these new protections she was able to resume her treatment and stay healthy to spend time with her daughter and granddaughter mr. speaker the ACA works it reduces health care costs enables young people to stay on their parent's insurance and ensures low income and struggling families that they can access the care they need if Republicans repeal this law without a viable replacement there will be real consequences to real people let me be clear by repealing the ACA Republicans would end health care coverage from millions of families put the insurance companies back in charge and yes make America sick again I urge my colleagues to consider what's at stake here real costs real lives not just a political do the right thing and protect families health care

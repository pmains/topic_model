Thank You mr. speaking out thank the gentleman for yielding me the time I just want to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues for responding to what is an unprecedented event in the history of this country many of us who've studied history know full well that the country has been here before and we have always recovered the problem is many times that recovery is uneven and what we have done with this legislation is created the opportunity to have a more equitable recovery taking place and I thank you all for doing that the fact of the matter is this is a great country which does not have to be made great again what we've got to do is make this country's greatness accessible and affordable for all Americans this legislation makes an attempt to do that and I would hope that as we go forward we will build upon it and when we come back which we will we will have an equitable Society for all thank you

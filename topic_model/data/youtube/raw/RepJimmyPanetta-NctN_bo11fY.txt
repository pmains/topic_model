Thank You mr. speaker Madame lady from New York thank you as well I rise today to speak against restricting the family planning services that are provided by title 10 just prior to signing title 10 into law back in nineteen seventy President Richard Nixon recognized how essential family planning was to public self to public health excuse me he actually sent a message to Congress telling them and I quote no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition last year mr. speaker President Obama reaffirmed that sense that sentiment by making family planning services a part of basic health care regardless of where one lives although President Nixon's and Obama couldn't be more divided in their politics even they were united behind title 10 I believe this is understandable considering how title 10 ensures basic preventive health care and family planning services for four million low-income people every year in my district title 10 family planning services saves such of seven dollars on Medicaid related costs for every dollar of federal investment that means that clinics in my district like Marmonte are able to help more women and men receive a full range of health care services so rather than restricting family planning clinics we should be promoting we should be protecting and we should be preserving access to those vital services especially for those families that value and need it most Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back my time

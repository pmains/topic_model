I I thank the ranking member very much for his voice on this issue and so many others and my dear friend from California Karen bass thank you for your leadership Mr Speaker I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the foot trafficking victims first act which I wrote and introduced in the last Congress with congresswoman Karen bass the bill passed unanimously in May of 2017 and I hope that the house will again stand with the victims of human trafficking too often trafficking victims are overlooked and underserved in my home state of Missouri I've met with many survivors and listened to their painful stories they need help to rebuild their lives and that's exactly what this legislation will do America's courtrooms need to adopt victim centered practices oriented towards justice and recovery while victims technically have access to mandatory restitution in federal courts the sad reality is that according to one estimate sex trafficking victims get restitution in only fourteen percent of federal sex trafficking cases this is unacceptable mr. speaker this legislation will direct the Attorney General to work on increasing restitution and to adopt victim friendly procedures in criminal cases we believe the trauma-informed care helps victims recover and co-op cooperate with law enforcement so we may put pimps and buyers behind bars lack of help for victims in the justice system can lead to revitalise ation or even result in victims being criminalized for offenses that they were forced to commit the put trafficking victims first act encourages training for agencies law enforcement and prosecutors across the country to implement victim centered approaches to investigating and preventing trafficking we also encourage law enforcement to make every attempt to determine whether an individual's participation in trafficking is free from force fraud and coercion before arresting are charging them the lack of good data on how to find and rescue victims of trafficking is another major challenge in the United States we don't really know how best to identify and locate victims what proportion are coming from foster care or their ages ethnicity or other characteristics we can't help victims if we can't find them and we desperately need to improve victim outreach the put trafficking victims first act establishes a national working group to develop a public survey of survivors and robust methodologies to estimate the prevalence of trafficking this will help us understand how and where victims are accessing help to improve service provision finally victims of trafficking are mostly served at the state level so it is critical that states improve how they respond to victims we need to make sure that all child trafficking victims receive the same level of care that any other child abuse survivor would receive the bill encourages States to improve outreach screen children and reading child welfare services and the justice system screen for nationals who may be labor trafficked creates safe harbor laws and develop emergency response plans together we can get victims of trafficking out of dangerous and abusive situations and make trauma-informed services more accessible I urge my colleagues to put trafficking victims first and join congressman bass and myself and voting for this legislation

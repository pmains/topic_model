uh first off uh you know my first question is going to be for administrator bose in december of 2019 your predecessor administrator vittori launched the blocked rail crossing incident reporter for public and law enforcement to report blocked highway rail grade crossings and the goal of the program was to address block crossings through identifying chronic problems and working to address the underlying issues excuse me while block crossings occur in every corner of america in my district we're having issues in the communities of bement and decatur that i urge you to work with all parties to address my staff has consistently referred constituents to the fraser incident reporter and so far 235 reports have been filed in bmet and 197 reports have been filed in decatur since the tools launch in these municipalities trains block crossings for hours and sometimes days at a time the communities are literally divided emergency response times are slowed access to schools cut off and frustrated citizens consistently have their lives disrupted what is the fra doing with the data collected and what steps are being taken to further address block crossings congressman thank you for that question and uh i i wish your communities didn't uh um experience those uh those block crossings at fra what we do with that data was we look at it very closely to the extent that we can reach out to the railroad companies directly and share that data with them let them know that we're hearing a lot of complaints from that specific area and talk to them about operational changes that they can make improvements that they can make also now again with the grant programs that we have if we need to grade separate uh we give we talk about that those opportunities as well but the um contact with the community and our constant um back and forth with community and the railroads is very very important so we want to facilitate those conversations and we want to make sure that we can reach a conclusion a positive outcome collaboratively are are these numbers high compared to other communities they are high okay on another issue uh in my district we've consistently had the worst on time service for the saluki express and the illini express amtrak routes in central and in eastern and southern illinois can you give me any update on what's being done to address those issues on those lines has the fra heard anything from the rail lines or from amtrak yes congressman i'm glad you asked about that we now have quarterly metrics and standards reports that we get reports on on-time performance and we're now at a point where we've had consistent quarterly reports where we can look about look at next steps and i know amtrak is looking at next steps to address those issues in a comprehensive manner as you stated these lines are well known to have had years and years of continuous delays and now we think we have the tools in our toolbox necessary to move forward in a positive direction to address those and again our funding programs if there are issues with specific places that need sightings that need improved grade crossings we have the ability to fund those projects so let's address them together and move forward so that there are no delays i appreciate that or the the tools you're talking about tools to address the short shine issue in those particular lines yeah uh the short strength issues are things that we're looking at actively right now with amtrak with canadian national in particular and we've been looking very very closely at them and we think that there's been some very positive movement well i appreciate your optimism but forgive me for being somewhat of a pessimist because i've had this same conversation for years now and i get a lot of positive talk that we're all working together but i don't see the improvement to fix the short shut issue on those particular lines and and i said the last time your predecessor was here and the amtrak uh ceo was here and anyone related to this particular problem we got to see results and and frankly until we see results we're going to continue to push and put more pressure to help our constituents and i appreciate your time today thank you for your responses i'll yield back the balance of my time

ANTISEMITIC COMMENTS THAT HAVE GONE FORWARD, WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW HER TO BE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS. >> JOINING ME NOW, ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, DEMOCRATIC OF CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, A MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE. CHAIRMAN, YOU ARE ACCUSED OF LYING TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHICH IS, APPARENTLY, DISQUALIFYING FOR BEING ON A COMMITTEE, WHICH I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT, WE COVERED A LOT OF POLITICIANS. I DON'T THINK THAT THINGS YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR RESPONSE. >> WELL, BY LYING, KEVIN MCCARTHY IS REFERRING TO TRUTH ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, AND HOLDING HIM ACCOUNTABLE, IMPEACHING HIM, LEADING THAT TRIAL, BEING A MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE. LOOK, NOTWITHSTANDING THE BOGUS RATIONALIZATION, THIS IS ABOUT SATISFYING THE LOWEST ELEMENTS OF HIS CONFERENCE, THE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE'S WHO WANT PAYBACK, THE GOSAR, MATT GATES, AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS, WHICH IS KEVIN MCCARTHY CAN'T BECOME SPEAKER WITHOUT THE QANON CAUCUS IN HIS CONFERENCE. HE WILL DO IT, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE WILL TELL HIM TO DO. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. IT'S A TRAGEDY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHETHER I SAY AS CHAIR, OR I DON'T, IT'S NOT THE TRAGEDY. THE TRAGEDY IS, THERE IS SOME SERIOUS THINGS WE NEED TO DEAL WITH AS A COUNTRY, AND IN ADDITION TO THESE PETTY ATTACKS ON PEOPLE WHO HELD TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE, THEY ARE THREATENING DEFAULT ON THE NATION'S CREDIT, THREATENING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS IF WE DON'T CUT SOME SECURITY MEDICARE, THEY WANT TO INVESTIGATE ANTHONY FAUCI. I MEAN, IT'S ABSURD, BUT WE ARE GOING TO SEE THAT IF REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE SAYING ASYLUM, AND IT LOOKS LIKE ONE, LUNATICS ARE TAKING OVER. >> YOU HAVE THIS TO SAY, LAST VOTERS REJECTED EXTREMIST REPUBLICANS AT THE BALLOT BOX, YET DESPITE THAT CLEAR REPUDIATION, REPUBLICANS ARE PLAYING FULL STEAM AHEAD WITH THEIR CONSPIRACY THEORY AGENDA, A POLITICAL SIDESHOW FOR THE QANON BASE. THEY ARE SO DANGEROUSLY OUT OF TOUCH. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR GOVERNOR. THERE ARE THINGS THE HOUSE HAS TO DO TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT RUNNING. RIGHT? RAISING THE DEBT CEILING, WHICH YOU MENTIONED, WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY SAYING, BUT PASSING APPROPRIATIONS BILLS IN A TIMELY MANNER TO -- ARE YOU CONFIDENT MCCARTHY CAN WIELD THIS NARROW MAJORITY, TO DELIVER UP THAT THRESHOLD LEVEL, OR ARE THOSE GOING TO BE TOUGH, BIG, YOU KNOW, CATASTROPHES? >> NO. I'M NOT AT ALL CONFIDENT HE CAN DO EVEN THE BARE MINIMUM OF THE JOB. YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING IF YOU HAVE A LARGE MAJORITY AND YOU CAN SORT OF SAY, WELL, I COULD AFFORD TO IGNORE THE CRAZIES LIKE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. IT'S ANOTHER THING IF YOU HAVE A HANDFUL THAT ARE KEEPING YOU IN THE SPEAKER'S CHAIR, AND THEY ARE CRAZY, AND YOU HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH CRAZY IN ORDER TO DO THAT, TO KEEP THAT JOB, AND THE CRAZY ONES SHOT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT, AND SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. IT'S WHY JOHN BOEHNER WALKED AWAY FROM THE JOB, WHY PAUL RYAN LEFT THE JOB, AND KEVIN MCCARTHY IS NOTHING IF NOT MORALLY FLEXIBLE, VALUABLE AND, YOU KNOW, HE WILL DO WHATEVER HE IS TOLD TO DO, BY TRUMP, AND BY THESE EXTREME ELEMENTS OF HIS CONFERENCE. THAT WILL GET IN THE WAY OF BASIC GOVERNANCE. >> YEAH. >> YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THEIR GOVERNMENT TO WORK, AND I JUST DON'T SEE THEIR ABILITY, EVEN TO GOVERN THEIR OWN, LET ALONE GOVERN THE CHAMBER. >> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE, AND THAT SPEEDING TOWARDS ITS COMPLETION. ONE OF THE BIG OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS, OF COURSE, ABOUT TESTIMONY FROM TWO INDIVIDUALS, VICE PRESIDENT, THEN VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, AND FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED, AND HE IS CHALLENGING THAT SUBPOENA. MIKE PENCE WHO WAS INVITED, AND IN NEGOTIATIONS AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT, JUST CAME OUT WITH A BOOK, HE IS TRYING TO SELL THAT BOOK EVERYWHERE THAT HE CAN GO, AND BASICALLY, HE IS SAYING, IF YOU WANT MY TESTIMONY, YOU'VE GOT TO PAY THE 25 BUCKS FOR IT. THAT COMMITTEE DOESN'T GET IT. HERE IS HOW HE DESCRIBED HIS DECISION THAT YOU DON'T GET TO TALK TO HIM. TAKE A LISTEN. >> I NEVER STOOD IN THE WAY OF SENIOR MEMBERS OF MY TEAM COOPERATING WITH THE COMMITTEE, AND TESTIFYING. CONGRESS HAS NO RIGHT TO MY TESTIMONY. >> YOU ARE CLOSING THE DOOR ON THAT ENTIRELY? >> AND CLOSING THE DOOR ON THAT. >> WHY DO YOU THINK HE IS WRONG WHEN HE SAYS CONGRESS HAS NO RIGHT TO HIS TESTIMONY? >> BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S BASED ON BASIC, IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT CONGRESS HAS A RIGHT TO. INDEED WE DO HAVE A RIGHT TO HIS TESTIMONY. IT IS WHAT IS HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC AND TO THE COUNTRY? A FORMER PRESIDENT HAS COME AND TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS, CERTAINLY A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT CAN. AS YOU SAY, NO, IT'S MORE PORT IN FOR HIM TO SELL HIS BOOK. IT'S REALLY BASICALLY FOLLOWING THE JOHN BOLTON MODEL. I CAN'T COME IN TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS FOR SOME FICTITIOUS REASON, BUT I CAN PUT IT IN A BOOK AND MAKE MONEY FROM IT. YOU KNOW, LOOK, WE HAVE TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING MIKE PENCE SAYS AND DOES RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE PRISM OF TWO THINGS, HE WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, HE DOESN'T WANT TO ALIENATE THE TRUMP BASE ANYMORE THAN HE HAS TO, AND THIS IS HIS WAY OF WALKING THAT LINE. IT REALLY IS A DISSERVICE TO THE COUNTRY, FOR HIM TO PARADE THIS AS SOME KIND OF SANCTIMONIOUS DECISION THAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO MY TESTIMONY, IT DOESN'T, OF COURSE, ANSWER THE QUESTION, DOES HE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTRY? CERTAINLY, IF HE WANTED TO TESTIFY HE COULD, AND HE IS WITHHOLDING THAT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. >> TO THE EXTENT THERE'S ANY PRIVILEGED PUNCTURED BY THE FACT HE WROTE A BOOK ABOUT. IF HE DOES SEEM TO BE PLANNING IN 2024 RUN ON THE PLATFORM OF, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

being here tonight want to get your reaction to the breaking news how do you evaluate the Biden administration's handling of the situation and is there any more information you can share with us about this Chinese spy balloon I expect to be briefed undoubtedly a classified briefing when we get back to Washington DC on on Monday I saw there's not a lot more information I can share I think what's so interesting right now is whether it was uh used for military uh reconnaissance or um you know the the electrical Grid or some other reason uh we'll get briefed on that um the the initial information I received was it wasn't flying over militarily sensitive areas necessarily or they would have shot it down earlier but they didn't want the debris Landing in any uh civilian areas and so they waited until the the balloon got over the ocean now you tweeted this quote if a CCP surveillance balloon scares you wait until you hear about Tick Tock can you go into that further yeah well Tick Tock is a Chinese owned company it is conducting surveillance on its users uh part of the future war and I'm not suggesting we're in a war or I anticipate a war but uh the the future Wars will be fought using cyber warfare as well as uh Space Warfare and the more information we give to the Chinese Communist Party the more information they collect and are able to use against us in a cyber War it is absolutely crazy that we are allowing China to collect that kind of information and I have a bill now that would ban Tick-Tock in the United States uh the the hope is that that the company is sold to a U.S company or there are boundaries put on the information so that the Communist Chinese can't gather information on U.S users and you also announced a new Congressional Anti-Trust caucus you're leading with Congressman David sicilini a Democrat from Rhode Island you're calling some of these big tech companies monopolies how is this not a free market and how is it hurting the American people well uh the big tech companies aren't uh involved in a free market they are monopolies Google controls 94 of the searches in America um and and that alone uh uh defines it as as a monopoly but what is engaged in what these other companies apple apple Amazon and and Facebook are engaged in are are really discrimination against conservative voices and and conservative viewpoints and so they use their Monopoly status in a way that influences elections and influences the information that people get in this country and Congressman you made an impassion to peel on the house floor this past Tuesday calling for big tech companies to end discrimination against conservative voices as you know at T DirecTV they've dropped Newsmax after dropping oan what was the response you're hearing from colleagues on both sides of the aisle well first I'm hearing a lot of of people indicate that they are shocked that uh a t and DirecTV would engage in that kind of viewpoint discrimination and and that conduct and secondly I'm hearing a lot of support for Newsmax and and one uh in one America news to make sure that we have diversity of opinion on these platforms and so I I think uh that we will continue to gather momentum in Congress I would be surprised if we don't hold some type of hearings on Viewpoint discrimination and I want to go back to the Anti-Trust again you mentioned the big tech companies in your new book Congressman Buck what company do you think stands out as the most egregious in terms of monopolistic powers or uh just surveillance maybe or censorship of views well I think Google is is by far the worst of the four companies that I mentioned um Google acts in a way that tracks Americans every move and I encourage people when they're not using Waze or Apple Maps uh uh Google Maps or other devices to to get from one location to another with GPS that they turn that off so that they aren't just giving information but Google's uh controls the advertising digital advertising space the buy side the sell side and they bought the auction house uh that that is engaged in that and so they are in control of digital advertising a very dangerous Monopoly for the United States government to allow all right Colorado Congressman Ken Buck thank you for being here tonight appreciate your time thank you

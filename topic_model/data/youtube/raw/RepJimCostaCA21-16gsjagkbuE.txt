hello I'm Congressman Jim Costa and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very very happy and joyous holiday season this is my favorite time of year it's a time of year when we all gather with our family and friends our loved ones and take the opportunity to count our many blessings I know I certainly have much to be thankful for this year and when families come together it's also an opportunity to take stock of those challenges that we've also had but let us also remember to say thank you to those who serve our nation those who are overseas those who are in the military working for our national defense protecting America's interests all around the world are those who simply are inspecting our meat or protecting our borders are trying to make sure that our mail comes on time everybody plays a role and let us not ever forget to thank our veterans as well who for them and their families as well as those who are in active duty who have committed years of service to their lives to the defense of our nation and it's just not those individuals but it's the families as well we have faced a great deal this year and as we often found times in which we've struggled with our differences our friends our neighbors and here in Congress to try to find the common ground it's important that we remember that the bonds that we share as Americans the bonds that hold us firmly together that are reflected by our Constitution and our Bill of Rights are so so much stronger than any differences we may have and as Americans of course we're a diverse society but I think it's important that we positively look ahead for the future notwithstanding those challenges it's important to remember that we can accomplish so much more by working together as we've done recently in passing prescription drug reduction efforts and legislation that will provide legal status for people who work in our fields and put food on America's dinner table every night with our American farmers ranchers and dairymen it's important that we remember that in Congress when we work together in a bipartisan fashion we can get an important Trade Agreement passed so it's my hope that the positive efforts that we have been able to achieve we build on for the new year and so as we look at the close of this year let us reflect with the hope that peace and joy and good tidings will be for all Americans thank you so very much and Merry Christmas Happy Holidays Happy Hanukkah and to all the diverse communities that we reflect that we represent god bless each and every one of you

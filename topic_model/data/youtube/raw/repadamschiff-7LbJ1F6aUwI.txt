WASN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL OR  LET'S JUST LET IT GO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RELIVE THIS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE  NEED TO LEARN FROM IT AND MAKE  SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. >> IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THAT  INFORMATION OUT THERE. I'M GOING TO BRING YOU  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. GOOD EVENING, CONGRESSMAN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING. >> I HAVE A CLIFF OF IVANKA  TRUMP IN MID 2020. LISTEN TO THIS. >> I THINK AS THE PRESIDENT SAID EVERY SINGLE VOTE NEEDS TO BE  COUNTED AND NEEDS TO BE HEARD  AND HE CAMPAIGNED FOR THE  VOICELESS AND I THINK A LOT OF  AMERICANS FEEL VERY, VERY  DISENFRANCHISED RIGHT NOW AND  REALLY QUESTION THE SANCTITY OF  OUR ELECTIONS AND THAT'S NOT  RIGHT. IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. AND HE HAS TO TAKE ON THIS  FIGHT. LOOK, YOU FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU  LOVE THE MOST AND HE LOVES THIS  COUNTRY AND HE LOVES THIS  COUNTRY'S PEOPLE AND HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VOICE IS  HEARD AND NOT MUTED AND WILL  CONTINUE TO FIGHT UNTIL EVERY  LEGAL REMEDY IS EXHAUSTED AND  THAT'S WHAT HE SHOULD DO. >> SO ALEX HOLDER, THE  DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER WHO  TESTIFIED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  THIS MORNING TOLD ME THAT THIS  WAS A BIG FOCUS OF HIS  QUESTIONING TODAY. WHAT DOES THIS RAW FOOTAGE  REVEAL TO YOU AND WHAT DID THE  COMMITTEE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT  FROM HOLDER? >> WHAT IT SAYS TO ME IS HERE IS IVANKA BASICALLY PARROTING HER  FATHER. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING  THE ELECTION. YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LYING  ABOUT IT. SHE GOES ON TO SAY HE'S FIGHTING FOR WHAT HE LOVES MOST. YEAH, HE WAS. IT WAS DONALD TRUMP THAT HE  LOVES THE MOST, NOT THE COUNTRY. AS PEOPLE POINTED OUT SO  GRAPHICALLY TODAY WAS HE WAS  FIGHTING FOR THEM TO VIOLATE  THEIR OATH OF OFFICE, IGNORE THE CONSTITUTION, WRITE THIS  FRAUDULENT LETTER TO GEORGIA  SAYING WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT  FRAUD AND SUGGESTING MAYBE THEY  SHOULD CALL THEIR LEGISLATURE  BACK INTO SESSION AND HE WAS  GOING TO HAVE THESE LETTERS SENT OUT TO OTHER STATES AS WELL AND  IT TOOK THE THREAT OF MASS  RESIGNATIONS, 150 TOP LAWYERS  AROUND THE COUNTRY RESIGNING TO  GET THE PRESIDENT TO STOP. AND I THINK IT SHOWED US JUST  HOW CLOSE WE CAME TO  CONSTITUTIONAL COLLAPSE. >> I WANT TO COMPARE THAT TO  WHAT IVANKA SAID, WHAT SHE TOLD  YOUR COMMITTEE UNDER OATH, OKAY? HERE IT IS. >> I RESPECT ATTORNEY GENERAL  BARR, SO I ACCEPTED WHAT HE WAS  SAYING. >> BARR HAD GIVEN THAT  ASSESSMENT ON DECEMBER 1st OF  2020 AND YET IN MID DECEMBER SHE SAID THINGS THAT APPEARED TO BE  CONTRADICTORY. WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT TO YOUR COMMITTEE IN.  >> I WOULD NEED TO SEE THE FULL  TAPE DONE BY THE BRITISH  DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER. CERTAINLY ON THE BASIS OF THAT  EXCERPT SHE APPEARS TO BE SAYING ONE THING UNDER OATH AND ANOTHER THING FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION. SADLY, THIS IS ALSO A TRUMP  FAMILY STORY OF TELLING ONE  THING PUBLICLY, ANOTHER THING WE GET MAYBE THE TRUTH UNDER OATH  BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL. >> DOES IT MATTER THAT SHE TOLD  THE TRUTH UNDER OATH FROM A  LEGAL PERSPECTIVE? >> ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S NO JEOPARDY TO HER IN  LYING TO A BRITISH FILMMAKER, IF SHE WAS LYING TO THAT FILMMAKER. LYING UNDER OATH EXPOSES YOU TO  POLITICAL PENALTIES. THERE'S.  >> YOU CAN LIE TO THE PRESS. PEOPLE DO IT AND GATES, BROOKS,  BIGGS, GOMERT, POSSIBLY MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, TOO. WHAT DOES IT SAY THEY'RE ISSING  FOR PARDONS? >> I THINK OF HOW UNPRECEDENTED  THIS THIS IS. YOU HAVE MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS SEEKING A PARDON FROM  THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR  ROLE IN SOMETHING. HERE THEIR ROLE WAS IN A PLOT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. IT CLEARLY SHOWS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT AND A FEAR OF CRIMINAL  LIABILITY. THATS WHY YOU SEEK A PARDON AND  THAT'S REALLY JUST ANOTHER.  >> THERE WAS A SEARCH YESTERDAY  AT JEFFREY CLARK'S RESIDENCE. DOES YOUR COMMITTEE HAVE ANY  INFORMATION THAT COULD AID THE  D.O.J. THAT COULD SERVE IN THEIR INVESTIGATION IF.  >> I'M SURE WE HAVE INFORMATION  AND WE ARE IN DIALOGUE WITH THE  DEPARTMENT ABOUT HOW TO AND  BASICALLY OPEN YOUR FILES TO US, WHICH IS NOT WHAT'S DONE. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN SEVERAL  HIGH-PROFILE CONGRESSIONAL  INVESTIGATIONS THAT RAN  CONCURRENTLY WITH D.O.J.  INVESTIGATIONS AND THEY'VE NEVER SAID JUST GIVE US YOUR FILES NOR

with that i want to recognize mr case for five minutes thank you mr chair and thank you to each and all of you for your for your service and your your partnership um and um i i agree this is a good good solid budget that that um uh responds to the times that we are living in especially on the climate change side uh certainly in in our house appropriations committee where i'm also privileged to serve to include this the commerce science justice subcommittee which has jurisdiction over at least noah and a number of the other agencies we've tried to act on this budget so refining the budget refining the the initiatives i think is valuable i want to just spend a little bit of time more driving a few points home in defense of the parts of our country that are not part of the continental united states um because um one of you made the comment on states west of the 100th meridian and i pause for a second to think okay did they mean hawaii as well and obviously we are west of the 100th meridian but the point i want to make is that many of the national policies to include budgets and funding and focus of these programs often tend to focus on the really the issues of the western continental um united states and of course we have a lot of parts of this country that are not not the continental united states in general nor are they part of the west and there are a lot of misconceptions that often flow out of that mindset um that that um that that you know people like me always have to kind of correct and and so i would encourage broader thinking there and i would just uh make a couple of observations to to make the point in the bureau of reclamation for example you spoke to the importance of the bureau in in in water projects okay well those are the big rivers and the big dams and the big reservoirs and the big distribution systems we don't do that in hawaii nor does puerto rico do that or nor does guam do that nor does the virgin islands start as samoa we function on a different model we function on a model of watershed 20 percent of hawaii is is watershed and that watershed captures the water and filters it down into aquifers and we use those aquifers for our water critical water we don't get to divert water from one state to the other we don't have colorado river diversion discussions we've just got what we got and so the bureau of reclamation when you when you administer for example your water smart you know program it's it's i think it's valuable for you to always think about hey there's other ways that states and territories are dealing with with with water issues so that would be kind of one one example um another example uh would be many of the programs having to do with invasive uh uh and critical species um now uh fish and wildlife and usgs both have a piece of this and uh we appreciate the attention to our particular problems but sometimes people do forget um that when you're sitting on an island uh the the the issues around on dealing with invasive species and and critical habitats are different uh from the from the western united so you're in your own little ecosystem um and that's ecosystem has developed over a long period of time and it is highly fragile it is different from the western or for that matter anywhere else in the continental u.s ecosystem and it is it can be affected very negatively very fast from invasive species coming in so the mechanisms that are available should be thought about and utilized a little bit more from manoa perspective you know we don't we don't really particularly have an issue of noah not understanding the oceans i mean we're in the ocean noah does world class leading research in the oceans in hawaii um if anything the inverse is true or perhaps you know there's less of an appreciation of the issues in the western united states from a from you know from a possibly from an ocean's perspective but um also we do world-leading research and atmosphere atmospheric research uh uh out of noah in in hawaii which is sometimes uh neglected in terms of the budgeting and the funding process and then the final point i would make is um we're talking about droughts here um and of course the western united states is in a terrible drought west of the 100th meridian but so is hawaii and by the way so are a number of the other places in our country that you wouldn't think would be drought susceptible nor drought um um consequences we have one of the most severe droughts we've had in in our history recorded history in hawaii right now now we all think about hawaii as being all this lush tropical rain and how could how could a way of a drought well we have drought and so sometimes that gets lost in the national discussion when we start thinking about how do we solve drought for the western united states we have our own drought and we need different solutions so so that's a long way of of just making the comment and there's not a question in there unless you would like to respond to my comment that um as you look at these programs please think about uh how the impact how the how the situation is different in different parts of the country uh particularly parts of the country that are that do not fit the model of when these laws were actually enacted to start with my time is up so i guess you don't get the comment on my on my comment uh but anyway i appreciate your listening and um well we'll be happy to work with all four of you on implementing a lot of these um um policies in a in a specific way i think the gentleman

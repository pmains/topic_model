also wanted to say that there are two particular things in this package that will help north carolina more than other states and for those things i'm grateful one is making sure that these few remaining states that have not expanded medicaid have an opportunity during this coronavirus pandemic when people who don't have health insurance are most at risk have a sweetener a slightly higher federal match going up to 95 percent if north carolina takes advantage of this that could result in more than 2 billion for health care in our state during the next two years and i know that my colleague congressman butterfield was very supportive of this and i am grateful that that is in the package also north carolina has some of the most paltry unemployment insurance benefits both in terms of how much you get and for the period of time and with the additional unemployment benefits here people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own in north carolina will have a a lifeline so i want to thank all the chairs of the committees that have worked on this this is a good package it is not going to solve all of our problems but it will get us through the dark hours until we crush this virus we're on our way this is a way to help our people i am very much supportive and with that i yield back

it turns out we spent a ton of money to / secure border with with Mexico quarter of a trillion dollars over the last ten years we have spent less than 1% of that to actually address the root causes for all these people tens of thousands of people coming to our country the they're not coming from Mexico the more Mexicans were back in New Mexico the Mexican coming into the u.s. it's mostly Honduras Guatemala Salvador the the reason why they're coming is because of lack of hope like of Economic Opportunity corruption crime a lot of which we are complicit in because of our addictions drugs and the drug simply just trevor's come right through those countries on the way to to to to the US we need for those countries to do a number of things to encourage their people to stay home to live in Guatemala for example the they have have a presence or last president in up going to prison corruption vice president went to prison for corruption and they've elected a new president actually just have a comedy show on TV and this actually turns out he's not not very funny but he actually pretty smart and I think he's a problem is promising person gave one of the best inaugural addresses I've ever heard the but we need we need for the government of Guatemala to figure out how to govern better and how to actually make the government work we need for them to and they need that too we need for them to fight corruption eradicated to extinguish the gangs and do all the extortion and killing people the and we need for them to foster a better climate for economic growth so that people have jobs they're not have to come to to our country like they are currently so I met the new president of guatemala men right after he's elected and lasts till he last year the is the first time the vice president's madam and it was important they spend some time together they did and then the ideas for for them to do these things in for us to help for us to help in for us to make clear to them if you don't do the things that we're expecting to do and show measurable progress on these funds don't expect a lot of money for us there is we're willing to help out like we did Colombian number of years ago but you've got to do your part

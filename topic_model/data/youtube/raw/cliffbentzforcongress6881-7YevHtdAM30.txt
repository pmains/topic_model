here's bill Meyer boy the radio and TV ads are really incredible for this second District House Republican or race for to be the Republican nominee to replace Greg Walden cliff pants rejoins the program senator welcome back to the show good to have you on oh thank you Bill thank thanks so cliff I guess we call you former state senator but you ended up or resigning in order to run for this seat here the way that you're being portrayed and now I know that politics are really interesting and by the way I'm gonna talk with Jimmy Crumm Packer tomorrow about these kind of things too it's it's astounding the way people are being represented in the ads out there and I haven't got a robo call the other day essentially calling you what is it Kate brown loving liberal and you just love to raise taxes that was kind of the message that was taken there and I may not know a whole lot about you but I don't really remember that performance when you were a state senator and I was wondering maybe you could give me lay on the ground it's not that I want you to respond to what opponents are saying because you can say just about anything you want on a political ad and you can't get suited for it okay that's just the way it goes your first amendment really protects a political speech but I'm giving you some political speech at this point and I'm wondering if you could set some record straight here please well first of all thanks for the opportunity to us to speak I think that that the accredited more factual than that which you heard on your on the robo call them the the fact that the fact the matter is I think that that robo call probably came from a doctor Bueller and I'm thinking further that he is so accustomed to attacking Kate Brown he can't you somehow can't get himself cleaned from from her as a target so what he's trying to do now is blink his normal targets Kate Brown who know you can't blame him really he's running hystrix parties lots of times but he is but it's a normal thing for him and so if he can't I mean to Kate brown well that's that's what he's trying to do here's the truth of it the governor I've known for many years as she was in the Senate when I went into the house and so of course I know her she's I wouldn't call her a close friend because she's not she did invite me up to her office as governor several times I can probably count them on one hand over the number of years that she was governor and I would say neither the house of the Senate now senator Baird sugar was telling me a few minutes ago that you were his deputy leader at that time was another case yeah that was actually the the thing that comes to mind or the meetings that come to mind that are the most clear in my mind are the ones where the governor was extraordinarily angry withwith both senator Barr sugar and me as a very very angry using a lot of words that we most assuredly could not use on your radio show here and her her telling us in no uncertain terms what she would do to us if we walked out the first time and then again the second time well we walked out both times and so to say that we didn't stand up and came around is ridiculous and and and of course the that was when I was assistant leader with Herman I was also assistant leader in the house - Mike McLane and charged with negotiating the 2017 transportation package and I walked out of the governor's conference room at least once I just in my mind twice when she refused to put a disclosure piece in for the low-carbon steel stance I just said hey we're leaving and walked out again I said upstate Brown I say it's just you know our friend dr. Bueller saying things like he stood up to Kate brown well he stood up getting lost so we stood up we walked out we want so I'm a little bit I'm a little bit taken aback by his attempt to time you decay I don't blend I don't I don't it's not just a surprise I do blame he should know better he shouldn't go negative that's a bad thing I think the voters don't like it what they want to hear is why he would be a good congressman what's good about you and what's happening is he's basically proving he's not going to be a good congressman because he's going on the attack instead of building himself up he's tearing others down that's that's a reflection of someone who's very scared about being a three-time loser that's what's going on now the one thing I would say though is that a negative camp can be very effective that's otherwise people wouldn't be doing it tear cliff I really I just wanted to just mention that to you there's a reason why people go negative because it can work and you know in a hail-mary sort of situation and I just don't like this store hid representations of any particular candidate out there I really don't that's why if they want to come on I'll certainly try my best to just set some of this straight tell us about the compromises done with the transportation bill because I think that's being they're trying to hang that around your neck on well you're a big catcher know that sort of thing well thank you so that we knew the build was going to pass there were 25 Republican 35 Democrats they needed one vote and so we knew that within our 25 there were several who would make the private deal and that build with that we knew it also in other words kind of deal and get something for their district added into the bill and then they end up cleaning up a little bit at home but at the price of selling out the entire Republican caucus right very well so we knew that and so what Mike McLain our leader was able to do is they look everybody will send Benson as the negotiator and he will do his best to protect the state and protect all of you as opposed to one of you making some private ideal and and and and the state being the worst for it so I spent five months negotiating this bill going back by the way not every day but frequently to the full caucus news dealer was part of that caucus and I was explained the entire bill and what we were doing and say is this what you want this was not on me this was on the entire caucus and by the way we well so what were the trade off keeping in mind that I was negotiating from a position of the minority I had so your position your negotiating from the position of weakness and the only thing you can do is walk out like you've done a couple of times right that's all you do but you could play well but no this is a no 17 Oh Santino sorry 17 we walked out in in 90 and so the the years before the walk out with fool that that even was there even discussed at that point and so as the infrastructure concept underlying the bill is one that you know forgive me but I'm on president's front side on this thing we do need infrastructure the challenge is always did how to keep the Democrats from using the bill as an opportunity to basically throw you out of your car and get you into a bus tour logo sticker I'm not sure what but that was what they were trying to do and the the idea also was that they were going to put in a twenty five cent gas back to increase by my being at the table and and Michael explained holding the team together we kept it at ten cents and and more to the point we were able to phase that in over six years if this business phased in yet and we were able to figure it every other year whose death and I and by the way I would add I'm a supporter of gas tax and also gas tax increases and I know some people may get angry with me but people want their roads built and they want their roads rebuilt something has to pay for it and it's one of the few taxes that actually goes to what it's named for or you know gas tax or actually goes for that the problem is though is that we do have that supermajority in Salem which has been wanting to carve out a bunch of that and use it for the green agenda that'd be fair to say cliff because we were at the table you know the old saying if you're not at the table you're on the menu and you know you're on the menu and so we we were able to do some amazing things and get them into the bill the one that was the most difficult I was getting a disclosure of the cost of the low carbon fuel standard which is adding between four and six maybe seven cents a gallon invisibly you don't see it and the environmentalist did not want that fall out and I said no you are we are going to address this low carbon steel Center and you will fess up to the Oregonians this is what it's costing and you know what it got in the bill and that was one of the reasons it took until basically the last several days to finally get this done because then people say well this was came from Bill no was this was a bill that was actually initiated by the Democrats in the house and and in fact when when we were negotiating it to the floor approach here well I was a vice but with Brian both wished and two others I actually asked the governor's representative to leave the room to get out goodbye yeah because there was an obvious attempt by the governor to make the bill of her own essentially essentially here cliff what I'm trying to illustrate this is wearing reason I wanted to have you come back on is that the art of compromise unfortunately is there you know it'd be great to be able to say hey we're just gonna have everything we want the highway or the height or they you know either my way or the highway but you know unless you have a supermajority it's difficult to get everything you want and even then the minority party which the Republican Party was in this particular case is going to have to do what it can to just cut a deal to make a bad bill less bad would that be a good way of putting it that's how I'm seeing it just the way it works well yeah you can sit in the corner and vote no and get run over wash to let your but your district get hurt or you can walk out which is the technique that we had not adopted it's in those in those years and or you can sit there and do your very very best to make this thing work in a way that's not destructive to your community and try to hold your community make your scenes better for it by the way I put thirty million dollars in the bill or Medford you can talk to see what degrees him wall under you got exactly what we did and how we did it if you get that 30 million for seismic protection of Medford in the bill and one other thing that works the the new dealer eventually voted against the bill after he had passed through all the meeting and I had actually sat down with him and said there's the project or including Eastern Oregon what do you have in mind and he sees selected Cooley interchange fifty million dollars the largest one for north bet he then voted against the bill voted against his own the project it would come to him and gave his his reasons for voting against the bill you wanted more money for Portland so so I mean you can do one eight two more projects for Portland which means more money for but okay all right so cliff Nancy's running for Congress cliff can you hang on for another segment here but I I wanted to ask you before we do this break though this experience in it's it's very rare that I would have a congressional candidate coming on it and explained what had been going on in state legislative sessions past as it is all being turned around and twisted at this point and that's why I felt like when I'm hearing a lot of these ads and some of my robo calls that I'm hearing an alternative reality like I wonder if there had been a space time continuum tear and I was put in some alternative universe and that's why I want to please talk with you about it and give you a chance to do this what has what happened as a state legislator or an estate senator how is that prepped and how will that help you if you were nominated for the Republican candidate so the most important thing is that you recognize the importance of listening really really carefully and understanding what it is everybody want and then this is terrifically important and it means going back to your County Commissioners which I've done Footwear over again that's that's why I've been endorsed by one of your commissioners of Bob Strasburg and and and and 32 other commissioners because I am with them and I say hey but what is it you want and then when I go back into whether it's Congress or the legislature and say when somebody stands up and says well this is what we want to do and I say I don't I don't think that's consistent with what the folks I represent what so one of the most important things is learning how to live another though is you've got to know your limitations you can't go in thinking that just because you're the new guy there and smart and and and whatever you might be that they're all demolition see they're not and what was going to happen is you've got to you've got to learn who your friends are you gotta learn to share common goals with you and you've got understand the workings of the political machine and I know how God's work I'm know exactly how a caucus worked you don't know who's in it and you got to know the rules that apply when you're moving a legislation forward but yeah 12 years in the house - in the Senate I know how I know I know how that process works and we don't like the term but you got a great you got to know how to make and grind the sausage right that's a big part of that cliff benches with me and he's running for Congress it's 8:30 we'll take your calls at seven seven oh five six three three if you have a quick question for a cliff that just get

at deaf m106 7km ET you're waking up with the phil meyer show on 99 3 k CMD + FM 106 7 km e d it's 8:31 cliff bents is with me he's GOP congressional primary candidate former state senator it's also a former state representative and art you have been hanging on for quite some time here and good to had you on question for cliff go ahead yeah good morning so I didn't know much about cliff before this I had no idea who he was but I understand that you're a property and water rights attorney and that you worked with the Klamath farmers against the Bureau of Reclamation denying water rights to the farmers claims that his intro yeah you know so here's what here's that there was two different eyes we're confused atthenes in the in Atlanta when I was a private lawyer I represented some of the ranchers that were up on the north end of the project in the adjudication and I did my best to do particular water rights in that faith that was in the adjudication I also represented some of the folks down around below the dam and again in the adjudication and the idea there was to put their best foot forward when it came to the claims that they had for use of water going back to thank you know for 1907 in that state so when I went in the legislature 13 years ago I picked up all of those files I think there were ten of them or maybe eight I can't remember I handed them to another attorney Ron Yocum and he took over from there that was that was my involvement that that that in that state I also when I got in the legislature I led the opposition to the dam removal bill that's my folks in my district opposed dam removals at all cost and I did my very best to to point out the shortcomings of base-2 settlement agreement I lost that argument the settlement unit passed and then ultimately fell apart without federal fund clarify what do they ask you aren't you yeah and let you have one more question you you had a question here on the law on the screen of Auden about about Senator Wyden's logging plan go right ahead so in today's mail Tribune Ron Wyden has introduced a multi-billion dollar bill to reduce wildfire fields he wants to give five and a half billion dollars to the u.s. Forest Service and the bad land management he wants to give another nine billion to train and hire people to restore the watershed and another six billion to put people to work tackling projects and maintenance backlogs at the u.s. Forest Service well couldn't we just log it with private enterprise and basically do the same thing okay let's let him answer that the other thanks for that a call art I just don't burn up too much daylight I would also add is that when I hear about the watershed restoration that sounds suspiciously like this would be water to or this would be money to facilitate the yanking of the dams cliff and I'm wondering if you might respond to that what day when he asked right okay so the short answer to this question is yeah if we get back into the woods we would be spending that kind of money which by the way so I'm gonna take a wild guess here and say that with what the senator is doing is looking at this sudden realization if that's the right word that trillions of dollars can be spent without having to worry about paying back I disagree with that and there's got to be there's got to be some sensitivity which I think the Senate and the House Republicans are saying wait a minute wait a minute slow down this money is real and one way or the other we're gonna pay it back but but I think what maybe the senator is doing today hey if we have this free money let's throw it at the forest problems and that's that's why you see suddenly all of those billions propping up this is not to understate the need they're just no doubt world we've got to get back in the forest and reduce the amount of wood and and to breathe and the five schools that have grown up around so many of our towns and pretty so many people at risk we absolutely have to do that I know down in Bedford you guys are just plagued with the smoke ashland it's horrid it's gonna get worse we need to do something yeah between the covin shutdowns and potential smoky eye it's kind of a one-two punch here cliff the climate basin compact is still in effect it is still settled law passed by Congress many years ago as you well know and you were fighting to keep these dams in would you be a yes or no vote if this if it ends up coming in to Congress that yeah we're going to get rid of that compact yank those dams out because it still hasn't been funded or approved by Congress essentially just what's going on yeah well I'm gonna be no but I'll tell you tell you it's super like I said earlier it's super important that you go to the community that you represent and you say what is it you people want now the challenge in the Klamath is that there's a whole bunch of people that want a whole bunch of different things and so you have to and I already started this I went down two weeks to go to the planet and I go down in one day it was it was a long day 700 miles in one day about 11 1/2 hours of driving but I drove down spent five hours there listening to one group and I'm and I've offered to drive down again after the election and listen to the next group and then the next group and the next group so you understand what the local community wants that is the most important thing but by my my initial position is always going to be let's not take the dams out because the next steps gonna be to take out Snake River dams the next step is going to be safety does it take up the Columbia River Dam and those pieces of infrastructure once god I'm never coming back we can't do that same 37 that can you hang on for one more segment here cliff okay can you do that alright guys we have a lot of people

back with Republican congressional primary candidate cliff Ben's former state senator state legislature and looking to make this jump asking for your vote here and let's go to Cohen Cohen how you doing this morning you have a question from Grants Pass for cliff go ahead yes sir good to talk to you again bill you bet it's up um cliff um I have a two-part question for you first of all is it possible that governor Kate brown is currently sandbagging for unemployment numbers to later affect the national election and second is it possible or what would you do to facilitate the unemployment checks getting to Oregonians more rapidly and efficient so as the first question I guess it's possible although that that sounds complicated to me so I'm not sure how she would do it and how would play in that space it sounds like you're more familiar with that then than I am but after the second question I have been receiving calls here at the office from people who have not received their their unemployment and it's a terrible deal for them and of course what should be happening and perhaps it is I haven't checked the perhaps their their hiring other people to help because if if ever there was a moment when you needed to have your unemployment check it and so if they're not getting additional help they need to be doing so so I wish I could have answered your first part of your questions more clearly but sorry on that okay alright : thanks for the question hey cliff I wanted to touch on is something that the senator Barrett shaker told me a few minutes ago that the the the plan seems to be to hang on to that kovat 19 stimulus money which was given to the state of Oregon by the federal government and to actually hang on to it under the hopes that there is a presidential transition and then Kate would be able to use it to backfill the budgets is that something that you as a congress person could could fight back against to make sure that she doesn't try to do that even if there is a change of a presidency we don't know what happens in November now we don't know well I'm certainly wouldn't I certainly wouldn't says there are so many complexities here but let me just say that so our local governments are going to be in huge need of help because of the reductive reduced taxes and and and the other things are happening occurs that there's to be some huge challenges local governments are going to be faced we're gonna get our first glimpse of that on the 15th when the revenue forecast comes in as we understand it's due to three billion dollars short and so that money is at one point I think it's 1.6 billion roughly I'm probably off a bit there but that money is terrifically important and it needs to be put into the places where it's needed most and that would mean a very very broad conversation and in the setting of a priority I've already been talking to our state senator here in Findlay they took my place and also Mark Owens my old house key and and suggesting to them that they get the rural parts of the state including of all of cd2 together as a as a block and say hey this is what we need this is how badly we need it and get ready to make that prioritization argument effectively all right cliff dance is with me this morning and say we got a former senator Allen de barro online hey Alan how you doing welcome back very good I'll just dip quick into it cliff is one of the most detailed persons that understand what he's voted on and read everything we couldn't have a finer representatives and I've already voted for cliff and urge everybody else to and cliff thank you for not going negative I won't vote for any of the babies that's doing negative ads this is disappointed in new dealer for distorting your record and the work that you did to help your Oregonians especially your constituents in Eastern Oregon so I'll listen off the air to the rest of the question all right thanks senator appreciate the call Thank You Alan all rights go to Brad hey Brad how you doing this morning Brad Bennington oh the Builder guy are you doing Brad yeah good morning to you cliff good morning to you Brad Brad Zdenek and you're saying thanks for running boy I'll tell you an adorable endure boy I don't know how you talked out except there's one other endorsement that you've got that I didn't want to ask you about and cliff what would you please would you know we've talked a little bit about your response to some of these things that are going on but for something you like me is really important that somebody is going to represent me understands my district could you please talk a little bit about how you understand this district and how big your senate district is inside the congressional district that you propose to represent and and how you can do that how well you know it and the other thing is is would you please talk a little bit about the fact that there is a congressman that has represented this district before done a really good job of it for a long time and he has endorsed you please talk a little bit about Bob Smith endorsement of your your campaign and why that matters okay Brad I appreciate the at least the okay clip he's telling you to blow your horn a bit I guess well thank you for that question I appreciate it congressman Bob Smith has been a friend for many years he was the one that advised me years ago he said here's where you're going to do you'll run for the House then you run for the Senate if you want to go on from there fine but do a good job in both places first and and I listened closely he was nivas a he was a very good friend his family's gonna go spend his sons for good friends and I so much appreciate this endorsement when I met with him to discuss the endorse but he told me three jokes I absolutely midnight or two before from Hema but it was great as far as my knowing that the district of course I know what my family's been here for a hundred years in this district my family is nieces and nephews scattered all across the district we've been ranchers over here three of my brothers families are still in the ranching business as a lawyer I represented literally dozens if not hundreds of ranch and farm families out across all of CP - not as many down in in Medford as as there's other places but a few so I know the space really well my dad used to be on logging when he was young man so of course logging is still a big deal my sisters married to a an engineer who's also a timber faller so I know the logging space extremely well I know the water space extremely well and and and I think i'ma think I'm one of us out here in DD - let me ask you before we take off is it is not a monolithic Republican or conservative district you know if things are have gone a little purpley what would you say to those on the other side of the political spectrum about about how you would represent very interest - and I'm kind of I'm not asking - for you to argue against yourself but do you see where I'm coming from it's it and I know this is a primary race I suppose maybe this is a question better for later on this year but maybe for those who are a bit more moderate let's say so the key for this step this question because I've heard another type of key is that I'm gonna stick with my principle that's that's the most important thing but the second thing is I'm gonna listen as I've already mentioned two or three times in this call the most important thing is to listen to what it is people want many times what they want has little to do with political positioning and so the the challenge is listen carefully and then within the scope of your principles respond appropriately so constituent service is is a it's probably the most important thing particularly when you're in the minority because many times you don't have as much to do when you're there except make sure your people are taking care of is the best you can so what I will promise is I'm going to listen listen and listen and then do my that's do to help cliff banks calms the website you want to find out more and of course the voting is on right now as we speak cliff it's a good having you on thanks for running for Congress good having you here

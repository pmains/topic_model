welcome back we are have back with us south carolina congresswoman nancy mace it's great to see you okay we have energy secretary jennifer granholm today she said the pipelines quote are the best way to go to deliver oil and gas she got her job by supporting killing the keystone pipeline so what do they want now excuse me let's do a do-over get those ten thousand jobs back what are they doing right this will probably not be the the first or the last time we see a reversal a fortune for president biden's administration particularly after the abysmal jobs report on friday where economists predicted a million new jobs in the first quarter and they came out with 250 000 so just so happens when you killed the keystone pipeline you killed tens of thousands of jobs and biden is going to learn the hard way following in the footsteps of nancy pelosi and aoc and socialist policies are job killers for everyday hard-working americans mean the debate is do we need more pipelines we just went through an oil boom why don't we have more pipelines i mean they're less gses and trucks to deliver a via pipeline the biggest oil pipeline in the u.s the colonial is still shut down because of that crippling cyber attack out of russia it's about half the fuel supply for the east coast you see it in your state we're talking about five dollar gas and gas lines right so what do you say well absolutely and all across the eastern seaboard right now and there are states of emergencies are being put in place my number one comment on colonial right now is i just want to urge calm to the american people we are going to be up and running back soon a state like south carolina we do have enough fuel to last us several days so i'm just if we hoard gas it's going to mean higher prices for everybody and it will extend the problems we're having with colonial to be even longer but pipelines have been effective under president trump's administration we were less dependent on foreign sources of energy under the biden administration well he's reversing that policy and we're seeing the effects of that today yeah so you're talking we hear what you're saying again we haven't seen five dollar gas in about 10 years and the southeast coast is now getting hit in the carolinas virginia georgia and florida aaa also warns mississippi and tennessee but you're saying don't panic the white house says it doesn't see a supply issue emergency shipments of gas and diesel already on the way and the pipeline is going to be back up and running by the weekend but still it's really nerve-racking yeah it is absolutely nerve-wracking yesterday i went to go fill up my car i did a half tank as opposed to a full tank i didn't need a full tank this week i could wait a few extra days until the pipeline was back online because there are people who do travel for work or for business or need to get their kids to school and we need to make sure that those folks have fuel in their cars so right now what i do know is in south carolina we do have enough fuel other states north carolina and georgia need they've announced that they're going to have a state of emergency potentially south carolina is already under that state of an emergency because of covid19 so i just want to make sure that we urge calm and not panic right now over the next couple of days to get through this let's watch former energy secretary rick perry on this watch this i'm pretty sure the clinton administration bush administration the obama administration all worked to get america to be independent of other countries of oil and gas and we did that under the trump administration we not only became independent we became dominant and this administration wants to take that away stop building pipelines well if there was ever a wake-up call hey uh president biden maybe we should build more pipelines instead of shutting them down this was it today with the colonial pipeline this is insanity well you know the issue too is 85 percent of energy installations across the uh the output across the country is in the private it's in private hands in the private sector so what is the infrastructure bill that the biden administration has been touting what will they do to protect that we keep hearing a lot of rhetoric but not details from pete butterjudge it's getting really tedious and tiring to hear the you know the padding and the the word salads and all the rhetoric but what what are they details there what do you know right well we do know in the initial infrastructure package that they had to rename because they couldn't sell to the american people from infrastructure package the american jobs plan i think is what it's currently called i can't even keep up anymore because i couldn't sell it the first time around what we do know is they wanted to spend just as much or more funding on electric vehicles which should be a private industry spend an investment in research and delivery and everything else rather than on our energy grid or protecting the very place where we are vulnerable to cyber attacks and so they're doing it backwards does that make sense i mean natural gas powers utilities which will power the electric cars okay thank you congressman nancy mesa wish we had more time

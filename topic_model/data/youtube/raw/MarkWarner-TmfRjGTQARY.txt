let me bring on now as she stated he is on intelligence he has certainly been committed to social justice he is certainly one that has regarded and respected the civil rights community let us welcome senator mark Warren [Applause] good morning let me first of all thank Reverend Al for allowing me to come here this morning you know I go back a long way we first started working together when I took on what folks thought was a little bit of a fool's errand but way back in 1989 I joined and then became campaign manager for then young man named Doug Wilder right that became the first african-american governor elected in his own right in our nation and even as far back as 1989 Reverend I was in the fight I know we've got mr. Clyburn represent Green here but I want to also make a comment about Senator Harris you know we saw her in the Judiciary Committee hearings many of us saw her when she took on then Attorney General Sessions in our intelligence committee hearings well when she took on the questions around Jim Comey in our intelligence committee hearings what you don't see and when I get a chance to see on a regular basis is the amount of hard work energy and commitment she puts in because on the Intelligence Committee 90% of what we do is behind closed doors but behind those closed doors hers is a voice even though she's a new member that is listened to by people on both sides the ILA and brings an enormous power and intellect to these issues now I was thinking about coming in here this morning going through a series of pieces of legislation that would be part of this networks agenda but I want to take a moment and maybe step back and talk about what I think is an even bigger issue now for those of you don't know my background and I'll make this brief before I was in politics before I was Senator before I was governor I was a business guy remember beating a couple years out of law school took my life savings I decided become an entrepreneur life savings $5,000 invested in a little energy startup company went to work for that company and in six weeks I helped that company go totally bankrupt I then went into real estate move to Atlanta and six months on that and failed at that as well but I never took out those bankruptcy charges third time though 1982 I'm living out of my car sleeping on my friends couches and I got a third shot I fell into the very early days of the cellular telephone industry still remember all my law school classmates saying to me wanna go get a real job who's gonna want a car telephone they're still practicing law but I was incredibly blessed but I also realized that in America I'm not sure that every American gets three shots if I've not been a white man with the appropriate education I probably wouldn't have got that third shot I might not have gotten that second shot I might not have even had a first shot and as somebody who is benefited as much as I have from this system I benefited beyond my wildest imagination but I stand before you today in 2018 and would argue and even though I've been the beneficiary of this system that modern American capitalism is not working for enough people and what we ought to be talking about and what the network's agenda ought to be beyond specific pieces of legislation is a forward leaning theory of the case how in America in the 21st century every American gets an opportunity to earn a good life not be given a good life but to earn a good life because there are three issues I think that undermine that opportunity right now right now in America today there is more economic inequality and income inequality at a greater level than any time in our American history except for about 1928 right before the Great Depression came today in America and conally made mention of this half of Americans are four hundred dollars away of an unexpected bill from going into bankruptcy and we have in this nation enormous amounts of economic insecurity my dad never made a lot of money he went to work for the same company 38 years he worked for that company but with that job came a certain level of security with that job came health care retirement and if he were to lose that job there was unemployment workman's comp disability that world doesn't exist today so we have income inequality we have income insecurity and we also have an enormous disparity in terms of equality of opportunity in terms of where you live or what you look like in America matter of fact Avonlea over thirty four hundred counties in America about twenty-two hundred of those counties in the last ten years have lost jobs and lost businesses if you look at the statistic ninety percent ninety percent of all new jobs in America they're not coming from the big old-fashioned corporations they're coming from startups but if we're going to make sure everybody America has that opportunity to earn a good life that is not going to work when 90% of all venture capital goes to only three states California New York and Massachusetts that is not going to work when less than 10% of all venture capital goes to women that is not going to work in terms of America where everybody gets an opportunity when less than 2% of venture capital early-stage funding those African Americans or Latinos so let me in my a couple moments here lay out what I think ought to be our agenda an agenda that doesn't look backwards an agenda that doesn't seem to be wistful for the good old days but recognizes that the rate of Technology the rate of globalization the rate of change is only going to accelerate so with you permission Reverend out let me lay out where I would hope we would be fighting because as communists said fights like this if the time is right the fight is right right number one in a world where we're not going to work for the same job for 35 years in a world where our children for the most part don't work one job but work two or three at once they may be working as an IT can so driving uber and renting out the department Airbnb matter of fact in America in 2018 and this started in the 90s as companies started to outsource jobs not just to abroad but if you are the janitor if you are the housekeeper you didn't work for Apple you work for a subcontractor today in America in 2018 one-third of Americans work in some level of contingent work they're either part-time they're independent contractors that are gig workers and the enormous thing about that third of the workforce they may be doing okay until the stuff hits the fan and they have no social safety net the social contract that was created in the 20th century between business labor and government has broken down as 21st century progressives we ought to be creating a portable benefit system that says no matter what kind of job you have no matter whether you are independent contractor gig worker or on your own as you work you ought to collect some benefits and those benefits ought to travel with you as you move from one job to another so if you are at that 45 year old age and you suddenly have a break you've got something to fall back on we need a social contract that meets the workforce where it's at in the 21st century a second thing we need to look at you know every business leader everybody has this truism you know our biggest asset is our people my biggest asset they leave the door at night when they workers go home but you know what in our tax code in our accounting system we give no credit to human capital there was legislation created about 25 years ago called the R&D tax credit it said we ought to promote research and development that's a good thing and if you make an investment as a company in something that qualifies as research and development you not only get to deduct that but you get a tax credit so if you're a company and you go out and spend $1,000 on buying a new compute you will get a tax credit an R&D tax credit and you will also be able to put that computer in a sense you call it an asset you put on your balance sheet you get credit for it if you spend that same $1000 investing in a human being you get nothing it's a cost it's a liability well if we believe that investment human capital is important and I've got bipartisan legislation to do this we ought to create the equivalent of an R&D tax credit for human growth we ought to have a human being arm detachment so if you invest a thousand dollars in training somebody up skilling them that company ought to get a tax break you ought to have to record how much you're investing in human capital and shouldn't we at least have a system from tax and accounting that values people as much as we value machines and other pieces of equipment that is where our future lies we are recognized as well no matter how much education you have if you're not able to continue to upskill throughout your career your chances of staying engaged staying involved having that fair shot is going to disappear so again we've created legislation that says we ought to have a lifelong learning account government helped out chipping in some too so you could accumulate money along the way so if you have that bump you have the resources to actually keep those skills that you need to stay in a job market we never also and recognize I stand before you as somebody who's been extraordinarily blessed to do well in this system but something is wrong or something is different in America we're in 2018 if you look back 40 years ago the average amount of time somebody held on to a public stock was eight years the amount of time somebody holds on to a public stock today is two months the great American companies that were created Perceval post-world War two could not be created today because the urge for short-term profits over long term you undermines the ability to kind of create those great enterprises so we ought to have a tax code in the system that doesn't say simply go for that next two cents next quarter to show profits and at the same time lay off investing in human beings without having system that rewards long-term value creation you under the tax reform fine let's incent at reform for long-term value home do you want a capital gain fine let's make it based upon a five-year hold you got pension funds fine you want to make sure that the people who manage those pension funds don't get compensated just on how well they do the next quarter but how much value they're creating over the long haul we ought to recognize that unless we make free enterprise or capitalism whatever you want to call it work for all people people's faith in the system is going to continue to dissipate so we need a new economic model we need a model that recognizes people are going to move from jobs the job that they still need security we need to do more than pay lip service to our investment in human beings and have a tax code and an accounting system where companies have to report how much money they spend on human beings and we need a business environment that says you have an obligation not only to your shareholders but to your stakeholders your employees the community living unless we can make a system where everybody gets that opportunity to earn a good life then this country which we have all been blessed to live in is not going to reach its potential now close with this I know and it's why I so appreciate what Reverend Al does year in and year out I know and I know this is a different kind of crowd here because you are activists but for many Americans they turn on the TV and the news comes on particularly if it's a with reverence good friend Donald Trump comes up I know that most people's normal reaction is you want to throw a shoe at the TV I feel the same way and I'm inside the TV yeah but we cannot lose faith we cannot lose heart it's commonly mentioned Tuesday night we did great in Virginia I was really sad though to see some of my good friends in the Senate lose their positions but we have to stay engaged if America voted if young people voted in their numbers if people of color voted in their numbers up here where I work would look a heck of a lot different so Reverend I'll I thank you for what you do continue to do thank you for helping me way back when I was just a young startup with Doug Wilder but we all got to stay in this fight because we do live in a great country but that greatness doesn't need to be made again it is who and what we are but that greatness can only be maintained if we have a system that gives every American that fair shot that opportunity to learn so thank you all very much [Applause]

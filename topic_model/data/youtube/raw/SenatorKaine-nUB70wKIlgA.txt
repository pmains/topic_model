I hope President Trump will follow the American Constitution it's very very clear Congress has the power to declare war and only Congress so if you're initiating war against a sovereign nation like Syria that hadn't declared war in the United States it's only Congress that can do it president Trump is not a king he's a president he's supposed to come to Congress to seek permission to initiate a war as ambassador Haley said they'd been following these chemical weapons attacks for months they clearly had time to come to Congress to seek our permission and and and this is really important Margaret it's not just about the Constitution it's about the value underlying the Constitution the framers basically said if we're going to order our troops to risk their lives put them in a situation where they can kill others be killed or wounded themselves then there has to be a debate and a vote by Congress to say this is in the national interest the president flouting this and saying I can do it without Congress what's to stop him from starting a bombing campaign against Iran or North Korea or some other nation and saying well I think it's in the national interest it's illegal because he didn't come and ask permission moreover it's reckless because as you pointed out there isn't a strategy we need to defeat Isis but we heard different things from the administration are we staying there now to topple Assad to counter Iran to check Russia to help the Kurds to buttress Israel to rebuild our relationships with Turkey they haven't laid out a strategy and military actions shouldn't be taken as a one-off it should be taken as part of a strategy

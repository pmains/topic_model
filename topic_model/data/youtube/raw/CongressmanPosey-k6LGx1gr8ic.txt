if you're here today and you're under 21 years overdue please raise your hand it is inspiring this is a large group of young people we've ever met this girl gets us through here all the time but this is a large group of young people we've ever had to show up to honor our heroes thank you all so very much again for doing that I don't know fathers still tell you our progress for our generation but they said nothing ever good happens if you're out on the road after midnight well my father was a line that was before on the play you know please do have it if you're out on the road for honor fighting ever midnight and thank you all for your attendance I usually talk about what my colleagues and what am i early mentors just when I got to Congress his name's Sam Johnson he represented a third District of Texas Ranger man if you've ever heard of Sam Johnson I know a lot of people here have before because they talked about him a lot Sam Johnson was a pilot US Air Force now he's you know good bit taller than I am they walked very stiff legged those from shackles almost eight years of confinement most solitary confinement North Vietnam he was sent over both shoulders broken by the rifle bus when it was being tortured he was shot down over Saigon this is one of our longest held prisoners of war and he wrote a book that talks about his catch as capital borders and I challenge people to breathe Captain Morgan because no matter what you've been through in life or how big or bad or tough that you think you are or what you've ever seen you won't read sam books Sam book you will weep your way through his books it's just hard to imagine that anyone could be treated as cruelly and humanely as he was for as long as he was and the reason I mentioned that and I would like to have every student in the United States a fare for possible region book is so that they would have some understanding of the risk that every man and every woman who ever done the uniform of the American armed services laid on the line for the freedom that all of us the including they of course too often take for granted today so on behalf of a grateful nation and a great for Congress I want to thank once again all our heroes here that are on this Honor Flight to be honored on this on our plan and wish you a safe and enjoyable day god bless you

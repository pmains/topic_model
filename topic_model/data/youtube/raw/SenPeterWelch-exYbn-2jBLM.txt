  FROM VERMONT, CONGRESS MEMBER  WELCH. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM VERMONT IS  RECOGNIZED FOR TWO MINUTES.  MR. WELCH: I THANK THE   GENTLELADY, MY COLLEAGUE FROM  TEXAS. MR. SPEAKER, IT'S WITH SOME  SADNESS THAT I HAVE TO SAY I   BELIEVE THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY  TERRIBLE TAX BILL. THE ECONOMY IS GROWING, AND  IT'S BEEN A CLAIM MADE BY THE  PROPONENTS OF THIS TAX POLICY. BUT IT'S GROWING FOR THE FEW.  IT'S NOT GROWING FOR THE MANY. WE HAVE THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT  RATE WE HAVE HAD IN YEARS. WE HAVE HAD THE HIGHEST PROFITS  IN CORPORATIONS THAT WE HAVE   HAD SINCE BEFORE THE GREAT   DEPRESSION.  YET RIGHT NOW IN THIS COUNTRY  CHILDHOOD POVERTY IS INCREASING  RELENTLESSLY, RELENTLESSLY.  HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN WHEN WE   HAVE SUCH A GREAT SO-CALLED  ECONOMY? IT HAPPENS BECAUSE WE HAVE   CREATED THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM   THAT IS TRANSFERRING MONEY FROM  LOW-INCOME AND MIDDLE CLASS TO   THE VERY WEALTHY.  THAT'S WHAT THIS CONGRESS HAS  DONE.  AND THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO  THE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOW IN  POVERTY AND WILL BE IN POVERTY.  BUT ALSO TO THOSE EVERYDAY   FAMILIES WHO AREN'T ON THE   RIGHT SIDE OF THE DIGITAL  DIVIDE AND WHOSE WAGES FOR THE   PAST 20 YEARS HAVE BEEN  STAGNANT OR DECLINING. EVEN AS THE THINGS THEY NEED,  COLLEGE EDUCATION FOR THEIR  KIDS, PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION  FOR THEIR FAMILIES, THOSE  PRICES ARE EXPLODING.  BY THE WAY, PHRMA GETS A HUGE  GIVEAWAY.  THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST PROFITS  THEY HAVE EVER HAD, AND WE'RE  PASSING A TAX BILL THAT GIVES  THEM MORE. WE'RE SHOVELING MONEY TO THEM  WHERE THEY ARE STICKING PRICE  INCREASES TO IT ALL OF US. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN BY   ACCIDENT.  THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE  SO-CALLED ENTREPRENEURIAL  ECONOMY. THIS HAS TO DO WITH A CONGRESS   THAT HAS NO CONSCIENCE.  THAT DOESN'T STAND UP FOR  EVERYDAY PEOPLE AND SAY WE WANT  POLICIES THAT WILL LET YOU HAVE  A CHANCE.  MR. SPEAKER, DEFEAT THIS BILL. I YIELD BAC

hello I'm Congressman Jim Clyburn I proudly represent South Carolina's sixth congressional district I'm also proud to serve as chair of the House Democratic faith working group and it's in that capacity that I'm here with three other members of our faith working group we're here today to provide our faith-based response to the House Republicans proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act retire Republican colleagues derisively call Obamacare joining us today is representative Lucille roybal-allard from California we will talk about the devastating effect this Republican proposal will have on the elderly we'll also hear from representative Keith Ellison from Minnesota of the adverse impact the Republican proposal will have on low income Americans and working men and women and then we will hear from representative Bonnie Watson coleman of new jersey she will discuss the massive tax breaks the republicans proposal will give to the wealthiest for you in our nation i want to thank all three of them for joining us I'm now pleased to yield to congresswoman Lucille roybal-allard my classmate hello I'm congresswoman Lucille roybal-allard and I represent the 40th congressional district of California Leviticus tells us to stand up in the presence of the elderly and show respect for the Aged the Republican American Health Care Act or Trump care does not honor or show respect for America's seniors instead it puts at risk the health care of millions of older Americans Trump Care allows insurance companies to charge older Americans much more for their health care while providing less today about 6.1 million Americans age 50 to 64 purchase individual insurance policies to pay for their health care and more than half of them are eligible for subsidies under obama care according to AARP insurance premiums under the Republican health plan will increase by as much as $3,600 for a 55 year old and 7,000 for a 64 year old all of this at the same time Trump care reduces the amount of subsidies older Americans need to help pay for their insurance policy for our seniors aged 65 and older Trump care shortens by at least four years the life of the Medicare trust fund why to give a tax break to the wealthiest of Americans also instead of protecting the provisions in Obamacare that strengthen Medicare this irresponsible Republican bill weakens Medicare and its long-term ability to pay for senior health care services if all this is not frightening enough Trump care also dismantles Medicaid as we know it for the six point nine million seniors who rely on community and home based care Medicaid is a lifeline for our low-income seniors and those with disabilities who depend on Medicaid home programs for assistance with eating bathing dressing or help in pain for skilled nursing home care Medicaid also helps to pay for disability accommodations in seniors homes and other necessities such as hearing aids and eyeglasses Trump care and dangers all these critical Medicaid benefits for our most frail and vulnerable elderly Americans by shifting costs to states and families struggling to make ends meet as a Catholic and a Christian I find those provisions in the American Health Care Act morally objectionable honoring our seniors and older Americans demands that we ensure they have health care that is accessible affordable and high-quality so they can live out their lives with respect and dignity as Pope Francis said it is this capacity for service to the life and dignity of the sick even when they are old that is the measure of the true progress of Medicine Trump care does not meet this moral standard thank you very much representative Ellison hello this is Keith Ellison from Minnesota's fifth congressional district the Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him his father died before he was even born and his mother died before he was six he was raised by a foster mother who was so poor that she struggled to feed him as he grew up he had a revelation that his purpose was to stand up for people who were facing injustice and oppression women children the enslaved and the poor taking care of our most vulnerable citizens is a cornerstone of the Islamic faith and since the Affordable Care Act was passed and signed into law by President Obama we've done just that as we've seen a huge drop in the uninsured rate that means we have almost 20 million people with the peace of mind that if they get hurt or sick they won't go bankrupt also insurance companies cannot drop you if you get sick they cannot deny you care if you have a pre-existing condition and there are annual and lifetime limits to what you can spend on care if President Trump and Republicans get their way twenty four million people will lose their health insurance and the people who will lose their health insurance are those who can't afford to get sick low income people working Americans seniors people who need our help this bill will harm millions of working Americans in order to pay for tax cuts for the rich we cannot allow that to happen we cannot go back to the way things were as prophet muhammad's said someone who strives on behalf of widows and the poor is like someone who fights in the way of God now is the time for Muslims Christians Jews and people of all faiths and people who may not practice any faith all over this country need to let their voices be heard in opposition to this Republican bill we can do it in faith if we stand up now thank you very much Keith and now Bonnie hello my name is Bonnie Watson Coleman and I represent the 12th district in New Jersey Thank You leader Clyburn for providing this forum to discuss such an important topic and thank you to my colleagues and the working group for your work here and each day here in Congress as a Christian my faith in God and my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is the greatest inspiration from my work in Congress my faith is the anchor of my commitments to protect the vulnerable and those with the greatest need my faith illuminates my path my work here in Washington is largely guided by the lessons of Matthew 25:40 where the Lord says truly I tell you whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine you did for me unfortunately the health care proposal put forth by President Trump and House Republicans is contrary to this principle and falls woefully short of our sworn duty as members of Congress our work is dictated by the best interests of the constituents we represent we are to advocate for and protect them at every turn this proposal serves as a threat to the well-being of America's backbone our working families and serves to only protect the nation's wealthiest one of the most disheartening examples of this problem is the manner that the Republican health care plan targets its strongest benefits to the wealthiest Americans this is in direct contrast to the biblical principles from Luke 12 from everyone who has been given much much will be demanded and from the one who has been entrusted with much much more will be asked the facts are clear the nonpartisan Joint Committee on taxation has concluded that two of the biggest tax cuts in this bill would provide a hundred and forty four billion dollars in breaks over the next decade to millionaires and billionaires this proposal would provide the 400 wealthiest families a tax break of seven million dollars per year I believe it is our duty as a Congress to ask more of those who have been given and entrusted was much more people like myself to my colleagues people like millionaires and billionaires who will have health care whether or not this bill passes what's even more alarming to individuals of faith is that these cuts are made at the expense of those who need our protection and our advocacy the most the poor working people the very ill older people people of color rural communities and the list goes on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this bill will result in 14 million Americans losing health insurance just next year and 24 million losing coverage by 2026 and an increase of premiums by 20 percent the United States of America is the wealthiest nation on the planet but there is no reason why the least of these the very people that the Affordable Care Act was designed to help should be endangered simply to fulfill campaign trail promises if my Republican colleagues many of whom say they are rooted in faith just as we are are truly interested in helping the American people I would also point them to the second chapter of James which puts it best suppose they're brothers or sisters who need clothes and don't have enough to eat what good is their and you're saying to them god bless you and keep warm and eat well if you don't give them the necessities of life and I'd point them to the third chapter of first John if anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them how the love of God be in that person let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth health care is a fundamental necessity of life and one that I will fight as hard as I can to preserve with truth in action not just rhetoric thank you very much and thanks to all three of you for joining us here today I want to once again thank you for viewing us today and listening to our response to this very critical piece of legislation each of us approach our duties and responsibilities from our own faith traditions yet we are united in our common values to do justice love mercy and walk humbly together we use these shared values to inform and guide us in our efforts to address the most pressing issues our country faces thanks to all of you for giving us a few minutes to hear our message you

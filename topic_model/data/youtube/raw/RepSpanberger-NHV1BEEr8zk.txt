[Music] i'm michelle and i co-own the trucking company with my husband as small business owners we were faced with the challenge of keeping our small business aglow and growing all in the midst of a pandemic after going back and forth with the sba close to two years i was able to have a meeting with congresswoman spamberger i was able to share with her the difficulties that my small business was experiencing her office contacted the sba on my behalf from that meeting we were able to grow our fleet and hire employees i would strongly encourage and suggest any small business that's experiencing difficulties to reach out to your local congressional office it made the difference from my small business being stagnant to expanding and i'm grateful for the assistance they provided

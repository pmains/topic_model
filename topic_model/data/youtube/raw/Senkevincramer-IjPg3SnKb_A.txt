senator kevin kramer joins me good evening senator and you have made a referral of this to syphias this transaction but tell me what are the standards i mean how does the committee how does it weigh whether it's national security or not i mean how do they decide this well this is thank you greta first of all for for this opportunity this is exactly why the request went not only to janet yellen the secretary of treasury which oversees cyphus but a key member of the committee and that is secretary austin secretary of defense um and the standard really it's sort of a case-by-case basis but you have this august group which sarah did a fantastic job by the way in her territorial um you see why they would all have have a role in this the reasons it's important to grand forks or at least important to those of us who care about national security is because this particular investment the fufang investment is 370 acres that will become a corn milling plant within 12 miles of the grand forks air force base which is a very important isr base that flies the global hawks today we'll be finding a new new mission in the future and of course we just caught a ribbon a couple weeks ago on a space development agency a ground control uh system for uh tranche of satellites so needless to say there's a lot of sensitive data that goes up and down from grand forks and uh and could be subject to easily easily be uh interfered with or stolen so does syphia's have teeth i mean they say that you know i mean there's a quite an interesting group of people who are who oversee it but from administration administration since they're no sort of set rules it's sort of like what each administration sort of thinks but does it have teeth and it makes a decision and recommends it to the president and the president says yes or no so it does have teeth if it should go all the way to the president so the first review process is actually just that a review they have to do it within 45 days and uh and you can actually expedite that even once a review is done and the review you know reveals certain things certain threats perhaps or a risk assessment of some sort it can then go to another 45-day investigation if that investigation demonstrates that the mitigation of risks would either be difficult costly impossible the president can then review it for his own 15 days and then the president can determine whether or not the uh as sarah said whether or not the investment should be allowed to go forward in this case and forks i think the first review is all that will be necessary quite honestly because local officials could take it from there all right let's say that some sketchy person wants to buy some land in your state really sketchy and gets rejected by civilians i mean do you have the budget to make sure the person doesn't just go you know go back home and trade it up trade it to someone else and have somebody else come in i mean imagine it needs to have some sort of budget because you could you could probably game this a little bit well perhaps but um remembering that it's against foreign investment that we're concerned about that cyphus is concerned about and um the in this particular case again the foo fang case the local community leadership and the state has done a really good job of putting in guard rails including claw backs so let's say for example the investments made it has been made the land has been purchased um but if anything sketchy should show up the state has and the community have reserved the right to end the deal and they would then of course take ownership of the property so to their credit they've done a really good job of protecting the investment to make sure it doesn't leave the country or get compromised all right we'll see what happens with this investment and all future ones senator kevin kramer thank you sir thank you

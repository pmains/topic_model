our colleagues I stand before you today as a Vietnam veteran five years of naval service during a hot war in Southeast Asia trying to make sure that the communism the flow the force of communism was stopped I started another 18 years beyond that right to the end of the Cold War as a naval flight officer retired Navy captain I am NOT a socialist I'm somebody who cares deeply about this planet I'm someone who believes it's possible to have clean air and clean water and better public health and foster economic growth as it turns out there a lot of companies in this country probably the same thing who believe the same thing clot up and build cars trucks and vans they want a 50-state deal on fuel efficiency standards cafe standards tailpipes and they want a 50-state deal so they don't have to build a car for you know 13 or 14 different states and in a different kind of car truck for the rest of the country they don't want to do that they want certainty predictability so you build one model for one car they want to be able to be successful in competing in a world marketplace in the next 10 20 30 years we need we need someone leading the Environmental Protection Agency who believes that it's possible to have cleaner air and frankly fostering economic growth in the auto companies that's what the auto companies want they're not socialists they're free marketers and there are something called agencies I just talked about something called HSCs hydrofluorocarbons terrible are polluting for the year for the environment 1,000 times worse than carbon for our global warming challenges there's a bunch of American businesses have new technology to a place HFCS they want to be able to not just develop they've developed it they want to be able to sell it all over the world the market places a trillion dollars and we're holding back and unfortunately the person who's going to be voted on here today to be our EPA Administrator he's part of holding us back because he won't agree to a treaty that the administration wants to put forward and it's crazy those companies have developed to follow on products to HFCS Honeywell chemours and others they're not socialists they're business people they want a piece in the international market and you want to do good things to climb it at the same change same time I just want to say to my colleagues we can do both we can have clean air rent up clean water we have a strong economic growth we need somebody running the EPA who actually believes in that too and I'm sorry to say here today I don't believe right now but it's Andrew wheeler and I say that with no joy thank you very much

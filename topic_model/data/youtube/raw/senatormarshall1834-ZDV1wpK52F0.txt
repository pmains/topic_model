joining me now kansas senator and small business committee member roger marshall senator great to see you this morning this is just a joke it's a grift from the progressives they want to keep their wish list in there but just cut the short term price tag we all know that they will never be able to get rid of this vast entitlement expansion if any of it gets through yeah you're right deagon good morning to you yeah at the end of the day this will be a 7.5 trillion dollars of government spending over the next 10 years the fight in washington dc right now is this do we want big government socialism or do we want economic freedom that's what really this fight is all about once they start these programs they'll never end there's going to be all sorts of budget gymnastics going on but at the end of the day this is about economic freedom versus big government socialism inflation is hurting every american who has to live their lives on a budget it is making america poor so is this the death of this spending spree that the left has been talking about and it's not just the progressives 48 out of the 50 democratic senators are in favor of this in favor of this socialist expansion i call it new century welfare monstrosity but 48 of them that's 96 percent of the democrats in the senate are in favor of it so it's not just a sliver or a soup son of the democratic party that wants this if you're looking at the senate it's almost the whole of the party yeah david if my town halls are any indication of where america is america does not want this spending uh people are not only mad they're now panicked about inflation and this big spending and more borrowing is only going to is only going to add to inflation and what president biden is doing his policies to to make the labor shortage worse is only going to drive this inflation up more but you're absolutely right everybody is now filling the sting at the gas pump at the grocery store inflation is absolutely a top issue on the hearts and minds of americans across the nation brian bremberg jump in yeah senator so the democrats bought some time on the debt ceiling they pushed it back to december so we're not going to have that crisis immediately i guess but i look at this and say well now they've got you know a month plus to spend time pulling their coalition together you've got two holdouts in the senate how concerned are you that those holdouts over the next month just say hey the price takes down a little bit i can do that it's only one and a half trillion let's go that seems to be the concern right now yeah i'm very concerned i'm very concerned that no one is talking about the tax portion of this bill right now so they're willing to to drive down the number and of course that's a facade that they can already address but what about the tax policy are we going to get rid of 1031 exchanges are we going to start taxing capital gains as an ordinary income are we going to start monitoring every transaction over 600 dollars so there's more to it than just the dollar amount this is the big government socialism theme that i'm concerned about as opposed to economic freedom and prosperity but i'm telling you there is a tidal wave coming out of out of an out of america out of those hard-working americans who don't like vaccine mandates and they don't like the policies of this federal government that are leading to inflation as well as open borders and increased crime all those issues that you all have been covering so very well speaking of the vaccine mandate senator the bite administration is taking that next step for businesses with 100 or more employees to have them vaccinated or face regular testing this comes as boeing announces it will require all of its u.s employees to get the shot by december 8th it's 125 000 workers you say biden's vaccination decree is an all-out salt on our civil liberties might be unconstitutional based on what i've read but would say you well certainly i do think a federal vaccine mandate is unconstitutional and that's going to be tied up in the courts but this white house owns this labor shortage and this this creed coming down from the white house is only going to make the labor shortage worse creating national security issues in many instances as well this white house and the cdc need to first of all acknowledge natural immunity there are many many studies out there that say that natural immunity is better than vaccines alone so we need to be talking about the immune versus non-immune not the vaccinated versus the non-vaccinated that would solve half of the the labor issue problem right now this is another crisis created by joe biden and his administration and i just want to look at the numbers real quick before you go on the percentage of americans who have gotten vaccine i think at least of adults in america it's at least three quarters have gotten at least one shot so why do you need a mandate to get like a minority of americans vaccinated that's the issue it just again it's government overreach con you know fear equals control control equals power and that's why a lot of these people get into this no no offense grift in the first place yeah yeah digging in remember so let's use your number and say three-fourths of adults are vaccinated of those people that are not vaccinated half of them have natural immunity so that leaves us with a very small amount we should be right there at the precipice of herd immunity right now we need the cdc to acknowledge herd immunity and that we've got this natural immunity 78 of adult americans 18 or over 78 percent have gotten at least one shot that's your fact senator roger marshall great to see you this morning sir thank you so much thank you dagon coming up the rise

florida reserves the john from utah is recognized thank you madam speaker if anyone can be considered an expert on water issues in in the united states it is the chairman of the subcommittee on interior appropriations as well as a former member of the resource committee i'm proudly to yield two minutes to the gentleman from california mr calvert thank you california is recognized uh madam speaker there's a clear sense in my district and i believe around the country that the constant expansion of the federal government and its bureaucratic red tape is holding back our economy one of the worst defenders of government is the overreach of the epa the proposed rule they jointly released with the army corps attempts to regulate waters that were never intended to be covered under the clean water act and would grant them authority over streams on land even when the water beds have been dry in some cases for hundreds of years this is a serious threat to both private property rights and our economy as a chairman of the interior appropriations subcommittee i've worked along with our subcommittee members to try to rein in epa's regulatory overreach the fiscal year 2015 bill prohibits the epa from changing the definition of navigable waters it is absolutely critical that we uphold the federal state partnership and prevent the administration from finalizing rule that results in the biggest land grab in the history of our country so we need to support this rule to bring this important legislation to the floor and i certainly hope that all the members will support it with that i thank the gentleman for the time and i yield back

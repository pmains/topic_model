I want to bring it out Congressman Jim Heinz Heinz i should say pardon me he's a Democrat from Connecticut and he's also a member of the House Intelligence Committee a key post their congressman thanks so much for being with us and I want to talk to you first about what we just heard thank you we just heard Barbara Starr talk about which is the Pentagon now saying that there is an Iraqi and Kurdish military force of 20 to 25,000 this is being prepared to retake Mosul in perhaps April perhaps may why is the Pentagon talking about a military action before it's happened and I'm asking you that because some critics are suggesting that this isn't necessarily about psyops this may be about politics what do you say well I certainly think it's a roll of the dice look obviously signaling your intentions to the enemy is an orthodox way of approaching this but remember one of the battles that is being fought right now metaphorical battles anyway is the battle for recruits and you know the more that disaffected young men largely young men around the world or even in places like Turkey think that there's a high probability that if they go to Mosul or if they go to northern Syria that they are likely to wind up dead that's not going to dissuade all of them but it's going to dissuade some of them but it is a real gamble here you know look we've got some experience with this and we know two things one the Iraqi army has not exactly distinguished itself in the last year with them soon I was a fighting force and remember we did this once before you know fighting force in the in the world the United States Marine Corps had a rough time retaking the city of Fallujah in Iraq many years ago from a similar band of terrorists and of course there's nothing uglier and more difficult than door-to-door urban fighting so this is a bit of a gamble that the Pentagon is taking okay so you say it's a bit of a gamble do you think that certainly I think our expectation is with some of these recruits is that they are inspired to die for a cause so isn't there also an argument to be made that telegraphing or saying outright that this force is going in to retake Mosul that it might actually inspire some young people to join up and fight with Isis look there's no doubt that some of the people that are part of Isis some of the people that are recruited are so out there so on the fringe that they might actually move towards their own deaths or towards a suicide mission we see that but I don't think that's the majority of people and obviously if you can take some people and keep them away that's a that's a good outcome but look at the end of the day you know most of these people are making a rational calculation even if some of these people are really truly seeking martyrdom or whatever it is that they seek the president has laid out a plan congressman to win her attempt to win the hearts and minds and to deter people from joining up with Isis but you said that you fear there will be little discussion of a long-term strategy to stop terrorism at its source what you heard yesterday from the White House does it do what you think needs to be done well it's a very small part of it and yes I have said over and over again that we spend in the United States Congress so much time talking about exactly how we're calibrated militarily and you know through the use of our intelligence community to go after this to these terrorists and in fact we're pretty good at that through the various means that we have of taking out their leadership but very rarely does the Congress the United States sit back and say wait a second what are the larger structural reasons that a the terrorism and that violence is flourishing in the Middle East why our state's failing you know why did Libya come apart at the seams and is now a failed state where Isis is showing up you know why is it that the entire northern half of Iraq decided to go with a bunch of murderous terrorists instead of actually you know working with their own national army you know what motivates a young man in Cairo to decide that instead of you know living a middle-class small business lifestyle they're going to go sign up with ISIL those are those are deep and profound questions and if we don't get to them and by the way this has to do with you know it has to do with failed States and people feeling like they don't have either economic or political opportunity it has to do with you know Imams a small number of them preying on young men and vulnerable young men but if we don't address those issues 30 40 years from now we will still be talking about is it drone strikes is it boot on the ground and so I think the president's discussion in the last three days is important but it's a very very small part of the bigger picture real quick before I let you go congressman fascinating personality profile coming out from the US intelligence community of the head of Isis Abu Bakr al-baghdadi suggesting he's headstrong he's a religious zealot and he has an apocalyptic vision what did the profile tell you about Isis's motives well you know there's no question and there's there's a real discussion happening right now in the in the media and amongst academics about exactly who these people are and quite candidly you know right out of the box i think at the very highest levels including the president we didn't have a particularly good finger on the pulse of what this organization was you know the president's unfortunate comments about this sort of being the JV team to al-qaeda you know that obviously turned out not to be the case and so understanding who these people are and and though I think we're spending too much time on this you know how do they relate to Islam is an important conversation because yes the leadership are these apocalyptic you know in saenz the wrong word but people who think that they're bringing about end of times and we need to understand how we can make them look wrong in that religious interpretation look let's push them back let's show them let's show the world in the Islamic world that we can collectively beat these guys that they are in fact a band of ideologically motivated criminals and the recruiting will begin to be a lot less successful than it has been and that is the struggle we're seeing now from Washington

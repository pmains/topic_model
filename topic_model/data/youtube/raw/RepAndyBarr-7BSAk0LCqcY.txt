welcome back to gma-3 and carol barr the wife of kentucky congressman andy barr passed away just last year from sudden cardiac arrest she was only 39 years old and now congressman barr has introduced legislation honoring his late wife as well as raising awareness for heart disease called the cardiovascular advances in research and opportunities legacy act or the carroll act and representative barr joins us now congressman barr thank you so much for being here with us want to offer our condolences your wife suddenly as we just mentioned passed away at such a young age just eight months ago you also have two young daughters so i want to first ask how you're doing how you've been holding up these past several months well amy and tj thanks for having me on and and we're doing okay we miss carol dearly she was the best wife mother friend anyone could ever have and she leaves an amazing legacy a legacy of impact and a life of consequence even though it was a life cut too short and our two girls eleanor age nine and mary clay age seven they are her greatest legacy well i am sure it was rewarding in some ways cathartic but also difficult to be sitting there and writing a bill to honor your late wife but the bill itself the carol act we're talking about here how do you hope it will help folks who had kind of the heart condition that she had which is again we should say somewhat common but still what is it you want the bill to be able to do well carol was diagnosed with a heart valve disease when she was in seventh grade called mitral valve prolapse and for most americans this is a very benign problem or condition that has to be monitored we were always told it's no big deal you just have to monitor it only 0.2 percent of americans who have this suffer a sudden cardiac death and unfortunately that happened to my wife carol she was only 39 it predominantly affects younger women we don't know why but we want with this legislation to fight back against heart valve disease we introduced the bill on heart valve disease awareness day in american heart month february and it just goes to show because many americans don't know that this condition can be life-threatening we know we need to raise awareness and we know how important medical research is to identify those individuals with high risk factors that actually would put them uh in harm's way and potentially give them a life-threatening condition congressman um eleanor mary claire your two uh your two daughters there what what's their reaction their response what are they saying to you about um this effort having to do with their mom just what do they think about what you're doing and and to see their mom's name on a piece of legislation and see daddy trying to get it through congress well they knew that their mom had a big heart and the doctors told us that her heart just gave out but in many ways i think my daughters know that she gave a whole lifetime of her heart in just 39 years to them to me to our family to our community i think they're going to be very very proud of their mommy because of what she's going to accomplish and what her legacy will mean to so many other families we're going to save lives and and my girls love their mommy forever but they're going to be very very proud of of what she will contribute to to to many other families i'm sure proud of her and of course proud of you and your efforts to do the very same well yeah while we have you here congressman i do want to ask you uh i understand you're planning to vote no to president biden's 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus package i'm curious why the no vote and what you would do what would your plan be to help the millions of people out there who are suffering financially during this pandemic well i think what what i would do is make sure that we spent the money that we've already passed in a bipartisan way over trillion dollars trillion dollars remains unspent from the cares act and the subsequent pieces of legislation including a 900 billion dollar relief bill that was just passed at the end of december and what is especially disappointing is how much in this bill the 1.9 trillion dollar bill that's going to be voted on later this week how much is unrelated to the covid pandemic and the economic crisis related to it a lot of it is is just a pork barrel spending that has absolutely nothing to do with the pandemic and i think what's most disappointing to most americans is that we've already appropriated 68 billion dollars to get kids back into the classroom i don't think we're following the science when we keep these schools locked down and we have over 60 billion dollars of already appropriated money that hasn't been spent to reopen our schools and what's so disappointing is that this bill 130 billion dollars allocated for schools k through 12 but 95 percent of it won't even be spent until after 2022 that's not going to get our kids back in the classroom we can do it safely we need to do it now we need to focus on deploying the resources that have already been appropriated all right congressman andy barr we really appreciate you coming on the show today we know you're a busy man so thank you for your time and for all of your efforts there in honor of your wife thank you so much i appreciate you all helping us raise the awareness

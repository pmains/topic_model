well thank you to my friend and colleague from florida because of its great weather beautiful beaches and low taxes a friend who once served as my congressman like to say that for many around the country florida is the reward for a life well lived as liberal states continue to run their governments into the ground and the pandemic has accelerated our ability to work remotely it's no longer just retirees who are moving to the sunshine state in droves in fact nearly 330 000 have relocated there in the past year alone with its strategic location along central florida's i-4 corridor florida's 15th congressional district is one of the fastest growing areas in the country our current transportation infrastructure is already inadequate and it's a problem that will only accelerate going forward unless we act now i'm sure many communities across the country can relate both sides of the aisle can agree that our nation's highways airports water infrastructure ports and broadband networks are the arteries of our national commerce and worthy investments of taxpayer money the good news is republicans are taking the lead to meet these infrastructure needs first we're proposing a major overhaul of our federal project review and permitting processes when i formally served on the board of the transportation planning organization in my home district we routinely had critical needs that waited years for funding some of those have still not been funded so speeding up that process is a critical first step we're also proposing a 450 billion dollar framework that will make crucial invest investments in our nation's transportation system water infrastructure and broadband networks this framework represents an investment in the real infrastructure americans need not bizarre reinterpretations of infrastructure or partisan pet projects congress has talked about infrastructure investment for years it's time to put words into actions i hope the president will continue to listen to voices on both sides of the aisle to enact a bipartisan solution to our country that it so desperately needs thank you and i yield back

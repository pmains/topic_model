thank you mr chairman i appreciate everything that the commission has done to help communities and emergency responders during wildfires out west it's disappointing that this majority hasn't worked with us on any of the solutions that can restore communication networks in areas that have been hit for instance my wildfire wireless resiliency act i'd also hope this committee would follow this commission's lead in setting effective spectrum policy this congress greater transparency for federal spectrum holdings is necessary for policyholders to make informed decisions so scarce spectrum resources are used in the best way possible earlier this week i introduced the government spectrum evaluation act with congresswoman clark to assess the commercial value of federal spectrum while i had hoped to focus my questioning on this bipartisan effort the majority today has made clear that they are dead set on continuing their pursuit for a government takeover of the internet chairman pai since the beginning of your tenure as fcc chair the majority has warned of an internet apocalypse if obama's fcc 2015 title ii regulatory order was reversed they've said investment in speeds would decrease and access would suffer clearly this hysteria is not based in fact had these concerns come to fruition our networks would have collapsed under the huge increase in demand during this pandemic in reality our networks have held up and even thrived during this unprecedented increase in demand meanwhile networks in europe where they've embraced the socialist internet policies the democrats champion here in congress have buckled under the added pressure chairman pai do you believe that you're restoring internet freedom order is part why the u.s networks were able to handle the increased network traffic thank you for the question congresswoman there's no question with increased usage of 35 up to 35 percent of fixed networks up to 20 on mobile networks a lot of people were wondering would our networks be able to stand up and they have and part of the reason is because of the regulatory reforms that we took against vociferous opposition before anyone heard of corona coronavirus the most notable being the restoring internet freedom order i'm proud of the decision we took to get rid of those arcane utility style regulations and the results speak for themselves speeds are up over twice or twice as what they were when we made the decision set records for fiber deployment in 2018 and 2019 millions more americans getting access to the internet than ever before the price index if you look at it has gone down in terms of the affordability of prices an independent study of urban rate survey data has shown that and so yeah notwithstanding all the hot air the absurd predictions we saw from politicians and lobbyists and the rest the proof is in the pudding the american consumer online today is better off because of our decision than they were prior to 2017. thank you chairman i i'd like to close by addressing the renewed efforts to establish a national nationalized 5g network the idea a government-run network would be preferable to the networks within a free market is ill-advised likewise the continued desire to impose utility-style regulations on the internet will impair our ability to deploy 5g and will only empower the chinese communist party to beat us in this race for 5g i've heard a lot of talk today from the majority about their desire for the u.s to lead in 5g i hope we can put this talk into action by dropping the misguided push that will kill our ability to deploy next-gen networks free enterprise is central to america it's produced the best telecommunications networks in the world period we have won the race to 5g we've unleashed a decade of innovation and and the app economy and we will do the same with 5g by championing free markets and american ingenuity we cannot beat the chinese at their own game of central planning and government control neither should we try with that i yield back

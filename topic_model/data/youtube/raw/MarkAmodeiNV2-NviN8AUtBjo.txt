details the Department of Energy sat down with Congress and Mark Amma day last week to discuss the plutonium shipped here from the Savannah River Site in South Carolina and I said that South Carolina gave the do-e a decision either pay 1 million every day for a hundred days or get the plutonium out that nuclear material can only be housed three other places Los Alamos in New Mexico the pantech site in Texas or Nevada our state officials filed an injunction to stop that shipment and On January 30th Judge Miranda do denied Nevada's request we're taking you to court and we're gonna make our case and you ain't bringing it here but if judge do would have done that they couldn't have brought it here but she did and I emphasize that this plutonium is not nuclear waste to be disposed of in fact this plutonium is still has plenty of use ahead and right now there is no timeline as to how long that plutonium will be in Nevada in the studio

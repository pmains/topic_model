thousand civilians police and military personnel have been killed in the conflict during the same period our first guest tonight is the republican congressman scott franklin he's a u.s navy veteran from florida who sits on the armed services committee and is briefed on intelligence and special operations congressman thank you for being with us does joe biden get some credit for the decision that he's taken we have known really since about 2010 that this war was unwinnable and yet two presidents ducked the decision well first christian thanks for having me this evening um we knew that there was going to be an exit at some point from afghanistan but how we've gone about this has just been completely disastrous and really the manner is all on joe biden's hands this is not how it had to be well let's just explore that for a second when president trump decided that he was going to withdraw draw the troops in january he reduced the u.s presence to just 2 500 troops that was the lowest number of troops since 9 11. the un assistance mission in afghanistan unama reported 5180 civilian deaths and injuries in the first half of 2021 that is significantly higher than the total that were killed or injured during the same period in previous years so he's right isn't he that actually it was untenable to stay the only way you could have stayed in the country was to surge the troops once again well i don't think that's accurate i think over time we were transitioning more of the responsibility for the day-to-day fighting to the afghan army we were there in a support role which we were providing and uh you know importantly for americans we had not lost any american service members in nearly a year and a half and as far as president trump uh negotiating with the taliban previously it was all very uh conditions driven everything that we've seen would not have happened in my view had president trump still been in office because the triple wires were put in place to ensure this kind of debacle didn't happen they were there but president biden chose to ignore those and make this a unilateral withdrawal well again i want to explore that because olivia troye who served for the vice president in the former administration she was a former homeland security and counterterrorism advisor she tweeted on friday donald trump had four years putting this plan in place to evacuate our afghan allies who were the lifelines for many of us who spent time in afghanistan they've been waiting a long time there were cabinet meetings she said during the trump administration where stephen miller would peddle his racist hysteria and undermine anyone who worked on solving the siv issue by devastating the system so there was not a system in place over the last four years even though the administration knew it was withdrawing the troops to get the afghan allies out well all i can tell you is less than two weeks ago president biden stood at the podium and said that we would not leave afghanistan without bringing home every american and every one of our allies that had committed and stood by our side and shed blood on our behalf that was a commitment from him now i want to know what his plan is now that we have no military presence in the country what is your plan mr president to make good on your word well what should it be because obviously the united states has leverage you sit on the armed services committee there will be a discussion i presume within the committees about the enormous reserves that the americans are holding is that leverage enough to ensure that they can get everybody out could you supply a list to the taliban and take them off one by one we've given up virtually all the leverage that we had but previously you know i don't the taliban doesn't need our money nearly as much as they need the control that we've handed to them in the country there can i talk to you about um some of the intelligence briefings i think you've even had today about the kit that has been left in the country obviously you have a great knowledge about this because you you were serving in in the u.s maybe you know about some of the kit that went in how much of it do you think is still viable i think a tremendous amount of it is you know if you we've seen some of the videos running around and obviously it's more than just blackhawk helicopters and and light attack aircraft it's it's um you know body armor night vision goggles gps equipment biometric equipment that oh by the way includes a lot of uh information on all the people that have served by our sides uh it's it's a devastating amount of information that we're gonna or equipment that we will be fighting against on the battlefield either there in afghanistan or will end up in other parts of the world and you know there's this notion that they don't need the aircraft now they can turn around and sell those to other countries iran in particular uh we will see this equipment again and that was another mistake you know once the intel was there that um that the taliban were going to take control of the country we should have had a plan to eliminate as much of that equipment as possible before we exited could you've done that because this was equipment that you left behind for the afghan military i watched a video the other day with the afghan military on the airfield in kandahar they had to hand over the humvees in in order to get out alive it was it was a deal for safe passage to get out of the airport there's not much joe biden could have done about that is there there was clear intel uh for a long time leading up that the the afghan national army was not going to be able to hold the taliban were going to take control obviously the the by administration had no idea it was going to fall as quickly as it did but they thought whether it's 30 days or 60 days or six months they knew that ultimately the taliban was going to be in control of the country so for them to say that you know we we gave this to the afghans we didn't hand it to the taliban that's just simply not accurate so here's what donald trump has said and it is relevant because he could be a candidate in 2024 he said all equipment should be demanded to be immediately returned to the united states and that includes every penny of the 85 billion dollars in cost if it's not handed back we should either go in with unequivocal military force and get it or at least bomb the hell out of it what do you make of that well that's that's easier said than done it's uh it'd be one thing to take aircraft out most of this equipment has been dispersed um i don't think there's gonna be much hope in getting a lot of that equipment back can i ask you about the over the horizon counter-terrorism operation which he's just outlined in his speech today he says this is the new way of of tackling threats like isis k i can think back to probably the second term of george w bush when the drones were hitting targets all across afghanistan and they were hitting on a number of occasions in fact quite a lot of the time civilians and it was the civilian toll which in a way gave rise to isis and the nihilism that they represent are you sure that you can fight a war like this from the air i'm quite sure we can't i'll tell you when when i was in bahrain shortly after 9 11 we were planning the initial strikes and at that time we had no uh secure air bases in country and those missions were coming from many many hours away we're launching off carrier decks in the northern arabian gulf flying nine hour missions having to refuel a couple of times off tankers it's it's darn near impossible to do that accurately and we need intel on the ground there that we've now unilaterally given up what intel have you seen about the strike on sunday which hit this family apparently killing 10 members of the family including a number of children i haven't personally received intel briefs on that my understanding what we think we we know this was not a high explosive weapon that we use but that the the actual explosion that killed the the civilians was due to secondaries of actually the target we were intending to take out which was a vehicle bomb but you've not seen the video of these secondary explosions as yet i personally have not known okay um just finally how should the united states deal with the taliban going forward i don't think we should recognize them as a legitimate government you know we currently have them declared as a terrorist group some would argue that even the deliberations that we've done with them so far might even violate that and you can we can argue as to who's responsible for that is not just biden it was uh you know president trump before even the obama administration dealt with the taliban but i'm really going for us to move forward as secretary of state lincoln suggests that we're going to start to cozy up with the taliban and negotiate them because those are the only tools apparently we have left i'm eager to see who's going to step forward step forward in front of congress and make the argument that we need to change our law to recognize them as no longer a terrorist organization because i don't think you're going to find many people that really believe that they're still the terrorists that they always have them but you're right i mean congress did sign off on the peace deal that pompeo struck with the taliban right yeah i just don't uh you know this this this leopard's not going to change in spots that they have been terrorists uh they're integrally connected with all the other organizations there and you know president biden can speak forcefully that the war has ended today but it hasn't ended today just deeming it so doesn't make it so just as we may have thought that we weren't at war on 9 11 but i can i can assure you on september 10th of 2001 we were at war with al qaeda they just hadn't informed us yet so we're still at war there congressman franklin really good of you to join us this evening thanks for being here thanks for being here

hi i'm don clavin the town of hebstet supervisor car safety is an important issue for children at the 13 it's the number one cause of death we can't let that happen and for years we've always had our car safety program but because of the pandemic it's on pause but we still need to be diligent that's why we've created this video for you to watch about the importance of car safety and the installation of car seats as a parent of three i know the importance of this and i ask you to watch the video pay attention and if you have any questions dial our public safety office at 516-538-1900 with any questions be safe hi i'm officer shepard with the department of public safety for the town of hempstead and today i will be showing you how to properly install a convertible car seat in the rear-facing position of your vehicle before you begin always refer to your car seats owner's manual as well as your vehicle's owner's manual for proper installation and information regarding the car seat all right so we are going to be installing this car seat rear facing into this vehicle by using the latch system with the built-in anchors in the vehicle so i'm going to start by finding my latch system and finding the clip taking it out just like so every vehicle 2002 and newer come standard with the anchor system for the the latch of the vehicle okay so we want to first loosen by pushing the bar in give ourselves some slack pull out on the other side the same thing i just did on the first one now i have both sides out we want to make sure that there is absolutely no twist in the belt whatsoever so no twisting like that make sure it is completely straight perfect i'm going to begin by finding and locating the anchor point for the latch i can see the symbol which has a little tag with a picture of a baby and i'm gonna feel for right under it and i can feel the anchor i'm going to put my latch system right into the anchor and you will hear a click know that it's in sometimes these could be a couple inches in there we got we got a click we're in and the exact same thing is just to repeat the process on the other side got my click we want to make sure that we are level with the ball right here so i'm going to rest this in the rear facing position and we are perfectly within where we want to be and we're going to tighten it this vehicle has a pretty flat uh bottom other vehicles have more of a could have more of a slope or an incline which would move the seat somewhat up like this in the event you do need to raise this side up a little bit more you may use a standard house towel just take the towel fold it up put it right under and then you can begin to install just like that then i'm going to put a little bit of weight using my hand in the center and pulling up the strap most car seats offer a little cut through i can't find it in the fabric but if you pull the fabric off to the side just like this it's much easier to pull the belt straight up and as you can see it's tightening much better and faster two people is preppable if you can have one on one side to hold it down one on the other side otherwise with just one person if you can really get into the vehicle either use your knee and pull some pressure or my preferable way but if you can do this is to get into the vehicle right behind make sure you're level take that one strap it's only on one side make sure there's nothing out of the way and we want to use our body weight to push this vehicle's car seat into the actual back of the seat we want to push it in and down so i'm going to do that and at the same time i'm pulling this up as i'm push twisting and turning i want to take a look make sure i'm where i'm supposed to be and that's perfect i can go a little tighter if i need to see just goes tight as you can and pull up and wiggle if you can't get behind the seat simply just put one knee into it and pull it and do the same thing the goal is to make sure when you feel by the belt path which is this side or this side right here that this seat does not move more than one inch in any direction i'm gonna pull this back out pull the padding back over to where it was we are now tight we're exactly where we need to be this seat is good for a child up to 40 pounds every child every seat excuse me every seat is different for the weight and height of uh of children so just be sure to look at the manual for your seat on that and right here always like i said give a feel we want to make sure this seat is not going to move more than an inch in any direction the same as the actual seat keep in mind that the back of the seat right here is going to move this is designed to do this this is this is completely designed to do this this is to absorb energy in a collision or an accident uh so that is why we put this seat back which i will demonstrate we want to make sure we leave enough room so we don't want to lock this back seat up against this or defeats the purpose of the design of the seat as long as you can get your entire hand through this pathway if it's behind both of the seats then this can still do its job and absorb energy in a collision or an accident keeping in mind this is not moving at all by moving this the vehicle is shaking that's how we want it it is also something to note that in the event of a collision whether it's a fender bender or not and if the child is in the seat or not uh your insurance company your auto insurance company um just put the claim in and they will replace the seat for you every car seat is good for one one collision whether this child is in the sea or not on this we actually have a recall card this comes with every new car seat it's important that this recoil card you either fill out and mail in or you can now do it online if there's ever a recall for anything on the seat the entire seat or even just the buckle then you will be notified by the manufacturer through email and they'll be able to give you instructions on how to go about doing that and that is how you properly install a rear-facing car seat with using a convertible car seat using the latch system in this vehicle you

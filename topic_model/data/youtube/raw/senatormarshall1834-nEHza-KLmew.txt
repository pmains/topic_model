mr. speaker this week we plan on boating on a very strong bill known as the border security and immigration reform act to better assess our immigration system and the security of our border I went to the United States Mexico border near o Tet near El Paso Texas this weekend I rise today to share some of the stories I heard from our Customs and Border Patrol officers and the compassion they ham for these families and children's they interact with these agents and officers have they had the highest on-the-job injury rate among all in law enforcement groups across the country additional ease officers see some of the worst conditions and are exposed to a wide ranging health risk like scabies lice tuberculosis chicken pox and many others day to day these officers are on the front lines protecting our nation's borders they are often stopped stopping drug trafficking human trafficking and much more they see the worst of the worst and put their lives on the line to secure our nation every day and in exchange for this they're often portrayed on the national media as cruel and are compared to unthinkable unimaginable groups from our world's history this is not the experience I had with them this weekend these officers have huge hearts and are often given a tough task at the border they told me story after story of how they bring personal items like teddy bears and toys from their homes to provide to children and often times running to McDonald's and other restaurants to get food for hungry kids who have very very long dangerous journey no one's in actuation our nation's border is terrible and our agents at the border see this tragedy daily seeing this for myself firsthand I quickly realize there's no perfect fix but it's imperative that we recognize and honor our Border Patrol agents hard work and do our part in Congress to pass compassionate comprehensive immigration reform that still secures our borders and helps alleviate the situation of crisis which now exists Mr Speaker I yield back

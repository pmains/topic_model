joining me now is Democratic senator Tammy Duckworth a wounded combat veteran who was among the first army women to fly combat missions during the Iraq war thank you very much become you know senator senator Duckworth I'm just kind of actually gobsmacked by what has happened we're just hearing from Peter Baker that John Bolton has texted him as well saying that he offered to resign and resigned today so that version is differing very much from the firing version that comes from the president where does this leave the troops having served in Iraq and knowing the troops in Afghanistan as a member of Armed Services how does this make people in the troop on the frontlines feel when they see such disarray in Washington well they're going to feel stranded and riyo they're there they're doing their job we've asked them to step up to leave their families behind to go into harm's way and defend America and yet the very top leadership from the commander-in-chief to his closest advisors can't seem to get their act together and can't seem to come up with a cohesive approach to what we're doing in the Middle East whether it's Iraq or or Afghanistan or Syria this is a real problem you know how troops are in harm's way right now and the weeks like them to get up and do their jobs and yet we don't have a president or a national security adviser who are willing to do their jobs ask you about the excuse the president gave over the weekend he said he cancelled the talks and canceled the Camp David meeting because of the death of the service member Ortiz on Thursday I believe he was killed by the patent by the Taliban as well as 11 other people including a Romanian officer or service member but in fact there had been a service member killed the week before an American service member killed the week before and days after that ambassador calidad was sent back to finalize the deal and arranged these meetings so they did not cancel the meeting when one service member was killed it seemed to be an excuse and then a quickly arranged visit to Dover by the Secretary of State Saturday night with almost no notice for the for the return of his remains to his family tell me how you react to all of that it seems as though the Servicemembers death was being used as cover for this failed policy and for the fact that the Afghan government was not going to participate in what looked like a charade at Camp David well I react with disgust at these actions by the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces to use a fallen service member for his own political gain should be shocking but unfortunately with this president is commander-in-chief it's not shocking he's shown that he has no respect for our servicemen and women and certainly he has no respect for the fallen or their families he's been known to certainly insult the family members of our of our heroic dead frankly what was he doing in fighting the Taliban to Camp David in the first place what was he thinking on the same week as an anniversary of 9/11 I mean that that is an insult and it's to not just the men and women who've served overseas but to our first responders to all of the Americans who died on 9/11 frankly it's shocking that he would even do it in the first place I support as negotiating with the Taliban but we need to do it as part of a coalition force to figure out a way to be able to get troops out of Afghanistan but to bring the Taliban to Camp David and the ultimate diplomatic meeting place a place of Honor if you get invited to that is shameful when we also ask you about this withdrawal schedule because the president seems so eager to withdraw and John Bolton was one of those saying too soon too fast we need to work this out and it seems that the there is no one else willing to stand up to the president in the national security team and say this doesn't work mattis quit over this regarding Syria but Afghanistan is analogous isn't not it very much is and we've learned over time that anytime you put a time a date for withdrawing troops is a way to tell the our enemies hey this is what America will be gone that's not the way you're supposed to do it and again we need to be entering into serious negotiations not as a lone wolf but with our allies our NATO allies who've stood to our left and to our right who've had our back for all of these years and I think that this is where secretary matters you know he said this and he quit because the president neglected our allies and we could not have been able to accomplish what we've accomplished had our allies not been there they stood up on 9/11 all those many years ago to support us and we can't just abandon our role that said we do need to negotiate and get out of Afghanistan but we can't do it by ourselves and certainly we should be doing it by inviting the Taliban to Camp David senator Tammy Duckworth and I don't need to remind any of us certainly that you have made enormous sacrifices in service of the country in war thank you very much thanks for your insights today and joining me

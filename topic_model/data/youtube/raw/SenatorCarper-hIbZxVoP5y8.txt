I just the criticism of the house legislation has been that actually increases the budget deficit over the next ten years it does a little up maybe a little those little piece of legislation and do a little of anything to reduce the growth with health care costs and this legislation according to the Congressional Budget Office which is critical of the house legislation says this legislation again with reduced episodes over the first 10 years by 50 billion by many times that in the second ten years I knew this legislation would bring it in growth of health care costs that's why when that we realize especially second-team you such large deficit reductions

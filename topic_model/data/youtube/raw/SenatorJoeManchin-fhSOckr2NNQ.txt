thank you mr chairman and secretary thank you for being here a high priority in my state is quarter h we've been trying to build it for 56 years we have about 90 completed or either funded to be completed we have that small percentage to be done yet and we have funding in that for the infrastructure bill the thing that we need help with is this um the language of the one federal decision language requires each project to have an agency that takes the lead on sorry okay and that would be under this it's finishing a highway so it'd be department transportation we're hearing that those rules haven't been set yet or haven't been drafted and it's supposed to be a two-year deadline a couple years might go by and the money be spent before we even get to to where you all can take the lead and help us if you would look into that we're just worried we're going to miss the opportunity to finish this highway we'll uh make sure to look into that our our intention has been to meet every uh every step on the timeline and uh we know how important that is for your state i think the one federal decision what you know the way it's written and and we did that to expedite right there was a pro for reason and there's gonna be a lot of people fighting back we've had everything 56 years you can tell they've thrown everything at us to slow it up this is going to be great it hooks i-81 into i-79 which is a tremendous going through the most beautiful part of our state but it opens it up which has never had transportation there so i would really appreciate your help on that if you give us a lead person in your in your agency would be happy to work with them on that let's go back to something that senator murray had talked about supply chains china is responsible for 80 percent of the world battery material processing sixty percent of the world's cathode production eighty percent of the world's anode production and seventy five percent of the world's lithium-ion battery cell production they've actually cornered the market and i i've got to be very honest with you what i see going on with putin energize weaponizing energy using it as a weapon in europe right now i'm afraid that china could do the same thing and we're not up and ready to run and i know that we have to decarbonize the uh transportation sector it's the one the ones that we have the most concerned about right now that we can do something and i've been very big on on hydrogen but we have not put the money or put the research to hydrogen the way we have on evs and it seems that we're still going down that path and there's a waiting list for evs right now with a fuel price of four but they still want us to throw five thousand or seven thousand or twelve thousand dollar credit to buy electric vehicle it makes no sense to me whatsoever when supply and demand and we can't produce enough product for the people that want it and we're still going to pay him to take it it's absolutely ludicrous in my mind but i'm thinking we're getting ourselves tangled in a situation that we're not going to be able to supply the continued electrodes and anodes and cathodes and everything that's going to be needed for this product so do you all have the same concern yes we're following this closely and i think it's a great example of one of the areas of manufacturing and capacity that we've gotta do more of right here on american soil you know if you look at the uh the the timelines that the physicists have laid out on climate uh some of them can in terms of our action and our need to rise to the challenge could arguably be measured in in months rather than years at this point and so we feel a sense of enormous urgency to accelerate not just the uptake of electric vehicles but as you note their production and our productive capacity for them one important thing that that you mentioned was the processing capacity for these raw materials so it's not only the stores of let's say cobalt or nickel lithium or some of those raw materials that are at issue but their refinement and sometimes it's actually the refinement piece that that is most concentrated in a place like china so we've been in close contact with the department of energy just got a briefing on it this week actually about what it would take for more of that to come onshore because we want to as we say with just about everything in infrastructure make sure that more of it's made in america produced right here in america and while we're also interested in the potential around hydrogen we feel a sense of enormous opportunity enormous urgency to deploy the technologies that exist and are on the market today and make sure that we get the absolute most out of that too i just came back from alaska then i was up on energy there and i was over in calgary and saskatchewan alberta and i truly believe that if if with what we see happening in the world being changed a little bit as we geopolitical unrest we have to form a north american energy alliance they have tremendous deposits of rare earth men especially in saskatchewan in that province and they're willing to to partner up with us and it's something we should be looking into they have the ability to do a lot of refining up there also that we might not be in with our environmental concerns that we have in our state uh we're gonna have to get the environmental community on board as a team effort to make this happen if i could throw one more thing at you just my own little plug for harmony grove we uh a good friend of mine congressman mckinley from west virginia has been really leading the charge on this and it's really something that's desperately needed it's the interstate interchange on interstate 79 morgantown it's called the harmony grove interchange if if you're uh if your miss your agency could look into that all we're asking for is if it's doable looking to see if it can be fast tracked that we can make something happen or either be told we have to reroute something or do something differently that would help us tremendously uh i thank you for your uh for your involvement in this and we're at tough times right now we just need to get on the ball and get something done and finishing the 56 euro highway would be great well uh we're in touch with your office on that i know the sense of of importance that's there and i'll make sure to follow up and get a sense of the status

thank you mr chairman and i hope america is listening today and to our witnesses let me say welcome and i regret that none of you were able to get into the kansas state university biochemistry program but i certainly appreciate your credentials that are all here today i think it's important to not only identify the true problem but also talk about where we've been and you all can help us fill into some of the pieces here when we talk about gain of function research it was late in 2011 when the nsabb which is the nih's advisory board stopped two scientists from publishing an influenza gain a function study that i believe dr ebright was referring to and they stopped it because they were afraid it could educate bioterrorists so this is 2011. over a decade over a decade ago sciences had figured out how to make h5n1 which is highly pathogenic avian influences more contagious in 2012 those two scientists and 39 others implemented a voluntary gain of function research pause on influenza experiments in early 2012 dr fauci encouraged all influence of scientists to pause gain a function and said and i'm quoting dr fauci 2012. it's essential we respect the concern of the public domestically or globally and not ask them to take the word of the influenza scientists it's interesting to me that dr fauci was focused on the messaging but he still wanted to continue the gain of function research again in 2012 dr fauci also said almost prophetically that he worried about unregulated laboratories perhaps outside of the united states doing work sloppily and leading to an inadvertent pandemic and he went on to say the accidental release is what the world is really worried about i go forward to 2014 now after biosecurity accidents and you and the united states research labs which are witnesses that talked about the obama white house implemented the second gain of function moratorium on influenza plus mers and sars because of the potential risk of lab accidents and inherent gain of function danger but gain of function still still continued at the university of north carolina research later that we shared with dr she the bat lady nevertheless clearly the u.s government and dr fauci knew that the viral gain of function research was very concerning and almost counter-intuitively while dr fauci encouraged united states scientists to pause their gof studies dr fauci offshored that offshored the paws research to china not once but twice in 2012 dr fauci gave a new grant to peter dasic's eco health alliance for influence research in china and then again in 2014 dr fauci gave another grant to dasic for sars research in china dasic partnered with who the wuhan institute of virology in late 2017 nih announced a lift on the gain of function moratorium what became known as the p3co frameworks which we referred to referred to apparently without consultation from a senate confirmed state department head or national security leadership also significantly there was no ostp director in place and only enacting hhs secretary at the helm so what was the result of this nih essentially lifts the moratorium on their own by slipping it in between administrations and self-policing and today we can't see the research record for dr fauci's offshore projects because the chinese community party supposedly has eco's health records and nih resist sharing theirs so i'll get to my question now dr ebright could eco health's research in china have led to the kova 19 pandemic and dr fauci's worst fears that a lab accident in a foreign lab became reality yes lapses in u.s oversight of gain of function research of concern may have caused the current pandemic and could cause future pandemics the us government funded high-risk gain of function research in high-risk enhanced potential pandemic pathogens research at the wuhan institute of virology in 2016-2019 the research overlapped the pause that was in effect in 2014 to 2017 and met the criteria to be paused but was not paused the research also overlapped the subsequent policy the p3co framework that has been in effect from 2018 to the present and met the criteria for federal risk benefit review under the p3co framework but did not undergo federal risk benefit review under the p3co framework thank you so much i have to stop and point out too that usaid who is knee-deep in this type of research is part of the state department where they can get the security advice that they should have asked for before they cleared this with p3co certainly i believe that this virus came from muhan china and that it is a product of gain of function research this is a bipartisan national security issue like several of our witnesses have testified that this viral gain of function could become it has become a a weapon of mass destruction that this model this is a 3d model what the covet virus looks like and this is the gain of function this is the the protein spike the two units that allows this key to fit into the door perfectly and the in the the the cleavage site and all that this became a nuclear hand grenade is what happened dr quay then dr s felt considering the extreme risk of this research and the incredulous obstruction by the nih usaid eco health in china should congress immediately pause this dangerous research i think that's that's an appropriate step for congress to take okay dr espel i think it would be somewhat dangerous to attempt to pause gain of function research when it's evident that that term is so malleable as to be evaded at will and also could plausibly do damage by applying to science that is not specifically directed at potential pandemic pathogens are there any countries that you would say we shouldn't be doing this type of research with when it comes to identifying pandemic-capable viruses that could kill millions of people and will necessarily be shared with scientists worldwide who will be able to access them i do not think that we should be doing it i do not think that china should be doing it i do not think that anyone should be doing it because it is expected to kill a hundred times as many people as it might save even if we could perfectly prevent an identified natural virus from spilling over thank you mr chairman i have some more questions that we have time for later but i yield the floor back thank you i want to start by going back to a comment that dr esfeld made that usaid paid for gain of function research in china and most people don't realize that because usaid won't give us the records and we've been trying for over a year to get those records which is why we're holding up one of their nominees as well so thank you for pointing that out dr sfeld i'm going to go to dr ebright next and talk a little bit more about eco health alliance that they're about their record of non-compliance they couldn't provide research records to nih when nih requested them they didn't have an adequate agreement with web they don't use appropriate rate of pay for web researchers there continue to be non-compliance with financial conflicts of interest policies dr ebright based upon eco health alliance's record of non-compliance should they continue to be eligible to receive federal funds their most important aspect of non-compliance was that they were informed by the nih in terms and conditions on the notice of award for their grant that in the event they encountered viral growth in their engineered coronaviruses that exceeded the growth of the parent coronaviruses by more than a factor of 10 they must immediately inform nih and immediately stop the research they did not do this so that's not merely a financial violation that is a serious hazard violation and a violation that may be connected to the origins of the current pandemic with that being said uh it is inexplicable that they were awarded subsequent federal awards and that they remain eligible to receive federal awards wow i need to submit for the record thank you for the answer a couple of articles first i i quoted dr fauci this is a an article from science july 2012 a handsome young dr fauci so i want to submit that for the record in my next two questions i want to submit uh something from the wall street journal a couple articles a well uh regarding genomic sequences without objection so we'll go to uh dr quay next you may be familiar with the genomic sequences nih's database i think you spoke about them that chinese scientists asked to be removed and how they were from early covet wuhan patients do you believe there could have been more data in nih's database submitted by chinese scientists that could hold the key to the coven 19 origins yeah this was a really nice piece of work by jesse bloom at the university of washington who found uh not in the nih database but on some amazon web servers uh the actual sequences of viruses from very early patients that had been put on gene bank and then removed before they were published and made available and the remarkable thing is um again going to another piece of good research the virus that first came out the first one a virus is three mutations away from what we now know is is probably the first virus but that's a computational method it's it's kind of complicated but anyway there's a prediction there are three mutations that have never been seen in humans before the first virus that we have in humans the specimens jesse found had some of those so we know that there are that the chinese have viral sequences that are ancestral to what we have and the more of those we get the more we'll get to the to the bottom of this i'll point out that these sequences were from september and october of 2019 two months before any uh any person in the market was sick so again the the timing of the market spillover uh doesn't coincide with the genetics of the virus doctor has told anything to add to that no other than jesse is certainly one of the foremost experts in this field and if you want probably some of the best answers that science can give then i would recommend that you request his input thank you my last question for 20 years nih sponsored ecohealth's partnership with scientists from the wuhan institute of virology the chinese scientists have bragged that their virus sample database is the largest in the world they took that data space offline in september 2019 nih asked equal health for research records ecohealth told them that the records are in the custody of the chinese government is it possible that the database taken offline by the chinese government was data collected by equal health and belongs to american taxpayers dr well since since the work has been funded in part by u.s taxpayers then by definition access to that would be important and i think i also think that that we don't have to rely on the wounded virology from releasing that i believe within u.s jurisdiction there will be copies of that database it's too valuable not to have in your own possession if you're doing research on it do you think there's any way we can still get any of that data that's missing i feel like you know somewhere we're going to find the grandfather of of covid or the a cousin or something here in in these data banks why why did they take him down and what would an advantage of them taking it down do you think we could ever find what we're missing well i was taken down at 2 a.m on september 12 2019 which is i mean i guess everyone works hard but that's a little suspicious to be doing it at that point in time i believe it contains closer precursors and my my hypothesis is it contains the one that's 50 mutations or 100 mutations not 1200 away and it was too obviously a smoking gun but again if you're collaborating on that and and you're you're spending 10 years building a database inside the windows virology you're going to mirror that database in your own facilities which means that it's got to be an equal health alliance somewhere thank you dr elston anything dad just note that i agree with dr ebright's assessment from earlier to the extent that china is doing this research because it is scientifically sexy and glamorous and get in is fast easy publishable etc chinese scientists have the same incentives as western scientists in this regard and i do not think in fact it's very clear that this research is not in china's tragic interest china has no more interest than we do in handing out the blueprints to agents that can kill millions of people including their people this is not in the interest of any established powerful nation and the question is can we show leadership and persuade them of that because as long as we're doing it we are making it we are contributing to the fact that this is seen as glamorous research it gets published in our top tier journals many chinese scientists get bonuses for publishing in our top tier journals we are driving these incentives because we persist in seeing this again as a health and safety issue rather than a national security issue so i think it is in our power to change it and i think this is one issue where our interests with are actually aligned with those of china and really indeed every other established nation these are asymmetric tools of mass death wow okay dr ebright anything we didn't ask you that we should have uh that i don't know but i just just wanted to agree completely with the last remark by dr esville thank you and i yield back

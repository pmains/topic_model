responding to the ranking member I think it's important that Fannie and Freddie continue to be what they have become perhaps accidentally and that is federal government agencies we need a federal backstop in terms of credit risk but never again should we have a semi-public semi private agency where taxpayers take the risk and shareholders try to reap the profit mr. Chairman I appreciate your patience on not raising rates you have a twin mandate but I'm going to ask you to also consider an additional factor not as important as your twin mandate and that is the profit that you create is a byproduct of your efforts at times turning over to the Treasury as much as a hundred billion dollars or nearly a hundred billion dollars in a single year and I want you in your decisions to reflect on the fact that that's not just a dry accounting entry it's life and death we have limited amounts of money that we can spend here in Congress on cancer research on body armor for our troops and research to make it better on opioid programs so people will live or die based upon whether you are able as you have in the past to turn over nearly a hundred billion dollars of unintended profit and I realize that's not your mandate but it is life and death we talked at another meeting about wire transfer fraud and I'll get you some background material on that but I do want to talk about just focus the Committee on the fact that people are being tricked through the internet - why are there funds into a particular number to count thinking they're sending the money to say the person they're buying a house from and instead it's going somewhere else so if we have a confirmation of payee system like the British we can avoid much of that as to your balance sheet shrinkage that diminishes your profit that you can turn over it also as you sell off or allow to run off your mortgage backed securities you're raising mortgage cost for people your testimony said we have a good job market it's not good until there's a labor shortage that drives wages up to make up for the 20 years of stagnant wages that we've had over the last two decades so I hope you would aspire for more than just a 4% unemployment rate I do have a question for you here and that is in your statement you comment on the federal debt you say the federal government debt is unsustainable path of course fiscal policy is outside your purview but it affects what you do we also have a trade deficit about a half a trillion dollars a year um kind of similar in size to the budget deficit and so every year we borrow another half trillion dollars to finance that as a country borrowing from abroad I wonder if you could say that the US trade deficit of over half a trillion dollars a year is on an unsustainable path yeah I mean I don't think I would say that I mean the the the the current account deficit is really set by the difference between savings and investment and I mean the reason that the reason the federal budget is on an unsustainable path is that the debt as a percentage of GDP is at a high level but much more important than that it's growing faster than GDP so debt cannot grow faster than GDP forever whereas I don't know that I'd say that about the the the the the accumulated trade deficit where every year we borrow over a trillion you know over half a trillion dollars just adds to our foreign debt but I want to go on and you know some of my colleagues find these hearing kind of dry and so they've urged me to spice things up by asking an accounting principles question we have Cecil the proposal for the current expected credit loss system being proposed by faz be the effect this is not the the effect of this may be to increase reserves but you and the other bank regulators are supposed to determine the size of reserves we shouldn't increase or decrease reserves because of a esoteric accounting theory discussion which has gone awry and so I wonder whether you believe that we should make this major accounting change for banks that will deter lending particularly in economic downturns without a quantitative impact study have you had a chance to look at this issue and how it will affect the banks that you regularly yeah so we we don't think that it will have that effect but we'll be watching carefully we you know we looking at this it's really been dunder discussion for a decade now it's it's a decision that faz be made and that we're just implementing and if we find that it does have that have effects like that then we'll we'll take appropriate action thank you thank you very much the gentleman's time has expired the

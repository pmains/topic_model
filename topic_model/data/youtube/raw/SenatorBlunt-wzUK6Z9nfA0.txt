on this topic borders supplemental even though a lot of our friends on the other side when you say border they hear wall there's no wall funding included in this it is all emergency funding slightly more than half will be to take care of unaccompanied children not children who were separated from their families children who came by themselves of that hundred and thirty thousand people that came last year the senator Barrasso mentioned about eleven thousand five hundred of them were kids who came by themselves about a third of those kids were under twelve about two-thirds were between twelve and seventeen and there's no option but for the Homeland Security to turn those kids over to Health and Human Services and for us to take responsibility for them this is not a group that under any circumstances you can say okay we're going to have to let you go because we don't any place to keep you show up in six months or so for your asylum hearing you can't take twelve and thirteen and fourteen year old boys and girls and say show up at some future time so we have to take care of these kids we are out of appropriated money to do it we are out of the money that would the appropriations bill allowed to be repurposed to do it and at some point very quickly will be basically asking the contractors groups like Lutheran Family Services and Catholic family services to just do this for free and at some point in the future we'll pay you that obviously doesn't work so slightly more than half of the money would be for that the other half would just simply be the overtime and the other things that have to happen at the border when you have this number of people coming to the border not walls not anything the Democrats have objected to in fact Louise rural our Lord from this the Democrat leader on DHS in the Senate said this is a horrendous problem so let's solve it as you would solve any other horrendous problem appropriately and quickly and we plan marked up that bill next Thursday

thank you miss Quigley let me start with you can you further elaborate or just describe the specific local challenges that you're addressing with your efforts to employ a smart transportation sure our challenges are probably not much different than any communities although ours may be exacerbated in some areas but safety congestion and capacity and limited resources to enhance those are our challenges so testing deploying these new technologies is a way for us to enhance capacity reduce congestion and increase safety without having to build additional infrastructure additional Lane miles or having additional rightaway takings etc and then you talked a little bit about the public-private partnerships which I'm a big proponent of but each day is unique and how that relationship should look can you talk a little bit about that for the state of Nevada and your involvement in a public-private partnership as you employ the emerging technology so as we're emerging these newer technologies most of them are in the pilot program or the demonstration phases so we can vet them through and one of the advantages of having a pilot program or a demonstration program is that you can work around your existing sometimes sty mean procurement processes and it's only after you've vetted and you've tested that then you it would move forward with the more formal procurement processes does that address the question thank you thank you and then mr. ray Croft you talked about moving forward right now in testing the commercialization in certain states let me ask you this how close is this technology to being truly available for people passenger use so right now the company is working towards being operational by the mid-2020s okay for passenger you've got for passing and and I appreciate the conversation that you had the chair with the chair because as we develop this emerging technology and get to that point we are going to have to be flexible with the different regulatory agencies that are out there and hopefully addressing the new emerging technology but still have a safety component and they have to be flexible with accepting this new emerging technology and thinking about it a little different way is that what you were trying to say earlier of course yes okay thank you the conversation I appreciate mr. Tolson you've talked about this as well which is creating jobs part of this and all of the use of all of the new technology is how we not only create jobs but there's always been this discussion about displacement of workers as well and how we should be working to give them the tools and the skills they need for the use of the technology because it will create jobs in the future can you talk a little bit about how you've created jobs with the emerging technology that you're utilizing I'm gonna ask you to talk a little bit that about that and mr. gray craft as well could you talk about manufacturing jobs that could come from the use of your new technology as well so mr. Tolson sure so what we're seeing is that as you can get more throughput and more efficiency inside the port there's more work to be done it doesn't slow the shipments that are coming in they have a more work that gets backed up than they can handle so this actually allows more people to come in work in this manner so you can get that through that's how we see it and this is how the Union in the conversations is panning out so and that's why I labor support so yeah absolutely thank you as you know we we have opened not only our test facility in North Las Vegas but also a manufacturing facility where we have that's where we've manufactured and assembled the majority of our components that we built into the test site that you saw on the screen as we look to commercialization as as I'm sure you can see this is a big system it's an infrastructure it involves vehicles that resemble the aerospace supply chains that that we have in full force out in LA that we have throughout the country my background at GE and so we do see that there's a lot of potential for manufacturing jobs and those jobs would exist and not only during the construction phase of a project where we need to procure the hardware to build the infrastructure but also the vehicles but those jobs will remain for for maintenance for spare parts over time and then we will also have as we continue to develop the technology and innovate new and enhanced efficiencies and cost points we will have the continued need for development manufacturing and so that'll remain and we anticipate fully leveraging our facility in Nevada thank you and then mr. Sanford you talked a little bit about challenges and barriers can you elaborate on on some of them and briefly before the committee sure so one of the I think the outstanding things that's uh delaying implementation of autonomous ships is regulations both within country states and from an international level so one of the regular requirements of international regulations of prevention of collisions at sea is to have the lookout on a ship that requires a manned ship right now there's no rule that allows you to supplement that person with a video camera for operation or allowing a computer system autonomous system to monitor the ship for safety there's also the safety of life at sea requirements which is if ships in distress the closest ship comes and provides support for that ship how do you handle that with an unmanned ship that doesn't have a crew on board to help a distressed ship so those two regulations will come about that's both at the u.s. level regulatory level through Cote u.s. Coast Guard and then also at the International Maritime Organization level for international regulations because they control everything for the International shipping thank you Thank You mr. chair

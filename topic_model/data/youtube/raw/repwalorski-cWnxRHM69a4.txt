recognize the gentlelady from Indiana this will ask you to inquire Thank You mr. chairman thank you and best sore loser for being here today mr. Chairman I ask permission to insert into the record a letter signed by over a hundred and fifty trade associations asking for a Federal Register notice that formally delays the increase of the list three tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent without objection Thank You mr. ambassador great to see you again always glad to have you here when can we expect that Federal Register notice the federal right now the president's made the decision and it's sort of in process in the next in the next day or so the president has made that decision he's made the announcement and it'll we're following the legal process we have a process where we go through we have a TPS see process as you know right with other agencies and they're sort of steps we have to go to but that's that that is something that will happen and it'll happen according to the normal course and with that when do you anticipate releasing more decisions for exclusion requests from list one or two of the 301 tariffs so we're in the process of doing that right now and those were in the first place we've out but we've already granted more than a thousand or almost a thousand as you know and and things were sort of slowed down because of the government closure but we're in the process of doing that right now we expect we expect another sort of trash to come out fairly soon mr. Chairman I ask permission to insert into the record a letter myself and my friend mr. Kyne led that was signed by 167 of our colleagues asking for an exclusion process for list three of the 301 tariffs mr. chairman without objection Thank You mr. ambassador there's obviously great support in Congress for an exclusion process for a list three and we've chatted about it I appreciate that in fact the most recent spending bill instructed USTR to establish a process within 30 days we're almost halfway to that deadline do you expect to meet that 30-day line Oh mr. chairman can you get that mic thank you the best I would say first of all that that that that was a report from the Appropriations Committee I understand that there are people in Congress who want us to have an exclusion process it's something that we're looking at our view till now has been that we would have an exclusion process for the 50 billion dollars which was at 25 percent the 10 percent which is what you're referring to in this case that there would not be an exclusion process I would note that since the date that we put that into place there's been a 7 or an 8 depending when you stop a devaluation of the Chinese currency so that the the effect has been less significant than than than fully 10 percent on those on those people are affected and our hope is that we can deal with this in the context of our of our negotiations with what the Chinese I I'm sorry to interrupt I just I also appreciate I know you and I chatted the constraints on resources and I understand that that you're facing with this exclusion process I recognize that the process for list 1 and 2 is tough to administer and I know it's moving slowly and that list 3 is kind of looming out there at four times the size and I understand that as well but kind just ask you this in the close here is there a way to simplify things a little to take the load off of your agency for instance what about companies who are hurt because they're only competitors are foreign and are able to export finished products to the US at little or no tariffs we have a process right now that we're following that we think is it's fair and it it looks at the competitive effect whether products are available in other areas and whether or not it's the focus of China 2025 so we're happy with our current process but it's a as you say it's a big big it's a big big process mr. chairman thank you you bet thank you gentlelady's let me

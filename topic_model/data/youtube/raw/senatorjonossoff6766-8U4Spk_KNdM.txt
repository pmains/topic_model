thank you chairman brown ranking member to me thank you chairman powell for your service and your testimony today obviously over the last 18 months the kobat 19 pandemic has been the most significant shock to our economy in the financial system but stepping back what do you assess to be the most significant systemic threats to financial stability over the medium term uh either limited to the u.s or globally i'd have to say that the the thing that worries me the most about it is really cyber risk um you know it's it's a constant uh concern and we you know we spend lots of time and resources on it so does the private sector but that's the one where we have a playbook for you know for bad lending and bad risk management we have a lot of capital in the system but you know the the cyber as you see with the with the ransomware issues now it's just an ongoing uh race really to keep up and uh we we haven't had to face a significant cyber event from a financial stability standpoint and i hope we don't but that's that's the the the thing i i worry the most about and in terms of uh threats to financial stability following cyber what next preoccupies your attention or concern um you know the the the economy is coming out of this globally coming out of this pandemic so i would worry about uh if we don't succeed in vaccinating people all over the world really we're creating time and space for the development of new of new strains of the virus which can be more virulent and and more uh difficult to fight and i i worry that that could that could undermine the economy and ultimately financial stability i the last thing i'll say is you know we're at the point in the risk cycle where people are looking at four or five years and they're seeing pretty good economy you know we're heading to i think a strong labor market highest gdp in seven years this is the time when risk takers can begin to forget that there's a bad state of the economy out there waiting for them at some future date and take too much risk and so from a supervisory uh and regulatory perspective we're very mindful that it's time to it's a time when we need to keep people focused on risk management that's a great segue to my next question which is given the extraordinary provision of liquidity not just since covid19 but the last 15 years how concerned are you that credit committees at major financial institutions and others allocating capital are acting with sufficient prudence given the easy access to capital you know financial conditions are highly accommodative people who are getting things financed specs and things like that are getting done we see bitcoin going up in value and down in value so it's a you know it's a at times it's felt like a somewhat frothy market uh and um you know you do you do worry about about that at the same time you know we're very focused on the real economy our our jobs are maximum employment and price stability really and also financial stability but we've got a long way to go so we want to be careful about uh about you know tending to our our main mandate while we also think about you know financial stability issues what is your level of confidence that there are not risks lurking in the non-bank financial system hedge funds private equity spax you mentioned given the provision of all this liquidity and the reduced visibility that regulators have into some of those institutions so there's lots of risk taking going on in the non-bank financial sector much of it can take care of itself private capital can absorb losses we know from the experience of the last crisis and the one before that there are structural aspects of non-bank of the non-bank financial sector that that really need some uh you know need better better regulation and better structures and that's particularly money market funds which twice have had to be bailed out in the acute phase of the crisis i think we saw that the uh the treasury market really lost functionality the most important financial market it lost functionality significantly during the acute phase of the crisis and we're doing a you know very careful analysis and thought about whether there needs to be some structural uh strengthening uh there and other aspects as well turning turning finally to uh climate change the fed's most recent financial stability report cited climate change as a potential threat to financial stability the national oceanic and atmospheric administration our country's foremost meteorological agency states that impacts from climate change are happening now they cite risks including changes to water resources floods and water quality problems challenges for farmers and ranchers increases in waterborne diseases rising sea levels that put coastal areas at greater risk the department of defense identifies climate change as a critical national security threat what is your assessment of the risk that climate change may pose to financial stability or to your dual mandate of full employment and price stability in the long run i think it has implications for all of those things in the long run we're very focused on the risks that individual financial institutions are taking and working with them to make sure they understand the risks they're running and can manage them and address them in their business model more broadly in financial stability financial markets generally and and non-bank financial institutions uh it's much the same we we know that you know the transition for example to a lower carbon economy may lead to sudden repricings of of assets or entire industries and we need to think about that carefully in advance and and understand and and be in a position to deal with all of that we're you know we're doing all of that work as our other researchers and central banks and governments around the world there's a lot of work going on on this senate you know it's a high priority but but a longer term issue in terms of the financial stability i mean i think the manifestations of climate change are here now but the the the financial stability issues are really coming thank you chairman powell i yield mr

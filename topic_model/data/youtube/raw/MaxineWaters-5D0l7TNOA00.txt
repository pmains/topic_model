welcome back to the ed show progressives have been hoping nancy pelosi would go to bat for those two tough words public option in conference committee well now it looks like there's not even going to be a conference committee democratic leaders have decided to hammer out their differences in private to avoid any round of uh let's say republican stall games a lot of progressives are concerned about this at this push that this final mixing of the bill isn't going to be what the house members want a lot of concern over there joining me for more on that is california congresswoman maxine waters a member of the progressive caucus maxine great to have you on tonight appreciate your time as always thank you very much you bet what is your number one concern that you hear that there i guess you could call it a watered-down conference committee that they're gonna close the doors and shut the republicans out how do you feel about that how do you feel about the the possibility that the house is just going to get pushed aside it's going to be the senate bill well first of all i just got the news early this morning that there was not going to be a conference committee and i was a little bit taken back by that because i truly was looking for transparency and of course many of us have got to engage those who are you know involved in the process to try and get that public option back in there to remain the house version also there's something wrong with this bill structurally uh on the senate from the senate side they want 50 different exchanges in 50 different states where some of those states won't even have any competition they'll have one or two insurance companies they may not regulate them at all and they could do whatever they want to do with the increase in premiums and co-pays and i'm just really concerned that we won't have an opportunity to put up the fight that we need to put up in order to first of all just straighten this thing out and make sure we have a universal healthcare plan a national healthcare plan with national exchanges that's the first big thing that's wrong sure and then of course the public option you know that and of course i'm worried also about taxing the health plans that uh workers have fought very hard to get and calling them catalog plans just does not sit too well with me congresswoman uh when you take a look at this what you just described is that the house of representatives stands the real chance of being marginalized here after a long hard drawn-out fight a lot of people campaigned on change a lot of people in districts across america won seats because of health care and now it seems like the you know it's up to nancy pelosi do you trust nancy pelosi i trust nancy pelosi what i don't know and i don't understand is what the conservative element would do both in the democratic party and of course i know the republicans are out to kill anything i know that they're out to tie up the system and there are many ways that they could do this they could go to debate on three items uh before they even get to a conference committee and they could just tie up the whole system i know that's a problem uh but here's what i also know i know that to the degree that we're able to put up a fight and put up a struggle we may be able to get this thing back on the right track but right now i don't know how we're going to do it congresswoman great to have you with us tonight thanks so much for joining us you're so welcome thank you ed congresswoman maxine waters of california

again this time on television by democratic congressman brad Sherman of California senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and former chair of the House terrorism subcommittee representing the San Fernando Valley congressman we were only able to reach you by phone earlier now we can see each other you've been watching and listening to our coverage you've seen this I won't call it sniping but this public disagreement between officials in New York and officials in LAUSD in Southern California about this tough call that had to be made this morning what do you make of it now in in in the light of the few hours of clarity we've had well there are a few elements of the Los Angeles email that give it a little bit more credibility the New York sources are saying that the supposed student misidentified schools or didn't use the term this email refers to los angeles unified school district so that that's the way los angeles students and parents would talk second this email of course references not only Los Angeles but San Bernardino and Bakersfield in San Diego as well so I think this could this email had a little bit more credibility and of course once she learned that identical emails have been sent elsewhere that diminishes the credibility of the email people in Los Angeles were unaware that anyone had received a similar email elsewhere in the country and further as you indicate when you see those markers in an email that personalizes it localizes it that's how it's possible for New York officials to have passed on it for New York officials to us have dismissed it but LAUSD on the other hand seized just enough in here of local references it really got their attention it did yet they're clearly parts of the email our fault the writer claims to be a devout Muslim I might use the term extremist Muslim but the from line on the email which I won't disclose but it contains a pornographic reference to a body part that's not something that either the extremist or devout Muslims would tend to do the word Allah is not capitalized in one circumstance and other other typos in the email but this is a place where you would expect it about Muslim to be Syria to be careful and there's certainly nothing in the email that indicates that the author has any understanding of Islam no references to the Quran no allusions to events in the in the life of Muhammad another part that doesn't seem credible is that he claims that he has 32 accomplices and that he has evasion there may be other parts of this email that turn out to be accurate and that's why an abundance of caution is called for but I would be very surprised if this attack involved 33 people and nerve agent so parts of this email may be true parts of it I don't think are but again the more we hear about the content of this email the more you read to us the more it makes you think you try reading all of that and then having to make the decision that 900 schools open unscheduled this morning or 900 schools remain shut and all those parents are forced to scramble and the chill gets sent through and already weary public in Southern California that's been forced to watch a witness so much this was a very tough call very tough call there would be intermediate steps about putting a large number of la PD at every school that would have alarmed parents it's it's not at all clear what was the right decision and an abundance of caution you certainly cannot be criticized well what about this finally congressman and that is your the superintendent of LA Unified should this have been a decision in concert do you put this up on the net as they say do you do you bring in homeland do you bring in Sacramento do you try to do what we were supposed to do after nine eleven get all this interagency discussion going with FBI with NYPD your counterparts in the next largest US city you you get as much information through coordination as you can right up until the time you have to make the decision but I i don't have a timeline in front of me does this email sent to the board member when did he notice it or did she notice it when did they get it to law enforcement the school district police so I I don't know how many minutes they had to make a decision and let parents know what the situation was so if you were going to spend you know wait until 10 a.m. pacific time to gather your information and to consult by then you've got almost three-quarters of a million students sitting in classrooms next to God God knows way congressman brad Sherman you make some terrific points thanks very much for also adding to our understanding of what was in this email thank you for joining us twice this morning since this news broke congressman brad Sherman who represents a significant part of the valley Democrat

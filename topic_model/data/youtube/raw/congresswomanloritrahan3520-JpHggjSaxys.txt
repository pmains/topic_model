hi it's lori trahan i may be working from home this week because of my positive covet test but that won't stop me from continuing the fight to protect abortion rights it's been three weeks since the supreme court's disastrous decision to overturn 50 years of protections secured by roe v wade and women in republican-controlled states across our country have already started paying the price in ohio a 10 year old girl who became pregnant after being raped was denied abortion care in her home state she was forced to travel to indiana to terminate the pregnancy that she had no say in and no control over in texas a cervical cancer survivor was able to get pregnant a miracle for her and her husband they had a name picked out when the unthinkable happened at 16 weeks an ultrasound showed that the pregnancy was failing and the complications were putting the woman's health in danger now since texas banned abortion access in almost every case the woman and her husband had to leave their hospital and drive 10 hours to new mexico when she arrived at the clinic on what i can only imagine was one of the most difficult days in her life she was harassed she was screamed at by anti-abortion extremists as she entered the facility in alabama an 18 year old girl was turned away from an abortion clinic just days after the supreme court ruling because the state moved so quickly to ban abortion she broke down crying devastated by the fact that she couldn't get the care that she needed and worried about where she'd have to go to get an abortion in time these are just a few of the heartbreaking and infuriating stories that have emerged in recent weeks and with many states now pushing for new or stronger abortion bans this is just the start so today while my republican colleagues chart out their plan to go even further and ban abortion nationwide including here in massachusetts i'll cast my vote to guarantee the right of every woman in america to access abortion care and i'll do so because our daughters are relying on us because this isn't the america they deserve it isn't the america any of our daughters should be forced to grow up in

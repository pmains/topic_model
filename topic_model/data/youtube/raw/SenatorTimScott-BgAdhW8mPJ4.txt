joining me now to reflect on what I just say and he might not agree and that is perfectly okay South Carolina Senator Tim Scott Senator you're as conservative as it comes but do you agree with my premise well Brian let me first say congratulations on your one day anniversary that is a big deal and thank God your viewers appreciate who you are and what you stand for I certainly do you're one of the most intellectually honest individuals on TV God bless you to your point I thank you for your monologue I will say that America benefits from inspirational leadership we haven't seen that much in the political uh Forum what we need though is Common Ground not necessarily a compromise Common Ground leads to Common Sense let me give you a couple of examples number one on the issue of Education 70 plus percent of African Americans Hispanics white folks Asians all agree that school choice is here to stay 67 of Democrats 68 of Independents and 70 plus percent of Republicans all agree when we start thinking about the American people right and not Republicans Or democrats you find common ground Common Ground leaves the common sense inflation another really important issue prices are too high the wages are too low the answer is not for the government to step in and give away more money that led to eight percent inflation for nine consecutive months what we need is to understand that the power is with the people give them their money and let them make their own decisions those are two very important issues the Border this is another issue where all Americans agree most Americans agree that we have to have a secure border for us to have a country that we can be proud of without those three common sense positions nothing else happens so common sense and Common Ground they go together so a strong border is Tim Scott's no-go Zone you believe that I actually obviously believe that too you got to have a secure border it doesn't mean you're anti-hispanic doesn't mean you don't like other people or immigrants I think we all understand that but where the rubber hits the road is a lot of people feel as though the rich have it too good and it's at this at the at the sacrifice of the working class and the poor and fundamentally the way to change that is to spend let's take some of that money and spend it and if you don't you're greedy and that's really what we see with the six trillion dollars spent over the last two years well what we see is the failure of spending six trillion dollars that led to the highest inflation in more than 40 years what actually happened to the working class American is that their spending power went down not up with all that spending what we know on our side of the aisle is that Solutions don't come in red or blue they come in red white and blue so the American Solutions work for the American people and what we know is that when we reduced when we reduced taxes revenues to the treasury went up fine but more importantly four thousand dollars went back in your pockets and by spending that money we had the best economy we've seen in a very long time the lowest unemployments for African Americans Hispanics 70-year low for women why because America trusted Americans and not the government and I think the last Administration made inroach with the Hispanic vote not because they had catchphrase because of the execution what you guys did so I think one of the most intriguing things for me is seeing that uh Iowa signed into law that eight thousand dollar student account that allows that kid to go to a private school if they public school they felt failing them I for one I had a grade school but I did not my mom and dad did not have a dollar to send me to a private school you had a similar situation this is changing and this is really gives power to the students absolutely thank you for pointing out Governor Reynolds a good friend of mine uh she has done a fabulous job she has an amazing story very similar to yours and mine so the truth is when people have had the experience of achieving the American dream because they work for it we know how to spread the love and what Kim Reynolds did the governor of Iowa was she empowered parents to have a choice and that means every child has a better chance for Success listen Brian our future as a nation isn't in black or white it's an educated or uneducated it doesn't matter whether it's a college degree or if you're an apprenticeship program if we equip the future of America with Americans who are Highly Educated lifelong Learners Katie Bar the Door well things are coming a lot of things happen in South Carolina I know Governor Haley's thinking about running she's good friend of yours appointed you uh to Senator I know that in South Carolina this guy named Tim Scott I know Trey Gowdy's got a book out and you think that's the biggest story Tim Scott's going to be going to some early primary States how close are you to making a decision about running Tim well Brian there's no doubt I'm going to hopefully be in Iowa next month and I'm going to talk about the importance of having faith in each other it is time for us to give back to uniting this country and if we think about the things that unite this country all of us want the Next Generation to be better off in this generation all of us want to be able to live where you want to live and succeed based on your efforts not because the game is fixed in your favor the good news is this is America we are the most exceptional Nation on Earth if there's traction for that story I hope to go to another state and then another state another state so we'll see what happens the good Lord's blessed me with living the American dream right Donald Trump will be in South Carolina this weekend and things going over to New Hampshire so as you know he is in and I know you guys are buddy so it might be tough for you to run against them but it doesn't look it will dissuade you right well we we got to thank God for the most amazing four years in my life some of a presidency look at the policies that we saw Pastor president Trump led to the strongest economy we've seen in my lifetime we have a lot to celebrate as Republicans but we also make sure we need to make sure that we have inspirational leaders leading us to the next American Century got it wow it's very subtle I got it uh Senator Tim Scott thanks so much have a great weekend God bless you

democratic congresswoman barbara Lee a penguin had barbara Lee is here congresswoman barbara Lee Democratic California weekend Washington DC is hosting the 45th annual legislative conference of the Congressional Black Caucus foundation congresswoman I've been impressed at the CBC over the course of this weekend really taking up black lives matter not in a row aren't they cute kind of way but like actively engaging and at a time when the discourse on the right has shifted to black lives matter are at Erebus you shouldn't be taken seriously well first of all black lives matters is a movement that we all must listen to and connect with once again I'm proud of my district of california where we have so many young leaders in the black lives movement secondly the black lives movement has evolved into a really political movement this challenging candidates are public policy issues which have to do with institutional and systemic biases and racism and it's so important that young people continue this movement and the push of course has to be from a democratic movement from the outside I mean that's how democracy works we're with us so that great to see you so you invited the Attorney General to come and you said you're very excited to tell him your ideas about change what are some of those ideas well first the Attorney General and I'm really pleased and excited that he accepted our invitation to come he only it's conducting these sessions in Memphis Atlanta Cleveland and Oakland and of course we have a lot of ideas okay and I think it's important to recognize the history of this or this a district in Oakland in the east bay in terms of the issue around police mistrust around criminal justice reform about round police misconduct but also the point that the community and young people have really fought for years for a change for systemic change or systemic criminal justice reform when you look at racial profiling when you look at grand jury report I'm a member of the Congressional Black Caucus Ferguson task force and so many of the ideas that we're going to hear from the community that the Attorney General is going to hear will be taken back to Washington DC and translated into policies and into legislation so now do matter it looks like in many instances black lives don't matter I think it's very important to recognize that the federal government issued data very recently showing that african-american men were shot 21 more times than white men today is national youth HIV and AIDS awareness day and to celebrate congresswoman barbara Lee has sent a special message exclusively on the HIV video minute hi I'm congresswoman barbara Lee co-chair of the Congressional hiv/aids caucus young people account for twenty-five percent of new HIV cases and to many do not know their status on this National Youth hiv/aids Awareness Day take your health in your hands get tested know your status get care together we can realize the promise of an aids-free generation I think it's important to recognize that this 50 years policy has failed and has not accomplished what previous administrations had wanted it to accomplish and now with the beginning of normal relations the American people will be able to have the right to travel to Cuba to see for themselves what they want to see they'll have a chance to engage in exchanges scientific exchanges medical exchanges and really be free to travel I'm very encouraged I've been really advocating for normalizing relations since 1977 been there over 20 times and it's very important that Americans understand that this is in America's interest it's in our best interest and of course the people of Cuba deserve to have interactions with Americans Americans deserve the right to travel to Cuba we need normal relations we need to end the embargo we can create jobs by having trade with Cuba all right it's unfortunate that the resolution that I voted against really does allow for a state of perpetual war without and I think this is critically important without any president coming back to Congress that 2001 resolution served as the basis for the 2002 resolution which was the resolution to authorize the use of force against Iraq and here we are again now engaged in military action without repealing actually that first resolution and so I'm worried frankly that the 2001 policy is going to stay in place until we repeal it and that it will set the stage for the continuation of military operations throughout the world really without congressional input debate or authorities twenty 120 yes votes and one no it was not unanimous in the house the tally was 422 one one solitary vote against going to war that vote came from Democratic congresswoman barbara Lee of California who went to the floor that day to explain why she stood alone we always need to recognize that a military solution is not the only option and give equal weight to other options and alternatives at that time but going back to you but it's not be there for one second does Washington do that like is the conversation on Capitol Hill anymore or left any less dominated by military solutions now than it was 12 years ago I think we're building that type of critical mass on Capitol Hill when you look at members of Congress and the Progressive Caucus the tri caucus the black car cuz the Democratic caucus I'd say and when you look at the vote as relates to the resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq you will see I think believe it was 132 or 133 members of Congress mostly Democrats who voted against that authorization but see now lay out what this legislation would do well thank you very much first of all let me just say women around the country and men have said enough is enough and what this legislation basically basically would do is remove the barriers and the bands on funding for reproductive health care all the reproductive health care options with which women with money have which includes abortions and so finally we have and we are so pleased we had 70 co-sponsors who introduced this bill along with myself to just say basically enough is enough we want equity you know the American people regardless of their personal views on abortions they believe that all women regardless of their income should be allowed the full range of reproductive options and so with progressives have had for many many years a very clear agenda that really I must say is mainstream mainstream American gender when we fight for a living wage when we see people who are living below the poverty line who are working excuse me living before the below the poverty line that's just downright wrong progressives want not only an increase in the minimum wage but a living wage also when you look at education when you look at making education affordable for everyone from pre-school all the way through either community college or college we have so many gaps there in inequities that we need to begin to close these gaps progressives they'll always do for that also tax reform we have a very unfair tax system river now it's about time we insist the corporations and CEOs pay their fair share

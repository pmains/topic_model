my pleasure to yield a one minute to the gentleman from Illinois we're pleased that he's back mr. Brad Snyder the gentleman from Illinois is recognized for one minute thank you for 19 years when Jordan occupied East Jerusalem in the West Bank Jews could not visit the western wall or the Jewish quarter of the old city they were denied access to places where for 2,000 years they have continuously we made a personal connection to their faith and their history it is impossible to separate Jewish identity from the Western Wall or the Western Wall from its Jewish identity or Jerusalem from the Jewish state of Israel yet this is exactly what has been happening in the United Nations for years and exactly what Security Council resolution 2 3 3 4 sought to do in addition the resolution overwhelmingly assigns blamed to Israel while avoiding direct criticism of Palestinian incitement and violence that's why last month I strongly urged President Obama to veto the resolution the US has and must continue to seek a sustainable two-state solution with the democratic Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized Democratic Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security but the only path to two states is through direct negotiations by the two parties efforts to force a solution at the UN or internationalize the issues are misguided and risk moving piece further away as an original co-sponsor I call my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 11 [Music]

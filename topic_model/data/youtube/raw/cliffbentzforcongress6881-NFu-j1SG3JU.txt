[Applause] question that's kind of been looming around and certain groups and around is let's talk transportation the transportation package and what all you know people people are critical of that and I guess tell us them a little bit more about that well the congressional district - has somewhere between thirty and forty thousand miles of roads and I don't really know how many how many bridges I'm gonna say hundreds if not thousands and we have to have those roads we have to because we can't get from burns to Bend and we can't get from burns to lakeview of we can't get from from Grants Pass down to Medford we've got to have roads and we have a lot of them and one of the things that people don't understand unless you are from this district is just how far everything is from somewhere else like today I drove two hours and ten minutes to get from Ontario - right where we're standing right now how fast did I Drive well the speed limit 65 I may have gone over that just a little several times and why was I able to do that without ever without ever slowing down on that road and the answer is because it's a really good road it's a state highway it's in great shape and why is that then the answer is because we invest in our roads it's a piece of infrastructure we have to have now those roads don't just magically appear and they have to be paid for and one of the things I was able to do with Greg Gretel sail from st. Greta some years ago was increase the speed limit it used to be 55 on all these roads it would take you forever I helped rake that fact I've sat down in my office in in Salem with with a magic marker and I outlined the roads on a map that we're going to increase from 55 to 65 and I took that down to legend the council and said here you go this is the rose we want to increase our speed limit off and that's how it happened yeah because then I added that to Gregory Rose bill then increase the speed limit on the freeway why were we able to do this because our roads are so good our roads are great and then when the safety people came in Troy kissed Alice is his name he's an employee a wonderful guy he came in and said you know I represented best because I was in the house at the time if you allow people to go faster they're gonna be in more dangerous they drive I said truck you may remember that you have constantly asked us to upgrade our roads fix the curbs and our cars are so much safer by virtue of airbags everything else can't we go faster and although he was not willing to Beaver he wasn't history his job is not to have us go faster but the truth is our roads allow us to do so and this louse allows us to get to places where we need to be much faster saving all kinds of time which we then can put to other more productive uses of just sitting there and driving anyway long story thank goodness we got the money for our roads and our bridges by the way ODOT had given us some figures before we passed the transportation package to replace all of our bridges in our system would have taken exactly give or take a few years seven hundred years seven hundred years most people probably don't know that the life were bridge is not seven hundred years it's a lot closer to 100 years so as we were going through and replacing bridges before the transportation package that's how long it would have taken after the transportation package we reduced that time by a significant amount certainly not down to a hundred years do you know why because the amount that we asked for in the package that people pay had to be a modest amount now why because you've got to pay your bills and and and you have to some people say we're not gonna do this we don't want to have to pay more money what they're really saying is let's abandon the assets our parents our grandparents built for us let's let them just crumble and why would we inherit a wonderful asset and run for road system from our parents and then let it crumble why would we do such a thing the transportation package was designed to make sure we did let that happen and so there are many good things in it there's hundreds of millions of dollars that were driven into will be invested in cd2 as a result of that package I'm very very happy for the for the the time and effort it took it's a good thing for the infrastructure for our part of the state shelly representing boss sir Davis had brought up you know you talk about the unique needs of Transportation c2 and what you have done but she wants to know maybe what would you do in DC about that about transportation well I joined the president and president Trump is is mentioning in fact are burning today talk about me because last night talk about a new infrastructure bill seven eight hundred billion dollars and this is this is something that is absolutely essential I want to point out that the transportation package that we passed in 2017 the the analogy that was used is that our entire system of roads in Oregon whether it's US highways or state highways or county roads and by the way the transportation package funneled millions of dollars back into our county roads so that entire system has been likened to a sinking ship going down kind of like this because it's gradually falling apart and when we pass that package we we changed the downward direction of that ship a little we didn't stop it so we have it it's our entire system is still deteriorating only more slowly because now we have more money to put into trying to keep it together if the president is successful and if I get to go back and help him I would do everything I could to make it his efforts to build up infrastructure successful then we could perhaps level out the the sinking ship of our of our roads and this is incredibly important over here in CD 2 because we have tens of thousands of miles of roads and if we can't jump in our car or whatever it is and go to whatever we need to get our economy will come to a halt the bridges in particular and I've often said if a bridge goes out between here and John Day it's a long way around a long way so the point is we have to maintain this infrastructure that we rely upon every day called roads and by the way I know the vector president that he's talked about infrastructure from the first day he got the office because it's a really important thing and he gets it and it's not just roads he's gonna be our dams our reservoirs it should be our pipelines should be a whole bunch of stuff that needs a lot of attention so I'm very happy he's talking about [Music] [Applause] [Music]

uh enter Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy who has some very basic ideas to address this to keep Social Security going because he's a fan of Social Security likes it but at the rate we're going doesn't think we're we're all going to be uh having it um Senator great to see you thank you Neil good to be with you one of the things that you propose is eventually raising the full retirement age uh which you can get Social Security from 67 as it is now to 70. uh that is also the age at which a lot of people even today if they push it off until then would get the most benefits but how soon would you roll something like that in maybe explain your position on just the age thing that has not yet been definite because we don't have an agreement from everybody we need to have an agreement from right but you can do what Reagan and O'Neill did uh um Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan and and not let it affect anybody for decades right no one who is close to no one who's close to retirement would be able to do it but Neil let's just stop for a second people start talking about that let's talk about some other things you could do one thing you can do is actually make the program more fair you can actually increase benefits from many people and the way we do that and this is the principal part of it we create an investment fund separate from Social Security we don't touch any Social Security dollars an investment fund that we hold in escrow and you allow the strength of the American economy to to build a bridge to sustainability for the Social Security trust fund we end up under our plan with enough money over time in order to increase benefits for millions of Americans indeed under our plan millions of Americans will see increased benefits When the law is passed and no one will see a cut and no one will see their age of Eligibility increase if they're if they are close to retirement at all so you have to Define what is close to retirement I get that and you were referring to Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill then speaker of the house to come up with a plan that later became the the basic part of the grace commission that that did extend Social Security shelf life for decades but didn't President Bush George W bush look at doing just this and of course it was the third Braille and he was just electrocuted a great question what what George W wish to do was to create private accounts each individual would have his or her own account right no we younger people we created be open to younger people but go ahead and and the fear of some was that the risk was born by the beneficiary under our plan the risk is borne by the fund not by the beneficiary and the beneficiary is guaranteed to get get the benefits which have been promised to her are promised to him she is at no risk whatsoever the risk is borne by the fund but over the time Horizon we're talking about that that will be a minimal risk um Senator there's another issue that keeps coming up whether we limit the the Social Security taxes to you know you're really at around 100 or you know a thousand and a half to and there are a lot of people get paid a lot more than that and that their contribution and the Social Security should be paid at a set rate up no matter how much you make what do you think of that yeah so what we do we don't raise the rates period end of story we don't raise the rates um but what we do is what we would do if we can get people to buy into it if we can get people to choose to preserve strengthen and uh Social Security as opposed to let it go and solvent if we can get people to choose uh over 40 years over 40 years we gradually increase the uh percent of wage income to which the Social Security the payroll tax applies returning it to where it was in 1936 and where it was in 1983 when Reagan and O'Neill did their proposal as you know though Senator I mean when we first got Social Security 16 workers were paying in for every one person who was getting Social Security now of course it's almost dead even or close to it how do you change that math or can you yeah absolutely you can we patterned after something that was done under George W bush has been in fact for 30 years or so uh if I have my math right the national railroad retirement system which was had had fewer workers and more retirees and was going and solvent sound familiar they created a fund kind of what we're talking about they created a fund in which they uh begin to invest separate from their you know a fund and they've got an 8.9 percent return every year A system that was born insolvent is firmly in the black paying the benefits that were promised if if we had done that with social back then we wouldn't be having this conversation well the best time to plant the oak tree is 50 years ago and the second best time is today still let's jump on it now to choose to preserve and strengthen the program and not do what say President Biden's doing choosing to let it go unsolvent and when it goes insolvent people get a 24 cut in their benefits yeah it's unsustainable to your point um I admire the guts of you and others who are looking at this because that crazy idea is what you're trying to do is is sustain something so that it doesn't go belly up at the rate it's going it's going to go Belly Up um Senator I'd love to get the updates from you on this and how it's going wooing some of your colleagues over Bill Cassidy the beautiful state of Louisiana

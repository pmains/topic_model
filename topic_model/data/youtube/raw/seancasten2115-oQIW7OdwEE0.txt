[Music] in June of this year in spite of never being a smoker I was diagnosed with stage-4 non-small-cell adenocarcinoma in my right lung like many others with medical conditions I have struggled wondering why me this is not fair yet every day I get up and remind myself that I am a survivor and I will do whatever I can to survive at the same time however I must prepare myself for an uncertain future with questions like how long can I work when I think about this question I feel myself ageing with worries that no beauty cream will help I do love my job and would be sad but leaving it but these crevasses in my face are caused by fear of losing my insurance if I do have to leave my job early my medication costs almost 13,000 a month when new insurance pay for that what about access to expensive tests and access to my oncologist I am afraid and with everything else that I am learning to cope with this should not be something that I and many others even have to think about of course there is a solution to this problem and it is certainly not to repeal the Affordable Care Act my current congressman Peter Roskam in Illinois sixth District has repeatedly voted to repeal the ACA in a recent debate with his competitor Shawn Caston I asked the candidates how they suggest people in situations like mine pay for the medications if insurance is lost Peter Roskam the man who was supposed to represent my best interests suggested that health savings accounts for the answer which left me shaking my head because who can afford that Shawn Caston on the other hand supports universal health care a common sense policy that would support everyone and ensure that we all have access to the care we need to live I'm voting for Shawn Caston and I urge you to make access to health care a priority for you as well we cannot afford four more years of Peter Roskam or any other Congress person who will not support those of us with pre-existing conditions [Music]

thank you like joe biden and hillary clinton you've been a consistent supporter of military intervention in the middle east from the iraq war to the libyan war to the syrian civil war some on your side of the aisle including the president-elect have said well we were given bad uh intelligence they misled us on the intelligence on iraq that's a very specific reason there's probably some truth to it but i think it misses sort of the lesson of the iraq war likewise your justification for maybe coming to a new approach on the libyan civil wars well maybe we overestimated the idea of having viable successors there um to me it seems like we're still missing the point because even after libya you guys went on to syria wanting to do the same thing again and you've argued well maybe we just didn't do enough if we'd done more we could have toppled assad and we could have had real regime change in syria well you got it in iraq you got it in libya and it's a disaster the lesson of these wars is that regime change doesn't work people say oh we're going to get rid of the iron fist and thomas jefferson's going to arise from the ashes well that you know is a naive notion to believe that thomas jefferson or his like live in libya or live in iraq their tradition is so much different than ours we've been fighting against centralized power and the english tradition for a thousand years um the revolution in england was 350 years ago ours was 250 years ago that tradition they don't have they have a tribal existence you trade one for another but mostly what you've gotten through the policies you have advocated and joe biden has advocated and frankly john bolton has advocated this idea of regime change has been a disaster for the middle east we complain everybody around here is concerned iran iran iran well why is iran stronger who's their best friend in the region now iraq you know we did that we had a balance of power it wasn't perfect but we had somewhat of a balance of power in the middle east and you guys messed it up you got rid of the one bad guy and another bad guy got stronger and so then you went to libya and did the same thing and they said well maybe olivia's a one-off well maybe there's a rule here maybe there's something we can learn about regime change and maybe we can learn that humility would be that maybe we shouldn't be choosing every government in the middle east i would argue that instead of always choosing the government maybe we should not reward the bad ones you know what i mean so for example with saudi arabia i despise the regime i'd probably still trade with them i probably wouldn't cut them off completely i wouldn't sell many more arms and after they killed khashoggi they shouldn't have gotten one bit of our armaments but both sides advocate for this on uae we tried to stop that because uae is a terrible human rights record both sides support it the problem around here is we have bipartisan consensus the problem isn't lack of consensus the problem is too much consensus but the consensus is for regime change are any of the lessons you've learned from the failure of iraq war libyan war the chaos the vacuum and more terrorism that occurred and more lives that were lost and then to go on to syria i don't get that there's been a lesson learned is there any kind of lesson learned on your part that regime change may not be the best thing for us in the middle east senator i think we we and i certainly uh have an absolute obligation uh to try to learn from everything we've done advocated to take into account uh the results and uh to uh make that uh inform how we think about these problems going forward and i've done a lot of hard thinking about some of the very situations you mentioned i'm proud of the fact that i have spent the all of my career during the times i've been in government for the better part of 25 years working to advance our diplomacy to do everything we possibly can to make sure that diplomacy is the first answer not the not the last answer and that uh warren conflict is a last resort that was syria the next step was the syrian civil war which looks a lot like the iraq war in syria in syria there were those who were advocating for uh a repeat of uh of iraq which is to say a whole scale intervention that's something that i did not agree with when we were looking at um what to do in afghanistan problem in syria it's it is there was a predictable result there had you gotten rid of assad who were the fiercest fighters over there al-nusra and al-qaeda the most rat the more radical you were the better fighters you were the program that you started with hillary clinton the program to train these the moderate rebels we spent 250 million we trained about 60 we sent 10 of them into battle and they were captured in the first 10 minutes it was a complete disaster this whole idea that there were moderates over there that we were going to support doctors and lawyers and stuff there were but i don't think they were out there fighting the ones out there fighting were jihadists al qaeda al-nusra and if they had taken over the country a terrible person but i'm not positive that these people would have been better so it means the same lesson our humility has to be let's quit toppling regimes over there let's don't support the bad ones but let's don't presume enough that if we topple them that in the vacuum thomas jefferson is going to arise because it never seems to happen with regard to advise and consent and this is a little bit on senator barrasso's extension of his question on treaties it really isn't so much a solicitous mood to say well we just can't pass these treaties we're going to make all these agreements they're not coming to you but i would argue even more importantly on war you have argued when you've been part of administrations that oh yes you know we'd like like senator kaine's a more narrow aumf but we don't really need it now you're not alone that sort of i think arrogant executive uh sort of attitude comes from both parties every president for the last 50 years in fact they all probably this they believe they have absolute power it's called this absolute article two authority and this runs on both sides but it runs through the extremes on our side the john boltons on our side believe in this absolute article to authority the aumf from 911 had nothing to do with people in somalia do you think the aumf from 911 authorizes you to continue the war in somalia i think the aumf uh from 9 11 has been used in countries and against groups that were not contemplated or cited in the amf which is the very strong reason why we should revisit it but it's very specific it says people who organize to attack us it doesn't mention you know if people say well they say and associated forces that's not in it that's somebody dreamed that up later and sort of said that it's in it's not in there it doesn't say associated forces there is no authorization for war in somalia mali yemen which the obama administration originally did support so there really isn't i'm not for a more narrow one i'm just from no more war over there i'm tired of all the war i'm tired of all the nation-building look i love the rights of women as much as anybody but if our goal is going to be that we're going to keep women in power like in saudi arabia we're going to go to war with saudi arabia because they don't have women ministers of health and stuff you know it really isn't exactly our national security you're talking about you're talking about something different now from the point of view the secretary of state there are things you can do through soft power to advocate for the principles we believe in but overthrowing governments to instill women's rights or to continue women's rights and to continue a military presence there and fight battles for it is really not something that is in the purview of the secretary of state or really under the constitution to anyone in our government with regards to nato you've advocated for expanding nato do you still support putting georgia in nato if a country like georgia is able to meet the requirements of membership and if it can contribute to our collective security yes the door should remain open so if you're successful then uh we would be at war with russia now i actually think just the opposite i think that uh senator with regard to nato membership there's a very good reason uh that russia has um proved aggressive against countries that are not actually in nato and under the umbrella and a good reason why it's chosen not to attack this would be adding georgia that's occupied to nato under article five then we would go to war well i think uh we've seen again in the past that uh countries that have um joined nato have not been the same target of russian condition that we've seen we were talking about 20 years ago we might have a valid argument now russia occupies georgia russia occupies or proxy troops occupy part of ukraine so i think adding either of them to nato not only is provocative but you'd have to ex you'd have to think what comes next i mean if we're obligated to defend our uh nato allies i mean basically we'd be voting for war so i wouldn't vote to add georgia to nato not not on your life unless i'm ready to send my kids and your kids to go fight in georgia um you know the complicated fights and wars and occupation around and i just think that we need to think these things through and i think for every provocation there's a response as well so we can't look at it in a vacuum people say i don't care what russia thinks i don't care what tehran thinks well if we don't understand our adversaries enough to think how they will respond but i don't think we're doing our job i agree with you but uh as you can tell i'm not excited about you know more military intervention in the middle east um i think there has been some chastening on the part of the incoming administration over previous failures but i don't think you have completely gotten the idea that regime change has has been a terrible disaster it's created vacuums chaos and actually more terrorism throughout the region so i hope you will consider that it's important not just for the philosophic point but it's important for our kids i mean we're sending these kids over to fight in these wars that go on forever and ever and ever and somebody's got to stand up and i hope you will be somebody brave enough to stand up and stop so i appreciate what you said

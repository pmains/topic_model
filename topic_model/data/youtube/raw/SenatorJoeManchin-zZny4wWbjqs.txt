affairs today both larry inbrandt will share pertinent information and answer some highly anticipated questions from our constituents thank you chris and hello to everyone out there my name is larry

meaning that we solve problems on your tax accounts and tax issues to get your results if you do feel that you need to talk to a operator for taxpayer advocate service you can do so by calling 877 seven seven four seven seven eight hello yes i'm brent bowie i'm a congressional liaison and within my role i work with congressional uh district offices on policy changes agency programs as well as other issues of interest within my role i make sure that congressional offices keep up to date on information so they can pass it on to constituents in addition to your congressional office is providing you this information we also have a great resource with an irs called rs.gov thank you larry and brent i'd encourage participants to reach out to the office of the taxpayer advocate service with any federal income tax filing questions at least 30 percent of the calls senator manchin asks me to assist with every day deal with constituent inquiries regarding federal income tax filing stimulus payments or the child tax credits through our conversations with constituents we've compiled a list of the top issues and questions that individuals have regarding their federal income tax filing larry and brent i'll read each of these questions and open the floor to you to provide your expertise our first question is from mr parson in berkeley county mr parson asks my tax return for 2019 took eight months to process in my 2020 filing almost as long what do i need to know now about filing my 2021 taxes is there anything that i can do to ensure that my taxes are processed in a timely way brent i think that you could probably must better answer this question and larry feel free to jump in yes uh thank you for this question mr parsons filing electronically with direct deposit and avoiding a paper tax return is more important than ever this year to avoid refund delays if you need a tax refund quickly i encourage you to not file paper but use a software a trusted tax professional or free file which is available on irs.gov for people with no issues with their tax return we anticipate most taxpayers will receive their refund within 21 days of filing if they choose direct deposit also i would add when you do file a return whichever method electronically or paper make sure that your income documents review them closely make sure they they are reported on the return properly um they are attached to the return and also take a advantage of any tax preference items you you can such as the earned income credit the child tax credit or the recovery rebate credit if you didn't get all your stimulus payments great thank you both so much our next question is from mrs campbell from tucker county mrs campbell shares i plan to file my taxes by paper this year i've heard on the news that the irs has mail that has been unprocessed from last year how can i be sure that my filing will be received and processed in a timely manner brent i believe this would again fall under your purview as more of a policy technical question but larry please feel free to jump in and add your thoughts too uh thank you mrs campbell for this question so even if your 2020 tax return has yet to be processed you can still file your 2021 tax returns i would encourage you to file electronically but if you must file by paper then file early and accurately to avoid delays for anyone in this group who chooses to file electronically here's an important point taxpayers need their adjusted gross income also known as agi from their most recent tax return when they file electronically for those waiting on their 2020 tax return to be processed make sure you enter zero as in zero dollars for last year's agi on your 2021 tax return okay great thank you very much mr short from kanawha county asks i have questions about my federal filing in my repayment schedule on a previous tax debt but i haven't been able to get anyone on the phone to answer my questions how can i talk to a live person at the irs larry would you like to take this question yes thank you chris and thank you mr short if you're doing your current year tax return and upon completion of it you determine that you do have a liability that you can't pay in full there is actually a form form 9465 a request for an installment agreement that you can actually complete and attach to your return and with that form you get to pick what day you want the payment to fall between 1 and 30 and you can also also put in the dollar amount that you can afford to fit your budget now if you have prior year tax liabilities and wish to talk to somebody on the phone to set up a payment plan an installment agreement that way you can do so by calling the automated collection service for which is a department of the irs and their toll-free number is 1-800-829 and that person will gather some financial information from you look at the balance that you have due and try to work out a payment plan that you have it paid off in a maximum they will not go any longer than five year period good information thank you larry our last question is from mrs garcia in cabell county i sent my payment for my 2020 federal income tax filing the irs cashed my check but i received a letter stating that my 2020 filing had not been received what should i do to correct this larry would you like to take this question as well yes and miss garcia thank you for the question and you're not alone um to give a little bit of procedure the irs in october and november routinely look at all taxpayer accounts and try to clear out credit balances to get them down to zero and get refunds out to clear them to zero before the new filing season starts now if an individual filed a return last year and they sent there to return in and they sent a payment in when that return is processed the return goes one direction to be processed and the check goes another direction to be cashed so her account is probably showing a credit balance because that return that check was cash but her return hasn't been processed people that have these credit balances would have received a cp 80 letter from the irs asking them what to do with that credit balance rather to transfer it to a different a year um to refund it um in her case and with a lot of other taxpayers if you did follow a balance due return and it hasn't been processed i would just wait give the irs another 60 or 90 days to see if it processes if it doesn't in those 90 days you can actually call my office and that number is 304 for and my andtake advocate will be able to look your information up on the computer and see what the problem is or if it's just as simple as the return hasn't been processed and give you advice on how to handle it or possibly even make it a case for me to assign to a case advocate these are some great questions and i know there are so many people around the state with the same questions i hope this information will be helpful as we wrap up i want larry and brent to advise constituents of any important reminders or helpful tips as tax season begins to roll out um as i spoke earlier the irs is doing document matching so make sure you have all your income documents your w-2s your 1099s make sure you have them all so you can input them on your return make sure the numbers are input properly and take advantage of those uh taxpayer benefit credits such as the earned income credit the child tax credit and the recovery rebate credit if you haven't didn't get your stimulus for 2021. so now i add a couple points i may feel redundant but these points are very very important first to avoid delays the irs encourages people to make sure they're ready to file an accurate tax return an accurate tax return can avoid processing delays extensive refund delays in later irs notices now we have a wealth of information and tools available 24 hours a day seven days a week on irs.gov to help you prepare to file that accurate return the other point is filing electronically with direct deposit and avoiding a paper tax return is more important than ever with the current backlog we want you to avoid refund delays if you need a tax refund quickly do not file paper and use software a trusted tax professional as well as we have free sorry free file on irs.gov about available to use thank you thank you both so very much for those helpful tips and thank you for joining senator manchin's informational session with the taxpayer advocate service and the irs if you or someone you know needs help with taxpayer

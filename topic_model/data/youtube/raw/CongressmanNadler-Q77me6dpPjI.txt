I want to bring in today's power panel we have congressman Jerrold Nadler of New York Jackie hilly executive director of New Yorkers against for gun violence and Ezra Klein MSNBC policy analyst and Washington Post columnist Jackie I want to start with you because last night was the fourth time that we as a country have watched this president have to address a national tragedy like this and I want to remind everybody of the last three times that we have seen the president taped to a mic to comfort the country it may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy but this much we do know no faith justifies these murderous and craven acts this tragedy prompts reflection and debate as it should let's make sure it's worthy of those we have lost I hope that over the next several days next several weeks in next several months we all reflect on how we can do something about some of the senseless violence can we recognize the president's words last night that enough is enough and that something will come out of this because right now the country is in need of something stronger and some resolve as we just point out with the state center to their McKinney you know I think the senator McKinney was really saying what's on the mind of all people in our country at this point I think the president put it very aptly and towards last night can we honestly say we're doing enough in this country to keep all of our children safe and I think clearly the answer in the country is no we're not if something like this happens in our midst and we're standing on the sidelines it's imperative on our part to do something about it congressman I do want to remind everybody exactly what the president said last night the strong words that he used while consoling the country in the people of Newtown but basically calling this country to action take a listen no single law no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society but that can't be an excuse for inaction surely we can do better than this surely we can do better than this sir seven members of Congress from both chambers have now called for action Senator Dianne Feinstein appearing on meet the press saying she wants to introduce assault weapons ban legislation on the first day of the new Congress the phrase tipping point has been used a lot in connection with the Newtown tragedy is this really a tipping point can we expect something better out of our elected leaders like yourself come next year I hope so but we won't know until the the facts prove it every time there's a tragedy like this people engage in similar rhetoric although I think the president's statements were very strong how you fully expect the president in early January to come out and recommend and put the weight of his office binds of strong gun control legislation and you know we've used any number of political excuses for these years people have been afraid of the leadership of the NRA who really have to be characterized at this point is in neighborhoods of mass murder and continuing will continue to be so if they continue to oppose reasonable restrictions on gun violence you know on Friday the same day as the tragedy that occurred in Newtown a maniac attacked an elementary school in China with a knife he wounded 22 children but they all lived the law come home the difference here is that the maniac had a gun and 26 was the 26 people are dead in China he had a knife to 22 children were wounded but they're all going to be okay it is our fault if we continue to let this insanity rain in this country we know what to do about it we have death by gun rates 15 20 times that of any other industrial country and we know exactly why we have to stop this Ezra when we talk about this there's a new Chicago trib editorial out by dick Durbin today talking about basically the big question of what will it take and he talked about what holds us back our political organizations that are well-funded well-organized and determined to resist even reasonable limitations there is a close political parallel between the gridlock in Washington on dealing with our economy and national debt and the eerie silence in Congress as the list of horrific gun crimes grows by the day an obvious big reference there to the NRA there were no supported senators of the NRA that would go on Meet the Press this weekend the NRA has been oddly mum in this telling NBC News that they want to wait to remark on this until more facts come to light but as you pointed out in a recent editorial in a write up yourself as we look back on the assault weapons ban between 1994 and 2004 we saw such a decrease in the amount of gun crimes in this country yet we let that lapse and we got away from it how easy is it going to be to utilize what is coming out the knowledge that's coming out of this tragedy in Newtown to revisit that and get something done I would never say doing anything in Washington is easy at all look we are going to have to do something I'm not a huge fan actually the assault weapons ban and this gets to something broader I think that needs to be talked about we need to do something we've action you keep hearing that we also need to do the right thing we need things will actually help the assault weapons ban I don't think the evidence is very good actually they did much to curb gun violence during that during its 10-year I'm not saying it wasn't a step in the right direction but it was rife with loopholes it was shot through with ways to get around it a grandfathered everything in so one thing that has happened particular lost 10 years as in particular Democrats have begun to believe that the NRA is all-powerful is that a lot of the thinking on gun control has has simply stagnated there hasn't been a lot of new fresh thinking and not enough integration of new important research into what we can do so as we get into this conversation one hope that I have at least is it we have enough time for it or we make enough time for we make enough space for it we figure out how to do a better job on this and we did frankly in the 90s and frankly and and such it it actually will have not just an effect on things like the mass shootings who've been seeing recently fallen more than 12,000 gun homicides a year the more than 18,000 gun suicides a year the more than 600 are about 600 inadvertent gun deaths a year and the 66,000 gun injuries free shootings are really not the only problem here although they are the most epically horrific so congressman is Ezra brings up when we use the example of the assault weapons ban maybe it wasn't the greatest piece of legislation because of all the loopholes that it had in it but a step in the right direction here we are nearly ten years later after it lapses and there are ten gun legislation bills before Congress that lawmakers could act on immediately among them to fix gun checks acts of 2011 and the preventing gun violence acts act on which right now there are these eight other ones that I'm not going to go over but we could see Congress act on it and meanwhile it's coming up on the two-year anniversary of your colleague gabrielle Giffords nearly being assassinated by doing a congress on your corner at a supermarket in arizona so when one of your own is nearly assassinated yet Congress does nothing how are we to think as Americans that something will get done now using this latest tragedy as the as the catalyst well I don't know that we should think that anything is going to happen that we have to make it happen Congress is not going to act unless the president and the people push it very strongly in the past election I don't think too many political people are aware of this the NRA proved to be pretty much of a paper tiger most of the candidates they supported Lost's mostly candidates they opposed one that information is to get out there but we have to put real pressure on our members of Congress who many of whom will do whatever is the easiest thing in their districts and then be may be afraid of primary fights or general elections we have to say enough is enough the president's got to lead and those of us who can have to speak out as I am doing now there is and the fact that that one rather mild gun control measure didn't solve the problem is no excuse we know a lot of things to do we know the fact that a country like Germany is 158 gun deaths a year and we have nine to twelve ten thousand a year we know what has to be done you have to I mean if we could do if we could really do what we should do I would make it a crime to possess after a period of buybacks of crime to possess an assault rifle rifle or a high-capacity magazine as it is a crime to possess drugs that's certainly more harmful than drugs that's not likely to happen but the least we can do is to ban the sale of assault weapons ban the sale of high ammunition clips chain get rid of the gun show loophole would under which anyone can buy a gun or anything site on site at and a gun show band gun trafficking that is limit sale of guns to one a month or something so that you can't go to Virginia by forty weapons and ship it illegally into New York where you have stronger gun control us these are things we can do we know to do and that we know will greatly reduce the number of innocent people killed every year they won't eliminate it but they will greatly reduce it I was struck by the fact that everybody's going to to investigate Adam lands and so forth we know what Adam Lanza was he had a mental problem there are mental there are people in this country we're going to have mental problems we don't know how to stop that we do know how to disarm them congressman thanks so much

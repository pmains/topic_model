I'll say one other thing on a completely different level this expires either when we pass the next NDAA or when the next president takes office it says in effect this president is not really our president for all practical purposes for every practical purpose he was elected by the American people for years ago but we don't like him so we're going to say he can't do certain things that his successor can do we're going to put something in writing only for this president now if this said this expires when the next end the AAA is past or it expires a year from now or whatever there'll be one thing but this says NDAA or when the next president takes office in other words very much like the Senate is doing with with the judge garland we don't trust the president maybe we don't that's a political decision but it's not a right decision we don't trust the president to act as president we repudiate the judgment of the American people made in the last election we say that for certain purposes his term has expired and we'll wait for the next president that also is precious and against our constitutional values and every level this bill is probably unconstitutional and certainly Amaro and III opposing I yield back gentlemen

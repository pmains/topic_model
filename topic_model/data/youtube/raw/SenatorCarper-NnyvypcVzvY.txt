the gentleman thank you for joining us today about a month ago sitting right in the middle there was Alan Blinder who used to be the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and he was on a panel of three or four person panel we were talking about deficit reduction and asking a group of really smart people what they thought we ought to be doing and I think goes Alan Blinder who said the 800-pound gorilla in the room on death's reduction is health care costs we live in a country where we spent about twice as much as they do in Japan get worse results they cover everybody we don't but he said that's the 800-pound girl in the room and I followed up his common by saying well with respect to health care cost containment and getting a better result for less money what's your advice he says I don't really know much about that he said but as a layperson I would just say this find out what works and do more of that so he said find out what works do more of that Democratic senators were over the White House gesture with the president our Republican friends were over there today and we had a conversation with President about deficit reduction and I shared with him Allen minders comments which I think are not only appropriate for health care but really for the way we spend money all throughout the government and my own view is a nice agendas would sell Valentine to that day I said I think we need to look in every nook and cranny of the federal government all of our domestic programs our defense programs entitlement programs tax expenditures and really and just ask this question here's the way we can get better results for less money or better results for maybe the same amount of money and when you just needed to change our culture in government and and that is to focus on which cultural it's a cultural spendthrift to a culture of thrift when it comes to to tax expenditures we need to do the same thing and there is assertions there's a strong belief in this country is certainly heard here today that some of the tax expenditures they relate to your industry don't necessarily get us the the best result for the amount of money that's been lost to the Treasury we're going to vote on the legislation I think authored by I think by Senator Menendez probably next week my guess is they're not 60 votes to to passive but later this year we're going to be voting on effort to try to trim the deficit by about four trillion dollars over the next ten years and we're going to do that largely on the spending side maybe two dollars is spending for every dollar of revenue and tighten what's will be on the table domestic spending defense spending tax expenditures be on the table and I would just say to you that when the vote occurs next week and we don't get 60 votes for cinnamon n Dez's proposal that shouldn't be the end of this conversation and we should continue have a conversation so that we can try to figure out how do we get a better result for less money really how do we get a better bang for the taxpayers dollars and it needs to be in your industry needs to be involved in that as well if I were in your business I don't pretend to be here to understand it especially well but I wouldn't consider myself an oil company and I would consider myself an energy company and my belief is that's what you do most of you do that and I would just like for you to talk to us about the efforts that you're undertaking your companies to move us away from fossil fuels to move us toward sources of energy that impair your health less than oil desert fossil fuels do that enables to come up with new technologies that we can sell and manufacture products and selling around the world just let's go just go down the list and you want to go first and just tell us what you're doing to help us through your company's average to develop renewables non-polluting forms of energy and what can we do to help you there well senator first I agree wholeheartedly with your comments on the deficit and ultimately we are an advocate for comprehensive tax reform and all of these things we're talking about today should be on the table and comprehensive tax reform as to what we're doing in developing alternative fuels and we have concentrated principally on transportation fuels because that's what we know the best we're not an electric power generator so we're not into windmills we're not in the solar it's just not our business but we are in the transportation fuels business as we've evaluated all the various technologies available out there for alternative transportation fuels the one that we believe we believe has the most promise although it is many years away is is to capture biofuels from algie's from various strains of allergies and we have undertaken a joint venture initiative we've committed six hundred million dollars with a company called synthetics genomics they have considerable expertise in mapping genomes because ultimately we think we're going to have to synthesize the type of allergies that are necessary to be able to scale up first we've got to be able to take this to scale and it's got to be delivered at a cost that the consumer can afford so we think there's a lot of promise in the algae space but it is a long long road ahead of us thank you please thank you we continue to ramp up our spending on research and development for alternatives and we similarly have a program that stresses LJ I would say though that fossil fuels has and will continue to represent more than eighty percent of the energy support that's required around the world one of the key things that's very important for our country is natural gas it's been over the last several years of technology developments that we're blessed with a great deal of natural gas some thought for decades and some think even for centuries to come so we are really applying a lot of research and development how we can develop natural gas even cleaner and and more efficiently and we think that's just a country's well blessed with these resources for standard of living and development of our economy good thanks yes sir quickly we think of oil and gas as the as the main driver in our business but on top of that and incremental to that alternative energy quick numbers we've spent invested seven billion dollars over the last several years most of the u.s. around wind biofuels lignocellulosic biofuels biobutanol solar and then carbon sequestration and it's a growing business it's difficult but it's going alright thank you sir but we do absolutely consider ourselves an energy company and I would tell you that as a company internally we look and say we want to be the most innovative and competitive energy company in the world so that's the perspective we take we've been in all of the businesses that have been mentioned when solar hydrogen and others the one that is emerging for us is the real opportunity is biofuels we have just recently formed a 12 billion dollar joint venture around current technology for producing large scale amounts of biofuels as well as then adding to that the very intense research and development we do we have been doing to take that to the next level and it's exciting stuff and we were talking about using enzymes to speed up the conversion to an ethanol and another technology that potentially skips the ethanol stepping goes straight from a biomass to a gasoline or diesel equivalent so it's exciting business alright thanks last one senator just in addition to some of the comments that have been made here we're the largest producer renewables thanks to our geothermal business and that's a very active business for us in Indonesia and the Philippines in particular we too are making investments in advanced biofuels we to believe it will be some time before those will come to market one opportunity that i think is out there during this transition phase that you were talking about is energy efficiency investments we have an energy efficiency company that goes in and makes investments in educational institutions and elsewhere to to reduce energy energy assumed i think that's a big opportunity and it's a near-term opportunity across this country thank you sadder thank you very much

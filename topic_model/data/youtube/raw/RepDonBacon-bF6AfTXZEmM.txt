I'd like to tell you about one of the successes of the Paycheck protection plan as you may know before the bill was passed the earlier version didn't have provisions for nonprofit organizations but we worked hard to include what we thought was wise about many of our nonprofits included unfortunately not all of them one of those that were able to take advantage of this was the youth emergency services right here in Omaha and for those who aren't familiar with yes by the youth emergency services they support our youth who may be facing homeless problems or hunger needing transitional housing they're there to support how are you through who are struggling for whatever reason that may have caused it in fact they support approximately 3,000 youth but the yes organization relies on donations and contributions and they're down right now because of the economy is being hurt by the Cohen virus so they applied to the Paycheck protection plan will receive that loan so it will turn into a grant and that enables the us team to keep other workers employed in turn that means that they're serving 3,000 youth in our community so this is a success story for the Paycheck protection plan and it's supporting a great organization notice the youth emergency services so thank you the mission of youth emergency services to support youth experiencing homelessness and near homelessness continues even during this pandemic we are still operating but we've had to make some changes some of our donors are no longer able to make their regular donations we had to cancel fundraisers we have some expenses that increased young people still need services and this paycheck protection program allows youth emergency services to pay for the cost of our labor of our dedicated staff and rent and utilities that frees up that money to go directly to the young people during this pandemic the mission of youth emergency services continues we would like to thank all the members of Congress including congressman bacon for stepping up and helping nonprofits during our time of need

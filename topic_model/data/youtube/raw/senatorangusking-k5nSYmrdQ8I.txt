thank you madam chair I want to join senator Heinrich in welcoming delegate plastic here basket I know a strong advocate for her constituents in the islands I also want to welcome the two governor's as a former governor myself I always feel the discussion around here is elevated substantially when we have governor's in the on the panel governor Mapp I apologize I was at another hearing I didn't hear your initial statement how is our the Virgin Islands on track to get the aid that they need is it being a package with Puerto Rico how what's the status of the federal aid the the support from the federal system has really been good for the Virgin Islands in terms of how we respond to life issues we are really working through FEMA on the shelter-in-place program we're having some difficulty there the feds are putting more money in tarpaulins in terms of $25,000 per unit but want to restrict the amount for permanent repair at 20,000 so we're trying to work that out our presence here and and your help senator is essential in terms of setting aside dollars and changes in the statute that permit more than simply rebuild as is I'll get to that in a minute but but basically it's on track but there is gonna be a damage assessment and a request for aid just as we've done for y axis in florida thank you a couple of technical questions I was fascinated by your testimony that some of the solar farms survived and others didn't which indicates that Solar is survivable yes it's properly built I notice in the photo of the wind turbines it appears that the damage is broken blades is there have been an assessment of whether the turbine all the towers withstood the storm the turbines are all there is broken blades the extent of the damage that would be a question I defer to governor Brazil he he has the wind towers and and what is it tell me about when and where their wind farms that that survived yet there I mean there was devastation across some of the wind wind farms that we hadn't you you would see the blades come out some of the towers when went out as well and similar to what what the governor saw in the Virgin Islands you know we saw severe devastation such as here in in Ho Macau but we saw other areas that were practically the question I'm getting at is properly designed renewables are still a feasible option for the islands yeah you've all given the hurricane risk of course how about rooftop solar how did that do yeah it did much better in Puerto Rico again there's there are some mitigation strategies about putting putting sort of a similarly worsen islands as well yeah walls in the in the side of it and those there's those turned out to be to survive very well and considering this was a cat5 slow cat5 and rooftop did well in the yes and and in fact senator because of that in terms of the reconstruction on the schools we were gonna we're gonna work with the Water and Power Authority and we're gonna use the roofs on the schools to create micro grids for the schools and put solar panels right on them well that gets to my next question is where I think we're all agreed here that it doesn't make sense to rebuild a as a 1980s grid when we have an opportunity when we have renewables the economics of renewables are so much better who makes that decision who's gonna does you do senator you do by changing language and staffer I never knew I had that power yes yes sir you do do you do by making the changes in the Stafford Act that permits it or in the appropriation and the set aside for the monies for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico if you authorize that's the second time you've anticipated my question clearly we need to amend Stafford so that it's not simply rebuild what was there before yes sir and I think there bill several bills being considered that on that line and that's something we needed to do but I'll get back even if Stafford is amended assume for a moment who who's gonna make the decision is it the power authority of the of the islands in Puerto Rico once the authority is in place and the dollars are in place then we will work with FEMA will work with the Army Corps of engineer and the case of hardware will work with them through the process that every other state goes through in setting up what the new profile should be the USDOE and the Virgin Islands have been great partners in the last five years that's why we know how renewables can work are the tests and all of that so we'll work with the federal agencies to make the right decisions final technical question for both islands both sets of islands the transmission lines went down I take it yes so that's a vulnerability as well and that gets back to the idea of distributed micro grids so you're not so dependent upon major and underground major transmission and underground yeah it certainly does and in Puerto Rico as we said most of the generation is is done in the south most of the consumption is in the north so you get lost and efficiency as well it is an opportunity to sort of flip that that's great well I know go ahead and just to add that in the US Virgin Islands this is the fifth time that the United States government is paying to rebuild the power distribution system and an aerial basis and this one is 300 which three hundred plus million just under reconstruction so that putting it underground in the main corridors the second corridors and having the micro grids and some aerial in the neighborhoods make the system a lot more resilient that could withstand these 185 mile an hour storm I appreciate your testimony and look forward to working with you I think this is an extraordinary opportunity for our country to see what a modern grid can and should look like thank you madam chair

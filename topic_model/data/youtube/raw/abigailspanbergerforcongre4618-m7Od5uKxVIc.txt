service isn't an obligation it's an honor that's what we teach our daughters and it's why I joined the CIA to serve my country and protect American lives people I would never meet too many Washington politicians serve special interests or themselves in Congress I'll bridge divides find solutions and put people first which is why I won't take money from corporate PACs I'm Abigail Spann burger I approve this message because serving this community means being accountable to you

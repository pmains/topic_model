russia's military operations and congress's response to the war on ukraine let's bring in florida republican congressman scott franklin he's a member of the house armed services committee and the house committee on oversight and reform and a formal former naval aviator who saw tours in bosnia and kosovo congressman i'm sure like the rest of us you are watching uh this war go on with with wrapped attention vladimir putin now says his forces have unleashed a hypersonic missile against ukraine there's no confirmation of that but if it's true what does it tell you well good evening john thank you um yeah you're right we don't have confirmation of that i haven't had any hearings on it yet but the fact that he would actually even make that statement would tell us that he's uh significantly ramping up his rhetoric uh he's that's a signal to the west more than anything else that uh that he's not ready to end this anytime soon and the fact that those hypersonic weapons could be equipped or be tipped with either nuclear or conventional uh payloads would say that uh he's at least uh signaling that he'd be willing to put nukes on the table well and it's it's also a signal to the west too uh isn't it i mean the united states doesn't have that kind of weapon in its own the russians and the chinese do well the the fact that he would have used a hypersonic weapon on this target if he did did so uh wasn't necessary for the target could have been taken out by a conventional payload but it tells me a couple of things that that also as as your former reporter noted uh this war has not gone anywhere uh near the way that putin had expected it to uh ukraine didn't roll over as as most of the world had expected or not uh you know they expected us to go very quickly uh didn't no one anticipated the level of fighting back that the ukrainians have done and he's in for a long slog now and it tells me that that if he indeed if he indeed used us hypersonic he's pulling out everything in his arsenal there was a reason i think early on he didn't take out the power grid he didn't take out all the aircraft parked on ramps he didn't take out those ammunition depots he assumed this was going to be an easy walk in the park and he wanted to preserve those assets for his own use later now he knows he's in for the long haul your fellow republican in congress michael mccall says the prospect of putin using chemical or biological weapons is very real i want you to listen to this and i'll get your reaction i've raised this in very high level briefings that they need to start thinking about this because when that does happen what is going to be our response it's classic uh this administration they wait and then they react like you know the russians have been on the border since the last march building up and i urged them in november to put the lethal weapons in now they're just coming in and and they're going to get caught flat-footed do you have the same concerns about putin using nuclear i'm sorry chemical or biological weapons i absolutely do i mean that he's uh he's proven historically that he's willing to use anything at his disposal and i think backed into a corner and he's made it clear that if he ever feels threatened that he would use any weapon in his arsenal i want to play this from senators uh senator roger senators roger marshall and steve danes listen to their remarks on the situation there we listened to ukrainian lawmakers today pleading for the weapons that they've been promised they told they've got nothing from the united states so far you don't do what this administration did where they promised the mig-29s in one sentence and then denied them later on that timidity that lack of moral clarity actually demonstrates weakness and our nato allies sense that those are the mig-29s former soviet jets that poland now has and has offered to the ukrainians you're a former naval aviator would those jets be useful in ukrainian hands personally i don't i don't think that the idea of the no-fly zone is a good idea for us those particular weapons you know ukraine still has a number of aircraft at their disposal it could be used i think that would be a serious escalation and i'm not sure that it's the weapon of choice i think the the sophisticated air defense systems the stinger missiles the things that we are providing have provided and are being used effectively for a better measure to take out uh that air threat that they're facing

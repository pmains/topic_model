Mr Speaker H.R 5774 is designed to do two primary things number one it's to prevent the federal government from re-victimizing disaster victims number two it's designed to save money in the aftermath of a disaster we watch as countless federal agencies the alphabet soup of federal agencies come rushing to the aid of these disaster victims offering everything from food assistance housing assistance you'll see them offering having having organizations coming in and offering clothes offering loans you you see all of these uncoordinated activities yet we have one Federal agency that's responsible for disasters and that's FEMA the Federal Emergency Management agency and and this FEMA they come in and what happens with all of these other programs you see disjointed responses let me give you an example Mr Speaker in the aftermath of of a 2016 1 000 year flood that we had in in my hometown FEMA came in started offering out assistance we saw disparate aid offered to to different folks you had another recovery program come in and provided 1.7 billion dollars 1.7 billion Mr Speaker here we are six years after six years after this disaster of the 1.7 billion dollars less than 700 million dollars have actually been granted to flood victims granted to disaster victims Mr Speaker I know your home state of Texas got pounded by Hurricane Harvey in some areas experiencing 42 inches of rain in 36 hours you have recovery and Assistance programs that are disjointed among the federal agencies they they cause a bureaucracy they actually re-victimize these people that have lost everything in these disasters this is designed to get recovery dollars where they're needed to expedite recovery to save money because you're saving funds that are being spent on long-term shelters save funds that are being spent in some cases approaching three hundred thousand dollars to provide a trailer a trailer for someone to temporarily live in uh saving money again hotel rooms and getting people back in their homes faster we still have people from our disaster six years ago that have homes that have been mucked and gutted stripped down to the studs without any additional recovery because they can't connect the dots so as the gentlelady from the District of Columbia said this is designed within 30 days of a disaster estimate the impacts provide an initial payment to where States and local governments can lead the charge in directing and prioritizing recovery dollars where they need to go this has importantly it has a five percent administrative cap five percent Mr Speaker two years after disaster I mentioned in my home state we had more money that was paid to the program managers two years later than we had actually given to the disaster victims these programs aren't designed to enrich contractors to enrich program managers to enrich people that are running these programs these dollars are designed by Congress to get to the victims to expedite recovery to allow for the community the economy economy to be recovered as quickly as possible and so I want to be very clear my co-sponsor the co-sponsor that worked very closely with us on this legislation congresswoman Plaskett from the Virgin Islands in 2018 was incredibly affected by hurricanes Irma and Maria hosted us down there to see the devastation and years later again still having her constituents that are adversely impacted unable to recover and requiring additional federal funds so in closing Mr Speaker I want to be very clear this legislation is intended to reduce the expenditure of federal funds it's designed to expedite recovery it's designed to cap the bureaucracy and ensure no more than five percent of these funds are actually going to program management that way the dollars can get immediately to the disaster victims and stop seeing this years and years of federal government dollars being shelled out for temporary housing and temporary recovery efforts we need long-term recovery we need our economy restored we need our communities restored

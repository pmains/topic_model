I rise tonight with the question of whether the house will allow government to continue or shut down to actually talk for a few minutes about a simple concept but that is apparently difficult in this body and that is compromised I want to talk for a few minutes about compromise based on the action that was taken by the Senate earlier today the the house has an opportunity to accept a compromise that the Senate has put before them the CR bill that the house drafted contained a budget number that was their number not ours we weren't wild about it but we've accepted it and the question is will the house except yes for an answer we've taken action again today we have again made this bill what we call a clean spending bill we've taken out anything other than what this bill is supposed to be at what level should government be funded and we've gone back to the house and we've said we're accepting your proposal we're accepting your number even though we we have a different number that we want to argue for and we'll save the other arguments for a budget conference if you will finally go to the table with us this is not fundamentally a debate about the Affordable Care Act it's not fundamentally a debate about the budget it is fundamentally an attack by some upon the very notion of compromise that is at the core of our system of constitutional government madam I stand on behalf of Virginians and I don't think Virginians are different than Americans in saying we have to be willing to compromise to find the common good and it is my hope that the house when they act tonight will act in the spirit of compromise and the common good and allow this government to remain open

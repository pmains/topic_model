this is an important hearing we appreciate your being here very much um looking forward to your testimony today and your willingness to start serve and continuing this important dialogue before I go to my questions I want to highlight several issues that I believe should be at the top of this committee's priority list as we look to reauthorize the FAA obviously there's no doubt that both the southwest and the no Tam system failures have shown the need for a reliable Air Service ecosystem both in the public and the private sector but I must note that reliability of air service is an issue that my home state of Wyoming faces every day whether there's a system outage or not factors such as a lack of Pilots High jet fuel prices a consolidation of air carriers and the up gauging of aircraft capacity have left many rural communities across the country at risk of losing their air service so as we move into this FAA reauthorization this committee must not lose sight of the main goal of Our National Aviation policy creating a truly national network that safely connects all regions together so I'm looking forward to the discussions today acting administrator Nolan it's my understanding that many in the aviation industry feel that no Tam system does not provide useful information I happen to be sitting on an airplane when no time went down and the pilot was trying to explain to us what no no Tam does often air crews are bombarded with information some of which is critical While others are repetitive or even Irrelevant for the specific route the aircraft will be flying as the FAA looks to recover from this outage and modernize the I.T infrastructure I'm curious to hear if the FAA has heard similar concerns and if there are plans to simultaneously modernize notam so that it can better prioritize the information it is sending to air Crews yes ma'am thank you for the question uh what are the so two things number one the journey that we are on and we're about halfway through it in terms of our modernization of the no temp system is designed to do exactly what you're describing and what the general concern is how do we ensure that the nodems delivered to Pilots being a pilot myself are relevant they're timely they're prioritized and they are speak to the root of flight now there are times when you might have to divert so we can't always say they're irrelevant you know if you're deviating around weather systems sometime that could take you hundreds of miles off your present Course and there might be a relative a relevant notem there but we are moving we've already got some functionality built into the system today especially on the federal notherm system and by the time we get to 2025 and we'll have everybody onto the federal notem system we'll continue to improve that and following the that we will ultimately get to an Iko standard all of that takes time of course but we are working through it very purposefully so how would it work if it's a more localized issue for example I've been on planes uh in Wyoming where there were antelope on the runway or a coyote on the runway so it only affects a few planes in a very localized area can no time be calibrated to address those sort of very isolated individual issues yeah so maybe to speak a little bit about no Thames right so for your flight that you're on departure yes you've got no Tams that are appended to the flight plan if you're on a commercial flight but the other thing you do as a pilot is you would call for the data's automatic terminal uh information which gives you weather which gives you tax away closures which gives you other things relevant that may not be working in the moment in the same thing for your route of flight and the same thing for your destination airport Pilots you would call prior to Top Of The Descent and say what's happening at my airport uh it may say is in Bozo and Montana or is in you know Jackson Hole Wyoming right that those are the in the moment types of information relevant information you would get from the airport itself our goal is to again to continue down this journey of uh streamlining the nodem system making it Iko compliant and getting it to a point where it is indeed relevant to each root of flight so uh recently you announced that upgrades to the no Tam system would not be completed for almost a decade and I assume it's because of the complexity of making the updates is but is there a way to expedite that time frame yes that's one of the one of the directions I've I've given my team is come back to me with what it would take resources wise for us to accelerate we love this see if that's possible right now we substantially the bulk of the work will be done by fy25 I like to see if we can bring that forward and then there are some other pieces that work into that okay one more quick question I understand the FAA has taken steps to prevent another no-tam malfunction such as decoupling the system and requiring that two people be presented when performing work on the system or be present since the issue with no Tam was caused by contractors accidentally deleting critical code does the FAA plan to restrict access to the no temp system moving forward to FAA employees no ma'am we do not and so we have a nodem system that is overseen by the FAA and maintained by contractors these folks are indeed the experts there what I have ensured that we have is the level of oversight for our FAA team and that the requisite level of leadership that oversees that thank you very much acting director Nolan we appreciate your being here um I yield to the gentleman from Georgia Senator Warnock

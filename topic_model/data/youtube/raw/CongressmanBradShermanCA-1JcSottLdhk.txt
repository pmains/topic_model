not my thing the EPA now looking into the gas leak more on the stick that's coming out of Porter Ranch the investigation first confirmed in a letter to brad Sherman congressman from the 30th district the San Fernando Valley first of all congressman good morning good to see you you've been the congressman from the 30th 27 to 29 they keep moving keep redistricting but you're still there you're not just the congressman representing the district you live there you live in port orange i do i'm known as brad sherman from Sherman Oaks last year we moved up to Porter in right so what are you experiencing you know most of the time I cannot smell anything part of that say fever I don't have the best sense of smell my wife doesn't smell it but in various it just depends which way the wind is blowing and my next-door neighbor has has relocated whereas we're staying in our home and we've got a special filter and things are okay for now other people we're talking about headaches and nosebleeds and nausea nothing like that all for you I haven't experienced your symptoms and yet as I say my neighbor had on all of those ya have to leave and those symptoms are very real for those people and families a lot of people leaving their homes so what's going to happen here what can we do well they're talking about shutting it down by the end of februari that is way too long various ways to deal with it right now there is a meeting going on about the idea of capturing and flaring the gas they have a kill well being drilled but that won't be done daily into februari and I'm pushing them to deplete the field right now they're pulling out of the field only the gas they can sell and this is not a high usage time for natural gas we use natural gas to create electricity to run our air conditioners so it's time for the gas company to tell its customers take gas from us as if it's the hottest day in summer and if you have to just create electricity that you put into the ground fine obviously it'll be free but they are still keeping natural gas there and pulling it out only as quickly as they can my understanding is they know where the leak is the problem is getting to it it's so far down into the ground that seven-inch pipe or whatever it is they just can't get to it that's why they need to pull the gas out of the field they need to empty the bucket so it's a lot more complicated than it seems ah yes and looking into the future we need to see subsurface safety valves they had those back in the 70s they weren't very good what happened they got old I am out they took them out and show me my folks these are not oil wells these are all storage feels natural gas you're a natural gas all right my question to you is simply this there are some people who have said there's an overreaction to this who say it's not that bad where the health effects are not serious we're not going to move in our lives because of this woody what do you say to those people well as I say our families take in that intermediate position we haven't relocated but we do have these special filters in the house and I'd say take it seriously but if if you don't have the effects or the effects are very modest and a getter your health provider thinks that it makes sense being closed you know that's that's not my decision but you've got such a wide range of reactions from people who aren't affected to people who have asthma and school has to deal with all types of kids so I'm not I'm not surprised that they're moving the school and real quick before we move on to talk about the Rose Parade and security there did you get those filters after this issue or you've always had them is this link you can do or the gas company has announced that anybody lives in the zip code they'll send you a filter okay which is a lot cheaper from no charge well actually they say they'll reimburse you will see if the reimbursement let me out we put money up my hope is that we can get the reimbursement before I advocated people are upset they're putting money out they're relocating their families could be in danger and then you're talking about that your kids health may be in danger take it handled you mentioned the Rose Parade you're not specifically involved with the rose parade but this whole issue of security this report that we had that most Americans feel something Bad's going to happen can you speak to that we've just got to deal with I hate to say at the new normal we have been on dealing with violent jihadists for 20 years and it's not going to be over anytime soon and the way to keep it in context is we lose a hundred people every day from automobile accidents but we're still on the 405 and we have to be careful and when there is a specific risk react to it but if you want to help your family keep them from natural gas leaks and buckle your seatbelts and that may be more important than what terrorists can do other things here well we have you as a Democrat you're backing Hillary or Bernie I'm with Hillary I think she's the next president of the United States they think she'll do an outstanding job and yet I've worked very closely with with Bernie for 20 years we served together on the Financial Services Committee and we have the the Sanders Sherman bill to break up those banks that are too big to fail so I think he's an outstanding senator I look forward to work does it does it get personal for instance you did serving in Congress with him and you did this is he like disappointed that you don't support him no because he knows of my admiration for for Hillary Clinton and right look you have to it it is personal but it's not like I don't think that Bernie has outstanding ideas I just think Hillary Clinton would be a better president and I made that decision back in 2007 I haven't changed so definitely stir things up that's for sure and done a lot better than a lot of people thought he would a lot of people are are angry at the system and bernie is able to identify ways and traumatically the chopped effect also comes out of that same sense of NY have you thought of the whole season thus far the campaigning the debating and everything well it's got a boost ratings yeah it is far more interesting than a race that where where people are just staying between the 40 yard lines and you cannot say as has been said in Prior races this is just a choice between Tweedledum and Tweedledee yeah you've got a choice of candidates from one end of the spectrum to the other and one personality type to the other some people would argue that at least one Tweedledum maybe I'm sure I thank you so much good thank you

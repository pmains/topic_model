um thank you mr chairman this has been a wonderful um subcommittee meeting and i really thank all of the folks who have come to testify um my uh question initially is for dr rao but if other people want to type in after um he's answered it please feel free so i'm from north carolina from the research triangle area and i've done some work with renewable energy and with integrated resource plans and north carolina was the first state in the southeast um to adopt a renewable energy portfolio standard and in addition to adopting that standard um it created incentives for the regulated utilities to encourage conservation because as we know if we conserve energy then we don't have to produce as much right and so uh because you are working in multi-disciplinary areas and trying to reach communities that might not be like the techie community i live in that looks at their smart meter and tries to figure out how to peak shave and do all of this how how can we use research and in particular behavioral research to encourage conservation and what else should be added um to enable communities that don't traditionally think about conservation to see it both as cost-saving and um a way to improve our planet thank you so much for that question that's a really important dimension one aspect of this is involving customers more directly in reducing load and that involves potentially using new technologies smart appliances smart devices uh potentially having to be much more involved in your energy conditions or thinking about energy costs if you have a smart meter that tells you more information about your real-time prices and how you respond to them we need to understand if people are able and willing to engage that much more in the effort to try and save energy so i think we can do a lot of research on the customer side to understand behaviorally what will incent people and send customers to really engage and we need more research that's qualitative fieldwork to talk to people engage stakeholders uh that's one aspect i think we also need institutional research and understanding how we provide the incentives uh to utilities and to other agencies and to state governments to provide the kind of support that we need both to prepare the grid in order to deliver those that information to people to understand the physical conditions of buildings to know where we can maximize our get the most bang for the buck in terms of a shell building shell improvements for example and also making sure that you have uh the right set of incentives uh for coordination amongst different players to make sure that all of these end up leading to significant uh long-term investments in efficiency because as you very rightly said the more we invest in conservation the less we have to invest uh to a greater to a greater extent in supply of energy and just one part of my um question was for less educated and low-income communities um who traditionally do not ha live places where it's easy to conserve energy and don't come from a culture where that um that's something that's valued or it's complicated to figure my mother couldn't figure out how to use an ami meter so what can we do to bridge that gap because not only will that help our environment but it'll lower their energy costs uh yes i absolutely agree there is a digital divide in some sense there's an information gap we know some things about it what can we do about it we can ask people i think we need strong stakeholder engagement to understand what it will take for people to engage and that's really what i think is the first step i'd also mentioned we have a lot of publicly created data from national surveys that starts to hint a little bit at some of these conditions people's education level people's engagement with other technologies that we can use as a starting point but we definitely need to ask people that's my main message um i only have a couple seconds left so if anybody else wants to pipe in please do so otherwise i'll yield back i just wanted to comment that you know at brookhaven we've created a department that i chair that brings together energy efficiency integration and grid modeling as well as energy storage because as you so correctly said all of those questions are interrelated thank you

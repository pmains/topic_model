we must address and evaluate our Nations and specifically our government's handling of covet 19. from medical censorship and unhinged spending spending to unconstitutional vaccine mandates we have seen our country economically crumble in constitutional freedoms trampled as someone who has served in the U.S Navy for over 28 years I am particularly disheartened by the vaccine mandates placed on our service members it is unacceptable that service members are being discharged and losing their opportunity to serve our nation because they have a legitimate religious issue with the vaccine unfortunately this medical tyranny hits very close to home as it is directly impacting my Georgia's Ninth District in fact my office was recently contacted by a major in the Army from my district who is being forced out of military service for refusing to take the vaccine he like so many others applied for a religious exemption and followed the process set out by the Army however like almost everyone his exemption was systematically denied without explanation this is unacceptable unconscious unconscionable and unconstitutional yet it's not just those in Northeast Georgia my own staff right here in Washington DC has been impacted by the Biden administration's medical tyranny a staff member on my staff just a few blocks away had a full ride ROTC scholarship graduated and should be training as an army field artillery officer right now but because he made the decision to not receive the covid-19 vaccine and applied for a religious exemption his hard work and service were dismissed and his constitutional freedoms were violated after submitting his religious exemption request he received a generic form letter declining his request and his and it is currently on appeal in the meantime he decided to join the good fight and I'm proud to have him on my team as we battle this fight to be frank I'm downright disgusted that our service members are being forced out by Biden's woke military this is unacceptable and we will not rest until there is justice my question to you is this you know we've talked about young men and the risk of myocarditis well what is the military full of young men young men in their 20s so do you think it was wise for the Department of Defense to force the coveted vaccine on young men and women in uniform no no there's no scientific basis to have that policy none thank you I think the um the decision by the department of fence of defense is having an incredible negative effect on the strength of our military you're seeing a decline in New uh recruiting that's correct in new recruiting and you are seeing great fantastic combat officers and combat service members being forced out of our military it is a disgrace and that is something that that we really need to to make sure we we fix

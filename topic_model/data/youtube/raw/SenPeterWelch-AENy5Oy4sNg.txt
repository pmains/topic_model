THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED MR. WELCH: I THANK THE   GENTLEMAN. I WANT TO SUPPORT THE WATER  RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT  LEGISLATION. IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE  COUNTRY, OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS   FALLING APART, COLLEAGUES ON   BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAVE   POINTED THAT OUT.  AND THIS IS EVIDENT IN OUR   DAMS.  IN VERMONT, DAMS ARE AGING AND   THE RISK OF THE BREACH IS  CONTINUE TO GROW.  CONGRESS TOOK A POSITIVE STEP  TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE PASSED  FUNDING FOR THE ARMY CORPS TO  REHABILITATE SOME OF THE   NATION'S OLDEST CORPS  CONSTRUCTED DAMS THAT ARE  CLASSIFIED AS HIGH HAZARD  POTENTIAL. AS YOU KNOW, THE FAILURE OF THE  DAM THAT IS SO CLASSIFIED IS   ANTICIPATED TO CAUSE THE LOSS  OF LIFE. WHILE SECTION 1177 WAS A   POSITIVE START, THE LIMITED  AUTHORIZATION HAVE HINDERED ITS  EFFECTIVENESS. TO THAT END I WANT TO THANK  CHAIRMAN SHUSTER AND RANKING   MEMBER DEFAZIO FOR THEIR   WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH ME TO   ADDRESS THIS MATTER. SECTION 105 OF THE LEGISLATION   BEFORE US ADDRESSES THESE  SHORTCOMINGS BY INCREASING THE   PROVISIONS OF THE AUTHORIZATION  AND GIVING DAMS GREATER  AUTHORITY TO ACCRUE FEDERAL  FUNDS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. THE BENEFITS OF THESE CHANGES  TO COMMUNITIES LIKE WATERBURY,   VERMONT, ARE VERY CLEAR. IN 2011, MR. SPEAKER, WATERBURY  SUFFERED A DEVASTATING FLOOD   DURING HURRICANE IRENE.  DESPITE THE DAMAGE THE VILLAGE   SUFFERED, TOTALLY FLOODED, THE   FLOODING IN WATERBURY WOULD  HAVE BEEN FAR MORE CATASTROPHIC  IF IT WASN'T FOR THE CORPS   BUILT WATERBURY DAM, IN NEED OF  SIGNIFICANT REPAIR.  SECTION 105 WILL GIVE THE CORPS  THE TOOLS IT NEEDS TO GET WORK   DONE REHABBING HIGH-HAZARD DAMS  LIKE WATERBURY ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. BOTH PARTIES AGREE WE NEED TO  IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.  THIS BILL WILL TAKE IMPORTANT  STEPS TO DO THAT AND ADDRESS   SOME OF MOST OUTDATED HAS  ORDEROUS DAMS IN THIS COUNTRY. -- HAZARDOUS DAMS IN THIS  COUNTRY. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT  THIS BILL A

today junior senator tim kaine unveiled the troop talent act 2013 his first bill as a united states congressman and this bill aims to assist military veterans in their transition to life outside the armed forces today senator kaine joins us in the studio to tell us more about his first piece of national legislation good to see you hey julie great to be with you today tell us about this this isn't a very important issue it is well i'm on the armed services committee and the tradition of a first bill is you should make it about something you really care about over the course of the campaign and in talking to people around virginia i heard again and again the challenges that our veterans have in re-entering the workforce so sadly we have a veterans unemployment rate now that's higher than the national average when we feel like boy we really owe folks the ability to connect so i'm taking some of the problems that i'm hearing about trying to fix them with something we call the troop talent act of 2013. and the core of it is everybody in military service gets training and technical skills and they also get leadership training but when they get to the civilian world if the civilian workforce doesn't understand the skills they bring to the table then they may not be able to get traction so it's about taking the skills military members get making sure that they if they can getting in their credentials that equate with those skills that mean something in the civilian workforce so it's all about uh making it easier for our troops to connect with civilian jobs as soon as they leave the military really excited about it and unemployment's such a huge issue the economy money's such a huge issue now lately we're hearing more states reporting budget surpluses and for many states it's against the law for them to have a deficit you know this better than anyone you worked as a governor in virginia under similar conditions so as a senator would you vote for an amendment requiring a federal balanced budget i'm very very supportive of balanced budgets um if we did them like the state did them some of the amendments that are on the table they call themselves balanced budgets amendments but they're actually require super majority votes for all kinds of things and i don't support that we had a balanced budget as recently as ten years ago with the constitution and laws that we have right now the real issue is to make sure that members of congress just you know cast the right votes about budgets i'm really proud that i'm on the senate budget committee when i got elected julie the senate hadn't passed a budget for four years i campaigned against that as a candidate i got on the committee i agitated with others we got to start passing budgets again we passed a budget on march 23rd and felt very good about it we have to now find a compromise with the house budget because they're a little bit different but that's what we're going to be working on next and just making the right decisions is the key we got to get our deficit um manage it better but we also have to you know grow jobs and grow the economy let's talk about jobs hundreds of government workers having to take a pay pay cuts furloughs for sequestration but the salaries of our congressmen stay the same do you believe you or other congressmen should take a pay cut while these folks are doing it until we get all this stuff worked out i think we ought to fix the problem you know i think sometimes if you you do there can be things like that that um that are superficial the real thing is we ought to fix the problem the reason that why are federal workers furloughed they're furloughed because congress could not find a budget deal this not being able to do a budget for four years there was a sequester mechanism put in place if we can't get a budget deal these bad things are going to happen that was something the last congress said they couldn't find a budget deal we are now in a new congress i've come to the body with the pledge that we're going to try to do the right thing fiscally responsibly we've passed a budget the budget goes into effect on october 1. it's for that fiscal year we appreciate you coming in to see us when you're in our in the hometown yeah well i'm not moving i'm here in richmond i have a little place to stay up there during the middle of the week but we've we're living right where we've lived for the last 20 years all right thank you for coming in we appreciate it

My colleagues have clearly explained the devastation this legislation would cause for millions of our neighbors by cruelly criminalizing nearly all undocumented people. I would like to emphasize one specific group that would be unjustly affected: DACA recipients. These young men and women, people who came to this country as children, who grew up in our communities, who aspire to be a part of the very fabric of our great nation, who in short, are literally pursuing the American dream, these people receive no exemption under this bill. Rather, with this bill their presence in the country becomes a misdemeanor or even felony offense putting them at very real risk of criminal prosecution and possible imprisonment. This bill is not just a threat to DACA recipients, it will have real profoundly negative consequences for all the communities we represent. The concerns are not theoretical each of us have DACA recipients living working and building lives in the districts we represent. They are our neighbors, our co-workers, our children's teachers, physicians, and role models. They're not just working in our communities, many are starting new businesses and creating new jobs instead of looking to deport these dreamers we should be seeking ways to empower them to pursue their dreams and improve our nation last week I shared the story of one of these dreamers I like to take this opportunity to highlight another several years ago at a roundtable discussion on immigration reform I met a young dreamer named Stephanie ax her story is just one of many that underscore what is at stake in this debate and how cruel and self-defeating this legislation is a dreamer Stephanie R was brought to this country when she was just four years old she has lived in the United States virtually her whole life she grew up here went to school here graduated from college here and is now building her career helping others here the United States is unquestionably her home her green and aspirations are American Dreams her success is America's success and strengthens our community and advances our nation a stefania's story is moving but it is not unique more than 700,000 young people have received daca a national survey conducted last September to assess the impact of daca concluded that the program has benefited both the recipients as individuals and the American economy as a whole daca recipients reported substantial increases in income and wages which not only improved their lives and the lives of their family but also means they're able to purchase homes by cars and in these activities pay taxes that bolster these communities and grow our economy without darka these people would lose their jobs their homes their health insurance essentially they would lose their futures the data is clear we know these dreamers are tremendous assets to our community but this bill would label them criminals no one like a Stephanie AX who came here as a child and has lived her nearly lived here nearly her entire life should have to live in constant fear of deportation but helping daca recipients isn't just the right thing to do it's also wise economic policy it's worth repeating figures I've previously shared with this committee a recent estimate by the Cato Institute found deporting daca recipients could deprive the United States of over two hundred and eighty billion dollars in economic growth over the next ten years a 2016 survey found 6% of daca recipients more than 40,000 young people that started their own small business in the United States that's a rate of entrepreneurship twice as high as average Americans it's estimated that after gaining daca status more than 50 percent purchased their first car and 12% purchased their first home these are significant the decisions that positively contribute to our local and national economies in other words this bill without this amendment will hurt daca recipients and American workers alike we all agree our immigration system is broken but this draconian cruel bill is the absolute wrong way to fix it what we need is comprehensive immigration reform not this mass deportation approach true bipartisan reform including increased border security along side a path to citizenship citizenship for those like a Stephanie ax will grow our economy reduce our debt and strengthen our communities docu daca recipients are not criminals they are the products of our schools part of our community is an important to the future success and growth of our country I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to make sure that we do not label these young people pursuing the American dream as criminals and I yield back

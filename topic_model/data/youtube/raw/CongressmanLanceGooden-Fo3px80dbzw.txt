joining me now House Financial Services Committee member Texas congressman Lance good and Congressman good to see you thank you good morning is it possible to get this done given that the Democrats control the house well I think it's important to know first of all the president doesn't just wake up one morning and throw a plan out there he told Larry let's get working on this now it's February we're gonna see this in September right around campaign season a retirin election day when it's important for the American people to know that they have a very distinct choice between more of the same from the Democrats or new leadership in the house which is what it will take to get this passed and I believe the American people will know who wants to go to work for them and that's Republicans hey congressman Rob soweth here I have a question so do you think that this would really go a long way to kind of quell the the criticism from the left that this administration and the tax benefits and stuff only benefits the wealthy absolutely you know they the administration wants to put out a ten percent cut for the middle-class taxpayers in this country I think it will come at a perfect time when you're hearing a lot of back-and-forth between whatever Democrat nominee that the Democrats settle on and the president come fall when we're in the in the heat of battle going into campaign season and I think that the American people really need to think and wonder who do they want running the US House of Representatives we've seen what it's like to have Nancy Pelosi in charge the president has agenda items that he has struggled to get through because of the obstruction from the Democrats and I think that the American people will have a very distinct choice come November congressman do you think that there's anyone on the Left that's been willing to compromise on something like this and give the president and the Republicans it's kind of a victory sure the Democrats there that are in trouble and on the ropes in November are willing to compromise unfortunately they're in a position where they're not able to tell the speaker no I'm gonna vote this way or that way we saw that in the impeachment phase there are a lot of Democrats who hated to vote to impeach the president their armors were twisted they said I've got to do this it's a leadership issue and so I think you'll see come closer to November you'll hear from a lot of Democrats who are campaigning on all their wins working across the aisle it's amazing the closer you get to November the more Democrats you'll find say that they're willing to work with Republicans congressman you mentioned compromise one of the things that could be on the table for compromising Larry Kudlow didn't mention it is the salt deduction because a lot of the members of the House that I've spoken to who were in the Northeast or in California really that's a big issue with their constituents do you think in the compromise spectrum talking about the salt deduction maybe part of the equation it possible but you know it's hard to feel sorry for these states that are just raising taxes and raising taxes I was reading just the other day that in Chicago the Cook County bills are coming out and people are reminded of how high their local taxes are and you're seeing this transfer of wealth and people moving from these high tech states to places like Florida and Texas and I think that you'll see more local opposition to this salt deduction by calling on the Financial Services Committee Josh cotton heimer he and I speak often about it he represents New Jersey it's a big issue there but you'll see Democrats from states in swing from swing districts and states like New Jersey like Josh who I think would be more willing to compromise with Republicans especially the closer we get to November if the president has just rolled out this great tax cut plan come September which is what I'm hearing is the goal do you expect congressman the Democrats in the house to pursue additional investigations against President Trump because they're kind of dueling headlines The Wall Street Journal says Democrats way whether to pursue new investigations as election looms in the New York Times they have Democrats plan to highlight health care and jobs over investigating Trump so which is it you know of course they're going to pursue more they can't let this go much air woman of my committee Maxine Waters was one of the first Democrats to state that if need be we'll investigate the president again and continue to I'm hearing this a lot from Democrats across the aisle they didn't get what they wanted this has not turned out the way they anticipated they thought that an impeached president would be someone who couldn't recover but they didn't take into consideration that once acquitted always acquitted and this president is more popular than he's ever and President Trump is is going on the offensive what Democrats are talking about impeaching him again or continuing investigation the president's talking about getting a tax cut plan rolled out in the coming months and I think that's something that's very different between the Democrats and this president and House Republicans we want to get to work for the American people Democrats want to continue to obstruct the president they cannot think straight because President Trump is in their heads and you'll see that as we go into the campaign cycle what I think the Democrats missed is that six out of ten Americans say they're better off financially now than they were a year ago and that's the highest it's been in twenty years so they kind of that - congressman thank you a final word so I was just gonna say you know even though even the Democrats in some of these swing areas even your your non-political American that maybe they don't like the president maybe they don't like some of his policies at the end of the day they are better off than they were before he took office because they are making money the economy is good the president is doing a fantastic job and I think come November whoever the Democrats whatever far-left individual they nominate to take on the president they will go down in the House will be taken over by Republicans will be in a better place you'll see this text this tax cut rollout it'll pass a republican-led house and the American people will continue to thrive coming up Thank You congressman good to see you

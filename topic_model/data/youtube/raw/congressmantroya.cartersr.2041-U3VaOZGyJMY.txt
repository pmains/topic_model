THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN FROM LOUISIANA IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TIME. MR. CARTER: MADAM SPEAKER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A HUGE THANK YOU TO OUR INCREDIBLE LEADER, MY NEIGHBOR, MY FRIEND, MY COLLEAGUE, MY LEADER, THE HONORABLE CONGRESSWOMAN SHEILA JACKSON LEE, WHO HAS THE PULSE OF OUR COUNTRY FIRMLY IN HER GRIP. I'VE WATCHED THIS WOMAN GO FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE AND WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S PURE. AND WE CAN'T THANK HER ENOUGH. IN RECOGNITION OF THE GREAT WORK SHE DOES, SHE STANDS AT THIS ROST RRVEG UM AND SHE TALKS ABOUT THE ATROCITIES IN OUR COUNTRY WHILE SHE CONTINUES TO FIGHT ATROCITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES. MA'AM, I APPLAUD YOU, I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP. IT'S A PLEASURE TO SERVE WITH YOU, AMERICA IS A BETTER PLACE BECAUSE OF YOU. FOR DECADES, THE C.B.C. HAS FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE, TRUTH, AND EQUALITY. FROM WITHIN THE HALLS OF GOVERNMENT THAT ONCE PERMITTED OUR ANCESTORS TO BE ENSLAVED. CONGRESS AFTER CONGRESS, THE C.B.C. IS AT THE CENTER OF MANY NEGOTIATIONS AND CONVERSATIONS TO BETTER LIVES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE 117TH CONGRESS WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL EXAMPLE OF C.B.C.'S LEADERSHIP. THE C.B.C. LED THE FIGHT FOR THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT ACT SO THAT INSTEAD OF BRIDGES TO THE BRINK AND TOXIC SLUDGE, AMERICANS WILL HAVE RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN, SAFE, RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. TODAY, THE C.B.C. LEADS THE FIGHT TO REDUCE CHILD POVERTY. THROUGH POLICIES LIKE EXPANDED CHILD TAX CREDIT AND SNAP, WE KNOW THAT INSTEAD OF SETTING KIDS UP TO STRUGGLE, WE'RE SETTING THEM UP TO SUCCEED. THROUGH POLICIES LIKE THE BIPARTISAN SAFER COMMUNITIES ACT, WE CAN IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY AND HELP PREVENT TERRIBLE, HATE-DRIVEN CRIMES LIKE WE SAW IN BUFFALO, UVALDE, OR ANY CITY, U.S.A. IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN FAR, FAR TOO OFTEN. IN LOUISIANA, BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF THE C.B.C., AND GREAT LEADERS IN THIS BODY, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE KIDS NOT HAVE TO SIT OUTSIDE OF A MCDONALD'S TO USE THE INTERNET. SINCE KATRINA, SINCE THE HURRICANES THAT HAVE WRECKED OUR COMMUNITIES, SINCE COVID THAT HAS WRECKED OUR WORLD, WE KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE BROADBAND ARE NO LONGER A LUXURY. BUT A NECESSITY. YET IN MANY IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT, PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS. MANY RURAL AREAS WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. TO TELEHEALTH, FOR EDUCATION, FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. FOR EVERYDAY LIFE. FOR SHOPPING. THESE THINGS WOULD NOT EXIST. BUT I'M PROUD TODAY BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF THE BODY AND BECAUSE OF C.B.C., WE'RE ABLE TO DELIVER AND BRING THOSE THINGS HOME TO THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA AND AMERICA. WE KNOW THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT IS NOW SIGNED INTO LAW, LOUISIANA IS SEEING DOLLARS FLOWING THAT THEY'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. BRIDGES THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER ARE BEING REPAIRED. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN NEW ORLEANS, BATON ROUGE, LAKE CHARLES AND BEYOND IS NOW A REALITY. THE ABILITY TO INVEST MONEY IN AREAS IN MY STATE THAT HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH CHEMICAL POISONING HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH DISEASE BECAUSE OF THE PLACEMENT OF THESE FACILITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY SETTLED THEMSELVES IN COMMUNITIES OF BLACK AND BROWN. NO LONGER WILL OUR COMMUNITIES BE THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE. NO LONGER WILL PEOPLE HAVE TO LITERALLY DIE FOR THEIR JOBS. SEE, WE CAN HAVE COEXISTENCE BUT COEXISTENCE BEGINS WITH EVERYONE RECOGNIZING THAT THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT COMMODITY THAT ANYONE HAS IS ITS PEOPLE. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE ENVIRONMENTS, CLEAN ENVIRONMENTS, WHERE OUR CHILDREN CAN BE EDUCATED, WHERE FAMILIES CAN LIVE, WHERE FAMILIES CAN EARN A GOOD LIVING, AND ENJOY CLEAN AIR. THAT'S WHAT WE FIGHT FOR AT THE C.B.C. EVERY DAY. AND LOUISIANA WILL BE THE BENEFICIARIES OF SUCH EFFORTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CAUCUS AND THIS BODY UNDERSTANDS AND NO LONGER LOOKS AWAY AND SAYS BUSINESS AS USUAL. NO LONGER CAN WE AFFORD TO WATCH CHILDREN GO WITHOUT, AS MY DEAR COLLEAGUE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE SAID MOMENTS AGO, MORE MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED IN HBCU'S UNDER THIS 117TH CONGRESS THAN EVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. MORE MONEY HAS BEEN PUT IN INFRASTRUCTURE SINCE THE VERY CREATION OF THE INTERSTATE SYSTEM. UNDER THIS CONGRESS. AND THIS C.B.C. HAS PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN MAKING THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. BUT IT DOESN'T STOP HERE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT. WE MUST CONTINUE TO GO OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE TELL OUR STORY. THAT WE'RE HERE AND WE'RE WORKING AND WE WILL NOT LET ANYONE TURN THE BLOCK BACK ON THE EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT SO VALIANTLY FOR. I'M SO PROUD TO SERVE WITH GIANTS IN THE C.B.C. PEOPLE THAT HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY FOR DECADES TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK YET TO BE DONE. WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIR BEATTY, WHIP CLYBURN AND MANY OTHERS, THE C.B.C. WILL CONTINUE TO SECURE MAJOR WINS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BECAUSE THEY DESERV

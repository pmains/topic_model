how i feel about joe biden i see this guy as a talentless career politician and completely derelict in his duty which is why i've called for him to be impeached one of the things about the republicans kind of frustrating at times is we don't fight we have to fight every single day right now i stand up to the status quo on both parties i have a core set of principles can we preserve this republic it is all on the line it's not easy to fight the fight that patriots fight but it's worth it i'm claudia tenney and i approve this message

after receiving death threats and profane vandalism at her home south carolina congresswoman nancy mace is taking security into her own hands by arming herself she joins us now to discuss congresswoman good to see you this morning i want to pull up some of these photos here of your house after it was vandalized and there was a lot of profanity out there when you saw this tell me tell me your reaction it was shocking when this happened and it feels violating and you know as a member of congress even before then when i was running for congress i had someone vandalize my vehicle my car on one of our debates i've had threats but until those individuals show up at your house it really it doesn't feel as real and when that happened i just i was shocked my neighbors were shocked and worse my kids were shocked about it and it doesn't feel good when you have to look over your shoulder every day worried about what might happen next so you decided to arm yourself to protect you and your children um tell me how your kids feel about all of this because i have to imagine that you know for them it might be alarming they might be scared what has their reaction been so far to you wanting to protect your family well they get it they're in middle school and they still they still got good senses about them they're young enough to understand that that they don't they didn't feel safe when this happened and they were worried and i remember the first day of picking them up after school when this happened and the first thing out of their first question out of their mouth was are we safe and we've had to change our lifestyle quite a bit since it happened to feel safer but they they get it they understand and they understand that that mom's got an important job and she's not going to be threatened and they understand that i want to protect myself and my family and that i won't be intimidated these are really tough lessons to learn at a top age and they're learning them right now and so how does it feel now to you know be able to carry out the second amendment and to to be able to have access to a firearm and to work to get your permits and to be able to have that power in your hands i will tell you that i learned that it's very empowering to know that i can defend myself and my family and my beliefs if i have to and so it was a critical decision and i i got my concealed carry permit at the end of the year but didn't feel the need to use until someone showed up at my on my front steps and i'm so glad and grateful that i have it have the opportunity to be able to carry a gun just about wherever i go it's important um but the biggest thing for me is feeling safe and feeling empowered now before we let you go i want to talk to you about this and we can go ahead and pull up this poll here this is a poll on americans view of biden's handling of the crime wave and you can see this is an abc news washington post poll 48 of people disapprove of the president's response to this recent crime wave 28 say it's an extremely serious problem that on top of gun control policies you know where does all of this take us in 2022 because i think americans are at a crossroads right now where they really have to figure out what's important to them well i can tell you this much republicans will be running on inflation and tax increases by the left and they'll be running on the violence we've seen over the course of the last year and jillian that you mentioned earlier on the on the program that the numbers that have spiked over the last 12 months the violence all across the country and cities small and large across the country and the biden administration's answer to that is gun control which isn't going to fly with most of america with families like myself that want to protect themselves from the increase in violence the worst thing we could do is make our laws tougher for legal law-abiding law-abiding citizens to be able to legally obtain a firearm to protect themselves and their families that's not going to fly with the american people congresswoman nancy mace i've met you in person you are very sweet but i know you're a tough cookie so i'm not going to come knocking at your door thank you for joining us though i appreciate it

you do that we want to make sure that we have a congressional representative that understands these neighborhoods that understands our concerns and listens when we call his mind is alert his heart is sensitive to our people and all workers all nationalities he's someone who connects with the community he knows the community he knows the issues that everyone faces so he has a lot of elements that makes them appeal to a lot of people i will always support the aspirations of families who have come here who are making their way towards the american dream what is going on in washington has been a disaster i think we can all agree on that and as a nation as a community as a people from wherever we are that we deserve better and i look forward to serving congress next year thank you very much you

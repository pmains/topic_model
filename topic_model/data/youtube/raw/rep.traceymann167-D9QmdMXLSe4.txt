uh thank you mr chairman and mr secretary thank you for being here uh this morning i appreciated uh congressman cloud's comments and questions about the vaccine mandates a couple questions ago and what they're doing to our fsa offices in kansas and uh and the inability to deliver services so so thank you for for that and attention there i represent the big first district of kansas which is the third largest ag producing district um in the country by dollars international trade is a key component economic growth and recovery uh mr secretary just two years ago china made a deal with the united states the phase one china trade deal to import 36 billion dollars worth of u.s ag products in 2020 and 2021 as you know china failed to meet that commitment uh by close to seven billion dollars that's 20 percent against seven billion dollars it feels like china sold america bill of goods and that my administration has made no effort to rectify the situation by refusing to hold china accountable the bite administration is hurting all american farmers ranchers and producers from wheat farmers in kansas to rice growers in california a few weeks ago i understand you sit on a stage in a room full of producers that acknowledge that china fell short on their end of the deal and in response to our concerns you said but here's the deal with our chinese friends they're light on what they've committed to purchase and that's why ambassador thai our u.s trade representative continues to converse with china about the necessity of living up totally and completely to the phase 1 trade agreement making up that deficit over the next several years the next several years was never part of this two-year deal which that we're now at the end of china said they would purchase a certain amount of ag products and they didn't um mr and my question is you know i joined farmers and ranchers and they're concerned about this trade deficit with china and and with your remarks what should i tell kansans about how you ambassador ty and president biden are taking immediate action to hold china accountable so they buy our ag products and put upward pressure on prices well i think your constituents uh should be reminded that we have a record year in ag exports uh a record that was set in 2013 when i was secretary before was surpassed this year uh or last year in 2021 and it's expected to anticipate that that record will be broken again this year so that you can talk about the fact that there have been two record years of ag exports which is one of the reasons why commodity prices across the board are significantly stronger and higher than they were a year ago today secondly you can tell folks that people are that there is an ongoing negotiation with china uh i don't know where your figures are coming from but my figures say that they are 16 billion dollars light and they are also light on seven very important uh sanitary and phyto-sanitary barriers uh and so we are giving uh china we're putting them on notice that this is something that we want them to live up to the phase one agreement uh we want our mexican friends to live up to usmca we want our canadian friends to live up to you at usmca we want our trading partners to live up to agreements and so the first and foremost program and step here is to indicate our focus on trade enforcement the uh on the input side the other big issue that i constantly hear from our producers is we've seen a four to five times increase in fertilizer cost dramatically increasing input costs for producers here as we're starting to head into the spring i know that you were asking about this earlier and i think the response was that that we should tell producers to uh to decrease the use of fertilizer that's not going to cut it for my producers who have had plans in place and crop rotations and such for years a lot of this is comes down to decreasing uh import you know china's no longer exporting fertilizer like they were what do we do there what should we tell farmers and how do we improve and really decrease input prices as we're about to see our producers get squeezed their margins are going to be squeezed greatly if we don't do something well we've been historically opposed to export controls and we'll continue to be historically opposed to export controls number one number two i think it is important and necessary as farmers understand and learn more about precision agriculture we're going to see farmers understand and appreciate the importance and opportunity to actually produce more with less this is not a suggestion where you simply eliminate the utilization of fertilizer this is a suggestion where you understand and appreciate where it needs to be applied right place right time right amount i agree and a lot of my producers have done that done that for deck for a long long time but they still have to buy fertilizer this year the time of the

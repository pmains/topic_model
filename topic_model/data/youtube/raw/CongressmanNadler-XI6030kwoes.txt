thank you mr speaker mr speaker sometimes events occur that are so out of the ordinary so unusual as to defy belief such as the decision of the speaker last night not to permit this house to vote on relief on aid for the three states and some other areas that were devastated by hurricane sandy i've been in this house for 20 years there have been many disasters floods hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires in every single instance this house is voted aid for the appropriate for the necessary states in every single instance usually within a week or two never more than three it has now been nine weeks since october 29th when hurricane sandy devastated three states and parts of moore nine weeks the senate passed the bill to aid us the house was ready the bill was prepared an amendment was prepared we were assured the bill would be on the floor last night or today the last minute the speaker without even talking to republicans or not to mention democrats from new york refusing to meet with them suddenly pulled the bill and said we wouldn't have a vote as if the people in new york and connecticut and pennsylvania and new jersey are not in aid as if thousands of people are still not without heat without water as if thousands of small businesses don't need loans and aids so that they don't go under is if thousands of people do not need help to rebuild their homes to clear their trash from their properties as if hundreds of municipalities don't need aid to finance this activity having used up all their budgets for that purpose we're told by the chairman of the appropriations committee we'll get a bill on the floor later this month in the next congress it's already nine weeks it's already an unprecedented length of time and why are new yorkers and pennsylvanians and connecticut residents and new jersey residents less americans than the people that we ate in the midwest and the south when when when we vote for aid for those people because they are the victims of natural disasters how can we treat an entire region of the country this way it is the most disgraceful action i've seen in this house in the 20 years i've been here i see that we're told that well fema still has money until march but it's not just fema it's a small business administration that needs the appropriation now to help small businesses now it's the army corps of engineers that needs the authorization the appropriation now to help the municipalities and help the the people who are victimized there is no excuse for this none it is a betrayal of the people of those states it is a betrayal of the people of the united states it is a betrayal by the speaker personally of the members of this house not to permit a vote i've never seen an action like it i hope i never see it again i urge the speaker to reconsider and to rectify this decision today because today is the deadline to avert going down in history as shameful i yield back

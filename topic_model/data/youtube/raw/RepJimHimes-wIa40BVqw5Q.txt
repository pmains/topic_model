Thank You mr. chairman and thank you gentlemen for being with us today and I hope you'll convey us with my thanks to the dedicated people that did you lead in your organization's I know those people have suffered a blow to their morale as a result of the disclosures that we've been talking about for a long time and while the route by which we got to this discussion was awful involving a clear violation of US law and almost certainly putting Americans at risk I do believe it's an important conversation for a democracy to half as painful as it may be given the circumstance I also reject that it is simply a PR exercise in convincing Americans at all as well if they just understood what was going on this is complicated stuff forget what we say and do to federal judges have ruled in opposite directions on the legality of the 215 metadata program the privacy civil liberties oversight board but 322 on the legality and constitutionality of is this is a good debate which I want to set aside for the moment in favor of a question of utility of the 215 metadata program uh also an area in which there's been a great deal of misinformation stories initially propagated by some of my colleagues that 70 events were disrupted that very rapidly became single digits maybe one two or three a director Comey question for you and testimony in the Senate and an answer to a question by Senator King you said for the FBI the primary value of this program is agility that is it allows us to do in minutes what would otherwise take us hours and my question is is that the strongest defense of the utility of the 215 metadata program that can be mounted or is there something else here we should keep in mind no it is the primary utility for the FBI from our perspective its agility is its greatest value it's a useful tool for that reason I might add that I think as I've said said before I don't think plots foiled is necessarily the only metric that could be used as to the potential value of the section 215 metadata which is an important tool last summer when we the number of diplomatic facilities in the Mideast that were closed because of what appeared to be potential to terrorist threats it turned up some number of selectors that pointed in the direction of the United States so using this tool we're able to eliminate the fact that there was no tariffs and there was no Tara domestic plotting going on so there is that at least in my mind that additional metric apartment the pure plots foiled and of course the program was conceived as a result of 911 and the inability to track a foreign communicant who is communicating with someone in the United States so it's kind of a maybe low probability but potentially very high impact to tool Thank you Thank You director copper I'd like to follow up if you want a different topic we touched on it yesterday in closed session pertaining to Iran and the agreement to p5 plus 1 agreement are we seeing compliance on the part of Iran with respect to their obligations under that agreement or put another way are we seeing evony any evidence of non-compliance so far they are complying with with the agreement and the evidence of that is in the initial IAEA declaration of their compliance with the provisions of the jpoa that's not to say they won't take advantage of that which is not prohibited they will and certainly the combination of the more intrusive IAEA inspections in surveillance coupled with what we're able to do now we'll be watching for that yeah thank you um do we have intelligence which suggests that the regime is in any way not acting in good faith at this point any sort of collection which would suggest that there is deception or amount no point to any I'm the director clapper you uh you said told senator King and over on the Senate side uh your opinion that right now the imposition of more sanctions would be counterproductive let me ask a slightly different question the president the State of the Union obviously said he would veto sanctions so that's that's likely off the table but what about resolutions or other measures that were to come out of the Congress threatening additional sanctions how would you feel about that was a as i said to senator King when he asked the question of the Iranians are students of us and our government they clearly understand how the system works here and so from their vantage I think right now additional imposition additional additional sanctions would be a poke poke in the eye and they understand the implicit threat is there any way if the Congress decides they're not in for whatever reason not a compliance and they want to impose more sanctions so it was kind of a policy thing but I think from the Iranian perspective right now since they do appear to be complying with the provisions of the jpoa would would hold that that possibility and reserve do director khabar do the Iranians believe currently that if there were a violation that the United States government would be very serious and very rapid in imposing additional sanctions well there are as there are various opinion pockets in this country about things so are there in Iran so it's very hard I don't think there's a monolithic view in the among the Iranian decision makers about that great I thank you I see my time is up but thank you very much for appearing and for all that you do at mr.

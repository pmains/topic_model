Hey just reminding us that if we don't have good help we don't have access to health care it's pretty hard to be happy at least for a lifetime so I say that it's sort of a preface mr. president oh I didn't want to say it say it now is not everybody who's eligible for health care who needs health care is covered we got a lot of people get their health care from employer-provided plans we got throughout thrown it 300 million people at all who get health care coverage in this country half of them from employer-provided planned about 25% from Medicaid about 15% from Medicare and there's about another 10% that in some cases don't have any coverage about twenty million people have no coverage we have a lot of people who now get their coverage from the exchanges every state has their own health care exchange or marketplace a lot of people are getting their health their health care a bunch of people also use federally qualified community health centers in States and the on the East Coast and the Midwest and across American further you have where they have ten cents or ten hundred ten thousand dollars you can get health care at these places and that's good but a lot of people who could sign up and get their health care in the marketplaces in each thing don't know about and there's an opportunity to enroll in the marketplaces and get their health care coverage by midnight on this coming Sunday on December 15th and I just want to spend a couple of minutes reminding people to do that who don't have coverage and it tell them why it's a good deal for them and for their families there's some good news here and so the good news is that all across our country folks have four more days to to sign up and there's also some more good news and that is that after going up up up up four years the cost of premiums and the exchanges in marketplaces actually obnoxious year in most marketplaces are think of the average reduction about Prima's grandma about 4% and for the next year and in more than a half dozen states premiums are coming down by double digit rates of inflation Delaware our cost to health care in our marketplace starting in the for coverage beginning January 1 is down by 19% and what's happening here is after see a number of years where health care providers insurers rather health care insurance we're dropping out of the business of offering coverage in the marketplaces they're starting to offer coverage again 23 insurers offered coverage in States this year that those insurers hadn't been offering coverage beginning January 1 I think it's about 45 more we'll start offering a coverage and that means we're gonna have some competition for customers for folks who need insurance and that competition will help create what I call a virtuous circle or a virtuous cycle and help bring cost down even more more choices more competition that is a good thing for our consumers and states across America but wait there's there's more and this year three out of four customers can find a plan for less than ready for this seventy-five bucks per month think about that three out of four customers can find a plan on the marketplaces the new exchanges for less than 75 bucks a month and you some people may be wondering if the Affordable Care Act the marketplaces is the right choice for you or your loved ones that's a good question to ask the marketplaces provide quality affordable health care coverage for Americans who don't receive affordable health insurance through their employer for instance last Friday other which a couple of people that like to have been talking to in my state just in the last week or so about health care coverage last Friday is down a place called Lewes Delaware which was first colonized by the Dutch 400 years ago it's the first town in the first state Lewes Delaware I met there a fella who's a self-employed artist his name is G W Thompson and his life was forever changed by the Affordable Care Act when he was able to find affordable and comprehensive health insurance and if for folks that are waiting to start a business and meet health care insurance I would encourage you to do this visit healthcare.gov I'll say it again healthcare.gov today find a plan that works for you got plenty of choices earlier this year I met a widow in Delaware named Marie and she lives with a pre-existing condition as it turns out there are tens of millions of people in this country who live with pre-existing conditions and for many many years they didn't have access to health care because they had a pre-existing condition that's not the case anymore the folks who do have a pre-existing condition they can get access to health care and thanks for the excellent staff at a place called Westside Family Healthcare that's what her Feli federally qualified community health centers and that they have a great bike place in in Dover but anyway Maria was able to go there and enroll in an ACA plan that covers her pre-existing condition and helps to keep her happy I mean you say that the folks across the country if you are one of 133 million Americans leaving living with a pre-existing condition I urge you to visit again healthcare.gov call care.gov find a plan that works for you if you are a young person who's just turned 26 and could no longer stay on your parents health plan visit healthcare.gov today and find a plan that works for you if you or your family have tried to enroll in Medicaid but did not qualify visit healthcare.gov today and find a plan that works for you and don't forget nearly nine out of ten customers are eligible for financial help which could mean a big savings for you and your family but to that line I've said this before I'm going to say it again maybe a couple of times but the deadline to enroll and the affordable under the one new marketplaces in your state in is this Sunday it's a Sunday at midnight so you got four days and depending on which time is on you over then maybe close to six hours in order to sign up don't wait another day though sign up today go to healthcare.gov now through this Sunday December 15th to shop for a plan that will give you and your family covered through 2020 you sign up sign up before the by midnight this Sunday and you have coverage beginning January 1 through 2 7 31st of next year I know there are a lot of things that always have to get done before the end of the year this is one that I think is too important to miss too important to miss so one more time visit healthcare.gov today to find health care coverage that works for your family's needs and your budget regardless of what state you live in if you have no coverage and mr. president I want to end this by saying since the Affordable Care Act was enacted we've seen some not all but some of our Republican friends here in the biz body and across the country dude they're dead level best to undermine the Affordable Care Act those efforts ramped up considerably under the current administration when the president and 18 Republican attorneys general had gone so far as to file a lawsuit that attempts to scrap the health care law in its entirety that lawsuit is working its way through the courts now but it's important for everyone to know despite these efforts to sabotage our nation's health care law the Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land and if you want to sign up for coverage before next year you can still do that until midnight on Sunday so I don't think there's a reason not to sign up and I would urge anybody who's out there listening watching you don't have coverage let's do it don't today and you'll be glad you did and the the idea of life liberty and pursuit of happiness will be a little bit close to being realized for you and with that mr. president I yield the floor

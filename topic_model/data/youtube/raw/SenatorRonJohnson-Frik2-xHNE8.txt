all right joining us now to discuss this is Senator Ron Johnson republican of wisconsin he also is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee senator Johnson thanks for joining us this morning Marty Jim how you doing doing well now you just heard what President Trump said in last night's rally in Pennsylvania North Korea's quote thinking about denuclearizing but quote who knows what's going to happen is that enough of an insurance for you for the president to sit down with Kim jong-un is that is that enough well president Trump has have been engaged in the maximum pressure campaign and I joined in a letter with five other my Republican Senate colleagues encouraging President Trump to make sure to maintain that maximum pressure until we find C complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization within North Korea so what we can't well we can't do is we can't do what we did with Iran and let off the pressure and then just watch the behavior go in the wrong direction so again it's just incredibly important to keep R at you know compete I would say ratchet up the sanctions against North Korea until they actually do in a verifiable fashion denuclearize okay now North Korea has backed out of promises before 1994 they promised end their nuclear program but they were found later in violation of that in 2005 they agreed to give up their nuclear program but they started up again next year they tested their first bomb and then in 2012 they said they would stop testing but later launched a satellite is the president just being naive here let's hope not again you have that history let's not be snookered again let's not be Charlie Brown to North Korea's Lucy we've seen this movie before that's why we've called on president Truong to make sure we maintain the maximum pressure campaign if anything I would continue to ratchet up sanctions until they again have complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization isn't it possible they would back out of the talks before they even happen if you ratchet up sanctions I was like the president wants to have this conversation well again if you listen to members of his administration they they're pretty level-headed from a standpoint of we need to make sure that we continue to maintain that pressure and from my standpoint content the pressure will bring North Korea to the table and more in good-faith negotiations and the president also said quote we have to be very nice to Kim jong-eun this is a dictator who has murdered untold numbers of people what do you think the president is going to accomplish by being nice to Kim Jong hoon probably not a whole lot what we need to do is maintain that pressure we have to recognize the heinous acts committed by Kim Jong hyung and again maintain the maximum pressure it's it's it's that simple and I'm just I'm just correct me if I'm wrong here senator I'm sensing from your voice that you're not so sure this is a good idea sitting down with Kim jong-un you think it's a good idea you know I think talking to people is never a bad idea as long as you maintain that pressure I've never quite understood you know that the enormous diplomatic gain by just sitting down and talked to somebody as long as you maintain the pressure so I'd rather talk to people to prevent any kind of miscalculation and let's face it miscalculation on the Korean Peninsula could be devastating so I don't have a problem in in talking to people but we have to maintain isn't talking to people this is talking about kim jeong-hoon this is yeah this is a very different ballgame well again I think the maximum pressure campaign is having its affect you we need isolate North Korea they say they're self-sufficient well what we're putting in the position where they're gonna have to prove self-sufficiency and of course they're not and I think that maximum pressure campaign is a bringing kim jeong-hoon to the table first time hopefully in good faith all right well and I want to talk about these new tariffs that the president announced on steel and aluminum you've expressed your opposition to this it obviously could affect the economy in Wisconsin and your fellow Republican Senator Jeff Flake has gone so far as to threaten congressional action to nullify all of this would you sign on to that would you support that I would but I doubt it have any chance of passing or and even if passed that we'd have the votes to override the veto you know what's unfortunate Jim is in Wisconsin I just traveled the last two days talking to all kinds of folks confidence had really been building we stopped increasing the regulatory burden actually started reducing the regulatory burden we made American businesses more competitive we gave real tax cuts to two scoffs nice and Americans there's really growing level of optimism because we were returning certainty to the American and Wisconsin economy and you know the talk of canceling NAFTA and now imposing these steel tariffs have just interjected uncertainty into the economy were just wasn't necessary so I'm really concerned that this is a counter counterproductive as well as you could really result in retaliatory actions by our trade partners and again it just injects uncertainty to an economy that was really doing quite well and I want to get back to this rally that we saw last night the president was in rare form or perhaps not so rare form take a listen to the president making the case for the death penalty for drug dealers let's listen to this when I was in China and other places by the way I said mr. president do you have a drug problem no no we do not I said huh big country 1.4 billion people right not much of a drug problem I said what do you tribute that to well the death penalty is honestly I don't know that the United States frankly is ready for it they should be ready for now the death penalty for drug dealers is that something that you agree with and meninas lead when it comes to criminal justice I would say we probably should not be shining or following China's leading becomes criminal justice you know I'm a support of the death penalty but only when in in those types of instances where we absolutely are 100 percent certain that the person is one harm percent guilty I'm not sure it'd be applicable to drug offenses and the NRA assuming the state of Florida to block a new law that the governor just signed there Rick Scott that would raise the legal age to buy all guns to 21 years old the nra saying that it violates the constitutional rights of 18 to 21 year old people what do you make of that do you feel like that this law violates the Second Amendment how far should the law go in that regard I would not support the law you know we send our sons and daughters over to Afghanistan in Iraq the defend our freedoms I think if if we you know if they do that they ought to be able to have the right to buy a hunting rifle without an ar-15 in law an ar-15 - 18 year-old for they are 15 that's okay I I think we ought to do is we ought to really detail what the operational characteristics are of weapons rather than just a scary name or a gun that looks a little bit scarier there plenty of hunting weapons that basically have the same operational characteristics let's define the operational characteristics and it's already illegal to have a fully automatic weapon it's illegal to convert a legal weapon into an automatic weapon so I would much rather concentrate on verifiable operational characteristics and then we could evaluate the weapons based on that okay Senator Ron Johnson thanks so much for joining us this morning we appreciate it have a great day our YouTube thank you sir a

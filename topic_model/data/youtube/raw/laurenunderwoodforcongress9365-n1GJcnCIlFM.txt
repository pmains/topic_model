I grew up right here in Naperville Illinois it's here where I first gained an understanding of the importance of community service as a girl scout began the education that helped me become a registered nurse and it was here that I learned to be the independent thinker and leader I am today when I was in elementary school I was diagnosed with a pre-existing condition it's a heart condition during the course of treatment it inspired me to have a career in health care as a nurse i spent my career expanding access to health care services for communities across our country as both a career federal employee and as an appointee and the obama administration I've worked on a variety of policy challenges and worked in public health emergencies and disasters issues like Ebola and Zika and the water crisis affect a representative is supposed to be transparent and honest about their votes they're supposed to be accessible to the community and ultimately accountable to us to the voters we just need to have representatives who make it a priority to have the backs of the families in this community there's something to fight for to hope for to work towards if we as a society don't invest in each other right then what do we have we don't have to be divided in order to protect our health care coverage nurses don't have a choice we get results we make progress or people suffer it's time that we really fix our healthcare system and I believe that we need to have a nurse at the table to do so I'm Lauren Underwood and I approve this message

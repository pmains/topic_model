okay I'd like to bring this uh state of the steel caucus uh state of Steel meeting to order and begin the process so first I want to thank all of you for joining us today we will open up with opening statements where Congressman boss co-chair the steel caucus will start I first would like to thank the veteran affairs committee for allowing us to use this honorable room I also would like to thank the staff who put this all together and worked extremely hard for months to be able to bring us together to be able to talk about the industry that we all put our time energy and love into and I'd like to thank all of you for what you do in the steel industry and for the economy of the United States and from my region with that I'd like to recognize Congressman Vost for his opening statement thank you chairman um first off I I do want to welcome everybody here but uh I feel like this is deja vu yesterday we were in a markup in this room for the entire day so I feel like I'm right back in the same seat that I just left um but you know you know there's difficult these are difficult times for many people across the nation and the steel industry and its workers uh are no exception the steel industry is vital and vitally important to Southern Illinois my Southern Illinois District as well as a nation as a whole your industry provides tens of thousands of job good paying jobs and manufactures the materials that help us build America foreign steel competitors have destroyed distorted the market by flooding it with unfairly traded steel Imports many of these products are products by non-market economies that produce and sell steel at below fair market value while China is the worst offender many other nations including the including close U.S allies are also engaged in unfair Trade Practices I was pleased that the administration had agreed to continue all nine of the anti-dumping and contravailing Duty orders on corrosive resistant steels the International Trade Commission is scheduled to vote today on cold rolled steel and anti-dumping and countervailing Duty orders it is my hope that the vote has a similar outcome to the core vote these orders and the current 232 and 301 tariffs play critical roles in leveling the playing field in American seal workers and companies last year through the caucus leadership the house was able to include additional funding for additional office for anti-dumping contravailing duties and investigations countries like China continue to try and find new ways to evade dumping tariffs and add the global access supply of Steel any future deals must maintain strong guard posts against China's ability to use other nations to do their own to to for their own game now is not the time to decrease the growth of American steel industry we have a steel industry that is recovering and using the protection of the anti-dumping and Canterbury Lane Duty orders to revisit it's in itself the foundation of our industry is stable but it needs time to set we cannot upend the product protection from unfair trade now enforce domestic Industries to watch new cracks form domestic steel companies continue to need the protection of anti-dumping and countervailing Duty orders when American taxpayer dollars are being spent we are we must prioritize spending them on products manufactured by the American workers using American Materials this is not this will not only help the American steel industry but will also help workers in related Industries who are struggling from the current supply chain and backlogs I'd like to thank you all for being here and giving witnessing testimony today each one of you know that I have been involved in this since I first came to Congress it is a vitally important issue of mine through a remap U.S steel uh and and of course and some other changes I will still continue to work on this committee and work on the vitally important issue regardless of where my district is and uh who uh I represent but I know for a fact that your industry is vitally important to this nation and we'll do everything we can to make sure that whether it's Republican Or democrats that we're fighting for you to make sure your people are working and making sure these American jobs are staying right here so with that I yield back thank you Vice chair Congressman Bost at this time I'd like to recognize Vice chair Congressman Crawford please thank you Mr chairman good morning to you all appreciate you being here today and I'm glad we're finally able to have this again after a two-year Hiatus I want to thank our steel industry friends who made being here a priority it's your perspective that helps inform Congress and I want to keep my comments short so we can give our Witnesses time to speak since I've been in Congress I've had the privilege several times to visit with many of you it might be tempting for me to say that I'm already very familiar with your concerns I know what you're concerned about trade infrastructure regulations this time around it's a little bit different since the last time we met we're currently weathering an economic storm with record inflation on Goods Transportation virtually everything you need to do business and that's certainly new since the last time we held this meeting in 2020. today I hope to learn how we as a steel caucus leadership can continue to be your advocates in Congress and to make sure the administration knows exactly what your perspective is and how you can remain competitive here in America and on the international age I'm thrilled to represent so many of your companies and your employees in the first district of Arkansas including the soon to be largest steel producing County in the nation we appreciate you being here today thank you and I yield back thank you Vice chair Crawford at this time I recognize myself I also am going to submit my remarks and keep it to the point so we can hear from yourself but ultimately I represent Gary Indiana the top producing steel region in the nation and today is all about making sure those hundreds of thousands of jobs and the economic development that you provide along with the National Security and interest of National Security when it comes to the steel industry so we do have an infrastructure Bill a bipartisan infrastructure Bill where Washington needs to get those dollars into the community so that you could start producing Steel in order to fulfill those orders we also need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to have a bipartisan uh the bipartisan uh uh competes Act pass and as far as the national security issue making sure that the semiconductors and the chips are being made in the United States that allows for the Auto industry the appliance industry the defense industry to be able to be productive and so we will continue to advocate for that and as a member of Congress on my third day my predecessor congressman bislowski who had dedicated himself to the steel industry into the United Steel Workers allowed me and gave me the opportunity through his leadership to be a co-chair of this caucus and since then we made sure that we worked in a bipartisan effort to bring a section 232 to fight for the administration to keep that in place to protect the steel industry and 301 and those tariffs to protect us from over capacity and governments that dump steel and lower the market value and so we'll continue to fight for that and as a member of Congress I've testified in front of the International Trade Commission five times to make sure that we have strong trade deals and to make sure that the internet National Trade Commission has the resources necessary to be able to provide those protections so trade and allowing for economic development and investment over the last two years in the Steel Industries are very important so what we do today is important because we're bringing together labor government and Industry in order to be able to provide results so ultimately I'm very thankful that you've made this time and I am uh my priority is to leave here today knowing what the future of Steel will be and what your perspective on that will be and all of us collectively in a bipartisan effort making sure that we are tackling those issues to provide for families and in closing my grandfather came over from Czechoslovakia worked at Inland steel That Was Then arsler middle which is now Cleveland Cliffs for 53 years in my community in my district steel touches hundreds of thousands of lives and so I have a friend here Danny franovich who owns a downstream industry it's called crown e-ram and he provides power services and electrical services for Mills but he provides work for 53 families and he invested his life Fortune into that company and I also was able to when Tom Conway and I kicked off the infrastructure bill for the steel workers to make sure that people were rallying behind it we knew the importance of it I was able to high five a 10 year old girl who was a daughter of a steel worker her name was stormy who wanted to be a steel worker so it's about those future jobs also so today let's be focused on making sure we come together when it's government Labor and Industry and providing for a future for those families so I thank you very much at this time I'd like to recognize Conor lamb for opening remarks thank you Mr mirvan I'm just going to waive the majority of of the opening we're here to hear from the witnesses primarily but let me just say welcome back it's really nice to see you all in person I know it's been a little while since we've been able to do that this way and I'll look forward to the the question and answers thank you and with that I would like to thank you uh co-chair Connor lamb Congressman lamb I'd like to represent uh president uh Tom Conway Thomas Conway was elected to the international executive board to succeed retiring International president Leo Gerard as leader of the United steelworkers the largest industrial Union in North America effectively July 15 2019 and was re-elected to a full term in 2021. Mr Conway grew up in a union family in New Jersey his father was an active member in the international Union of operating engineers his mother worked in a brush Factory where she successfully organized a union and negotiated labor contracts after serving four years in the United States Air Force and attending trade school for the airframe and power plant mechanics Mr Conway was recruited by Bethlehem Steel in 1978 to work at its Burns Harbor Works along Lake Michigan in Northwest Indiana he joined the local 67-87 of the usw which is in my district and quickly became a union activist he was since he has since testified numerous times before Congress the International Trade Commission and a steel caucus and has become the Union's most experienced contractor negotiator it is my pleasure my pleasure to welcome Mr Conway to the steel caucus again Mr Conway thank you Congressman Revenge I didn't know you guys had that bio um greetings chairman Lambert Boston Crawford and I want to thank you for your continued stewardship of one of the most influential caucuses in Congress it's an honor to speak with you this morning I've been a steel worker for nearly 44 years now starting out making steel in Northwest Indiana and since working to help ensure our members can safely produce millions and tons of steel every year with good wages and good benefits and that that's why I can say with confidence um that through the fair bargaining process with many of the people beside me here at this table we're going to be able to reach good collective bargaining agreements by September 1st the reason we can approach this bargaining session with an eye towards cooperation and not a confrontation like our many but Washington DC has played a role and we want to continue that cooperation between Labor Management and it's important that Congress and our government take a leadership over its responsibility ensuring Fair competition and although our country in the world's economy are being stressed in really significant ways the fundamentals of the domestic steel industry are strong because of cooperation between industry government and labor for example the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law will add 40 to 50 million tons of steel demand over the course of the next five years and congress's edition of the build America by America or Baba Provisions require that all federally financed infrastructure projects used American-made Iron and Steel we see immense possibility through increasing domestic Iron and Steel procurement for example the Department of Housing and Urban Development just one account at HUD spends over 400 million dollars annually on clean water and drinking water and materials such as pipe and sewer pipe two other agencies already ensure U.S workers get a first shot at making those materials so it's time to harmonize our procurement rules using Baba to maximize domestic jobs we also need to expand clean technology manufacturing to create opportunity and demand for steel products whether it's in a windmill or an EV charging station or everything else in between steel will be needed at the same time the path forward to reducing emissions means respecting the importance of the current productive capacity and incentivize the deployment and new technologies and techniques and steel making to keep us cleaner than our Global competition at the same time we cannot let our guard down an international trade distilled aluminum 232s and the 301 tariffs on China when combined with effective dumping and countervailing Duty laws have proven effective at keeping Global excess steel capacity at Bay yet the globe is still a wash in excess capacity to the tune of over 500 million tons we need long-term Solutions that's why I'm encouraged by the global Arrangement on steel and aluminum between the U.S and the European Union these negotiations have the possibility of creating a larger block to restrict access of dirty steel and Congress should do everything it can to support that success Congress also needs to update our trade laws we haven't updated our trade laws that protect Americans jobs in seven years foreign governments and importers have gotten creative in invading U.S duties that's why the usw is supportive of rep representative Sewell and Johnson's bipartisan level of playing field act 2.0 and encourage every member to steal caucus to co-sponsor that legislation this is important that over 90 million tons of new integrated capacity much of it funded by Chinese producers will come online and explode carbon emissions by over three times in Southeast Asia this is why the steel caucus pay close attention to the indo-pacific economic framework that the administration is currently negotiating usw is not going to settle for anything less than a good agreement encourages Congress to push for strong pro-worker framework finally the workers in the sectors need strong safety net too workers in import sensitive Industries like steel have benefited from robust job training programs like TAA the program is set to expire in September and it would be a failure Congress to let a program where over a hundred thousand workers qualified last year and most of whom worked in manufacturing Global and domestic events have made America's future uncertain our Union sees a pathway through that uncertainty by everyone here looking to each other in the eye and agreeing to a fair bargain labor and management do it every contract I encourage Congress to work with us to do the same and thank you and I look forward to any questions thank you president Conway at this time I'd like to recognize representative lamb to introduce our next speaker uh thank you I'm now pleased to introduce Mr Lorenzo Gonzalez Mr Gonzalez has been chairman president and CEO of Cleveland Cliffs since August 2014. he designed and led the company through a strategic transformation including its Acquisitions of AK Steel and Arsenal middle USA Mr Gonzalez has been in the industry for many years has testified at this hearing many times he's previously been chairman of the board president and CEO of Metals USA Holdings president CEO of California Steel Industries he's won several Awards earned a master of science degree from the federal University in Bello Horizonte Brazil and a bachelor's degree in metallurgical engineering from the Military Institute of Engineering in Rio De Janeiro Brazil I also have to say Cliffs had several of us up to its Butler locate education sometime last year for what I think is one of the most interesting presentations I've received as a member of Congress really just about what grain oriented electrical steel actually is and how it works and why it's so important to so many of the things that we do so I want to I don't think I've seen you since then but I just wanted to thank you for making that available to us because your folks really did a tremendous job and with that we welcome you back to the steel hearing good morning uh cool Vice chairman Boston Crawford uh good morning all other members of this dual caucus uh I'm very pleased to be here representing the 27 000 employees of Cleveland Cliffs uh we acquired all these companies that you mentioned uh chairman lamp and uh different from what normally happens instead of uh shrinking down and reducing employment we have grown for by by blips and Bounds we increased our Workforce by more than 5 000 people since the Acquisitions took place I lost testify before this caucus in March of 2020 just days before the start of covid lockdowns since that time we have acquired two steel companies in case you and also let me tell you essay and a major processor of scrap metal named ferrous processing and Trading Company we also complete the construction of a state-of-the-art direct reduction plant the first of its kind in the Midwest of the United States that's a one billion dollars investment in Toledo Ohio concluded in December of 2020. with these Investments Cleveland Cliffs has transformed itself from a Pure Play Iron War Mining Company into the largest producer of flat rolled steel in North America and the largest supplier of Steel for the automotive industry I had one point in the largest supplier of Steel of each car manufacturer that is now moving from internal combusting engines to electric vehicles each one of them we are the largest supplier with these Investments Cleveland Clips has transformed itself from this type of a major supplier of Automotive steel we provide employment for approximately 27 000 people with over 20 000 employees represented by unions including the United Steel Workers the United Auto Workers and the International Association of Machinists rather than deliver the same speech you have heard time and time again about the need of a Level Playing Field and other tired references I'm going to address a few key points that relate to the future of the domestic steel industry and how our success can influence the Midwest in the American society as a whole first we have right now a real opportunity to reverse the misguided 30-plus year old failure called globalization and we can only do that by rebuilding the American manufacturing sector over the past two years the United States has experienced two painful lessons in over-reliance on other countries the covet pandemic in Russia's war in Ukraine the pandemic resulted in the realization by the broader society that the United States has outsourced into China and to other nations the production of goods and materials needed for the health of our people in the basic functioning of our economy backlogged ports Trucking shortages and Customs delays were not the cause of supply chain problems but rather symptoms of the Relentless and systematic Outsourcing of American Manufacturing the second lesson came with Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the green realization that a conventional shooting war between Global superpowers is a never-present threat the promise that unrestrained free trade would lead to a lasting globe of peace is a farce the invasion was undeniable evidence of the Strategic realignment of the world with the United States and its allies on the side of democratic values and with Russia and China using unbridled aggression to grow territory suppress descent and commit human rights abuses the underlying truth is simple China and Russia want to stay claim claim to America's Global influence they are not our trading partners or consumer markets to be tapped by American companies they are first and foremost superpowers competing against the United States if the United States is to continue to serve as the world's most influential leader we must reclaim control of our manufacturing base sell another way giving up our manufacturing base as we have been doing for more than 30 years now is equivalent to yielding power to our enemies in the wake of the hard Lessons Learned in the last two years a number of companies are finally considering making investments in domestic manufacturing facilities and growing good paying U.S jobs as the American vehicle vehicle Fleet electrifies we have a unique opportunity to build the entire EV supply chain in the United States Cleveland Cliffs as the largest supplier of Automotive still in North America is on The Cutting Edge of developing and supplying steel products for this electrification such as advanced high strength steels for battery enclosures and oriented electrical stews for electric motors for this electricity electrification Revolution to succeed however we have urgent need to restore production of microchips and many other manufacturing components I implore Congress to pass the chips act now that's a good start next I need to re-emphasize that the United States has the most technologically advanced carbon efficient steel industry on the planet Europe likes to pretend that it's a steel industry is more advanced than the American history industry it is not in fact Europe finds itself in an impossible situation having to rely on natural gas from Russia to support manufacturing and basic needs such such as Home Heating the United States has abundant Natural Gas that's being employed as a lower carbon fuel source to reduce greenhouse gas emissions Europe talks about hydrogen and carbon-free still making but that is just rhetoric with what we already have in place and with no need to further investment or massive subsidies the United States is poison to lead the world in cleans to production for the next Century finally it's time for the United States in particularly the traditional is to making region of the American Midwest to realize what we have I skill the workforce raw materials fresh water and Technology we have the means of producing steel and the very best consumer Market on the planet the United States is suffering an identity crisis at present beset by device politics and fatigue from the events of the past two years but fundamentally the United States is still a great country one that rewards hard work and values community over ideology or partisan affiliation the power to bring back what's good in America does not reside on Wall Street and will not come with the last pre-packed idea from abroad I ask that you as our elected officials reflect the Good Will and Common Sense is still present in our communities and our people the same ones that elect you Manufacturing in the United States is necessary for good paying jobs capitalism in a peaceful Society that's all we need to reclaim our glory and to continue to be the Envy of the world thank you very much for the opportunity to testify I'll be more than happy to answer any questions we may have thank you Mr conclave's I just want to let you know that Connor and Leon and representative lamb and I had that conversation on the floor after he had that tour and he was able to enlighten me and he was uh thrilled and learning the new technology that was uh that you were placing uh with the electrical vehicles and electrified steel so we did have that conversation thank you very much at this time I'd like to recognize representative Crawford to introduce Mr bear thank you Mr chairman Alberta is Executive Vice President for plate instructional products at Nucor Corporation he's held multiple positions at Nucor including general manager of Nucor steel Texas and vice president of new core corporation uh Mr bear thank you for being here thank you uh chairman mirvan and lamb Vice chairman Crawford and Boston on behalf of Nucor corporations more than 31 000 teammates thank you for the opportunity to speak today about the Investments we're making in American Steel my name is Albert and I'm Executive Vice President of Clayton structural products for Nucor Corporation for decades this caucus has been the first line of defense in keeping our trade laws strong and helping to get foreign governments out of the steel business we must all continue to fight for a Global Steel Market where winners are determined by market forces not by government subsidies or other non-economic factors because of your hard work and diligence the playing field is more level today for our industry which has led to billions of dollars of new Investments and thousands of new jobs at Nucor we're seizing this opportunity by investing more than 12 billion dollars to expand our steel making capabilities and Target New Growth areas for steel demand by the end of this year we'll begin operating our steel mill in Brandenburg Kentucky which will produce plate steel for offshore wind towers and other infrastructure projects this Market is currently served by Foreign Steel we'll also soon break ground on a new steel sheet Mill in Mason County West Virginia this will be one of the most technologically advanced and have one of the lowest carbon Footprints of any sheet Mill in the world and we recently announced a new rebar micro Mill in Lexington North Carolina which will serve construction customers from Washington DC to Atlanta these projects will create thousands of family supporting jobs and enable our next generation of manufacturing workers to have a promising future in their home communities as customers look to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chains the low emission steel produced by the U.S industry gives us a competitive advantage by pioneering the use of recycling to make new steel Nucor has led the way as one of the cleanest steel makers in the world our greenhouse gas intensity is less than one quarter of the global average and one-fifth of the average Blast Furnace producer this puts us 20 years ahead of the Paris agreement's most aggressive Benchmark for the Global Steel sector and even though we're one of the cleanest steel makers in the world we are actively investing to reduce our carbon footprint even further finally the pandemic has taught us that developing strong resilient domestic Supply chains for critical materials like semiconductors is vital reshoring semiconductor production presents tremendous potential for unleashing a manufacturing Renaissance in the United States we are encouraged by The increased Focus Congress and the administration have given to this critical issue and to our country's broader competitiveness with China as legislation advances we must also use this opportunity to address the Chinese government's latest schemes to evade our trade laws as Representatives Sewell and Johnson have proposed in leveling the playing field act 2.0 we are confident Congress will get this important bipartisan priority across the finish line last week Nucor reached the 50-year Milestone of being listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will celebrate by ringing the closing bell on Tuesday in the last 50 years while total domestic steel production in the U.S has decreased by almost 30 percent Nucor has grown from a company that produced only 138 thousand tons of recycled steel at one small bar Mill in Darlington South Carolina to become the industry leader producing over 25 million tons of bar sheet plate and structural steel for our economy at 25 Mills across the country we appreciate the steadfast support and Leadership from all of you in this caucus thank you for the partnership you've built with our industry the work you are doing is truly making a difference thank you thank you at this time I'd like to recognize representative Bost and we'll introduce Mr farhoff from U.S steel thank you Mr chairman um thank you Mr chairman and I you know I'd like to introduce Mr Richard fruhoff he's the chief strategy and sustainability officer at U.S steel Mr fruhoff assume this role last year after many years of serving and Senior executive roles with the company in his current position he is responsible for creating and driving U.S steel strategy and sustainability priorities to achieve profitable growth he also is in charge of developing policies and methods that will support U.S Steel's future by aligning business sustainability and organization opportunities earlier in his career he served in national security positions with the U.S Department of State U.S armed control and this arm agency and the department of the Navy as a marine I won't hold him hold that against him a native of Pittsburgh Miss fruhoff earned a bachelor's degree of science uh in Foreign Service with uh from Georgetown University a masters of public policy degree and Harvard University uh Kennedy School of government and his law degree from University of Virginia school of law Mr frujo thank you for appearing here today and you may deliver your testimony we appreciate it well thank you Mr chairman and uh and all the vice chairs and the members of the Congressional steel caucus on behalf of the 24 000 men and women of United States deal thank you for the opportunity to join you today for this hearing all of us appreciate the bipartisan caucus's leadership and support of American Steel making you know a trendy phrase these days is reassuring of American manufacturing well I think I can speak for everybody at this table we don't have to reassure we never left from our iron ore mines in northern Minnesota to our integrated Iron and Steel making operations in Gary Indiana the Mon Valley near Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Granite City Works near St Louis to our electric art furnaces in Fairfield Alabama and Osceola Arkansas we mine melt and make steel in the USA and we're proud to do it steel is critical to our national and economic security and is critical to providing a foundation for domestic manufacturing and energy security the pandemic and the economic recovery have emphasized the critical importance of retaining and rebuilding domestic Supply chains we need American-made steel to rebuild and Supply American-made manufacturing and energy Independence Global Steel over capacity and the actions of foreign governments and producers that feed that over capacity are a real threat to our security this excess steel making in China and other countries distorts Global Steel trades our U.S industry is investing to grow stronger to create jobs and to continue to meet our nation's needs we cannot allow this to be undermined by over capacity and unfairly traded Imports strong trade enforcement and continuation of the section 232 National Security action on steel Imports is absolutely vital to American Security we thank the caucus for their strong support of the industry's adcvd cases and confronting unfair trade since I last appeared here in March of 2020 U.S steel has advanced the sustainability commitments in our best for all strategy which is making it possible for us to get to our future faster in January of this year we announced that our approximately 3 billion next gener 3 billion dollar Next Generation highly sustainable and Technology technologically advanced steel mill will be located in Arkansas in Osceola close to our Cutting Edge Big River Steel plant this new Mill design features two electric Arc furnaces with Advanced steel making capability a state-of-the-art endless casting and rolling line and advanced finishing capabilities the first use of endless casting and rolling technology in the United States brings significant Energy Efficiency and capability enhancements to the company's operations when completed the sophisticated new steel making facility in combination with Big River Steel will form a 6.3 million ton Mega Mill capable of providing many of the most advanced and sustainable Steels in North America the new non-grain oriented electrical steel and galvolume galvanizing lines currently under construction at Big River Steel will further Advance our ability to respond to our customers pressing supply chain needs to satisfy their own domestic manufacturing expansion non-grain oriented electrical steel is a critical product for electric vehicle Motors this new line will help our automaker customers increase address their increasing demand for electrical Steels as our economy adjusts to climate change in April U.S steel was recognized for another significant sustainability achievement we earned the first ever site certification in North America from responsible steel which is an international non-profit organization with multi-stakeholder membership from every part of the steel supply chain that's customers and manufacturers and non-governmental organizations the site certification was awarded to Big River Steel which will hold the first Global annual meeting of responsible Steel in the United States in November in may we celebrated our investment with you Congressman mervan of 60 million dollars in a 500 000 ton Pig Caster at our Gary Works which is under active construction this project is a key part of our metallic strategy to utilize Minnesota mind or to support electric Arc furnace steel production as this U.S Steels announcement last months of plans to break ground this year at one of our two Minnesota mines on a Dr grade iron ore pellet production system this approximately 150 million dollar investment would produce pellets that are critical for dri or hbi process for electric Arc furnace steel making as the United States transitions to a lower carbon steel making we need to develop iron ore production facilities to ensure we're sourcing American Iron to make American Steel we should not and do not need to Source iron pig iron or other iron products from Russia in fact we urge the president to use his new authority to adjust tariff rates on Russian pig iron by loving at least a 25 percent tariff on those Imports we also at USD are the first American headquartered steel maker to publicly announce a 2050 net carbon zero emissions goal we are in a global race to decarbonize Steel making developing and deploying needed Technologies requires collaboration yet it's also a matter of competitiveness in Canada and across Europe governments are quickly stepping forward to support and fund the multi-billion dollar leap needed to advance and Achieve Steel decarbonization in their own Industries the US Begins the race ahead the American industry has the lowest CO2 emissions per ton of Steel produced among the seven largest steel-making countries yet we must accelerate rate as other countries including our alloy allies fully commit to investing in 100 green steel production as just one example the hydrogen Hub initiative enacted in the bipartisan infrastructure law can provide critical support for decarbonizing our economy and Industry in southwestern Pennsylvania U.S steel is actively exploring ways with like-minded organizations like shell GE power equinor eqt and others to work together to advance that region as a hydrogen Hub and national leader in decarbonization thank you again for inviting osteel to participate in the hearing and I look forward to today's discussion thank you at this time I'd like to introduce Mr Porter Tracy Porter is the Executive Vice President of the Commercial Metals company during his tenure with CMC he has served in numerous roles Tracy began his career with CMC while in college during that period he worked in various capacities in the Departments at the Saigon Texas Mill after graduation Tracy worked for General Portland Incorporated and tedco Inc before rejoining CMC in January of 1991. he was named to his current position in November of 2021 Tracy has been involved in numerous local and Statewide Civic organization as well as industry groups throughout his career he recently served as chairman of the board of directors of the steel manufacturing association the Washington D.C based electric Arc furnace Steel Industries trade Association it is my pleasure to recognize Mr Porter for statements thank you co-chairman mervan lamb Crawford and boss thank you for the opportunity to address the Congressional steel caucus this morning I appreciate your support the U.S steel industry and the U.S industrial manufacturing base I am Tracy Porter Executive Vice President of Commercial Metals company and past chairman of Steel manufacturers associations it's an honor to appear here today before you all and provide our perspectives on the American steel industry and our priorities on policy founded in 1915 CMC is a global leader in sustainable recycling manufacturing and Fabrication of Steel and Metal Products excuse me and is a leading provider of construction reinforcement Solutions excuse me CMC is a Fortune 500 company with over 12 000 employees globally with our over eight and a half billion dollars in sales in the last 12 and a half 12 months CMC is reinvesting in American manufacturing the new steel mill operations in Arizona and recently announced steel mill to be located in Eastern United States since melting our first heat of Steel in 1962 we have manufactured steel using 100 recycled metal and electric art furnace technology which is far more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional Blast Furnace technology using 82 percent less energy than the industry average and producing 63 percent less CO2 per ton of Steel we melt this process allows us to give new life to the scrap metal we collect in our recycling facilities saving over 19 billion pounds of scrap from going to landfills we are among the lowest carbon intensity and most energy efficient steel makers in the world CMC is making record Investments that are creating jobs expanding product offerings and building the futures of communities in fact American steel companies have announced some of the largest Capital Investments ever in States and counties across this country domestic steel makers continue to make investments that will modernize decarbonize and Electrify the elect the American steel industry currently under construction in Mesa Arizona our third steel mill our third micro Mill will have the ability to direct connect renewable energy sources and will be the first in the world capable of producing both rebar or reinforcing steel and Merchant bar located adjacent to our existing CMC steel Arizona facility which was the first successfully operated micro Mill in the world our new Mill is currently scheduled to Commission in early 2023. we also recently announced plans for to build a fourth micro Mill in the eastern U.S micro Mills are the most efficient in green steel making process available in the world today and these investments will enable CMC to produce one third of our Steel in North America in micro Mills which again use 26 percent less energy compared to traditional many mills and generate 40 percent less greenhouse gas I'd also like to add that CMC has an extensive steel operation in Poland given continuing hostilities and ongoing Devastation the number of refugees from Ukraine has grown to over 3.5 million people which is equal to about 10 percent of the Polish population today I'm extremely proud of the efforts of our CMC team in Poland to exist exist those in need CMC continues to collaborate with well-known humanitarian Aid groups that specialize in helping victims of armed conflicts and natural disasters and has also made CMC accommodations available to refugees I'd like to highlight three important topics during my time with you today infrastructure investment trade policy and sustainable steel making our country depends on a vast network of critical infrastructure airports roads Bridges Freight rail ports and electric grids to keep our economy humming the age of many infrastructure systems strains on Supply chains as well as Rising maintenance and safety costs are inhibiting our nation's economic performance we applaud the bipartisan passage of the infrastructure investment jobs act This 1.2 trillion dollar package is focused on traditional steel intensive projects that will make our economy more competitive the package is expected to increase rebar Demand by 1.5 million tons and result in about a 17 percent increase in rebar consumption domestically however this positive development can only happen if we have strong domestic procurement preferences and strong trade law measures if we generally genuinely want to have a stronger economy a more competitive steel history and improve the environment we must ensure that our nation's infrastructure that we build our nation's infrastructure with steel that's made by Americans for Americans we must be committed to strong domestic procurement preferences in the infrastructure investment and jobs act this will have a dual benefit of creating good paying jobs and ensuring that we track back we build back better using the cleanest greenest steel available section 232 response though not originally designed to offset the impact of unfair trade provided a comprehensive response in pursuit of distinct National Security concerns as well as stemming the flood of excessive Global Steel Supply into the U.S in combination with targeted ad and CBD orders the 232 measures have helped to restore balance to the U.S market and to create the conditions necessary for the industry to begin recovering and reinvesting it is our opinion that after successful negotiation of tariff quotas with the EU Japan and the United Kingdom the remaining 232 tariffs as well as the quotas with Argentina Brazil and South Korea remain in fact it remain intact the 232 tariffs have resulted in a decrease of unfairly traded steel Imports increased capacity utilization and spurred billions of dollars in investment investment announcements with minimal disruption to the domestic steel industry supply chain in terms of China we also realize that they are still engaged in a market distorting practices reduced demand covert related lockdowns and falling prices will cause Chinese producers to seek outlets for their subsidized excess capacity the current 301 tariffs continue to be an important deterrent to Chinese non-market Behavior increasing the EU and Canada increasingly the EU in Canada are using subsidies to make their Steel Industries look more like ours imitation is not innovation subsidies to convert inefficient excuse me EU and Canadian steel making operations to existing eaf technology pioneered by American Steel makers has the potential to disrupt markets and add to Global excess steel capacity over the last three years the American Steel producers have spent over 20 billion dollars of their own money to make its industry and make our industry more sustainable and more efficient sustainable steel making comes naturally to CMC we have been in the Metals Recycling business for over 100 years the United States is already a leader in sustainable steel production in the U.S over 70 percent of Steel is produced with electric Arc furnaces according to the climate Leadership Council American-made steel products have over 75 percent less carbon intensity than internationally produced steel we produce our Steel in our country at CO2 levels that other countries can only aspire to and we have been doing it for years as there is increasing talk about carbon border adjustment we have we must not penalize American Steel makers and other manufacturers for their Superior low carbon manufacturing processes and environmental stewardship Congress could should consider seriously consider some of the type of carbon border adjustment which ensures producers to prod of dirty Steel dirty foreign steel pay a premium to have the privilege of selling our markets we should not tax our domestic producers burdensome regulations are already doing that American Steel makers can't compete with anyone in the world we lead the way in low carbon intensity steel production we are an efficient industry that will continue to transcend every type of geopolitical and economic environment with the support of sound government policies and free market principles where employees to safely and sustainably make steel that helps make our country secure and strong I thank you for your attention and for your bipartisan leadership to support American Steel makers thank you Mr Porter at uh this time I'd like to recognize Congressman lamb for any questions that you may have Excuse me yes we have one more witness I am so very sorry representative Crawford please introduce the witness thank you Mr chairman Anthony ferbota is our next speaker he's currently the Vice President of Finance for Sacrament Industries and has served in various roles during his 31-year tenure with the company Mr forboda is on the board of directors of the committee on Pipe and Tube Imports and is the immediate past chairman Mr faboda thank you for being in your recognized um thank you for that good morning co-chairman lamb mervan co-vice chairman boss and Crawford and the distinguished members of the Congressional steel caucus my name is Tony faboda and I'm the Vice President of Finance and government relations at settlement Industries I have served for over three decades I'm also a second generation steel employees my father was a steel worker with Republic Steel and LTV and have been affected by Steel my entire life Zuckerman is the nation's largest producer of Steel Pipe and Tube products headquartered in Chicago we employ over a thousand workers at our facilities in Alabama Arizona Arkansas Illinois Indiana Michigan Ohio and Pennsylvania our company has been in business for over four decades and we have continued to expand our footprint by adding new product lines investing in new facilities and expanding opportunities for our employees just a few months ago we opened up our newest facility at jumbo HSS Mill the largest in the world in blakeville Arkansas in fact and representative Crawford's District the 200 million dollar project is one of the largest private Investments made by the Pipe and Tube industry in the last decade we're not the only ones investing in the Pipe and Tube side borisan Bull Moose tube and new cores has invested quite heavily in Pipe and Tube to the tune of you know hundreds of millions of dollars in Texas Kentucky and other areas of the country you've also heard from everybody else down the down the line here as far as their Investments we're talking about billions of dollars this was all made possible by the 232 ruling infrastructure jobs helping families in a difficult time all this made possible by us supporting the steel industry the past few years this morning I'm pleased to appear on behalf of the committee on Pipe and Tube Imports the nation's leading trade Association for the U.S Pipe and Tube industry cpti members make an array of carbon and stainless steel Pipe and Tube fittings and products cpti members span the country we are in 32 states 99 congressional districts and today employ over 32 000 employees these companies manufacture a variety of carbon and stainless steel pipe two products used in our agricultural Automotive construction defense energy fire protection and transportation sectors the industry is an essential customer of the nation's steel industry in fact many of the companies around this panel today are suppliers of flat rolled long products to our industry despite the challenges of a lingering pandemic I am here today to say that our industry is better positioned to serve our customers across this country we can attribute this to having strong trade laws and have resulted in an anti-dumping and countervailing Duty orders on a variety of Steel Pipe and Tube products and the steel section 232 program both of which have worked to reduce the number of unfairly traded Imports in the United States the industry has been a supporter of trade laws and continues to support policies that will strengthen these tools in addition the industry firmly supports the continuation of this section 232 program the industry and its employees have remained committed to serving our customers and companies are making the necessary Investments to ensure we can continue to contribute to the nation's economic recovery companies have taken the necessary steps to reinvest retool and serve new and existing markets including construction energy and infrastructure as we move forward we need to ensure that we are able to compete on a Level Playing Field with our Global competitors and steel Pipe and Tube we know firsthand the injurious effect of unfairly traded Imports just five years ago Imports of Pipe and Tube were at a record high and as a result of existing ad and CBD duties in section 232 tariffs we saw uh we saw quotas drop in number of imports and number of products this was welcome news however we knew it was only a matter of time before we saw Imports increase in 2020 there were 3.4 million tons of Pipe and Tube Imports compared to 4.4 million tons in 2021. this reflected a 29 increase from the previous year in import penetration Rose from 27.2 percent of 2020 to 33.9 percent in 2021. we have data for q1 of 2022 that reports import penetration at over 40 percent and an equally important note the industry remains committed to ensure that we can respond to any global trade irregularities as we know recent effects in Ukraine have decimated the country and their citizens we are all aware of Russia's still making capacity and their ability to Downstream products including Pipe and Tube our industry has learned that some Russian steel has been used to make Pipe and Tube which has entered into the U.S from Oman a way for Russia to potentially evade existing A.D and cvd duties on hot rolled steel and possibly avoid trade sanctions that are in place we also believe producers that UAE producers are using Russian Steel we share this information and conveyed our concerns to the Commerce department and U.S Customs and Border Patrol that false melted and poured Source information was listed for nearly 50 000 tons of pipe in 2022 even though there was Zero hot rolled steel production in the UAE the steel caucus should look into the lacks enforcement of these existing licensing provisions and blatant violations by providing false information on Entry documents we hope that the caucus will inquire with Commerce Customs as to why this is occurring and what action plans they take to remedy the problem it is disturbing to see that Russia may be economically benefiting by shipping steel products to third countries evading all the steps taken by the United States we would ask that the caucus engage with the administration to discuss what appropriate actions can be made in this matter as Congress and seal caucus continues this work in the second session of the 117th Congress we would like to highlight a few of our priorities the industry is continuing to carefully monitor the usmca to ensure full implementation and the intended benefits are received by U.S manufacturers Canada has been adhering to that agreement but Mexico is of great concern the industry continues to work with ustr to identify Solutions through Section 232 Provisions to remedy the growing levels of misclassified Steel conduit products from Mexico the industry remains committed to ending Global Steel over capacity particularly in China and will continue to engage with the oecd steel committee and Global seal Partners on Solutions the cpti is a strong supporter of trade laws and we remain committed to work with Congress and the administration to develop and Advance legislation that will provide tools to unfair Trade Practices and custom fraud as Congress moves forward with their legislative agenda the cpdis the caucus support these measures and we believe to reinforce the foundation of the domestic steel sector support pending trade legislation leveling the playing field act 2.0 HR which is currently being discussed in the U.S Innovation and competition act we asked the caucus to convey to con to conferees that it's important to include the trade remedy the provisions in the final agreement having these in place will enhance U.S trade laws to ensure import sensitive sectors including the steel sector and their workers can obtain relief through enforceable remedies support legislation that would create opportunities for the domestic steel sector to serve the growing renewable energy sector through the use of tax credits in the budget reconciliation bill Support Enforcement of the Buy America program for National infrastructure projects support full funding in fiscal year 23 for the U.S trade agencies charged with administering the U.S unfair trade laws and customs enforcement the caucus has always been in Forefront of development of legislation that addresses the importance to the industry its workers and the communities we serve I know that our industry and Association thank each of you on the caucus for your commitment and Leadership on these issues the industry has a great partnership with the caucus and we applaud you for the work that you do we need to keep the momentum Behind These Collective efforts and result in economic growth and security for the domestic Pipe and Tube and fittings industry seals sector and our nation's manufacturing sector thank you for your time today Mr furbota thank you for that important testimony and excuse my miscue I appreciate you being here today with that I'd like to recognize representative lamb for questions thank you Mr Conway I wanted to start off with you welcome back great to see you again um I appreciate you highlighting in your testimony that the bipartisan infrastructure law will add 40 to 50 million tons of steel demand over the next five years you know one of our goals in passing some of the strongest buy American Provisions that we've ever had was to Advantage your members you know not just to improve the company's bottom lines which is also a goal but to make sure the workers get their Fair cut of that in the last couple years obviously we've seen an increase in strikes um you know labor unrest in Western Pennsylvania we had a long and significant strike at ATI during the course of the pandemic which affected a lot of the families so uh you know as we sort of monitor what the public is spending on this steel and how the industry responds I was just wondering if you could comment on the state of Labor Relations presently as you see them any particular challenges that your members are countering I know obviously the Administration has made some changes at the Department of Labor that you know should hopefully help smooth things out but just any comments you can make on that yeah I appreciate um that opportunity Connor we're in negotiations right now with both Cleveland Cliffs and U.S steel and so I left Pittsburgh in that bargaining those teams are continuing to work and we have a deadline of uh September 1st and as I mentioned um look the industry's done well over the last couple of years so in prices continue to do well because all the things that we've spoken about here so there's no reason same people ought to get in a fight when things are going pretty good and I think we're going to be able to get to September 1st and get good responsible agreements going forward um you know it has been people are are struggling with jobs in the country and there has been a number of strikes and and we've seen a few more not um you know the one at ATI was was certainly disturbing um and made no sense frankly he just got forced into it but you know there is a sense that corporations are doing very well and people want a fair share of it and so there's been an upswing in strikes as there's been an upstream in in resignations and people moving and so there's a labor shortage and that tends to bring those squabbles about um but at least here I think we're going to be fine um yeah I think we're going to be fine I I don't thank you yeah I just wanted to express that I think one of the frustrations many of us have had since the start of the pandemic at least on the Democratic side is you know when we spend a lot of the Public's money in direct support of an industry wanting to make sure that the industry recognizes um you know that that part of the deal for us at least as a customer the US government is that the workers are treated fairly and that a negotiation is held fairly so it's it's good to hear that your expectations are positive on that regard but just know that you know we have your back as as this time goes forward um the I have about a little over a minute left um Mr Gonzalez I just wanted to ask you uh one of the things that I've worked on since I've been here has been legislation to create a strategic Transformer Reserve Run by the department of energy the goal being that it would have by America standards and you know we would ensure that we always have what we need as far as Transformers May here in the United States do you think a strategic Transformer Reserve would be beneficial you know not just economically but for our national security absolutely do you think we could meet the need efficiently at a fair cost using electrical steel like Cleveland Cliffs produces yes sir thank you we have been continuing to invest in expanding our capacity to produce electrical Steels we have just announced a small investment among dollar terms uh 30 million dollars investment in our Zanesville Ohio facility to bring back a Sensei mere meal to produce more electrical Steals and that will increase and free up Butler PA to produce more grain oriented electricity for Transformers that's great thank you I don't think people realize you know how crucial that is when we talk about meeting our climate goals we're going to have to design and and rebuild a grid for the future that looks a little different than it does today which means we're going to need a lot of electrical steel and you know as you've highlighted so many times that I didn't really appreciate until I visited your plant the complexity of making it and the the electrical steel that's coming into this country from outside is as far as I know coming from countries that don't even make it so you know the question of of where it originates um you know presents itself that way so hopefully you know we can use the government's buying power for something like a strategic Transformer Reserve to at least help out and as part of really an infrastructure type approach while we address the other issues thank you Mr mirman I yield back Mr fan and Mr Lim just to compliment that little investment of 30 million dollars will generate another 100 good being union jobs in our Zanesville Ohio facility so that's pretty much what you're talking about so we don't see the unions as opponents we see the units as partners we deal with them on a daily basis and we work together well and Together We Are One Plus One three not one plus one two we don't divide we sum up we work together and I believe that my my friend Tom Conway has the same view thank you at this time I'd like to represent our recognized representative Crawford for a question thank you Mr chairman um let me start by directing my question to my comments to Mr bear I completely agree with your statement earlier that we must keep the government out of the steel business uh citing China for example in 2005 China had the capacity to produce over around 400 million tons of steel per year Chinese still making capacity is now around 1.2 billion tons per year much of this heavily subsidized highly polluting capacity that should have exited the market a long time ago the Chinese government is now exporting this subsidized capacity to third countries through their belt and Road and other initiatives while claiming it's reducing excess capacity this is an economic issue an environmental issue and a national security issue and I'm glad to hear you believe that we are doing what we're doing as a caucus is making a difference I just asked what else do you think needs to be done to address government subsidies and other Market distorting behavior in China and across the globe oh yeah thank you Congressman that's that's a great question um I think what I would say first is we need to continue to enforce the trade laws that we already have on the books and and continue to strengthen them as well and this means using them uh to to enact measures before uh when when unfair trade is happening but then also ideally before that injury uh is causing harm to our industry in terms of strengthening those there's still gaps in those trade laws they're they're still uh reaches that they aren't able to make I'll give you an example uh if China were to subsidize production in another country such as Vietnam such as Indonesia those current trade laws don't allow us to to take action uh things like the the leveling the playing field act would close some of those gaps so we really strongly support and appreciate the work of this caucus to to as my comments said to move that across the the the Finish Line lastly then I'd also say we need to continue to use the measures of National Security uh that we already have like section 232 that allow us to make sure we have a strong robust resilient steel industry for America to build uh our national defenses to build our infrastructure and to make sure that we're able to support the needs of the of the American people going forward the American steel industry is ready to do that is able to do that and is making the Investments to do do it and with the with the support of this uh caucus we'll work together and get it done appreciate that Mr fruoff in January U.S steel announced that it would double the size of its steel production in Osceola Arkansas which is in my district by building a second Mill with two new eafs near its existing Big River Steel facility when completed this would create a Mega Mill with over 6 million tons of annual steel making capacity can you give me an update on that project and and um and explain the significance of big Rivers still being recognized with responsible Steel's first ever site certification in North America which was also just announced in January yes sir thank you well the the project is is well underway we broke ground in February uh for the expansion of Big River we're calling it br2 but as you noted between Big River Steel and the expanded facility we'll be making over 6 million tons and uh Mississippi County Arkansas will be the largest steel-making county in the country once that milk comes online so the price project is well underway it's on time and we're looking forward to getting it up and running in 2024 ground is spinning move Steel's being put into the ground I can tell you as well that the non-grain oriented electrical steel line that we broke ground on last year is progressing very very well and that should come online in another 12 months to be producing electrical steels for the EVS the motors needed for electric vehicles so those are all progressing well with respect to responsible steel that's a global standard body focused on climate change it has 12 principles and Big River Steel was the first American Mill to pass a rigorous external audit and be certified as a a steel making site so we're very excited about it responsible steel has members across the steel supply chain not just manufacturers but big customers like Daimler and BMW and others and by the way Big River Steel received daimler's sustainable Global supplier of the Year award last year too so it continues to shine thank you sir outstanding Mr Porter in the time that I have left my district has become the epicenter for eaf steel production Howard domestic AF steel makers working towards a low carbon future well just by the nature of what we do in electric Arc furnaces we're Recycling metals that have come out of the waste stream so we're instead of putting them back into the landfill we're making them in new usable products uh the other thing that's pretty significant for us now is the Advent of technology and Renewables as far as electricity and as you all know our electric Arc furnace industry is powered by electricity so with the growth of the wind energy sector as well as the solar today many of us are employing the use of that technology to power our electric Arc furnaces the other thing going on a little bit on the in terms of sustainability and believe it or not it's it's a it's kind of the technology-based deal is machine learning artificial intelligence uh our meals are packed with technology most people are shocked by this when they come in to see the technology that's employed but humans can think so fast machines think a little bit faster so as they tweak our processes as we melt the steel and roll the steel um the machines are doing some behind the scenes calculations and refining the process for us was energy is extracted from that we make a cleaner steel we less emissions things like that so it's something we focus on every day at CMC and I think the eaf industry as a whole it is a major Focus for us for the future thank you yield back this time I'd like to recognize Congressman Boston for questions thank you chairman uh Mr Freehold um one you know one of the bipartisan priorities of the Congressional steel caucus is is trading enforcement you know preventing unfair trade steel imports from China and elsewhere from undermining American Steel making and it's critical now this International Trade Commission is currently reviewing several existing anti-dumping uh countervailing duties cases against foreign steel why do you think that it is uh important to continue these cases at such an aggressive pace well well first thank you to you and to the other members of the caucus who have been strong supporters before the ITC and thank you for that you know the adcvd cases are an additional protection level for the industry against unfair trade we've talked a lot at the other Witnesses have talked about China we talk a lot about sort of circumvention and the over capacity so the ability to use the adcvd cases to stop these unfair unfairly traded steel Imports with additional tariffs and duties at the border is critical it's not just the 232 you need the strong enforcement of the adcvt cases at the ITC and the ITA of Commerce and we also need strong Customs so I know the committee has supported that in the in the past as well making sure the Customs and Border Protection has the tools to enforce these so we need all of these tools and we need them to be strongly enforced and funded and the administration to keep on top of it because as others have said these these external Imports they're always is looking for ways to circumvent the rules yeah just kind of going in that same direction several of the witnesses have brought up the fact that basically they hide our disguise where the steel comes from and then try to slip it through different ways the Commerce Commission do you think it is aggressive we're giving them the money do you feel like they're being as aggressive as they need to be or how do we what can we do to make we can pass all the laws in the world but if the laws aren't being enforced then then so so what can we do to try to get these agencies to do be aggressive more aggressive and understand how important this is well I think uh certainly Congress has done its part I would say Continue to update as Tom said update the laws to give them new authorities but and I believe that the administration and the ITC the ITA and Customs are doing what they can but they they're outgunned I mean you're they're going up against an entire country right against the Chinese and other Industries which have massive State uh um uh resources behind them they're always looking for ways to move steel to another country kiss it and then say it's Vietnamese steel or Indonesian steel or to to build facilities in these other countries uh and so you know it's a global game that's constantly moving and so I think our administrative agencies need tools and they need to be constantly looking at new ways of enforcement sharing of information from the age agencies and from industry we provide information and I think the cooperation between industry and the the executive branch is critical well that's what we do as far as account of alien and all of that and trying to catch that the other concern that I have is um what can your industry do and what can you advise us to do to dealing with our you got to realize that as much as a lot of people think that members of Congress stay around forever there's a quick turnover what do we need to do and what can you do to educate new members of Congress as are they coming in to explain to them how it is that U.S steel made in the United States is the cleanest made the best made and then make sure they understand that it's not some evil industry it is the industry that actually operates this nation and so what what can you do and what what can we do better to educate the new members of Congress they come in well we're happy to have and we have hosted I think you all of you are welcome at any of our facilities to learn we've hosted your staff we've actually had CBP uh officers come to our facilities to learn about steel to learn what to look for uh to learn for you know Mill markings and and the traceability paperwork you should be able to find uh for any any uh coil which is what we make right to help them understand the industry to understand how steel moves through the system so they can understand and look for false documentation for looking for the telltale signs that this is a falsified uh certificate of origin we're happy to educate any and all of you and come to any of our Mills and learn learn what we do and how you can tell whether something is genuinely made in the U.S and not yeah I appreciate that and I'm very sure short on time so I'll go ahead and yield back thank you at this time I'd like to recognize congressman stauber thank you very much Mr chair and the vice chairs for hosting this and thanks to our Witnesses this has been a couple years since we've been together and and for those of you who don't know I represent Northeastern Minnesota and it's the Iron Range and it's extremely important to our nation and it has been for many years as as uh Lorenzo and Mr fruhoff understands one of the things that I really think is important and it's been brought up a couple times is a 232 tariffs and Mr Gonzalez this is for you the 232 tariffs are protection from the steel dumping and to make to ensure our industry stays vibrant we have pushed this Administration to keep them on the continuation from the last Administration can you give us a snapshot of the devastation that would happen if those were to come off well I I can tell you what happened because we had section 232 first of all section 232 is not supposed to have a a direct impact on trade and uh it's related to National Security and the very first thing we need to understand is that iron war and steel are the foundation of National Security we worked through the previous administration then Congressman Kelly was one uh that was extremely uh important to get these things moving as well as Senator Rob Portman of Ohio uh representative Carlos from Pennsylvania so we are working very hard to have a section 232 put on course and laminations of Transformers because the course eliminations were built were were being cut in in Mexico using Japanese South Korean and Chinese steel we are giving away our ability to produce Transformers so the very first thing we need to do is educate members of Congress because then when we talk with you you understand or we are we're talking about I'm very pleased to to hear from uh representative lamb that he he learned in in his visit to our Butler facility what we're talking about anyway we're able to move that that painful section 232 process through the the administration Commerce uh uh after we pushed a lot was able to put that thing on the desk of Mark Meadows the former Chief of Staff well that thing was never signed by the previous president and the new president came and never signed either so that's lack of knowledge it's giving away the farm it's very easy to talk let's buy America we can buy America if we make in America if we don't make in America we'll just be talking we will be talking you'll be talking and nothing you get done so when need to understand when you're talking we're not just talking we're just trying to give you information for you to pass the laws because your people you are the people that elect you know better because they're they're suffering they're the ones that are suffering we are talking on their behalf so when I say let's restore manufacturing that's not because we are trying to create any type of protection it's we would like to survive as a nation Lawrence I couldn't I couldn't agree with you more thank you for the comments uh Mr far off the recent Announcement by U.S steel to invest in your minds on the Iron Range to enable production of Dr great palace continue to promote your commitment to ensuring Steel's mind melted and made in America what is the status of this project what is needed to make it successful and why is it important to the future of American Steel making well thank you sir so the project uh we are in the engineering phase it's 150 million dollar float plant that is a special line to create a direct reduced iron grade pellet requires additional beneficiation uh so right now we're engineering the project uh we need permits obviously uh to get going on construction of the line we're excited to get going on it uh I think the line will allow us to take some of that 22 million tons of iron ore that we mine every year in the in the Mesabi and use some of it for these electric Arc furnaces which are now about two-thirds of steel production here in the United States so we see that as critical to the long-term future of the Wasabi Iron Range being able to make iron ore pellets both for the blast furnace Fleet that we have but also for our electric Arc furnaces and for other electric Arc furnace users it's a critical input to Electric Arc furnace production now thank you very much and Mr Gonzalez real quick strong trade trade laws that are strictly enforced have always been important to the steel industry can you address the importance of our anti-dumping countervailing duty laws to the steel industry yeah we can't uh we can survive as an industry as a a vibrant job generating National Security type of Industry if we are not protect against people that are just dumping steel here in the United States selling for variable cost being completely subsidized to do that and we just watch and believe that we're doing a great job because we are cutting prices marginally at at the the end user level so it's extremely important that we understand that these things don't land in the United States because they are better or more competitive or they are technologically more advantage that they are just unfairly competing and destroying our society by stealing our jobs and move them moving them abroad thank you very much and I yield back Mr chair this time I'd like to rep I'd like to recognize Mr Kelly for five minutes thank you Mr chairman thank you all for being here uh I think the one thing we kind of lose sight of is your total economic footprint all of you represent so many workers but you also pick up something that people talk about as fringe benefits which is a huge lift right so we help people with their health care we help people get ready for retirement and so the the health of the steel industry has always been critical I think one of the things that I know from being in my life and Mr gonsalves uh you know I live about a mile from Cleveland Cliffs I grew up with in Butler Pennsylvania it's about a half a mile from the dealership and I got to tell you visiting that that facility and Frank adino puts on an incredible program on what grain ornate and electric steel is and I really think it'd be good for more Americans to understand that when we talk about steel we're just not talking about steel we're talking about a whole variation of products that are out there so whether it's the granuary electric steel which goes in our Transformers and you know it's interesting you have to explain to people when you're out driving look at telephone poles every place you see a gray canister understand that what's inside that canister is what makes it possible for the house to have the flow of electricity it's eye-opening for a lot of people and then then we talk about the non-oriented electric steel because one of the businesses uh that uh we're seeing now explode is the electric cars and that product goes is very essential for that so my whole point of being here today and and listening to you and I I'm glad we were able to finally get back together when we talk about our position globally I don't want us to be a participant in that market we don't need to participate we need to dominate we for too long have allowed other places to take part of our market right in front of us and we've stood back and watched it happen and then we sit back and say I wonder how that took place our ability to work with you on a daily basis on a monthly basis and looking at policy after policy after policy and excuse me if I offend anybody who has never been actually in the workforce but has worked in government all their life please if you don't know anything about the policy don't get involved in making something that's impossible for us to participate so without apology in mind Mr gonsalves and all of you could you just just quickly so people understand the number of people that get a paycheck once a month twice a month whatever it is get their health care get their pension just as the the places that you represent uh I think it's incredible what we don't understand and I think our role is to represent you and represent those workers and represent America so I meant when I said God dang I don't want to participate I want to dominate and we need to put you in a position where you can actually do that so Mr proof it just start just real quickly because we're running out of time I hate to do this to you all you come the whole way down here and you get five minutes to talk to us that's not the way I'd run my business but it's not my business well thank you sir well I you know there's a study that was done just uh to your point a couple of years ago in Western Pennsylvania I think U.S steel alone has a three to four billion dollar impact beyond what we spend right so we spent a lot of money ourselves this is the multiplier effect of the small businesses uh the suppliers the restaurants that are near the facilities that feed the workers the workforce the truck drivers who come and drop stuff off and take it away uh we have we have a our pension plan is overfunded we're happy to say but we have lots of folks who are on pension uh who are retired and they depend on us being able to pay those pensions we have 3 000 workers alone in Pennsylvania um we are I think either the largest or maybe the second largest uh manufacturer in Western Pennsylvania today I'm just giving that as an example to your point you know Congressman mervan you know U.S steel Gary it's that's you know we're we in Ursula are now Cliffs we we are Northwest Indiana manufacturing um and again there are lots of uh pensioners who depend on us being able to make sure those Pension funds the Steel Workers pension trust are funded properly so that they can have the retirement they they deserve and the multiplier effect is huge I think you know manufacturing people lose sight of that unlike some other uh Industries what we do ripples through the economy a lot more than some of the Tech Industries or the Pharma Industries and so I think uh I'm glad people are talking about restoring manufacturing like I said at the beginning we never left um and hopefully some of the manufacturing sectors that did leave are coming back because manufacturing creates really good jobs for lots of lots and lots of people and really good retirements and health care and all the benefits you need yeah so if any of you just I mean and and look I don't think this country understands the immensity of this industry I mean it is we not all Steel's created equally we know that okay there's all kind of different products that get made uh and I think the our are not knowing the total impact of us not watching over this product and saying we've got to protect what we make here we've got to make sure that people don't take from us what we started I just I've got to tell you I know we're running out of time so I'm going to apologize to you all for us not doing enough in the past to help you when we know it's an unequal playing field and we sit back and we watch it I think Pete you you said it right you know this is a two-year deal for us and it keeps turning and you know so the day you get elected the next day you start your re-election so we're often concentrate too much on being reelected Mr chairman then we do about what our responsibility is I we are Representatives I know we call ourselves Congressman we are representatives and we represent all of you so listen I want to thank you for being here today I mean that sincerely uh but man I'll tell you what there's a hell of a wake-up call out there today and if we don't if we're not aware of it or we have a blind eye or a deaf ear to what's happening it's our own fault look at the man in the mirror that's the problem we need to get on top of all this so thank you all for being here Mr Gonzalez I want to thank you personally you have kept Butler alive for many many years uh if I've got 1400 friends that work there their families benefit greatly Mr Conway what you want to able to do we have raised the standard of living for millions of people because of what you all do and work together so thanks so much I'm sorry to go on but I I tell you what we better get more passionate about what it is that we do uh we can it's nice to have these meetings but I don't want these two hours just to be two hours of pounding a desk and screaming I want to make sure we're doing policy that makes sense for all of you so thanks so much thank you Mr chairman appreciate it thank you representative Kelly for bringing the passion and putting an exclamation point in uh bringing your uh your community in in the global perspective into it thank you with that I'd like to recognize Mr garamandi for five minutes thank you and thank you for heading up the caucus very very important in 2009 as I left the uh Lieutenant governor's office in California a bridge was about to be built across the bay of the Oakland Bay Bridge got into a big fight with the state of California about whether it ought to be American Steel turned out 10 percent cheaper to be Chinese Steel ultimately it was 10 more expensive because of the quality of the stereo wasn't there that started when I arrived in Congress in 2009 a Make It in America agenda and together with steny Hoyer we've been driving that agenda every year adding more and more requirements along the way shipbuilding Navy on and on uh this last year in the infrastructure jobs act which I must say only 16 of my Republican colleagues voted for Senator Baldwin and stabenon and I and steny Hoyer added make it buy it in America standards to every Federal dollar spent whether this Department of Agriculture or Department of Transportation so we continue to work on this we appreciate all of your support it would not have happened without the steel industry and other Industries supporting strongly those provisions no we got to make sure that it actually happens and so your information that you're given today together with uh watching closely there are plenty of people that are trying to get around the loopholes including American contractors of every kind and stripe so uh work with us let us know and as you've heard from my colleagues here we're ready to to go at it um it's not all good Mr furhoff you once owned the Pittsburgh California steel mill why did you shut it so that it can be an Amazon warehouse yes that's how that works so one of the challenges of that facility uh and I think you've kind of touched on it is supplying steel to it right now the steel that used to come to that facility came from Korea it did and the cost of uh and we could go down a whole rabbit pole if you will talking about rail but moving today the situation with the rail industry moving steel from the Midwest to California to have it further finished is cost prohibitive if you can even move coils out there right now the rail industry is so bottlenecked is virtually impossible to get reliable service from Gary out to Pittsburgh California so the alternative is do you import steel from Korea to keep that facility running and that was one of the challenges we had in trying to keep that a viable facility you and I need to have a further discussion I understand it's a done deal and Amazon's going to have a lovely Warehouse we're happy to talk to you sir about what the opportunities are to make that facility that space into something usable and productive for the region it is a great facility it's a great Port location there in Pittsburgh it's a deep water Port it comes in pretty far inland through the bay system so it is a great site I think as I said one of the challenges was supplying the substrate to that facility from the Midwest that's interesting um all of the happy talk here isn't spread across the nation nor is it spread to the steel workers that have lost their job in that plant it's a pity you didn't talk to the representatives in the area so that we could have worked this out before you pulled the plug as I said sir we're happy to have a conversation with you uh the challenge again though is there is no substrate Supply in that area it is as you said a deep water Port that is cheapest Transportation Systems in the world are on the water they are you know I'm not buying your argument it's a done deal but I tell all of you that um it's not a happy talk in every part of America you build Mills here you expand them yes oh by the way there's enormous opportunities in that area for hydrogen as a fuel we've had conversations with some of those uh folks looking at hydrogen in that area sir absolutely the permitting situation in Northern California is a challenge permitting in California is easy if you have the right project if you want to build a stadium for the Rams or the Oakland you can get a past it it's about the politics it's about how you move your project forward I really want to thank all of you for your support in our continuing effort on buy America Make It in America we're not going to drop that there's more to be done with that I yield back foreign thank you at this time I'd like to recognize Mr balderson for five minutes thank you Mr chairman and to think that I'm taking Mike Kelly to the Ohio State Notre Dame football game you'll be cheering loud um thank you all for being here this morning uh Lorenzo I feel like I can call you by your first name you and I and Mike and Rob we've had so many conversations in the last couple years and it's been a wonderful opportunity for me you are definitely in my journal as one of the great Americans that I've had the opportunity to work with so thank you for everything that you've done and um you know you took you mentioned the 30 million dollars that you've added into my hometown that plant like Mike's is less than a mile away from my home I've actually had two parents two sets of parents come up to me in the last three weeks uh one father was at Walmart as I was doing my weekend shopping wise home uh and and thank me his son is staying in his hometown where he grew up and he's going to work at Cleveland Cliffs uh and the other one was a phone call so thank you for the jobs that you've added there and it's a hundred jobs of good paying jobs Mike talked about the benefits the health care uh it's all good and I thank you and I thank clevelandcliffs for all your efforts and and work that we put into that uh we recently discussed the importance of Congress passing the Chip's legislation and producing these semiconductor chips the United States some of you may know that the Intel project is located in the 12th congressional district that I represent in Licking County so this is something that we've been working on hard for the last seven months actually a little bit longer than that but um can you explain to me why you believe this is such an important issue to the steel industry also uh first of all thank you very much for all the good work with US Representative balderson uh we would not be able to do things in this interview area without your support because your leadership in the area helps the community understand how things should go and uh this is also something that members of these two caucus can do more in terms of uh allow us to do our work because sometimes they just don't know what's going on and they are bombarded by the general press and things like that trying to portray something that's extremely good has not been so good I I get this feeling as I I moved into Indiana and I don't feel like the the people in Indiana really understand what they have there in terms of the competitive Advantage for the world the cheapest Act is just that it's our chance to bring these manufacturers here to the United States creating American jobs with high good pay middle class wages vast majority union jobs what's a good thing in my opinion and that creating the the industry that comes around that's exactly how this country did a hundred years ago and you have the chance to do again with the electrification of the fleet and Cleveland Cliffs because of our massive leadership in automotive we are the biggest supplier of each one of these folks that are going from combustion engine vehicles to EVS each one of them General Motors where the biggest Ford we are the biggest Toyota we're the biggest Honda we are the biggest each one of them so we are working with each one of them to do that you need to help because we need these common factors to produce here in the United States they are learning a tough lesson bringing stuff sophisticated specified staff from Europe is a bad idea they don't have natural gas to hit their homes let alone to produce Steel they will run out of water we are at the Great Lakes at the age of 21 of the fresh water of the world Congress needs to understand what we have then we have more Butlers more zones views more Northwest Indiana more Clevelands more Cincinnati's that's what we need we need to work together we need to stop really find things I hear people talk about electric first come on half of my production half of my plants have electrical furnaces the other half have blast furnaces and the Blessed furnace are there to stay they are not polluting blast furnaces they are not blessed First Chinese blessed furnishers that use Center and pollute like crazy we have the highest level of pollution control in the world and the most efficient and environmentally friendly blessed furnaces in the world so let's stop this thing of talking down Blast Furnace that's that's against the workers of the United States let's put abundantly clear that's good bad speech and I'll not take that anymore but the cheapest actors is just that our ability to redo in the 21st century what this country thought the world in the 20th century it's our chance again let's see if we will put it to to good use or if we're going to put it to waste well thank you for your input and um looks like we got a little movement going last night so we will see and as you said uh and I'm going to be respectful we've run over our time here a little bit but um you know you brought up natural gas and in the state of Ohio and West Virginia and Pennsylvania we have about a hundred year supply of natural gas um and and Germany's dealing with uh an issue right now dealing with that and they also are going after the chips act uh of their own sign so Mr chairman I apologize and I you back thank you thank you thank you very much congressmember I'd like to recognize myself uh Mr Conway many members have taught or many individuals who testified today talked about the level the playing field 2.0 if you could uh talk about that and and update us and and the Vitality of that okay I think that's it's been a long time coming it's really an important piece of legislation for us and you know it recognizes what we've been dealing with for you know decades um and there's been somewhat said here about it today this battle that's going on you know Lorenzo puts it in really Stark but good terms we have an opportunity and we have not updated our trade laws we have sat back and watched the Hemorrhage of um our communities and our jobs and good paying opportunities and people and and you know I was listening to representative Kelly it's one of these people that we're dealing with they had orph they had companies before that got shut down and caught and there are a bunch of retirees out there who unfortunately we call them orphans and we struggle with trying to figure out how are we going to keep them going and and when and when you build a new company like like we have here in some of these instances who takes care of them whose responsibilities and so without something like beginning to turn the corner put level the playing field back in you know there is an opportunity here to really do something about trade and not just talk about it thank you Mr Conway and and I agree with you growing up in Northwest Indiana having those steel mills lose families lost their pensions and uh it was devastating to the community it was devastating the Main Street and the economy of all and that's why we're here today I also wanted to ask a question that came up putting a 25 percent tariff on pig iron on Russia I believe that you had mentioned that if you can just address why that component would be an advantage to the United States steel industry yes thank you Mr chairman so uh pre-conflict in the Ukraine about two-thirds of the pig iron in the United States consumed in the United States came from Russia or the Ukraine there's virtually no pig iron production today in the United States there's a little bit for foundries but the Russian industry uh uses pig iron and other metallics to subsidize Putin I mean these are oligarchs who own those facilities so why we would allow pig iron or other metallics to come into the United States without the same same types of tariffs that we're talking about for finished steel products or finished steel we don't understand anyway the president has the authority now and we think he should use it to put a 25 tariff on pig iron and other metallics so that our Industries can produce these products without being undercut by unfairly traded Russian Imports and of course so that the oligarchs are not funding Putin's War Machine Mr conclave's Lorenzo would you like to add to that yeah look I expanding on that uh the the massive production of uh Big Iron in Russia that existed prior to the invasion of Ukraine continues they are not shutting down because some countries not all some countries are not buying pig iron from Russia that big guy is going somewhere and displacing local production and this local production is coming to the United States long story short the the game of whack-a-mole with uh stew is now being replicated with big Iron from Russia so and uh you know we continue to to look to the other side because we we use bigger we produce our own pig iron and when we account for emissions they are all inside our plants because it's all scoop one it's our equipment but when you import pigar or you buy pig iron from a 30 part not necessarily even importing that's a scope tree and scope 3 is not accounted for so we continue to to play this beautiful game of calling emissions only scope 1 and 2 and ignoring scope 3 and pretending that everything is fine it's not fine and we are accounting for all these things because one day these things will be all uh clear and we are going to see the reality of things so having the real picture understanding the needs to have a steel industry understanding the reality what's pollution what's not pollution what's global warming not being global warming helps a lot otherwise we continue to talk the same stuff over and over again and nothing happens Mr uh for Bodo you had mentioned that this uh first quarter last quarter in 2022 that there was an increase of 40 percent of imports uh what steps can the steel caucus do to try and uh assist in that well I think first and foremost making sure that we have the available funds for a quarter and custom and border patrol to make sure that they can do their jobs and and keep track of all this product coming out of the country we talked a little bit about Mexico Mexico is not living up to their agreement in the usmca uh this is something we've brought forth already to Commerce and the ustr's office and obviously they've they've had some other things on their plate with with Russia and with the China negotiations originally um but let's let's start at home and let's let's get our partners in the usmca to live up to their agreements and and live up to what you know the agreement said and I mean I I think that's that's those are two big things that we could you know stop the foreign imports from coming in um uh otherwise I think they're going to continue to rise if you know it's it's like uh you know a child they'll keep taking steps and steps and steps and they'll keep Taking Chances until someone slaps their wrist we just have to take a stand and and uh I think that'll temper their expectation moving forward thank you with that that concludes uh this meeting in closing I just want to thank all of you for taking the time uh and as we have all mentioned understanding the Vitality of the United States national security when it comes to the steel industry and the hundreds of thousands of the hundreds of thousands of jobs and families that you impact and the economic footprint it is about National Security it's about Economic Opportunity and it's about uh members of Congress government Labor and Industry coming together to if I could use Mr Kelly's uh not to participate but to dominate and what is on the other side of that domination is making sure that we have a future for our workers for our Workforce and for an industry that is provided for families in my district for decades it's faced challenges and we have to have strong trade laws and we have to work together to make sure that the resources are there to enforce those trade laws and we have to make sure that we work together in a bipartisan effort which we have done here in the steel caucus to advance to protect and to make sure that we're thriving in the steel industry with that I thank you all very much for joining us today and look forward to working with you in the future and again I want to thank the staff for their endless hours of participation in making this happen Jamie and all the other staff members and the usw for allowing us to put this together appreciate it and thank you very much

all right i want to revisit yesterday's uh non-events with uh president biden and the oil company people joining me now is kansas senator roger marshall center marshall always good to see you sir thank you for your time friday afternoon i just want to revisit this i don't want to let this go so let me get this right you had the biggest oil company ceos who could actually help produce more gasoline for example and you know add supply lower the price take a whack at putin and then biden doesn't go and he won't talk to them he sends them to the boondocks in the energy department right which as i said earlier in the show looks like a 1970s public housing project and then in the white house in the beautiful roosevelt room right biden sits with the windmill makers and never talks to the oil and gas people at all what do you make of that senator larry i i don't know what to think of it that's the question i get back home every time i go back what was biden thinking when and then you fill in the blank but we all know that the decreased supply of gasoline is on the back of joe biden's policy every time he opens his mouth every time the secretary of energy talks she creates uncertainty this white house doesn't realize that it takes two years to get some type of return of investment from oil exploration and probably five or ten years to pay it back they just don't get it you know senator i think of course you're right but i think politically you know biden was insulting them again by not showing up he was in town you could have met with them he could have met them in the roosevelt room and also in terms of policies giving you he doesn't care about oil and gas really he's he wants windmills and and solar farms and whatever stuff that's not going to help him get out of this mess um i people ceos that i talked to who were in that meeting they asked uh secretary granholm manager secretary grantham they asked her if they could get some regulatory waivers just some waivers to help out and the answer was no yeah it's unbelievable what we need is a regulatory pause and that's what the legislation we're introducing is to have a regulatory pause on anything that would slow down our oil and gas energy and that's one of the big big reasons we're afraid to do any type of more drilling is because there's just a mountain of regulations waiting for us and slowing down the process same things happening in mining same thing's happening with fertilizers you know also senator uh you know biden was saying last week of course he's trying to distract attention from his restrictive policies on fossil fuels but he was saying you know whoa did i make a mistake in the war in ukraine well the reality is russia's um energy production their oil production and sales are now basically back to pre-war levels for ukraine because they got india and china buying the stuff and there are some price discounts although not that big but there are some discounts in other words he's making good money on our mistakes our supply our supply cuts pushed up prices and he's the guy uh the recipient of this i mean that's crazy right larry looks to me like joe biden wants this war to be drug out you know first of all he's slow walking the ammunitions the military aid over there and then he's delaying sanctions so putin continues to export a billion dollars of oil every every day so that's given him the power to run this war a billion dollars a day and to your point the sanctions aren't working joe biden is delaying the implemented implementing sanctions on the financial energy sector and and further evidence the ruble's back to pre-war levels interest rates are back to pre-war levels and as you pointed out their oil exports are back to pre-war levels as well joe biden is is actually helping russia i'm afraid so one way or the other senator roger marshall thank you sir we appreciate it very much talk soon folks i'll be

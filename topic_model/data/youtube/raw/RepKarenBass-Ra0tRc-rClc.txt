but first we want to get to congresswoman karen bass to talk about the federal vaccine requirements and a whole lot more of course she represents culver city inglewood west l.a she's negotiating that big george floyd justice and policing act we'll talk about that in a moment but congresswoman good to see you uh let's talk about where where we are at at on covet and and what you make of what the federal government is doing does more need to be done well i absolutely think more needs to be done uh i do think that it was absolutely right for the president to say either get a vaccine or get tested but what i think is that we're slowly moving to mandating vaccines for example the idea that there's a big percentage of people in the military who don't want to get vaccinated and what i think is is that in a minute we're going to be moving to mandates in some areas you know some private companies are already moving to mandates i want to get your reaction to something that the president said today that struck me he said that on a daily basis he receives phone calls from foreign leaders asking for vaccine because their people want it desperately in the meantime here we are in america it's free it's readily available and now it's taking all of this money that you could put to other issues within this country it's it's taking that incentive and you'd think that the the avoidance of death would be incentive enough well you know what i mean i think that it's really sad and you're hearing all of the hospitals say that almost 100 of the people that are hospitalized right now in icu and dying are people who are not vaccinated and you probably have seen some of the interviews of people in the hospital expressing how regretful they are that they did not get vaccinated but you know what that's because the way the um the the way the virus was handled last year the way it got politicized the way dr fauci has been attacked masking has been attacked it's just really sad uh i think that we could have been so much further in conquering this virus if we had not gone through the experience of last year and more variants are going to continue to kick up until the entire world is vaccinated so just to drill down on something you said about mandates do you believe that the military should have a vaccine mandate do you believe that the house of representatives should have a vaccine mandate now they're bringing back the mask mandate but do you think there should be a vaccine mandate to work on capitol hill well i i will tell you that i do think within the military that that it should be mandated and it's hard to say that it would need to be mandated in the house of representatives you know because the problem is is that you see the picture of the house chamber right there well the virus spreads around and 100 of the democrats have been vaccinated in the house 25 of the republicans haven't because 25 of the republicans have had covet two of them have died and so they believe because they've had coveted they don't need to be vaccinated and i think that that's just really bad information and it's sad to say but the members of congress need to be educated more and there are a number of members of congress that are doctors i do believe they are vaccinated and i wish they would talk to their republican colleagues yeah the president saying today this isn't about red states or blue states this is a matter of life and death so let's not politicize this any longer given what alex just said about the mask mandate being imposed on the house floor there are plenty of republicans who are just refusing it so how is that well i mean it's very it's very difficult and so we need to go back to wearing masks we wouldn't have to wear masks if everybody was vaccinated and so you know it's problematic to see my colleagues actually stage a protest i mean it gets to be like high school sometimes you know it's a little embarrassing so they're going to go into the center of the floor and not have their mask on as a protest i mean it's just it's actually pretty uh pathetic unfortunately unfortunately we are seeing covert numbers on the rise we're also seeing crime numbers on the rise we've seen these horrible images of people going into stores and and this feeling with some that there are not enough consequences for these thieves when you see these images what do you think is going on and how do we fix this well i think i think those images are absolutely awful to see people steal like that to know that crime is ticking up but here's what i'm really concerned about i mean after 30 straight years of really harsh sentencing mass incarceration and we're just beginning to institute reforms i don't want to see the progress snap back and i do think that we need to evaluate some of the reforms so for example we release people from prison but you know the big thing that i've been working on in working on specific legislation we need to figure out how to reintegrate people back into communities allow them to work because once you have been incarcerated and have a felony it's very difficult to get employed and so i think while we're talking about reforms we need to talk about unintended consequences we need to be proactive and figure out how to mitigate those problems before reforms uh before some of the reforms go forward you are the author of the george floyd justice in policing act which is now being negotiated between you and cory booker and tim scott in the senate we understand that you've come to an agreement on a framework but we haven't heard a whole lot since then where are we at on the bill and are we looking at an actual deal with real legislative text sometime imminently well i certainly hope so but you know very well that i finished my job in the house on march 3rd it's been in the senate and i've been working with my senate colleagues and the senate process is very very slow so we adjourn tomorrow for the month of august but the senate continues on for a week i know they are making progress you know that a lot of attention is paid to just one aspect of the bill but there's about 20 different pieces of legislation in the bill and so i know that they are trying to reach agreement on many of those areas and i'm certainly hopeful that they will be able to complete their work by the time the senate adjourns next week which means that they would complete their work hopefully they would pass a bill and then the bill would wait until the house goes back into session is that realistic that we could see a bill actually done and passed within the next week i think that it is possible but you know i have thought that before so i'm a little reluctant to say positive we're going to get it done yeah you wanted the may 25th deadline you're passionate about this you will press on congressman karen bass as always we thank you so much for being with us thanks for having me on great to see you

streaming 24 7 from across the country to just around the corner fox weather stream live now on your favorite device oh yes this is a blockbuster announcement the supreme court has voted to overturn roe v wade this decision just came down it's a 213-page decision you're going to read through all of that to find out if there any dissents who dissented what precisely they said and is this ruling precisely the same now as the draft that was leaked earlier tammy bruce still with me i'm concerned look i don't know what the reaction is so far but i'm very concerned about these days of rage which are promised outside the justices homes yes well uh it certainly has not been a secret um we've known what this art what this group has argued they're going to do uh it sounds uh many people have argued that this is like domestic terrorism this has also been an effort to try to influence the court which is a federal crime and yet the department of justice has not acted on that that is and then we had of course the attempted murder of justice uh kavanaugh so so we know that there are unhinged people who are reacting to the rhetoric from the left which has been insightful it has been inappropriate it's also mostly been a lie uh that this does not while roe versus wade is overturned it does not make abortion illegal it simply moves it to the states the court the supreme court does not make law they don't decide what's law and what is not law they say what's constitutional and as a result this means that the states and which which as i've argued feminists and everyone should applaud is that it's closer to your vote that you have more of a chance of controlling and influencing your state legislature and even organizing to influence various state legislatures exactly this is what then the left it prides itself on being able to do and yet they don't do it because they've liked this tension they've liked this division they've wanted this to be able to have these days of rage they issue and and this is i consider a success because of women's power and influence as voters with the majority of voters now and uh our our power in existing uh political office uh in in social issues in general with the internet so this is but however the rhetoric has moved like these groups these left-wing groups to perpetuate any kind of violence and division and that is something all of us should condemn and the doj should act on in arresting individuals they know are conspiring to do any kind of violence against churches against pregnancy centers and against uh supreme court justices why haven't they got an informer inside what's the name of this organization that's threatening daisy it's like ruth sent us and then but that not that group there's a secondary group yeah these are these are ad hoc groups by the way and i remember them when i was on the left ad hoc groups that are formed underneath existing groups that don't dare do something like this they make up names uh and then they're free to make the threats that they want to make anonymously uh and at this point the department of justice perhaps they're doing things that we're unaware of to protect the justices and to deal with these groups like they have jane's revenge jane's revenge so just like they've done with the white supremacist groups and they've like you know raided homes and arrested people this needs to be taken seriously congressman mike waltz is with us republican from the great state of florida carlson uh the the ruling has come down 213 pages of it what's your news today well stu i mean to tammy bruce's point and i think it's worth reinforcing the congress has never passed federal legislation one way or another on abortion that you have a national right to it or or a national ban and that's why uh the roe versus wade decision 50 years ago was so overreaching and so unconstitutional essentially they were legislating from the supreme court uh and and i truly applaud uh it being struck down it was unconstitutional and and also to our appointments back to the states now uh and and it is for the state legis legislators not courts well it's been taken out of the legal role i i think what's important is it's been taken out of the legal constitutional realm and put into the political realm which restores power to voters voters and we the people may now express our opinion on how we want our society to be run i i think in that respect i think this is a good ruling you too but that's not going to be the narrative from the left uh be prepared for the scorched earth tactics uh of the left uh both politically as we head into the midterms uh but also emotionally and trying to ramp people up that do you think it helps them do you think this helps the democrats i'm sorry to interrupt you do you think this helps the democrats i do think it helps the democrats politically because they will use it with essentially that a lie of the narrative that this is some type of national ban uh they want to go after suburban women uh and and and they will twist and turn this narrative but i also think they're going to overreach uh almost assassinating a supreme court justice uh is just unconscionable thank god we passed the law to at least be able to protect their family and authorize law enforcement and by the way stu where's the leaker uh where's the leaker that yes and where's the accountability there uh to try to influence this decision but the justices uh you know stood their ground uh i think this is a correct decision and finally the science has changed and if we can get that narrative out there that uh that unborn babies feel pain they have heartbeats they are lives that deserve uh to be protected uh i think we have to shift the narrative on our side this isn't about women's uh what a woman has a right to do this is about a young baby a young child that deserves a chance uh and this is about children's rights uh as much as it is anything else carlson hold on for a second i'm just trying to bring our audience up to speed on what's happened here the the ruling has come down from the supreme court and roe v wade has been overturned as we said previously this is a 213 page decision it has to be gone through in great detail to find out exactly what is in it hillary vaughn is with us in dc hillary what do you have for what's the latest on this hi stuart great to be with you um so what we're getting trickling in reaction from capitol hill from lawmakers of course some very pleased with this decision and some not very pleased with this decision but you're also getting the very raw visceral reaction from a lot of people standing outside the supreme court if we can put up that video right now while i go through some of the reaction that we're hearing from capitol hill hill one coming from congresswoman corey bush who has been a huge advocate for abortion rights tweeting this abortion care is health care it was so before this and it will remain remain so after this we don't care what a far-right extremist supreme court that is in a crisis of legitimacy says your racist sexist classist ruling won't stop us from accessing the care that we need and we also did get comment from senator amy klobuchar who also saying that basically the fight continues from now until november so democrats very eager to make this a big campaign issue to energize their base headed into the midterm elections but of course you're hearing from a lot of republicans that are happy that this decision has come down one notable one from senator tom cotton who says roe was a tragic mistake taking from the american people and their elected representatives a deeply moral question the supreme court has finally corrected this mistake and i highly commend the millions of americans who toiled for years to achieve this great victory for unborn life and self-government so stuart the bottom line is of course democrats are very happy are unhappy about this republicans are very happy about this we are waiting to hear reaction from the white house and the president specifically to this reaction we expect that something will come today uh probably very soon stewart all right hillary i want to thank you congressman waltz and tammy bruce all of you thank you very much for the coverage that we've delivered over the past few minutes we will stay on the story as it continues to develop all right we've got uh we're going to check the markets real fast this look the roe v wade decision has no impact on the financial markets at all

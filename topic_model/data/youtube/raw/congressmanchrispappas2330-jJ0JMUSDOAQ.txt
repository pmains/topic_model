the bill that I want to mention today deals with the spouse and family of of Veteran who passes away over 155 million dollars that VA was holding on to that should have been dispersed to family members uh and beneficiaries we took that report turned it into legislation and passed it into law Bill shortens the time frame that VA has to designate contact and pay beneficiaries looks to better publicize existing tools that are out there including online tools it also helps beef up the staff at VA that is needed to reach these hard to find beneficiaries I think it's a common sense step I think it just underscores the importance of how we can get it right for the end veteran that often struggles to get the help the care the benefits that they're owed and we expect that the bipartisan work will continue there's been a change in leadership in the house but I don't think that really changes the tenor of the conversations that we're having or the ability to move meaningful legislation just appreciate your service and what you do every day to help veterans New Hampshire already stand ready to do whatever we can in Washington to advance the ball Chris that's not your job description

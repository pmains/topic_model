good morning thank you very much for joining me here today my name is Chris Murphy the honor of representing Connecticut in the United States Senate and I wanted to say a few brief words today about the new crisis enveloping the country surrounding the president's attempt to use a foreign government to try to manipulate the 2020 elections I'm happy at the conclusion of these remarks to answer other questions including those about the status of background checks negotiations with the White House as well I think this is the most serious moment of the Trump administration to date the president is openly admitting to having asked a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 elections the president has admitted to pressing the new president of Ukraine to investigate one of his political opponents and he has also dispatched his political fixer Rudy Giuliani to try to close the deal this is unacceptable in a democracy no president of the United States can use his office can use the national security apparatus of this country to try to interfere in an election to try to destroy his political opponents that this cannot happen in this country and if it is indeed true Congress can't allow it to stand I had heard several months ago that the new Ukrainian president was deeply concerned and confused about the pressure he was getting from the Trump administration to commence an investigation against the Biden family and so I went to Ukraine several weeks ago to meet with the new president to talk to him about these concerns indeed once I got on the ground there I heard about how confused the entire new Ukrainian administration was about the nature of these demands they were getting from the Trump administration to conduct this political investigation and that they worried that the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness at the time to investigate the Biden's they were unwilling to conduct this investigation because there was no merit to it the Ukrainian prosecutors saw no reason to investigate mmm every media outlet that had looked at the charges that the president was living were deemed to be false and so I heard when I was in Ukraine from the president directly his concern about why the aid was being cut off to Ukraine the president also told me he had no interest in interfering in a u.s. election what is happening now is that the president is admitting that he pressed the Ukrainians to conduct these political investigations because he thinks he can get away with it the president thinks he can act with impunity I don't think it really matters whether there was a quid pro quo I don't think it really matters whether the president explicitly told the Ukrainians that they wouldn't get their security aid if they didn't interfere in the 2020 elections there is an implicit threat in every single demand that a United States president makes of a foreign power especially a country like Ukraine that is so dependent on the United States every time the American president asks a foreign country to do something that foreign country knows that if they don't do it there are likely going to be consequences and so it doesn't matter whether the president specifically linked the investigation of his political opponent - the withholding of the aid even if he simply asked a foreign power to interfere in our elections that would be unacceptable in and of itself we just spent a year trying to figure out if the president invited the Russians to interfere in the 2016 elections head the Muller investigation uncovered a phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in which Donald Trump asked Valdemar Putin eight different times to interfere in the 2016 election that would be the smoking gun that Republicans and Democrats had been waiting for and so the question is does it really matter that that phone call simply occurred with a different country I'm gonna give some real thought over the next few days about what to do about this I think it's important for us to get as much information as we can the whistleblower complaint needs to be sent to Congress there is no discretion allowed by the administration on the matter of whether this whistleblower complaint is sent to Congress the law commands the administration to send serious whistleblower complaints to Congress and the executive branch needs to do that ASAP I know the obvious question is whether the house should proceed with impeachment proceedings I have been reluctant to recommend impeachment to the house for a few reasons one of which is that I you know haven't been convinced that senators should be providing recommendations to the house on what is essentially they are sole prerogative but I'm going to give some serious thought to my position on this matter in the coming days because I don't know how I live in a country I help lead a country that allows a president of the United States to openly admit to this kind of corruption and get away with it so I will leave it there and I'm happy to also answer some questions on the status of background checks negotiations as well it was so I so I I have been long involved in us Ukraine relations in large part because we have a strong Ukrainian American population here in Connecticut and that Ukrainian American population is deeply invested in making sure that the u.s. Ukraine relationship remains bipartisan they want to make sure that Republicans and Democrats support Ukraine and that there's no politics involved in US support for Ukraine and that was in part why I brought John McCain here to Connecticut years ago he and I did a joint forum on the importance of bipartisan support for Ukraine so I so I've got to know a lot of leaders in Ukraine and I started to hear from them in the springtime shortly after president szalinski was sworn into office that he was getting pressure from Trump political operatives to begin an investigation into the Biden family i fairly immediately sent a letter to the Foreign Relations Committee asking the committee to open an investigation into these claims and concerns at the time Giuliani was openly admitting that he was having these discussions so it wasn't a state secret the Foreign Relations Committee declined to open that investigation I continued to hear those concerns over the course of the next several months I raised them repeatedly with my Republican colleagues and then I finally made the decision to visit Ukraine for myself to have some of these conversations who you be making a public declaration by the end of this week that you either support impeachment or I don't know III don't know I don't have a I don't have a time frame for it I think in the past to be honest my reluctance to recommend impeachment has been first due to my question as to the proper role of senators in recommending action to the house but also my my question as to whether there was sufficient public support for such an endeavor but I you know I've always weighed those concerns against the seriousness of the actions from the administration I think for me it's always been a balancing act of reasons to withhold a recommendation for impeachment against the gravity of the actions by the administration and certainly this weekend's disclosures make the gravity of the abuse by the White House even more serious and that will factor into you know the decision that I make in terms of my public position on this matter the assets of the house right so it were the Senate ultimately would be the juror and and the house we ultimately will have nothing to say about impeachment unless the house votes to send the matter to the United States Senate now that has not stopped some of my other Senate colleagues from making recommendations to the house that is not improper I just have not done that as of yet just helps him with his face of the election I mean you know in impeachment is a political process it's not a legal process so it's not it's not out of bounds to consider the political implications of impeachment given that it is a political process I I just worry that the president is daring this country to hold him in check I just I was you know I thought it was extraordinary that the president admitted to the country that he had engaged in a fundamental corruption of his office he did that I believe because he thinks that he acts with impunity these days and we've all got to consider you know can consider that and I have talked with Democratic and Republican senators this weekend and I think that I'm not saying that there are Republicans that are going to recommend impeachment but there is concern from both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the president is engaging in an activity that raises new levels of concern you should but I think the first I think what's what's important first is for this whistleblower complaint to be sent to Congress I mean there's there's no legal question around whether the whistleblower complaint has to be sent to Congress but remember that what we know is that the sum total of the president's pressure campaign on szalinski is not contained in that one phone call I mean the president has been sending political representatives to the zalenski government since the spring to try to pressure them to do his political work so we also shouldn't believe that that that one phone call between Trump and szalinski represents the the full scope of the administration's actions to try to get the Ukrainians to interfere in the elections remember Pompeyo was asked yesterday whether the State Department itself had facilitated these these demands of the Ukrainians to investigate Trump's political opponents and he would not answer that question so it is it is very possible that the State Department itself has been involved in this conspiracy the vice president's connection to Ukraine given what we know about him going to that country in 2016 and trying to oust the top prosecutor that led an investigation as the oil company this has been debunked by everyone that has looked into it the the prosecutor at the time was corrupt through and through everyone was asking the Ukrainians to get rid of him the IMF was asking the Ukrainians to get rid of him the Americans the French the British the EU it was an open-and-shut case that this prosecutor was was corrupt and and had to go Vice President Biden was making the same ask of the Ukrainians that everyone else was asking so you know this is you know this is simply a a political career of the White House that by the way morphs by the hour I mean yesterday the Secretary of State was on TV accusing Vice President Biden of election interference and what what does he mean whose election is the alleging that Vice President Biden interfered in the Ukranian election is he alleging that Vice President Biden interfered in the 2016 election I mean it's it's a sign of how there is no connection between the things that this administration says about Joe Biden or anything else and the truth and you know Pompeo said claimed the vice president yes yesterday Pompeo claimed the vice president interfered in an election and no one seems to be outraged by that no one seems to be asking questions of Pompeo today what is the nature of the allegation that the secretary of the state of the United States just lever did levied against the former the former vice president but it's a sign of how loose they are playing with the truth so I mean I just I'm gonna disclose all of the private conversations I have but it's absolutely logical that the I don't need people to verify for me that a foreign leader would be confused when they are getting overtures from political representatives of the president we don't do that in this country we don't have campaign operatives of the President of the United States traveling the world asking foreign governments to interfere in American elections and if you were a foreign leader it stands to reason you would be slightly flummoxed if you got a visit from the president's personal lawyer asking you to conduct investigations into candidates that are running against him so yes I had confirmation from people that visited me from Ukraine telling me that this was an issue but I mean frankly you don't need that confirmation it's obviously a problem if the president is sending his campaign operatives around the world to get foreign governments to manipulate American politics I've been pretty open about what Solinsky said to me so szalinski opened the meeting by raising concerns about this money being withheld so he was deeply concerned about the impact that it would have on Ukrainian security to lose this military funding and then later in the meeting I raised with him specifically the issue of Rudy Giuliani's overtures to him and his team at the time I didn't know that the president has rate had raised this directly with zolensky I you know I cautioned him that by getting involved in the 2020 election he was going to potentially destroy the bipartisan nature of the u.s. Ukraine relationship and and after watching what we had just gone through and trying to discover whether Russia was involved in the 2016 election the last thing Ukraine should want is to be the subject of investigations as to their role in the 2020 election he gave me a very strong answer he was ready for the question he told me that he had no interest in getting involved in the 2020 election that he understood the damage it would do to the u.s. Ukraine relationship if he did get involved and I left you know very confident that he was going to reject the overtures from the administration and I was glad I was glad about it yeah so the conversation that the conversation in question July 25th September so the week of Labor Day so so much late so I mean I was there you know over a over a month over a month later Ron Johnson yes and I he was with me as I raised this issue with others in Ukraine the president wasn't the only person that I brought this concern this concern up with well we were there the the our Embassy in Ukraine told us that they had not been involved in these political demands of szalinski and you know my my interpretation of their of their refusal to get involved was that they believed they were improper again I'm now concerned that I didn't get the full story because the fact that Pompeo is now refusing to say whether the State Department was involved may suggest that there there there was some work being done by others in the Trump administration beyond the President himself and he actually asked for your help too now I'm that not on the question of the Trump campaigns overtures he did ask us to intervene to unlock the aid he made a passionate case as to why Ukraine needed that military aid and he asked us to ramp up our efforts to convince the president to change his mind the a was ultimately released after the it became clear after the whistleblower complaint was was made well I don't know but I'm very worried that we are going to start focusing on the question of whether there was an explicit quid pro quo and that's why I said at the beginning there is an implicit threat to every demand the president makes of foreign leaders and so to me it doesn't matter whether the president you know explicitly told szalinski that he would lose his aid if he didn't conduct this investigation the president should never be asking foreign leaders to interfere in American elections period stop it doesn't matter whether there was a explicit quid pro quo what the president did was a core what the president has admitted to was a fundamentally corrupt act and Republicans and Democrats need to acknowledge that coming back in May earlier this year and the other piece investigate this and well you're asking them again do you do you expect that there'll be some sort of hearings or some sort of oversight I'm you know I'm not holding my breath that Mitch McConnell is going to you know open up an investigation of President Trump on this matter given his reluctance to investigate any of the other Trump administration corruption but the house is investigating the Ukraine matter I think they have three different investigations already open to understand the nature of the election interference requests made by the administration so I have not had any communication with the Trump administration since last Wednesday night when I met with the Attorney General I don't think that's coincidental I think the White House has been in crisis management mode since the whistleblower complaint was made public and so I don't know whether the White House is going to be willing to reengage on background checks given the crisis that is currently unfolding I thought the proposal that the Attorney General was making was a fairly good faith effort to bridge the divide on background checks there were some things in it I think need to change but it was a basis for a negotiation and you know I have told the administration from the beginning that I can't get all I can't get all my Democratic colleagues to support a measure that's less than universal background checks there will be many Democrats who will not be willing to settle for less than universal background checks I think this is so important that we should be willing to compromise and if I get a call from the White House that they are interested in having negotiations over the bar proposal I will be there I will have that conversation i-i-i-i I think I can you know walk and chew gum at the same time I'm going to continue to lead the outcry against the president's actions in Ukraine but I also understand that if we have the opportunity to save lives by changing the country's gun laws we shouldn't forsake that opportunity [Music] you know the president's instincts are not wrong that you need to start cutting down on at least the ways in which vaping is marketed to children guns every single you know every single day and remember he says that he's he continues to represent that he's a strong supporter of the Second Amendment well so am i there's nothing inconsistent with strongly supporting the Second Amendment and requiring that everybody prove that you're not a criminal before you buy before you buy a gun you know the president now the NRA has come out against the bar proposal the White House has a difficult fundamental choice to make they can only get a meaningful deal on background checks if they take on the NRA and I I think the Republican Party is at an inflection moment today where they realize that they can't stick with the NRA any longer that they're gonna get wiped out in Congress if they continue to do the NRA is bidding but I don't know they figured out how to make that break yet and and that decision is in front of the White House right now given the NRA s position on the bar proposal if your colleagues are unwilling to accept anything less than universal background checks what are you willing to accept well I think the focus well I mean I can give you a little sense of that I'm at the very least we need to be requiring background checks on all commercial sales so these are sales that are advertised or sales that are done at a gun show you know I would I think the background check should be required for every private sale of a gun regardless of whether it's advertised and so so that's my that's my baseline is that at least all commercial sales should be covered and I think the the essence of manchin-toomey and the essence of the bar proposal you'll meet that bottom line for me so if so universal background checks means that you know even if you're selling a gun to a neighbor you have to go through a five minute background check when we say commercial sales we mean a sale that you have put up on you know a gun that you have advertised on the internet or a gun that you're making available to consumers at a gun show you know essentially a sale that you needed to you needed marketing or advertising in some way to consummate and that's the difference between universal background checks which we have in Connecticut in Connecticut it doesn't matter you know whether you're selling your gun to a friend or you're selling it at a gun show that sale needs to have a background check associated with it so the number of sales today that aren't covered by background checks it's hard to know but it could be upwards of thirty percent of gun sales sales not not gifts or loans sales right now happen through the private market and so of that thirty percent I don't know that we that we have good data to know how many of them would not be covered by something like manchin-toomey all right guys thank you very much appreciate it yep thank you

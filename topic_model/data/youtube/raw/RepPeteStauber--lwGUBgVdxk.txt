Thank You mr. chair and ranking member graves I am honored to be an original co-sponsor of this legislation with my colleague Congressman Joyce to increase the authorization for the Great Lakes restorative initiative the bill enjoys strong bipartisan support from Great Lakes region members which is illustrating its importance from Lake Superior down to Lake Ontario while my district follows the north shore of Lake Superior mr. Joyce's district rests along the banks of Lake Erie the Great Lakes restoration initiative provides crucial pollution pollution control endangered species mitigation and research on countless other topics to both of our districts and all districts in between this program works through 15 different executive branch agencies institutions of higher education nonprofits and state and local governments and Native American tribes to administer nearly 5,000 projects benefiting our Great Lakes in my district the GL RI funds a project for the Fond du Lac band of Lake Superior Chippewa to help end the spread of aquatic invasive species throughout their territory while also partnering with our state Pollution Control Agency to ensure the st. Louis River remains clean although these are just two examples of the nearly 5,000 projects listed they illustrate the glr eyes project diversity we must continue the strong tradition of keeping our Great Lakes and ecosystems pristine and it's crucial we move this bill out of committee and to the House floor mr.

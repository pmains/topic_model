Thank You mr. chairman welcome let's start by talking about Sudan as you know last month in Sudan president of al Bashir was removed from power after three decades of brutal oppression there worrying signs however that Sudan's new rulers are going to drag out any transition to true democracy and perhaps indefinitely in your judgment what is the role of development assistance in building up Sudanese institutions we are obviously very supportive of a transition to a peaceful and democratic Sudan we think that the people of Sudan have spoken loudly and clearly they want to return to civilian government and we look forward to hopefully the day where we're able to support and strengthen just that do you anticipate any significant problems distributing aid or promoting USA IDs mission under Sudan's current governance we do provide humanitarian assistance now were the largest donor to the people of Sudan in terms of humanitarian we provided over 250 million of humanitarian assistance in 2018 but again as I've said before humanitarian assistance is treatment not cure I mean that that obviously is not the long-term answer the long-term answer is fostering citizen responsive governance and we think that's what the people of Sudan has been protesting for and we're all very very hopeful but also deeply concerned as you've characterized we need to see that transition occur I think it's it's important for Sudan and it's important for all of us yeah I agree but let's let's shift to Nicaragua I'm also deeply concerned about the political trends in Nicaragua and your take a regime last year I passed legislation along with Senator Menendez and congressman Ross Layton to impose targeted sanctions and restrictions on loans to Nicaragua and and the mandate a civil society engagement strategy the legislation was signed into law December 2018 assistance plays an important role in our nicaragua strategy including democracy assistance what is USAID strategy for ensuring that our development assistance in Nicaragua is used in a way that promotes our priorities and values Thank You senator and thank you for quite frankly for for raising the issue of Nicaragua and focusing on it we agree with you very strongly ortega is a brutal tyrant who has clearly shown no regard whatsoever not only for democratic rights but for the well-being of his own people first i i think we all need to salute the extraordinary courage of young Nicaraguan activists and democracy voices under the harshest of of crackdowns they have continued to be loud and clear on calling for democracy we see ourselves as a crucial lifeline to them and so in the last year we provided support directly to the Nicaraguan people 17.6 million for nicaragua through oti as we call transition initiatives to promote first off to provide some civil society support and reinforcement but provide some relief for these these folks also our voice has been consistent in calling for justice rule of law and a restoration to democratic order we won't back down just as the young people of Nicaragua will not back down thank you let's shift to Venezuela the history of development assistance in Venezuela has been a complicated one for decades Chavez Maduro and and their thugs had used foreign aid as a weapon meanwhile the country is spiraled into catastrophe which is required USAID to coordinate with other agencies and assets in the region including SOUTHCOM in your judgment what steps can USAID take both in Venezuela and elsewhere to ensure that badly needed aid is not diverted by regimes like the one in Venezuela thank you as to Venezuela and assistance I guess I'd offer a couple of things first I want to thank all of you I want to thank the members of this committee in this body for its support for our democracy assistance work in Venezuela over the years both sides of the aisle the first time that I met Juan Guido face-to-face had spoken two months in the phone but face to face he thanked me for that that's what he think before he thanked me for the support that we have provided to civil society but in particular the National Assembly he's of course the leader of the National Assembly and thus the interim president and that is a reminder to all of us of just how important these investments are we need to stay engaged and support democracy civil society young democratic voices and so first and foremost we wouldn't be here if not for those investments and I'm grateful on the humanitarian side it is an extraordinarily difficult situation obviously so we have mentioned we have pre-positioned assistance in a number of places we welcome the announcement by the International Red Cross Red Crescent that they are trying to to find ways to see that assistance can be delivered in country not subject to diversion from Maduro and his regime and i you know i can tell you more in a different setting but we will make sure that our assistance does not get politically weaponized as it is as assistance has too often in the past by Maduro he's used it to punish enemies to reward friends and obviously we're not going to let that happen in terms of our assistance thank you thank you we think

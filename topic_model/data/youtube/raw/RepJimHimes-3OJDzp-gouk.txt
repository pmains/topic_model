now is congressman jim Himes of connecticut who serves on the House Intelligence and Financial Services committee's he's a Democrat from Connecticut and also a chief Washington correspondent Peter Cook joining us as well but congressman let's start with you some strong words coming out from Lindsey Graham saying that look we are going to have to commit ground troops you say well I say it's unfortunate when a united states senator uses language like he used that we're all going to get killed at home part of the problem in the debate here of course going some parts of the public sentiment though yeah but but but first of all he's being inflammatory and he's scaring people at a time when we need deliberation and secondly he's sort of flying in the face of something that most people who understand anything about the region understand which is that if this becomes a US war against Isis that is a war that we probably can't win I mean yes can we destroy you know people's armored vehicles yes but if Isis has the opportunity to frame this as the u.s. against Islam which is what they want we are in a lot of troubles so the senator is just plain wrong we need to do the hard work of building an international coalition in which Sunni Arab states are plainly part of that coalition but okay you know I know secretary Kerry talked about you know the use of the word war but but congressman to defeat Islamic state defeat the militants now though it's got to be more than airstrikes is it not well that's right but look we need to be very clear about what it is that we can accomplish here these are people who when they are gathered in formations or you know driving armored vehicles across the desert we can find them and we can kill them we're actually quite good at that but they will of course as soon as we start that effort but you do believe we can defeat on air strikes alone no no my point is that if we use the word defeat we are talking about eliminating a group that can blend into a local village where they will get support and yes that does imply not just boots on the ground hopefully not ours but it implies a larger effort to try to eradicate the kind of conditions that allow a group that is as poisonous as this one to flourish Peter wouldn't make it what do you make of what congressman jim Himes is saying which is that is virtually impossible for us to get rid of islamic state what are other congressional leaders saying about the objectives of these airstrikes well they're certainly a number of Republicans in particular who question whether or not it is enough to truly defeat Isis as the president has pointed out whether or not we can outsource if you will the job of taking Isis on on the ground with the Syrian rebels who maybe we can't trust right now those are some of the questions that are out there my question to congressman hi miss Betty if is first of all on the specific notion of providing support for the Syrian rebels and arming those rebels are you prepared to vote YES on that and what about the larger question broader use of force authorization are you prepared to have that debate perhaps in the lame duck session of Congress and would the president get the support of Congress if it comes to that yeah Peter look I think it's essential and I've said this and a lot of my colleagues have said this I think it's essential that we have this debate on the floor of the Congress and that the president come to the Congress for authorization to undertake hostilities if you want to use the word war or not hostilities that that in my view anyway are not authorized by the original authorization for the use of military force against Osama bin Laden and associated al-qaeda so I do think we need to have that debate though I'm sorry if you have that debate are you prepared to vote yes and do you think most of Congress is prepared to vote yes well look I you sit on the Intelligence Committee so I've probably had more access to these so-called moderate rebels than most and I have profound misgivings about that part of the plan now by the way I support the president's desire to step up airstrikes to you know protect the Yazidis to try to avoid genocide to keep our people safe but I think we need to really understand what we're getting into when we're talking about spending half a billion dollars to support a bunch of people in Syria that we say we're going to vet but we don't really know where that goes frankly our history there has not been terribly good this is exactly the kind of conversation we need to have on the floor of the of the Congress now Peter I just want to make a quick quick switch not only is Congress considering these actions against Islamic state but there are also considering actions at home when it comes to these and version deals what are we going to hear from Jack Lew if we are going to hear anything before tomorrow well the expectation Betty is first of all that Congress is not going to have the time or the inclination to take on this issue of inversion right now before the midterm election is just not going to happen we've gotten that message already from Senate Republicans not not really serious there is a possibility maybe in the lame duck session of Congress so the pressures on Jack Lew and he has told us that is there in the very near future he leaves for Australia tomorrow Betty there's some questions whether or not he might have to do something before he leaves and congressman you get the last word you you actually say our corporate taxes are too high here yeah look and you know what do we mean by what are we going to do something out of about inversions could we put a bandaid on it make it harder for people to do this of course we could but but to your point what we really need to do here is comprehensive tax reform which which includes making for a more competitive tax code that means not having the highest statutory rate in the world and it means not having the complexity there can you believe we'll get to that well that's a separate question I'm not going to happen before the election no absolutely not maybe not happen within the next certainly not within the next few weeks at all which is a the possibility of getting some decision out of the Treasury secretary all right congressman thank you so much thank you buddy congressman jim Himes of connecticut

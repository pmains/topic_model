Some thought it would never happen. The Supreme Court taking away a woman's right
to choose. A right to privacy that existed for almost
fifty years. It's extreme and dangerous. Now some D.C. politicians want to ban all
abortions with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the mother. As a doctor and mother, I am outraged. As your congresswoman, I won't stand for it. I'm Kim Schrier and I approve this message
because this fight is now.

my understanding Taylor I work for comparison like alcohol thank y'all for arranging congressman McCaul and Congress on Matsui or been running all the weights several that will have them here soon just in the interest of time we're just going to kind of kick things are not so get the conversation started the listening to don't know Congress McCall is the co-founder and co-chair of all the high-tech caucus and the childhood cancer caucus worked recovers from the Matsui on high-tech and congressmen have been common from Maryland on childhood cancer issues and so when we heard that Dell and TJ were retaining up to do some work using cloud technology to help better understand a very rare and aggressive form of childhood cancer older West ola this issue seemed to be kind of really write up my losses alley across this over two issues you've worked on lots it also happens to Dell is located just barely outside of my bosses districts in Austin and selling a lot of constituents you work for dell we're very proud of the work they're doing going to let see gutom kennesaw here today miss communes executive director of kids vs cancer and she's gonna be talking a little bit about what this is mike from a patient perspective one day gentle is a help to give next day he emergency brain surgery and he built rebound he had difficulty speaking he was erect sick he had minimal control over all cancer pediatric cancer is a terrible terrible this and how devastating each other as a child use your child there was supported mr. child yesterday was Jacob's moving update for eighth grade and all the stresses school were there wasn't there to the instances so that's that's what you this is apparent and I think that's what we as a society guard against eternally so in the next I page and you know what my family is like now that our last Christmas capture jacob is just a photograph he died 10 years old and why did he die you die because we just haven't done enough to figure out what kind of drugs effectively treat kids for the answer in fact from the last 20 years the FDA has only had an initial approval of one pediatric cancer drug this is really disappointing our community I think we need multipro for multi-pronged approach to address the serious challenge in forming kids vs cancer I've been working with congressman McCaul and andy taylor butterfield and holland on creating her back which thrilled 58 authorization bill the creating go back provides financial incentives for pediatric drug development for new drugs but what else can be done and one other approach that I think is very important to discuss for here today is personalized medicine approach which dell auntie jen are focusing on and we've in the pediatric cancer we are so so appreciated with that what does that mean as a parent you know when Jacob was diagnosed we learned by the way that Jacobs disease was refractory to treatment which I that was not responding to the practice was receiving Jacob will followed a trial which is what most busy cancer and our media question for oncologist was does Jacob really fit the population that that is kind of population of this trial you know it's kids with a certain diagnosis and certain other parameters because if there's subpopulation of kids like Jacob who just aren't responding to treatment in his he can be one of the kids who survives or not and your oncologist couldn't answer the question the primary investigator the trial couldn't answer the question and the answer was about the answer was that we now know didn't have five years ago that there are many subtypes Angelo blastoma Jacobs disease and these kids were different some types of different genetic profiles respond differently to chemotherapy and Jacob subtype he's got respond it was a waste because we did not done enough research of times and so that's why I think a personalized approach for a kill like Jacob who is refractory to treatment you know really might result in safeguards save lives and that's so important while is personalized medicine really appropriate for pediatric cancer supposed other standing up here telephone by sorority I think the need is so great and what we've done is so minimal that it's really really should start but I want to bring up a couple other reasons why pediatric cancers revision focus our attention to personalized strategies person's essence directions first of all parents of children with cancer are desperately living absolutely anything and we are more tolerant to risks of toxicities or just unknown outcomes and crafts and you know our kids may not survive million we are understand the risks we are educated you would be amazed educator even uneducated arms are we've got very bright they have the capacity to understand the risks second of all as our following students will tell you there are a lot of dishes around privacy together personalized medicine trouser and creating databases which will inform medical research guide for parents of kids with cancer do not care about privacy we don't care if all you know my entire genetic history my husband's Jenna history in fact donated Jacobs tissue researchers Mike and I provided blood samples waived all privacy rights we just don't care and our friends they don't care either nobody hears about privacy HIPAA and IRB regulations which are intended to protect families from some privacy are not a good match what do I go for in the future I hope this project or TJ with dell expands so that it serves not only kids with your lesson wonderful children and I hope there's opportunity to thank well my name is assessed scientists research institute and it will be my pleasure today to tell you about our innovative projects isn't time that was going to thanks easy well they say that content apologize i served on the ethics committee which doesn't make you popular number of Congress bills tied up in meetings but I'm prior to kickoff is jointed childhood cancer caucus in high-tech caucus that one of a detail teaching for being I'm very proud blood elves employees normal districts and Michael Dell's not too far down the road and I scissors until Vlad was just like that I just want to give a shout out to what delves down from childhood cancer in terms of donating and cloud computing space to TJ which is a basically a genome project to combat neuroblastoma which is as made you know the children is a very legal in almost every case very life-threatening condition they kill so many birds out there so I went back down without reckoning donation of cloud computing the financial donations made millions dollars towards research and development in childhood cancer on earth have you spoken room you have to thank you so the Nancy may have told you about the creative note back passage overwhelmingly in the house this is the first childhood cancer drug bill that we have had passed in the history of the Commerce and but it's very significant I can't take the credit Nancy at the author I always say no bows the vehicle wouldn't help get it through and you would think something like this to be very easy thing to get past but it was not we a lot of road block blocks and obstacles pulled down and Nancy to help out my wife was God secret weapons first club board md anderson shares each other kitchen at committee and we pull Briana a fourteen-year-old cancer survivor the National spokes woman I guess or girl if you will phenomenal spirit and actually had heard filed a bill she lobbied members I was on the floor it was just a tremendous day to see it is hard for members to say no to and so we have got 180 co-sponsors at the end of the day we file I convince mr. lash it was a good idea he get in the end support of the bill and it's on its way to the Senate and all conversations I've had with the Senate that looks very positive where you get to the President's desk by and hopefully by before the August recess so I know that's not what this is this is more about to teach n and cloud computing what Del's going but I thought is accounted meet a nice marriage between you know high tech and the childhood cancer issue now you can use technology to defeat the number one killer of children in this country and so with that thanks very much for being here particularly Nancy and I'll turn it over to our panelist ok so again we're here to represent just a phenomenal project supported by Dow Lodge convert and we're going to start off by showing you a little video to introduce the incentive behind the project you heard from Nancy how important this is we wanted to talk a little bit about incentive and then going to loop of the details of other projects it's and how cloud computing is going to pediatric cancer no master lock is the pediatric cancer the cancer seen in kids today last 16 years of age 62 more than nervous system missed answered only by hand for a fraction a few percent today we use chemotherapy that a technical body that fifty percent of those kids are going to be laughs and when they do be upstairs no care every nerve law stuff is a little bit different than what you want to do is use high performance computing and new areas like genomics really targeted treatment two thousand teachers really focused on truck repair medical advances or the Human Genome Project it's a medical benefit for patients with series of diseases and disorders it took us ten years and almost 3 billion dollars to see what's the first genome it now takes us only 10 days and will be a few thousand dollars to sequence that you know you're not a dated as in generating into this test is are out there any care bunch potentially what you're asking people to do analytically is basically taking subjects like a long library to make shredding totally shortening and then putting it back together there's so much data coming out that we want to be able to help them versus gap in his day the most effectively data ringless country asian can't wait two months for trade that had to them especially which i was there about some of the disease was very quickly dell technologies in America TGM speed at the time taste now between diagnosis and the correct treatment they're finding today at several months our technology that I've found today's what we're building is a club that allows us to be able to store all this data in a shared environment and allows us to incorporate this remarkable technology really works on the back computer systems love the dells in order to really make a difference for any commodities and you know the story elements and post-acute so I'm early running leading edge techniques that really change the waiting list genomics research is done I think by doing this sequencing you're going to find the Achilles heels and many childhood cancers the lessons learned this time of the project will be exceedingly useful many of the common cancers that something or family simmers this is definitely the future of Medicine it becomes a model for how you need cancer he shifted forward adding birthday anniversary at any other aspects though several steps are sold out success this effort is helping the person who sit in front of us right now I can't wait to share the devil family work with many different stories so with that introduction let me now start to talk a little bit of a science sitting and I'm here representing the science at each end the work that presents a real team effort so there's a tremendous number of people involved on the clinical side the genome generation of data the interpretation of data and the newest arsenal in the battle against pediatric cancer is dealt with with the compute infrastructure that you'll see that it's really accelerated this process and the ability to communicate collaboration clouds so let me let's start with this slide so first of all let's talk about the old model of how the patients are treated today we call it evidence-based medicine evidence-based medicine essentially says that if you have a disease like neuroblastoma or mental questo or any other pediatric cancer it's defined based on the anatomical location of the disease or the type of tumor but it's not really mechanistically defined and when you take the treatment often what you get is a very small subset it is maybe 20 or 30 respond when you try to do drug development advance a new treatment it has to be the standard of care and if it's only twenty percent it won't get improved as a drug so we lose a lot of drugs that don't get developed in fact a lot of adult drugs that really get tested here and in this bill that just heard about is going to obviously change that so we're very grateful for legislation like that but nonetheless we want to move towards a model that doesn't generate this type of data if you go to the next slide we can start them out curl the molecular features of a tumor so genetic changes happen within the tumor cell that changed the way it responds to a drug we can measure those now in stratify patients three-point use we call this information based message to choose individual biomarkers and tailor the treatment against those specific genetic changes that's what's been happening the last five or so years in the field that we've been getting a little better at class on disease not just based on anatomical features are physiological features but getting down to biomarkers where we really want to go the destination is in the next slide because that is where we want to collect entire genomes we want to look at the entire set of features that could be altered measure them all come up with exactly the tailored interpretation of what's wrong with that Cooper and choose from hundreds of therapeutic options and choose the one that's tailored that's just right for that patient and by doing so greatly increase the chance that that child will respond and we're starting with the greatest unmet need we're starting with tumors that are going to be refractory to other treatments we're starting with tumors where the patients have no other hope other than to find something new that is not a standard of care that is tailored the question is how do we do that how do we take billions of measurements and translate them into a therapy adoption and then the answer is it's an integration of genomic technologies and computational methodologies this slide shows that we start with characterization of it operations so I won't talk about it today but there's very sophisticated technologies that allow us to probe into the molecular features of a tumor but then interpreting those requires a lot of competition too just to have you heard a knock off talked about the taking along my burden previous with shredder and then trying to realign it again that requires a lot of competition currently it takes anybody else in the world it's about seven days just in computing that decision to get to the answer with dell's health we've been able to reduce that down to a single day and we just started the project in November so already that we've been able to get get dramatic acceleration and the reason that's important is you only have two weeks to make that type of decision you have to move fast and and these technologies to make a big difference then the other thing is we want to support of knowledge Network so the collaboration cloud allows us did not just store genomic information but linkage is therapeutic options and share it across distributed tubes so so for example this trial is involves multiple groups so we've got teaching represented up there we also have an angle Research Institute for dr. shoulder and her colleagues resign we're also linked to the NCI or some of the data in general analyze and there's about 18 clinical sites that are distributed throughout the US this network of collaborating clinical and research groups requires infrastructure to connect them that's what the bell cloud does that we have what we call the kids cloud kids them for knowledge integration of that American system it connects all of those groups the clinician scientists and and we way to developing portals for the families to power them to participate in their own healthcare all of this provides a collaborative environment and ecosystem that supports these types of trials so just walk completely through the workflow this starts with the patient you've recruited into the clinical trial the patient's tumor is biopsied a specimen is collected DNA and RNA is isolated from the tumor and analyzed using the genomic technologies we call that molecular profiling and then those technologies allows us to process that information again not in a week but in a day and then the process information is presented as pathway and therapeutic options to the genomic super bored again these are a group of physicians they may be geographically distributed they're multidisciplinary teams clinicians and scientists they come together as a team to cure the kids I mean it takes a village to cure again this is how we integrate it a global village I think technologies the personal treatment plan to use on and the treat the patient is treated and we learn one and as we're going to we're going to treat hundreds of kids in the by the end of this trial should have about seven hundred iterations of learning of applying two moments to see what the outcome is and with each iteration of treating a child in learning something we hope to create a national model for how to advance this technology to improve it really creative learning system to advance how we get better outcomes for these kids so I'll switch it over now to dr. talkin so I guess I want to start a little bit by tellin you you know why this is important to tell you know a lot of a company like that'll really be interested in this so we were looking for a way to have the largest healthcare life sciences IT team in the world or about 13,000 people in our division and we were looking for a way to use our foundation to really drive or with a huge change in clinical health care and I called Jeff Trent up and said Jeff you know we've been talking about personalized medicine for the last 15 years we've known each other 15 years when talking about for 15 years now and you know now with this next generation of sequencing technology coming in and the next generation of high performance computing we're actually a point where we can actually make clinically relevant decisions for the patient so if you told you in the video that you know the human genome project took ten years of cost three billion dollars just a couple years ago you know would it cost millions of dollars say five years ago it cost millions of dollars and would have taken six or nine months to do a full genome you know a couple years ago it would cost a million dollars and it would have taken nine months and lastly we did one in four days and moved it to the tumor board so now we're really clinically relevant so that's a huge change in the way that we're approaching things and what we really want to do is we want to give these patients the best chance they can do if you know how drugs have been a pharmaceutical chemistry background the way drugs were developed historically a bunch of chemists at in a lab and mixed stuff together says that looks like a drug and then they tried it for different kinds of conditions a drug like lipitor you know which is one of those widespread drugs in the world works in about sixty percent of patients you know twenty percent of patients it has no effort at all and another twenty percent of the up serious side effects at Riverside you know what you want to do with personalized mez really target the drug to the tumor so that it only has the effect on the tumor and doesn't have all these extra side effects and that's why you know things like pedes we haven't had very many much testing or on drugs so really important we start to test these drugs and children and make sure that we really understand you know what the right doses are how we treat them effectively and this this thing is kids are really good chance of mean these kids with this disease you know about three percent of them after they come out of remission live a year so we want to get it on the drug as fast as possibly get about one chance to get them on the drug because you know these chemo cycles take a few months and they want the kids to have some time to rest in between cycles and you know you can probably do one or two cycles you want to make sure you get them on the right drug now so the next chart so what we've done is we installed one of the largest supercomputers in the world's about eight teraflop machine if you want to get as a trillion operate per sentence our very very large super computer from what TJ TJ had a largely / computer before that took up a holes data center essentially we've actually increased the performance of their data center about twelve hundred percent so it's a huge increase in what they're doing we take in what they could do from days and weeks down to I think the last calculation so that the the really stretched over joining into is try to get this down at one day for the analysis and last week we did it in six hours or thing so we end our stretch goal with one day now our stretch goal is going to be the whole simulation do the test on Friday when we come in on Monday it's done so that would be really excited for so you can really you know we don't want to make these parents wait a long time they figure out what they're going to do with your kids either so getting this done as quickly as possible for me hmm I really think this is going to have a huge effect on the way on the way you know you're going to treat the kids and then you know you said that we'd like this to be the model for pediatric cancer growing what we think it is going to be the one we're not just interested in just neuroblastoma the reason we did this thing was we thought you know this is the toughest cancer there is and if we get tired really go after it it will start working for other cancers so we're really proud of the company we are this car are our team and dal you know is very involved in this week of scientists that are helping to tune the codes and got scientists that are involved in helping to develop things like the portals and several publications and we're really excited about the idea you'll be an associated with this group of people cancer some so thanks three times then anybody have any questions for 13 per se applaud del antigens it's really fascinating estate investor she ate and maybe to get kind of simplify it for those of us who are doctors but Miss weird it's very targeted approach and and so you identify the particular gene that's causing the scalar decided you divide the tortoises yeah so mean there's about 150 cancer drugs out there right 19 therapy drugs and we know what pathways are targeted you know we know when when a tumor form a certain pathway is activated and we target that pathway with the drug we know what drugs target which pathways and so historically the way they've done it if they said they thought that you know all neuroblastomas are the same so they every doctor we're trying to say chemotherapy so they wouldn't work and now we know you know that there's lots of different kinds of neuroblastoma target to the individual pathway of the drug you know so we target the drug threat to the pathway and he killed go ahead and kills the cancer without intervention Tristan's body that's the idea I mean there's still side effects of these drugs really time when we really getting down so we start develop these things individually for kids you may know the least number or side effects for the children who survived she's always be these survivors and cancer landrum lived editions of whole life that can you tell us about these successes originally sure I mean one of the biggest successes that we've seen in first lesson in Pediatrics has been in there a bus coma and medulloblastoma what we've seen for example durable responses in neuroblastoma but but just to answer your question about patients in more specifically here's there's a set of genes that fall into a pathway pathway simply means a set of biochemical steps that are in the sequence and so it's not one gene it's any one of these genes in this pathway this property how this we call the Hedgehog signaling pathway and meet there there's a set of genes that are mutated within that conference or answer that one of those cancer types happens to be eventual blastoma and and if there are mutations in this gene it creates a vulnerability to inhibitors of that pathway now these drugs would have never been tested in pediatric cancer but in toad am bahnhof to say wait a minute i know of a few indications starting to basal cell carcinoma but then also mention less than where we know the dirty vacations and password you can predict that there's going to be a sensitivity and when that was tried and you've seen miraculous response as I mean metastatic cancer hearing we've seen the same thing happened in the breast cancer and other cancer types just you know we can legitimately claim now that we have curative intent before the best we can hope for with patients that have metastatic refractory cancers palliative which means we just you know we create some comfort to the patient and then come in on PDF answer you know adult cancer who seen it the company's I am Jenna Genentech of delaware's for coming things like not a little poem of that you know if you have the right unit I'd a ninety-seven percent of the time that eliminates the cancer son so we we know we have models that really work it's exciting you know now that you know this new genome technology that's coming in to actually do these testing them and a real clinically relevant put your clothes on pediatric this work this potentially plus all yeah we're starting to bring some that need for pediatric and the other guy mentioned here how that you know Nancy talk about a little bit more butters we really don't have access to the experimental therapeutics that we have access to an adult answers when you're looking at the genome it it opens up a whole universe of therapeutic option because you can discover things there that it may be an experimental drug late you want to bring in but it's very difficult to clean those it's credible computers in pediatrics and in fact even if you see signal is very hard to get those approved through pediatric conditions and of course that's where we want to bring both the signings and the technologies but also with legislation together to change that should be pretty much better right so the PSU is that their school you know with the drug oncology drugs developed for an adult education which drugs are developed and if the drug proves not to be affected for that adult education it's never tested in kids and there are numerous cases now we're pediatric cancer drug developers are hoping that unapproved drugs will be just because they have alternative evidence that these drugs be very effective leaders but the drugs go away so we need we need teach in and out to identify new pathways that we can use to treat kids with general answer we're hoping that we creating home fact creates financial incentives for our pharmaceutical companies to stay in the game and to provide those drugs drugs to pediatric researchers so that we just get them to target later and the other the other thing is we were in a panel this morning with the National Cancer Institute and I would see and one of the things that kept coming up all day long was the restrictiveness of some of the regulatory compliance to chill childhood cancer you know around things like HIPAA compliance and not that these laws aren't very important for lots of reasons but in pediatric cancer when she said it was just a few minutes ago they don't care about privacy they don't care about they just want their kids to be held prescriptions for kids and adults so it's just that the patient population where you need that we just don't care about price so scary so we have a lot of conversations exploring about you know how we can work to kind of modify the IR viewer rules and the HIPAA rules so that he can start to share this data much more efficient way for these two children child with cancers where you know I mean we had all the families of the National module of us on a narrow blessed consortium in Austin two weeks ago and every parent said we don't care there's one you can have anything you want from us if you can say virgin yeah parents rated more even as well as many parents there there's piston guys were just motivated there are a lot of restrictions on experimental you know like Texas Children's I saw the ticket a child still aligned developed and don't you know drunk and they could use that because now they drug the parents were just like we want to try I mean much Elton John no one of the really terrific things when we talk about a lot of people think about Google and Amazon than those types of clouds where people go and sell things you know they the shopping and all sorts of things in the cloud this is a dedicated culture so it is HIPAA compliant it falls within the FDA regulations it I armies and all of these this is a secured it's more secure than bank right so so we respect privacy and security and in all these things we work with all in all those confines but what we're going to try to do in these conversations it's try to shift the focus and say security is one thing but but we really have patients in front of us who desperately need us to share and communicate information across the networks thanks Adele we now have a healthcare dedicated their ecosystem that does protect the data and enables it to be shared so we can and with some support and getting access to the experimental therapeutics we can really make a big difference by stitching all these things and that's something else that we're in the table I think that you know it very 40 Jenna's you know because we're the largest healthcare insurance company in the world will more hospital and healthcare data in our data center from anybody so we not as accurate probably better than any company in the industry and we bring a lot of that expertise to make sure you know all this patient data is very secure but we'd like to find ways to start to enable it to be able to do what the parents lost together um exactly for those of us who I understand via equity IRB how do they restrict or so from an IRB standpoint if you if you generate data there's no need to tell arrow an IRB is by what institutional review board is though is the board that decides how these clinical trials have you done anything with it or within a lot of research organization and then and content to the board is to protect patients from from doing something wrong to them for making decisions that are not around a drug to make to be forced into making decisions that's right yeah so there's very good reasons for having hierarchies we're not arguing that this impede after cancer we believe that the kind of regular regulatory compliance you have to live which is you know if I do a tea no secrets on a child and I want to use it in another trial I'm not allowed to do that even if the parents give me permission to do if I wanted to apply to a genome sequence on a child and the child wants to use it with another doctor they're not allowed me because it's not done enough Clea laboratory right so basically these are the HIPAA protects privacy of patient information what a lot of people don't know is that patients didn't have rights to receive statement so that the parents can request data and Captain solid share the data and what we want to do is is step up to the responsibility of ensuring that we could support that technologically support their privacy and security you don't ask us why the tools that allow all of that but also enable the sharing because as you saw there's without what 18 different institutions which one has their own institutional review board and we're talking about interoperability between hospital systems having a unifying ecosystem the bell cloud allows us to navigate all that complexity and create an interoperable system that allows data we shared between DX perfect and interpretive and extract meaningful value of it can get the right drugs with regulation and this collaboration allows us also historically the way they've done this is you know we did a genome test we literally put out a hard-driving shifted to from one side to the other community analysis now we can move the data between in the cloud and the analysis real time so he took a little bit about the work you're doing with or what the connection is to NCI maybe just since as congressional briefing and kind of wondering you know for policymakers what what your technology what you're doing how that fits in with what governments doing sure I'll get started so we're working with the leadership of NCI so so pediatric oncologists like Lee helmet for example are taking very active role he was participated in the launch the project where New York announces the dell gift to pediatric cancer and lead was there to speak on behalf of the federal government we're also integrating some of the clinical trials that we're going to be running our through the NCI as well so we see within the NCI critical because our destination our vision is to create a national model and we think national leadership from government both on the legislative side and only healthcare side at the NCI and the NIH is critical to have that kind of involvement we're very lucky to have that participation to follow but what are some of the impediments and within the federal government we should change you to help well I think we've seen a lot of support in breaking down barriers dr. colleges talk about the meeting we had this morning where there was the NCI and the Elven seen the office and that's the coordinator I've got together the office of the National Coordinator supports information technologies and health so they are the number one organizations in the United States government that creates a regulatory environment for how to deploy healthcare IT and and we've got just remember support from ONC and it's coming together and saying how can we break down these barriers we talked a little better both data exchanges with actual patient privacy this meeting this morning it was incredible Kachinas usually don't see the only patient advocates the possible what do you want to see how the patient how do you want to see existence commission so we're seeing that they're not just passively areas on strategy partners were downloading Thank You the areas like a college is a major force and you know this idea of driving consumer itl you know using IT nauru drive help people that care about it of the perimeter second eighty percent of the population is barely healthy people to chronic illness the twenty percent and then people with cancer are probably the highest value population for 22news i-team to drive care so enough education tell stated that i would like the right to waive my HIPAA privacy protections which i do not have the rectitude and that behaves my ability to get in my ability to get the sender or to support research i wanted to support and similarly i want the right to review the genomic analysis position this currently under that's a problem because that means that if they want to do the treatment after this treatment they don't have the information we need for clinical trial it's not part there now so the challenge is you know on your hippo guidelines the patient owns their data under IRB the face of mine on that data but they can't see they're looking to I think there's certainly chance this certainly opportunity for patients and many more rights adopted rights in patients and doctors should decide together and the result of their silence no one else another friend from doe I just Thank You congressman for your leadership hosting this panel but also in my face to my stepped up to the plate listen and this is not just you know this is one of our signature giving programs this is part of the deal foundation obvious can follow your successes I mean so just in the last month we've taken the amount of time for hundreds of hours six hours oppression look for to rebut successes but we don't build past for augustness can help send of nothing because we're very limited right now with Derek options we could have to it's incredible how much horsepower goes would be generating the data and then interpreting it accidental help

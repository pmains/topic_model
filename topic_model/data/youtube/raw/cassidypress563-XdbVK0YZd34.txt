thank you for that kind introduction and thank you for allowing me to join you for this very special event you're all gathered today to support an urgent and important effort electing bill Cassidy to the United States Senate if you didn't know it already the path to Republican control of the Senate travels straight through Louisiana to remove Harry Reid as Senate Majority Leader and finally take back the Senate for Republicans we absolutely must succeed in Louisiana we all know that the only way Democrats can win is through fear and scare tactics they'll go back to their same playbook of trying to divide the electorate drumming up the old phony war on women let me tell you about the real war on women in Washington it's skyrocketing deficits and debt which threaten our children's future it's a stagnant economic recovery which is making it harder for families to get by and it's a health care law that is causing families to lose their doctors lose their coverage or to have to pay more for it the democrat-controlled Senate in Washington is a rubber stamp for President Obama's failed agenda taking back our country starts with putting Republicans in charge of the United States Senate and winning the Senate means winning Louisiana you are so fortunate to have a great candidate like Bill Cassidy running this year in Washington we need bill Cassidy in the Senate as a reliable vote for less spending lower taxes and American energy independence as the mother of two young children I especially look forward to working with Bill on education policies that prepare america's students to successfully compete in a 21st century economy and perhaps most of all as a doctor bill Cassidy will help lead the fight in the Senate to repeal Obamacare so that we can put solutions in place that will help patients and protect taxpayers bill Cassidy will stand up to President Obama at every turn we need his leadership in the Senate and I'm asking all of you to spread the word about what's at stake this race for families in Louisiana women will make the difference in this race as Republican women leaders bill Cassidy needs your help to win this fall you can make the difference for him I hope you'll all work together along with his wife dr. Laura Cassidy who has been a real leader in medicine and education to do everything you can to elect bill Cassidy to the United States Senate thank you so much

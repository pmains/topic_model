president yesterday I joined with chairman Bingaman to introduce legislation to address an urgent threat to America's national forests the lack of resources to fight serious wildfires that at this very moment are burning on more than 300,000 acres in our country to date and it is certainly early in the fire season more than eight hundred and thirty thousand acres already have burned the heart of the problem mr. president is as the fires have gotten bigger the Forest Service air tanker fleet to fight these fires has gotten smaller in 2006 the Forest Service had 44 large air tankers under contract in their fleet last week they had just 11 large air tankers under contract and 10 of those averaged 50 years of age now after very tragic events of this past weekend in which one of those air tankers crash and it's courageous pilots were killed and another had a failure of its landing gear and sustained serious damage the forest service is down to nine large air tankers this is an extraordinarily serious problem and a solution is long overdue now the reason I've come to the floor this afternoon mr. president is that the Congress has an opportunity to expedite what could be the beginning of a solution the Forest Service now is ready to begin awarding contracts for the next generation of air tankers consistent with their large air tanker modernization strategy on May twenty-fifth as is required by law under 41 USC 30 90 reedy the Forest Service has given the Congress a 30-day notification of its intent to award for multi-year contracts which contain cancellation ceilings in excess of 10 million dollars and require congressional notification these four contracts would in effect begin to fill the federal government's need for large air tankers to file fight wildfires now the 30-day waiting period is simply delaying urgently needed action without congressional action these contracts will not be awarded until June 25th my view is with hundreds of thousands of acres burning and a severely depleted capacity for sending air tankers to battle these fires I see nothing that can be served by the Congress sitting on his hands and waiting for those 30 days to expire the forest service requested the contrary Congress waived the requirement to wait the full 30 days to award these important contracts the sooner the Forest Service can award these contracts the sooner the companies that receive the awards can begin to deliver those next generation air tankers and get them out fighting the fires mr. president I want to be clear that I do not know the details of these contracts and have no idea as to which companies that submit bids are going to be the successful recipients but I do know that the Forest Service is complied with its obligation to notify the Congress Congress has been notified with the required information and I just fail to understand how the country is going to benefit by simply letting time pass I urge my colleagues to see how important in how serious this fire situation is and approve the critical legislation that I have been troduced with Chairman Bingaman at this very moment mr. president there are 11 uncontained large fires nationally a hundred and fifty-two new fires that have been reported in just the last 24 hours and dire predictions about hot and dry conditions combining with strong winds looming thunderstorms and arid lands across much of our landscape all of these factors contribute to a dangerous fire situation on the ground and yet as we speak the Forest Service now has only nine air tankers to assist those hard-working fire crews eight of those tankers are getting to the point mr. president we're there ought to be considered museums in the sky now while the Forest Service can and should use all possible assets such as helicopters and innovative options like the 20 thousand gallon very large air tanker the agency is likely to need to call in the National Guard and the large air tankers remain a critically important tool for fire suppression in fact the firefighting agencies mobilized air tankers 153 percent above the 10-year average in 2011 yet these planes needed to assist on the ground firefighters have dwindled to the dire shortage they have atrophied to the point that I have described mr. president this afternoon now this lack of resources is coming at a time when the nation's forests are very vulnerable to fire and the fire season is early but we're already seeing the production of record-breaking fires fire seasons are getting longer and they are more severe and we are seeing more and more mr. president of what the professional foresters call a mega fire from 2002 2008 at least ten states had fires of record-breaking size the Forest Service indicated in its air tanker mobilization strategy that the agency will need up to 28 of these air tankers in order to adequately battle fire threats so the Forest Service says we need 28 as of this moment this afternoon mr. president there are only nine so I am asking today for the Senate to recognize the seriousness of the threat and let the Forest Service proceed in awarding these new contracts as rapidly as possible the legislation the Chairman Bingham and I have offered would enable the agency to do just that and begin to tackle this extraordinarily serious health problem in closing mr. president I want to express my thanks to all of America's courageous and dedicated firefighters they put themselves in harm's way to protect our communities and we should be grateful to them and to the pilots and companies and agency a personnel that tires tirelessly battle these fires and I believe on behalf of every member of the Senate it's appropriate to express our deepest condolences to the families and colleagues and Friends of the recently deceased pilots I hope that by advancing the legislation I've described this afternoon the Congress will be sending a message to those courageous firefighters and those that they work with that the Congress is beginning to put in place a system that would provide them real relief mr. president I ask unanimous consent that my comments be printed in the Congressional Record

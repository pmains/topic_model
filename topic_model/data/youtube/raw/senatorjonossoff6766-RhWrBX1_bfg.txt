thank you Mr chairman uh Mr chairman I know you touched on this issue a moment ago I want to raise it again with you Dr Shogun that's the backlog in military service records veterans across Georgia across the country are deeply frustrated by the interminable delays accessing their military records and they they need these records for their VA health care benefits they need these records for their employment and educational benefits I introduced last week the bipartisan access for veterans to records act to try to address this backlog so that veterans in Georgia and across the country can access their records if confirmed will you commit to working with me to eliminate the backlog of military service records requests at nprc and not just to working with me but to putting it at the very top of your agenda yes thank you senator for that question it is at the very top of my agenda if I am concerned uh confirmed as archivist of the United States and in fact if I am confirmed as archivist of the United States I will make my first trip as archivist of the United States to St Louis to the mprc so I can meet once again with the leadership there and the hard-working staff that are attempting to reduce the backlog there has been great progress made thus far and I look forward to finding Creative Solutions within federal law and regulations in order to reduce that backlog at a faster pace I appreciate that commitment Dr shovin and making that commitment here today will mean a lot to veterans in Georgia who frankly are skeptical after years of dealing with this that there can be a change but there must be a change veterans deserve timely access to their records and I'm going to ask for a further commitment which is that once you have had the opportunity to meet again with the folks at the nprc and to get your bearings in your first four or five weeks in office should you be confirmed that you will timely submit to this committee your assessment of the drivers of this backlog and a specific plan to eliminate it we make that commitment yes thank you Senator I am willing to make that commitment I will make myself available what I've learned and just a further comment on that I think I mean obviously the first thing that has to be done if I'm confirmed as archivist is is removing the backlog but there has to be a second step which is to make sure that backlog is not created in in future circumstances we hope that the pandemic is is over but we can never predict what is coming down the road in the future so I believe there has been great progress uh by uh the Department of Veterans Affairs and moving to digitize those records in a timely fashion and and a reasonable priority and uh once those records are digitized and placed in the cloud then NPR's nprc staff will be able to access them and I think every the request will be processed much faster in the future so I think there's there's a good there's a good end to this story if we can get there thank you doctor

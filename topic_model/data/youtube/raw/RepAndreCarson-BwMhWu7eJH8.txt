I'm congressman Andre Carson wishing a Ramadan Kareem to Muslims observing Ramadan all over the world this sacred time of fasting and sacrifice is a special opportunity for us to grow closer to our faith and each other and to reflect on our many blessings let's also make this month an occasion to recommit ourselves to living out the values of Islam this includes fighting poverty promoting peace stamping out inequality wherever it exists and more together as a global community we can achieve it with our faith as our guide

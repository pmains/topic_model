chairman bustos thank you for for having this hearing and under secretary bonnie thank you for joining us today as we all know it's important to get farm programs right in advance of the next farm bill during your confirmation hearing last summer several senators asked you about the conservation reserve program the crp program you often answered that it's vitally important that we get the right lands in the program we don't want to take highly productive lands out of the program where we we don't want to put highly productive lands into the program and i agree with that focus uh according to usda's most recent uh national resources inventory released one out of every four acres of land and crp is considered to be prime farmland in your mind why is so much good productive farmland ending up in crp and what is usda doing to achieve the shared goal of reserving crp for the most environmentally sensitive acres that need to be in the program so the concern you would have if you have really productive land coming in is that uh is that they is that you know they're you're taking out highly productive land that obviously has uh economics uh economic uh considerations as well and that you know this this program was designed for uh for uh uh more marginal lands obviously it's a voluntary program producer you know landowners are gonna enroll what they're gonna roll but we can do things through targeted enrollments continuous enrollments partnerships through crap that can make sure we get those lands that are really environmentally sensitive maybe they're environmentally sensitive because they're in a riparian area or maybe their efforts to deal with water issues like the republican river in colorado or um you know their their targeted uses here and i think that's really important there of course are lands that may be uh you know uh drought um sensitive or otherwise that will come in through the general uh sign up those remain really really important but there are ways that we can both incentivize and think about continuous enrollments and others to make sure we get the right mix of lands into the program thank you yeah i think the issue needs to be addressed before any discussions about raising crp's acreage cap really come to bear we're gonna have limited resources as we all know in the next farm bill and limited land on which we're farming in this committee i think we need to prioritize the working lands program and make sure that the right acres are going into the crp program so um thank you um second question you know as farmers are gearing up for the 2022 growing season uh many are having difficulty getting fertilizer we know you know many times fertilizer costs three four uh three or four times or more than it did last year also having challenges getting key chemicals that may not even be available for crop protection due to regulatory and supply chain issues if these challenges ultimately result in lower lead yields in your mind what risk is there to the crop insurance industry and in particular to the private sector um delivery system that that's currently in place as these claims come forward i mean i guess it's hard for me to estimate what the risk is there there obviously is one there and you know we we want to we're sensitive to the fact that that folks are looking at at higher input costs as i noted before you know the set of tools we have is relatively limited we are thinking about are there ways that we could help on the supply chain side um the work we've done so far has sort of been on thinking about export the partnership in the port of oakland but we're open to looking at ways that we can address this our challenge is that our toolbox is relatively limited yep great uh one more quick question i know i just have a little over a minute but our my family farms in gove county which is northwestern kansas and the fsa office um the the workers there constantly are talking to my dad and i hear this repeatedly from other offices you know just the antiquated computer systems the inefficiencies the amount of time it takes to log in and log off at what what's being done there and uh what do you think needs to be done here moving forward and forgive me if you cover this earlier in the hearing now i i t across fsa and across fpac is a really really important issue and um we've just adopted an updated strategic plan but frankly there's there's more to do there and it involves both the public facing side i mentioned farm loans earlier but making enrollment easier updating that to make sure we've got uh better tools than than we do now and as you point out kind of the the office side of it was to make sure our folks have the uh the best technology we've got work to do this is going to be an important area of investment we have to think about how we balance the uh the the workforce we have how we how we build the workforce there's work to do there and i think we'll we'll do it in uh consultation with congress great well thank you mr undersecretary and uh chairman bruce i yield back

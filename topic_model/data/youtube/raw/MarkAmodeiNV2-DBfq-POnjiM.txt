we're gonna wait and see what happens in the house and let's talk about the house a little bit more congressman mark Amodei a Republican from Nevada is the co-sponsor of the herd aguilar bart bipartisan immigration bill in the house congressman thank you very much for joining us let's talk about this budget deal senate leaders have reached a budget deal but let's talk about what happens in the house mark mark meadows just said to reporters a moment ago that if all four leaders agree on something that all all everybody in Congress will vote YES on it we've got Schumer we've got McConnell where do things stand and you're in your estimation with Pelosi and Ryan well I think it's one of the things where both the leadership Swee had a conference just just a little while ago both of the leadership teams are in the process of unveiling this to their different conferences mostly because all of our pals in the Senate didn't bother to Telegraph much of what was going on so obviously it's kind of that old thing you got to read it to figure out where the heck you stand on it the bill doesn't have an immigration component components I know that you have an immigration plan that you've put forward in the Senate as I mentioned a moment ago Mitch McConnell has promised to bring up immigration Nancy Pelosi is asking for that same assurance from Paul Ryan here's somebody who wants to get things done even though Nancy Pelosi is not it's not your leader but do you think that there should be or do you need an assurance from Paul Ryan in order to vote in a spending bill without immigration well you know her question since we've basically done nothing regardless of who was running the outfit for the last ten years and and so when you sit here five months ago the president says Congress you got till March 5th guess what nobody's talking about March 5th now which is another chapter in the Congress and deadlines book I'll let you fill in the contents of the chapter so yes should we vote on it as dreamers as ripe as any issue obviously are there solutions for for daca absolutely but the problem has always been katie is you got to stick with the facts and guess what there is a way to do things which is in the best interest of the country which takes care of the history issue but if you're going to politicize it from one side or the other then we're going to be sitting here again wondering why we haven't done anything let's talk about your bill you got 27 Republic and 27 democrats signing on to it what else is in it well I mean first of all let's let's go with what you mentioned which was those were 27 people who are strong on the issue not strong on the politics so if you really want to result there you go it deals with those folks that were in the program some of them that weren't it does it in a way that's in the best interest of the country not the best interest in terms of one side or the others talking points and it also has a border security component in it for that part of the border but once again the politics over sweep all those faxes okay has anybody said anything about the 5,000 mile border with trees growing on it to the north I mean come on all those borders where there's international airports in the country do you think anyone's talking about the Canadian border you know what because quite frankly there's no political there's no political mileage to be made in it at the moment made for Canadians only for Mexico no there's no political mileage for Democrats or Republicans I mean everybody's been talking about the southwest border forever and and that's fair enough but it's like hey you can't afford when you have thousands tens of thousands of miles of border and international airports in the country to just go yep that's where all the action is because quite frankly it is it let's talk for a moment about the politics the president has said that other bipartisan measures are completely unacceptable he wants all of the things that he's asking for the 25 billion for the wall the ending of chain migration or family unit reunification the ending of the visa lottery program you have chief of staff John Kelly talking about dreamers and saying that some of them were too lazy to get off their blank to sign up for that it's rhetoric like that from John Kelly the rhetoric from the president that we've heard the past and also these these very hard line tenants that he wants for his deal what is that going to do for moderates moderates like you in the Republican Party for 2018 for their chances well you've hit the nail right on the head with the question Katie and that is if this is going to be rhetoric driven and guess what don't hold your breath for me for March 5th or afterwards and and and that's been the challenge this is this group of people on the herd bill on both sides of the aisle are credible people on the issue bipartisan nationwide men women people of color people not of color and so it's like well god why would why wouldn't we take a look at something like that perhaps they're onto something are you worried about maintaining the house in 2018 well you know what in in this business you don't know whether you're a foot or horseback on any particular thing but I can tell you speaking only for myself that my involvement with it is a commitment to the issue I don't think is going to change who votes for me of any national origin one way or the other I'm just embarrassed about going back and trying to defend nothing for yet another cycle Nevada Republican congressman mark on the day

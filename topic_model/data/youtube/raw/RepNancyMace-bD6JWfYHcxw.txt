welcome back we're here with congresswoman nancy mace we've been talking about her first 200 days in office it probably feels a little bit more like 2 000 i'd imagine uh you have accomplished a lot in your first 200 days a lot has happened um gotta get to this infrastructure bill one trillion dollar infrastructure bill that very difficult trying to get both sides to agree yes it is and i i thought you know sitting on the transportation and infrastructure committee this would be the one committee where we could be bipartisan and the bipartisanship work has been done in the senate rather than the house house leaders were not able to be part of the conversation when that deal was being negotiated that bill was just written i do have a lot of questions about how the infrastructure package will be paid for um whether or not we're going to have a tax hike like we've heard rumors about it's thousands of pages of legislation that just was written this weekend so we haven't even been able to even get anywhere close to finishing reading it to see what's actually in it yet 2022 election not far off your fundraising has been very successful thus far i have to talk a little bit about voter id your stance on that and as well as for the people act right well uh just a few weeks ago we announced our q2 fundraising we raised over 860 thousand dollars we we just been so blessed and so fortunate that all this all the hard work i've been doing over the first half years really really paying off at this juncture and i'm honored to do the job i mean this is an honor of my lifetime to serve so so in terms of voter id what is your stance on this well i'm a big supporter of voter id and just last week we had a delegation from texas that flew by private jet to d.c to talk about some of the voter legislation happening in texas i had an opportunity to question one of those texas delegates on texas voter id and that individual didn't have really any answers about voter id in texas and in fact i was able to point out in texas that voter d really isn't a problem you need an id to just live a normal life in texas and anywhere else in the united states and the encouraging thing that i that i learned and got out of that hearing that day is that blacks and whites african-americans and caucasians that in texas they all register to vote at the same percentage rate and they all actually cast their ballot at the same percentage rate of their population and so all those things are encouraging when we're accusing ones that are the other of suppressing the vote or being racist when the data actually shows the opposite i think it's really important that whenever we're making decisions whether it's covet 19 or about ensuring election integrity and election security and that our our ballots are counted and all that that we're using facts and we're using good data absolutely hr1 also known as for the people act what would it its passage mean for future elections well hr 1 is really federalizing it's usurping the constitution of the united states because it's federalizing the election process so today the constitution allows for states each individual state to outline when where and how their elections will be conducted for hundreds of years this has worked and continues to work um it also would uh would fund chat with taxpayer dollars elections so let's just say you you love or you hate or or like or dislike someone like on the squad like aoc or maybe it's marjorie taylor green well you would be funding the election campaigns of both of those individuals um and i just you know i two things one i'm not going to violate the constitution and and two we don't want to federalize it but three you know the federal government and tax dollars you the taxpayers should not be funding somebody else's election particularly with someone that you disagree with fundamentally or philosophically it doesn't make a lot of sense all right well and on top of all the committees and all the things that you've been doing thus far uh you also take a huge caseload you've been receiving phone call after phone call after phone call to your office and we of course would be remiss if we didn't put that phone number up on the screen so that more phone calls can flood your office uh congresswoman so we do i am pleased to i'm begging you yes okay absolutely and so the reception uh from your constituents as well as the relationship to your office so you're finding it to be a pretty a pretty solid one thus far oh absolutely we're making historic we're making historic records right now we've we've already returned over three million dollars to taxpayers in the district a lot of people earlier this year continue to have problems with getting their irs refund checks so we're helping people through that process it could be a social security check that went missing or va benefits or you can't cash the stimulus check that you receive whatever that is whatever that issue is and often we get called about state level issues and we try to we help point people in the right direction even it's not a federal agency we still want to help them at the state level we have opened over 200 300 cases and we've closed almost 2 000 of those and every day people are calling us because one of the things i promised when i was elected is that i would work hard and that no one would work harder than i would and we're seeing that today i've got to hire my fourth caseworker this week because of the load that we're having and we're happy to do it this is one of the the honors of a lifetime it is for me is to serve and i want to serve everybody in the little country whether you have an r or a d by your name it doesn't matter our job is to serve each and every person in our community i think this is a good place to end it at least for now congresswoman i have so much more to ask you but we've run out of time i want to thank you so much for taking the time to join us today thank you so much thank you we're back after this

so I'll just ask again has Iran violated the letter of the jcpoa not asking the IAEA I'm asking you so is it is it the State Department's position that that Iran has not violated the letter of the jcpoa that is the judgment of the IAEA I'm not asking the IAEA I'm asking you sir I've responded sir okay does annex one paragraph 61 of the jcpoa state quote Iran will only engage in production of centrifuges to meet the enrichment rnd requirements you're familiar with that I would have to respond in formal fashion to that okay well formally that is what that annex one paragraph 61 States is it true that Iran has acquired more than a necessary amount of ir8 centrifuge rotor assemblies for R&D purposes with 16 times more capacity than the IRA one to enrich uranium again I would have to respond in a formal room you could respond right now sir I would have to consult I am NOT a technical expert I'm I thought you're the acting secretary I am but those questions are highly technical and they demand a very technical and specific response which we will provide as part of the jcpoa an enrichment research and development plan will submit the IAEA that permitted roughly 10 ir6 centrifuges are you aware that our on has assembled 13 to 15 ir6 centrifuges which should have been limited or destroyed under this plan representative all questions of this character can be responded to an appropriate level of classification in writing well but you're stating that Iran has not violated the letter of the deal so what I'm gonna do right now is go through all the different ways of ron's violating the letter of the deal is is it your position that you're not going to respond with regards to any of the ways they're honest violate the letter of the deal these technical questions will require a sufficiently classified written response under annex 1 paragraph 76 of the jcpoa the IAEA can request access to military locations such as Parchin to verify compliance is that right how did my response is the same to all questions if this gear is it's a technical question as your position you can't tell me whether or not the jcpoa grants access to Iran's military sites for inspection for verification it does sir it does state that that is part of the jcpoa correct okay so that you're able to answer that now hasn't it has not been crystal clear that it's Iran's position both before during and after the jcpoa was finalized that they will not grant any access to their military sites I will respond to that question in writing you can't respond to that now no I cannot but what I mean rouhani hasn't had a problem saying this over video yeah I don't I don't know why that requires a classification I mean it is well known open sourced information Iran is made crystal clear that we do not have access to their military sites there is much well known open source material that is also not correct or is nuanced I will provide a detailed response from appropriate US government agencies to all of these questions as Iran acquired more heavy water than they are allowed to under the jcpoa the saint's respond sir what what what's the response we will provide a detailed response in an appropriate fashion see here's the problem you you have no problem coming before Congress and others will come before Congress saying in no uncertain terms Iran is not likely to litter the jcpoa but then when you're asked questions about all the different ways that iran has violated a letter the jcpoa you have to you know respond in writing or it's a technical question that someone's act somewhere else is expertise you don't have the expertise to engage in any answers with regards to ways the ron's violating the letter of the jcpoa yet you do have the expertise to come to Congress and say they're not lying the letter of the jcpoa and you do have the expertise to come before Congress and explain the justification for your position yet when you asked about all the different ways Iran collecting more ir6 rotor assemblies than are allowed to assembly more ir8 rotors assemblies than they are allowed to the centrifuges to deny access to their military sites to collect more heavy water than they are permitted to and that list goes on when we went to par Qin and we found nuclear particles that we want to follow up on Iran's new position was you can't visit Parchin so we were not able to inspect with regard to those those particles that were discovered so if you do not have the technical capabilities to answer any questions with regards to all the known specifics of how Iran is violating the letter of the deal then we should not have one witness after another coming before the this committee and others making the flat-out statement that Iran is not violating the letter of the jcpoa because that has consequences for the sake of the record congressmen my comment was the IAEA has in his most recent reporting not found significant violation of the provision and until the and until the IAEA comes before this committee I don't with they do come before the community happy answer to ask them the same exact questions but you're here representing the United States State Department and I'm asking you about different specific questions and I have answered we will provide you detailed answers to all of those questions go back

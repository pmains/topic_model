joining me now is democratic senator michael bennett of colorado all right so it sounds like you're up against a wall here sir how do you change any rules on the filibuster even in in small ways when kirsten cinema is saying no way uh she's going to make it very difficult you know i i think that we should put this on the floor and have a vote and let's have people stand up and be counted this place doesn't work it it it can't compete with dictatorships around the country and and we ought to make it work and we can fix the rules to do that and and while we're doing that we ought to protect the right of millions of people across this country to vote because it's being taken away it's being suppressed all over the country what do you mean dictatorships around the country i'm not saying dictatorships around the country dictatorships around the world is what i meant sorry but we we're seeing voter suppression all over the country so given that listen there's a lot happening uh in 2024 there are a lot of people being put in place there was a big long article in the atlantic by barton gellman about what could happen with the um electors and states deciding to choose their own electors and not hold up the will of the people but it seems like the only people that are pushing voting rights and and changing the rules on the federal side are the democrats and without a 60-vote threshold or with that 60-vote threshold what are you going to do i mean it's absolutely true look we we we need to get to a 51 vote threshold in the senate and i think we can do it in a way that works for everybody we ought to make sure that the minority in the senate has the right to debate by actually having a real filibuster on the floor not sitting in your office with your remote control but out on the floor having a debate in front of the american people that's the way it was supposed to work and and also the chance to offer amendments which people in the house don't get to do to affect legislation and have further debate in front of the american people but then at the end of the day 51 people need to be able to decide one of the things katie i think that's really wrong in the country right now is nobody understands how any of these rules actually work and therefore they don't know who to whom to hold accountable here for not delivering things to them yeah what about well hold on what about the child tax credits we're talking about i know we're talking about voter voting rights the child tax credit is integral for so many people around the country it's it's integral for so many children around the country to lift them out of poverty and that's expired the last check went out buildback better is now on the back burner until maybe maybe this spring lindsey graham says it's dead what do you say to the people out there who who need that money the kids who need that money we we have to find a way to bridge this katie we've got to find a way to bridge it you and i had a conversation long ago during my not very well noticed campaign for president when i was running on the child tax credit and one of the things you said was it just seems like we can never do big things this is a big thing we cut childhood poverty in this country almost in half we cut hunger in this country in a quarter you would think the least we could do is figure out how to extend that until politicians can figure out how to how to how to reach a deal i've seen this place in chaos at the end of the year when tax cuts for rich people were expiring and nobody had any trouble figuring out how to extend those tax cuts into january into february the least we could do for the 61 million kids across america who are getting the benefit of this tax cut is uh is to extend it and we should find a way to do that and by the way we finally did a big thing katie tur well you did and um there are a lot of people that hope that big thing continues into the new year a lot of people hope it's permanent a quick question not a quick answer so my producers are going to scream but hopefully you can do it quickly do you still have faith in the system you got to look even if you don't have faith in the system even if you've lost faith in the system that needs to be that needs to to force you to to work harder to change it you know congressman lewis sacrificed his skull on the edmond pettis bridge to those billy clubs for the sake of the democracy and you know i think you just had a daughter i i have three daughters women fought so they could get the right to vote this self-evident right to vote for more than a hundred years so we are not entitled to lose faith in this the system is corrupt the system doesn't work the system's not not competitive with those totalitarian societies around the world right now and we have to make it so we also have to create an economy here that when it grows grows for everybody not just the top 10 percent because if that's what we're going to continue to do economically we're not going to save the democracy either two things protect the right to vote get an economy that when it grows grows for everybody and we'll be just fine senator michael bennett it is always great to have you i'm so happy to see you

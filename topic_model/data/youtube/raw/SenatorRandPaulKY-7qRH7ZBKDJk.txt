joining me now from washington dc senator rand paul senator thank you so much for joining me glad to be with you no senator uh is there anything that you support in the one trillion dollar stimulus package i think it's important for your viewers to know that we don't have any money in washington there's no rainy day fund there's no savings isn't like we can walk over to the federal reserve and open a big safe and say oh there's all this money there's free money we're going to give it to people i think it's also a problem that when republicans begin to act like democrats and it's a spending frenzy it's sort of a competition to see who can spend more money that that's dangerous for the country we've already borrowed 3 trillion this year we were already a trillion in debt just from our annual spending so that's 4 trillion now we're talking about another trillion but they haven't even started compromising with the democrats so the republican starting position is adding another trillion of debt it's irresponsible and i'm starting to become more and more worried about the economy the stock market you know came back but yet we have this danger now that the republicans are going to give up and really give up and lose historic you know lose by historic margins if they keep acting like democrats and then what happens to the economy if you have all these governors still keeping the economy closed so the answer isn't more free money from washington the answer is you have to open the economy the cause of the recession slash depression is the governor's close the economy down if you don't open it up and you borrow five trillion in dollars guess what you could end up a lot worse yeah the federal deficit is is clearly ballooning here uh but we're kind of a stuck between a rock and a hard place we know that millions of americans are suffering through no fault of their own they want to go to work most people want to go to work but then we have as you pointed out are state officials governors or city councils who are shutting down business and not letting people get back to work so you know this is a phrase we keep saying over and over again get people back to work but how do we do that when our health officials say it's not safe to do it and then we have our state and local lawmakers who aren't allowing it well you have to look at the facts and so when people say it's not safe to go back to school the facts argue otherwise so the death rate among children under 18 is about one in a million that's safer than the seasonal flu and we go to school every year with a seasonal flu people say well what about the teachers will the kids infect the teachers well the infection rate from children back to adults is very very rare also they've done contact tracing studies in china the netherlands iceland and england four different countries and what they find is very rare transmission from children to adults but even if there was some transmission we could keep our vulnerable older teachers at home those in their you know mid to late 60s or 70s maybe they could teach online but you can't really have school online there are too many parents who are incapable of doing it there are parents who don't want to do it and then their parents that are single parents in work how are they going to get you know how are they going to do it if their kids aren't in school so we have to open the economy but the economy is closed because of government edict so if your government is closing your economy we're going to have to have legislatures state legislatures push back on governors to try to get the economy open again yeah and pretty much every health expert doctor that i've talked to agrees with you but you don't really hear much of their voices on the mainstream media you only hear the people that want to keep the school shut down despite the science as you pointed out earlier today i heard senator ted cruz talking about how some elected officials specifically democrats are trying to make the coronavirus as painful as possible on the people going into election day do you agree with him on this i think there's an authoritarian impulse in certain leaders like we have a democratic governor in kentucky but i call him drunk with power because he's gotten a little power now he loves it he gets to dictate to every restaurant and every public venue in all of kentucky how many people can come into their venue we never anticipated anything like that when we thought of the soviet union at its worst we never thought of a government that could control every aspect of a business and now we've allowed this to happen we've also closed all the schools and to my mind there's not been one epidemic not even one sort of record of contagion within a school because we closed all the schools down before we got any of it we don't even know if we're going to have these episodes in schools one thing we do know though is child care stayed open in new york throughout this if you were a nurse or a doctor or you worked in a hospital or you're a policeman or a fireman you were thought to be necessary the kids of those workers still went to daycare one day care i think the y had 40 000 kids stay in their daycare over a four month period guess what the rate of uh coronavirus was in the daycare it was like less than one percent mortality way way less than that so really they found that daycare actually was able to stay open to the midst of the worst pandemic what state did worse than any place in the whole world new york and yet the daycare stayed open were able to survive without really making the problem worse so these are important things but nobody is basing their decisions on either scientific evidence or facts they pretend to be but it's really the emotions of these are people who believe in big government they believe in all of us being told what to do they think they know what's best for us but they're killing our country they're crippling the economy senator i'm sure you have a lot to say about this i remember a few months ago i went down with the daily caller team and we interviewed you about your waste report and just that the spending that happens in washington dc is absolutely insane now this really boils my blood in the stimulus proposal it includes almost two billion dollars in funds for the design and construction of a new fbi headquarters why yeah we're in the middle of a pandemic i can because both both parties are guilty of pork and i just came from the republican caucus lunch and i stepped out and said i think i'm in the wrong lunch again i think this is the democrat lunch where are the conservatives where are the people who believe that bankrupting the country is a bad idea but you're right there's pork stuck in this bill and they haven't even talked to the democrats yet there's 20 billion dollars in big ag big agricultural pork in there there's another 30 billion dollars for military guess what we spend more in our military than the next 10 countries combined and that's not enough we got a chance to add more pork so there's more pork in there there's billions of dollars for daycare when did republicans start to believe in federal daycare i most daycare in our country has always been taken care of by private companies when did we start believing the federal government needs to fund daycare and they're all saying well we can't open up unless there's daycare yeah there's daycare all over the united states it was taking care of millions of children the only reason they're not operating is because the governor and big government republicans have been saying you can't open up tell them they can open up again and business will resume and will be okay but printing up and borrowing trillions of dollars a huge mistake they're ruining our country and i fear for what's going to happen when the stock market finally figures out we're 5 trillion in the holes and we're not going to open the economy be one thing if this was tiding us over and we're going to open the economy this fall i'm getting this vibe from republicans and from democrats the economy is not going to open and we're going to be five trillion dollars in debt in the base space of five months and it's going to be a disaster and when wall street wakes up to that you know katie bar the door what's going to happen to our savings and the stock market wakes up and says guess what there's not going to be an opening and there's going to be a ton of debt that is a bad combination yeah and senator as you pointed out it's on both sides this whole giving money away uh but you you have to think what these lawmakers think about their constituents and the people at home who see for example this two billion dollars being spent on the fbi headquarters like people must feel bamboozled and scammed by our lawmakers the very people that we elect well senator we're gonna have to leave it here thank you so much for your insight we really appreciate it thank you

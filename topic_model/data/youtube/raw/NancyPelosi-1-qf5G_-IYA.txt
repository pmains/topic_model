as first district native americans make up about 25 of my constituents unfortunately native american women are two and a half times more likely to be assaulted in their lifetime than other women reauthorizing the violence against women act is important to my district that's why i'm very concerned about the impact of sequestration cuts on programs supported by the violence against women act more than 20 million dollars in cuts are at stake what does a 20 million dollar cut mean it means thousands more victims would be denied shelter and legal services it means thousands few police officers prosecutors judges and victim advocates would get specialized training as a former prosecutor i know we need to do all we can to keep victims safe and hold perpetrators accountable and that means we need to do all we can to stop these sequestration cuts and i yield back the balance of my time

you know Matt and I'm watching this today and I'm watching you in particular and I'm watching the interactions here and I'm thinking you know look at what's happening in Seattle and around the country you know canceling cops and live PD I think we need more cameras cameras showed us the truth all right didn't lie to us wood wood with mr. Floyd for example sure defund the police abolish ice disarmed Americans and then surrender our cities to the antifa mob if this is the rulebook for the new woke topia count me out I think that today the reporting that you've just indicated shows that like an Tifa has now designated Seattle their capital and it's going to be bad for the citizens there what we need to do is focus on supporting the good police isolating and removing the bad police and I'm hopeful Sean that we could actually work across party lines on this this shouldn't be a partisan issue we should work on it together and I and thanks to the great work that Dan did representing police and that Pastor Scott did representing his community and so many around the country I actually think we took a very productive step today not only the event team looking for arm you know guards they've taken over entire city blocks and an entire police precinct LA Teachers Union they want our calling for 400 members school police units to be disbanded they're protecting our kids at school Matt we went the opposite direction when we saw school shootings in Florida we worked with the Republicans and Democrats to increase the number of school resource officers because we thought if a young person could have positive interactions with police maybe they coached their basketball team help them get a band-aid when they skinned their knee that that will actually build the type of community policing and this year another question they could keep law enforcement and our students safe god forbid you hear the school shooting is that your son or daughter's school would you like to know the cops are there or not there I vote there I vote I'd want them there please do that they can help and they will in most cases they will they will save lives thank you all

madam Speaker I want to thank representative castor for yielding and for her tremendous leadership I rise in strong opposition to HR 31 34 which is nothing more than yet another ideological attack on women's health care it would defund Planned Parenthood for a year leaving millions of women across the country without access to critical health care services Planned Parenthood centers often serve as a primary care health facility for women seeking birth control cancer and STI screenings and other critical preventive care in 2013 alone Planned Parenthood provided health care services to more than 800,000 Californians and provided more than 93,000 Pap tests and 97,000 breast exams denying access to these health care services such as planned Parenthood provides it will harm those who most need these services the most including low-income women and women of color this bill is shameful it's disrespectful it's wrong politicians shouldn't be interfere in any way in a woman's personal health care decisions it's past time Republicans stopped or on women and stop these ideological attacks and stop using women's health care to divert attention from a looming government shutdown because Republicans refuse to pass a budget vote no on this deceptive

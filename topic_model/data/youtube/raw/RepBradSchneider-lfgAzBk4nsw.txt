mr. speaker 44 years ago this week the Supreme Court ruled in roe v wade in favor of a woman's right to make her own decisions about our own body it's outrageous that today more than four decades later President Trump and my Republican colleagues have made restricting choice their first order of business yesterday President Trump signed an executive order banning health organizations to receive us funding from even mentioning abortion as a medical option for their parent patients and today this house is launching a radical assault on women's health care that penalizes women in small businesses that choose private health insurance plans that cover abortion services the effect of these unprecedented restraints and restrictions is clear restricting the comprehensive health coverage available to women terminating a pregnancy is a personal choice that should be a woman's alone made in consultation with our family and our position politicians have no role in this process I urge my colleagues to end this backwards attack on women's rights and start tackling the real challenges voters sent us here to address and I yield back the balance of my time

yes yeah so um since I started this story I guess I learned that the roots of the Peace Corps started in dummerston Vermont it appears sargent shriver attended the experiment and international learning and one of the first Peace Corps volunteer trainings took part at what would later become SI t um if you talk a little bit about Vermont's history with the Peace Corps and Sargent Shriver told me a number of times how impressed he was with with Vermont of course the idea began with President Kennedy but then when he has started to get into it guys realize all that back on his head when the very first places was here in dummerston I mean I in the Dominican Republic and and the director of the Peace Corps and then they volunteer here and that's why it's perfect if you can just give us a sense of why it is you chose to travel to the minute to the Dominican Republic for this observable this is one of the very first places with the peace commerce and if it's the longest history of it both the comp respond to calls volunteers and so that's what i want to see as it looks well also to be able to combine the trip is going to haiti where we have a strong from on interest now one of the things that I was by Marcel and I have been here before and they're always struck by on one end poverty but on the other hand the the fact that people can do things for example there is a market in downtown port of port-au-prince i am called walking through there this crafts there's individual shops and and his life going on with people obviously greeting everybody that has a devastated area even today on the other hand you going streets where they tell you the rubble was 78 or nine feet high and now you can you can least walk to and the houses of being either cleared or rebuilt i likened it to receive blood back home come i said this is horrible the water is 56 feet high but the water will recede within a day or two here it took a year to clean out all the all the rubble Peter mentioned the place with prosthetics we we we gave some help from the Leahy war victims fund the the pond I set up or landmine victims around the world and I'll get them started but you sit there and see children in their learning to walk getting their prosthetics the question I asked and the reason why countries like the United States can't say okay we've done everything it's all over now these young people could have to be followed for years and years to go come one day grow and the prosthetics have to be replaced but to they've got to know they could be a real part of society so I I agree with Peter I have had more Hope than I thought I would have i I've reviewed all the photographs leading up to did quite a bit of photography today and I can see a significant change but this is some will not happen over overnight the concern I heard from a lot of the Haitian officials you have a lot of things going on the world you the United States there's Japan there's Libya two wars don't forget us as we try to rebuild as we try to bring people back it cannot be done overnight country without the infrastructure needed and and they're right

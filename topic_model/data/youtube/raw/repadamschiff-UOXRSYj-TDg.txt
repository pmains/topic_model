>> MR. SECRETARY, THANK YOU FOR  YOUR TIME TODAY.  >> THANK YOU, MARGARET. >>> WE'RE JOINED NOW BY  CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. HE IS A MEMBER OF THE JANUARY  6th SELECT COMMITTEE AND  CHAIRMAN OF THE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING AND GOOD TO HAVE  YOU HERE IN PERSON.  >> THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.  >> I WANT TO PICK UP ON WHAT WE  JUST HEARD FROM THE SECRETARY  WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS  FAR RIGHT GROUP, THE PROUD BOYS. THIS IS ONE OF THE MILITIAS  INVOLVED IN JANUARY 6th. IN THIS INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY  THIS PAST WEEK FROM CASSIDY  HUTCHINSON, THE FORMER TRUMP  WHITE HOUSE AIDE, CHIEF OF STAFF TO MARK MEADOWS, SHE TESTIFIED  SHE HEARD CONVERSATIONS INSIDE  THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THIS FAR  RIGHT GROUP AND ANOTHER ONE  CALLED THE OATH KEEPERS. IS THERE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE  TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS  COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THOSE  MILITIAS AND THE WHITE HOUSE? >> I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO FAR  AHEAD OF WHAT WE INTEND TO  PRESENT IN OUR NEXT HEARINGS,  BUT OUR VERY NEXT HEARING WILL  BE -- WHO WAS PARTICIPATING, HOW IT WAS ORGANIZED INCLUDING THE  PARTICIPATION OF THESE WHITE  NATIONALIST GROUPS LIKE THE  PROUD BOYS, THE 3%ers AND  OTHERS. WE'LL PRESENTING ALL THE  INFORMATION WE HAVE. ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS WE'VE  AND CONTINUE OUR INVESTIGATION  INTO PRECISELY WHAT YOU'RE  DESCRIBING.  >> HUTCHINSON SAID RUDY GIULIANI WAS SOMEONE SHE PERSONALLY HEARD TALKING ABOUT THEM.  >> THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS  THAT WE HAD INTEREST IN HIS  TESTIMONY AND INTEREST IN THE  TESTIMONY OF OTHERS. WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO PROBE ANY  CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE  DANGEROUS GROUPS AND THE WHITE  HOUSE. I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN SOME  ANSWERS BUT THERE'S STILL A  GREAT DEAL WE DON'T KNOW THAT  WE'RE ENDEAVORING TO FIND OUT.  >> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ALLEGATION OF COURSE. WOULD BE A MUCH GRAVER  CONSTITUTIONAL THREAT TO THE  COUNTRY THAN THE POLITICAL  DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED WITH  BRINGING CHARGES. SHE SAID THIS IN AN ABC  INTERVIEW. SHE ALSO SAID THERE WERE  POSSIBLE CRIMINAL REFERRALS.  >> FOR FOUR YEARS THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT TOOK THE POSITION  THAT YOU CAN'T INDICT A SITTING  PRESIDENT. IF THE DEPARTMENT WERE TO TAKE  THE POSITION THAT YOU CAN'T  INVESTIGATE OR INDICT A FORMER  PRESIDENT, THEN THE PRESIDENT  BECOMES ABOVE THE LAW. THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS IDEA  THAT THE FOUNDERS WOULD NEVER  HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO. EVEN MORE DANGEROUS IN THE CASE  OF DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP IS SOMEONE WHO HAS  SHOWN WHEN HE'S NOT HELD  ACCOUNTABLE, HE GOES ON TO  COMMIT WORSE AND WORSE ABUSES OF POWER. I AGREE WITH JUDGE CARTER IN  CALIFORNIA. I THINK THERE'S EVIDENCE THE  FORMER PRESIDENT ENGAGED IN  MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW  AND THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. >> BUT THERE WILL BE A POLITICAL CALCULUS TO THIS AS WELL. THIS IS INCREDIBLY DIVIDED  COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE VOTED FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND STILL  BELIEVE, WRONGLY, THAT HE WON  THE ELECTION. PROSECUTING HIM, ISN'T THERE A  VERY HIGH RISK TO THAT? >> YOU KNOW, IT'S CERTAINLY NOT  A STEP TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY AT  ALL. AT THE SAME TIME, IMMUNIZING A  FORMER PRESIDENT WHO HAS ENGAGED IN WRONGDOING I WOULD AGREE WITH THE VICE CHAIR IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANYTHING ELSE. AND THE DECISION NOT TO MOVE  FORWARD WITH AN INVESTIGATION OR NOT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE  PROSECUTION BECAUSE OF SOMEONE'S POLITICAL STATUS OR POLITICAL  INFLUENCE OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FOLLOWING, TO ME THAT IS A FAR  MORE DANGEROUS THING TO OUR  CONSTITUTION THAN FOLLOWING THE  EVIDENCE WHEREVER IT LEADS,  INCLUDING WHEN IT LEADS TO A  FORMER PRESIDENT.  >>> YOUR COLLEAGUE, ADAM  KINZINGER, SAID NEW WITNESSES  HAVE COME FORWARD SINCE CASSIDY  HUTCHINSON TESTIFIED. HOW MANY, HOW SIGNIFICANT? IS THERE NEW INFORMATION THAT  REQUIRES NEW HEARINGS? >> I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY  MORE INFORMATION THAT IS COMING  FORWARD. IN TERMS OF WHETHER THAT WILL  MATERIALIZE INTO PARTICULAR  WITNESSES ON THIS TOPIC OR THAT  TOPIC, WE'RE GOING TO WAIT AND  SEE, BUT WE ARE FOLLOWING  ADDITIONAL LEADS. I THINK THOSE LEADS WILL LEAD TO NEW TESTIMONY. IT'S PART OF THE REASON WE  WANTED HER TO COME BEFORE THE  PUBLIC IS WE WERE HOPING IT  WOULD GENERATE OTHERS STEPPING  FORWARD SEEING HER COURAGE WOULD INSPIRE THEM TO SHOW THE SAME  KIND OF COURAGE.  >> HAS SHE INSPIRED PAT  CIPOLLONE TO TAKE UP THE REQUEST TO SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN? >> I HOPE SO. WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH MR.  CIPOLLONE'S COUNSEL. I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN WORK OUT BRINGING HIM IN FOR TESTIMONY. HE CLEARLY HAS INFORMATION ABOUT CONCERNS ABOUT CRIMINAL  VIOLATIONS, CONCERNS ABOUT THE  PRESIDENT GOING TO THE CAPITAL  THAT DAY, CONCERNS ABOUT THE  CHIEF OF STAFF HAVING BLOOD ON  HIS HANDS AND NOT DOING MORE TO  STOP THAT VIOLENT ATTACK ON THE  CAPITOL. AND I HOPE THAT HE'LL  DEMONSTRATE THE SAME COURAGE WE  SAW OF CASSIDY HUTCHINSON  DISPLAY.  >> WHO IS ATTEMPTING TO  INTIMIDATE THE WITNESSES, AS  CONGRESSMAN CHENEY SAID, AND HOW SIGNIFICANT ARE THE SECURITY  THREATS AGAINST HUTCHINSON? >> I HAVE TO IMAGINE THE  SECURITY THREATS ARE VERY  PRONOUNCED. CERTAINLY OUR MEMBERS ARE  FEELING THEM AND HEARING THEM. I HAVE TO EXPECT THE SAME IS  TRUE OF HER SINCE THE FORMER  PRESIDENT AND HIS ENABLERS ARE  GOING AFTER HER. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE IS SAFE. WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS. WE HAVE THE CONCERN OVER THE  SAFETY OF OUR WITNESSES, WE HAVE CONCERN OVER PEOPLE TRYING TO  INFLUENCE OR INTIMIDATE  WITNESSES.  >> WHO'S DOING THAT? >> I CAN'T COMMENT ON SPECIFICS. >> BUT YOU KNOW? >> WE WANTED TO LET THE COUNTRY  KNOW AND ANYONE IN THE FORMER  PRESIDENT'S WORLD KNOW THAT IF  THEY SEEK TO INTIMIDATE  WITNESSES, THEY WILL BE REFERRED FOR PROSECUTION AND WE HOPE THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL MOVE  AGAINST THEM. WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE  WITNESSES ARE SHARING LAWYERS,  THAT ESSENTIALLY, AND THIS GETS  TO SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WE  REVEALED DURING THE CASSIDY  HUTCHINSON HEARING, THAT THEY  ARE REVIEWING TRANSCRIPTS, THAT  THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY COORDINATING POTENTIALLY THEIR STORIES OR  THAT WITNESSES FEEL THEY HAVE  GOT BIG BROTHER WATCHING WHEN  THEY SIT IN FOR THEIR  DEPOSITIONS. >> SO ON THAT, I WANT TO ASK  YOU, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  CASSIDY HUTCHINSON DESCRIBED  HAVING BEEN TOLD BY ANOTHER  INDIVIDUAL IS ABOUT THIS TUSSEL  IN THE BEAST, THE PRESIDENT'S  VEHICLE WHERE HE ALLEGEDLY  LUNGED FOR THE WHEEL DEMANDING  TO BE TAKEN TO THE CAPITOL. THE COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY  INTERVIEWED TONY ORNATO AND  SECRET SERVICE AGENT ROBERT  ENGEL. WAS THIS THE FIRST TIME YOU  HEARD ABOUT THAT INCIDENT? DID THEY BACK THAT UP OR  CONTRADICT THAT SYTESTIMONY? >> I CAN SAY I THINK WE'D BE  INTERESTED IN HAVING HIM COME  BACK AND OTHERS THAT CAN SHED  LIGHT ON THIS. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS  THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ANY  DISPUTE OVER THE FACT THE  PRESIDENT WAS FURIOUS THAT HE  COULD NOT ACCOMPANY THIS ARMED  MOB TO THE CAPITOL. THAT SEEMS TO BE UNDISPUTED. AND THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT  KNEW THAT THE MOB WAS ARMED,  WANTED THE MAGNETOMETERS DOWN SO THEY COULD TAKE THEIR ARMS TO  THE CAPITOL, THAT DOESN'T SEEM  TO BE DISPUTED BY ANYONE EXCEPT  DONALD TRUMP, AND HE HAS, AS  WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST, NO  CREDIBILITY AT ALL.  >> QUICKLY BEFORE I LET YOU GO,  WITH YOUR INTEL HAT ON HERE, THE BULLET THAT WAS USED TO KILL AN  AMERICAN JOURNALIST HAS BEEN  HANDED OVER TO THE UNITED  STATES. IT'S UNDERGOING BALLISTICS  TESTING. IF ISRAELI SOLDIERS DID INDEED  KILL HER, WHAT CONSEQUENCES  SHOULD THERE BE? >> I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE AN  INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION SO WE  UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE AND WHY. ONCE WE KNOW THAT, THEN I THINK  WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THE  CONSEQUENCES SHOULD BE. BUT I DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATION AND  I'M GLAD THAT TH

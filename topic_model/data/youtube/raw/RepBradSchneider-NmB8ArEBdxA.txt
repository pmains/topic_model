I rise today in support of HR 35:37 the veteran entrepreneur ship training Act of 2019 and I thank mr. Spano for joining me in introducing this legislation and helping lead this effort to improve the program to ensure veterans can continue to take advantage of the boots to business program it is an honor to be here today to celebrate and honor our nation's veterans entrepreneurs just this week we celebrated Veterans Day and last week we marked National Veterans Small Business Week every member of the military has already demonstrated their love of country by committing everything including potentially their lives in the service of our nation and when their service in uniform is completed many veterans direct their passion to starting a business such dedication to nation and community should be recognized every day this is patriotism and not a partisan issue that's why I'm pleased that the Small Business Committee can once again highlight how we put aside the differences we may have in some areas and now bring these bipartisan bills to the floor today entrepreneurship has always been a bedrock of the American economy particularly for our returning vets that's why our committee is focused on bipartisan solutions to repay our veterans through policies designed to ease the risk of starting and running a business I thank chairwoman Velazquez and ranking member Chavez as well as the committee staff for working with us to increase the opportunities and resources for veteran entrepreneurs HR 35:37 bolsters the Small Business Administration's boots to business program to enhance our ability to ensure that it is effectively serving aspiring business veteran business owners there are approximately two and a half million veteran owned businesses generating one trillion dollars in receipts such successes are a draw for many of the men and women leaving the service today to become their own bosses entrepreneurship provides a promising opportunity to continue serving their country creating jobs and their local communities while supporting their families empowering vets to succeed as entrepreneurs should be a viable option for people trained to lead inspire and achieve remarkable things their success Spurs local economic development and demonstrates our commitment to their aspirations of entrepreneurship but starting a business can be complex and sometimes daunting the process can seem overwhelming but programs like boots to business offer resources and assistance from experts giving aspiring entrepreneurs the lessons of others previous experience initially launched in 2012 the boots to business program offers transitioning service members and military spouses insights into self employment and business ownership the veterans business outreach centers are trained and empowered to deliver these services to over 180 military installations nationwide in 2018 over 17,000 veterans service members and military spouses participated in the two day course research has shown that servicemembers are distinctly qualified to start and run their own businesses while serving the military they learn how to make good decisions and chaotic environments and our natural confident and driven leaders each year more than 200,000 service militarist members make the transition from military to civilian life transition assistance is critical to ensure that those who serve in the military have opportunities for meaningful employment HR 3 5 3 7 addresses the many issues we've heard from veterans by updating many aspects of the program and also offering certainty by codifying it for the next five years I again thank mr.

uh i mentioned the uh the five-year plan and and and cook inlet and i think there was a lot of a lot of concern in may when the department canceled lease sale 258 um citing lack of industry interest and i can say with real certainty that was that was not the case but in the environmental analysis the department's experts stated that if no lease sale occurred the price for gas would increase as would emissions due to use of alternative fuels so i mean the the problem that we're facing here is in alaska we're already paying some of the highest gas prices in the country and so it was just kind of stunning to people to actually read the department's own words that cancelling this sale would actually actually canceling the sale would increase the the emissions increase the costs so can you can you tell me why this particular sale was was canceled what consultations were done with industry that led to this claim about lack of industry interest because the folks that are coming to me are saying we we absolutely uh are interested were interested now there's no opportunity because it's been taken off the table um thank you ranking member it it it was the fact that actual oil companies did not show interest in cook inlet i i recognize that the oil and gas association um did show interest but um for for us to move that forward we would have had to have interest from the actual companies who would be uh bidding on the leases and right but if there's if there has been nothing that has laid down they can't indicate what their interest is it's kind of a uh you know chicken and egg or horse before the cart i mean but but what happened was there was no ability no opportunity to even show an interest because the sale was entirely canceled well well i i appreciate um your perspective on this and um i i'm not sure what to say other than what i have already said um in any in any other sa lease sales we have actual companies showing the interest uh the industries they put forward you know ideas uh for those opportunities and we didn't get that with respect secretary my time has expired i will just share that uh what we face is that uh 80 of the of the natural gas um that comes to to the most populated portion of the state comes out of of that cook inlet and there is a real concern that now that this is taken off the table what comes next thank you mr chairman thank you

as president the next vote the boat will take in less than an hour is a vote that would exercise the Congressional review Act which I'm a supporter of the idea that we should use the congressional review act is a good thing for us to look at what any administration does in determine if that's the right way to go today I certainly intend to vote to maintain the position that the administration's had on the the affordable clean energy rule this is a in this is a rule that will have very positive impact on our state just like the rule it replaces would have had very negative impact we're in the top five coal using States for energy in our state what the Obama administration's rule would have done the massive energy regulations would have imposed billions of dollars in compliance cost that would have been passed along every single time that someone harvest a crop flick flips on a light switch shops for groceries or walks into the door at work under the Obama era rules families in Missouri would have faced double-digit utility price increases and in fact the average Missourians utility rate would have doubled in something like a decade this would put that rule about for this Congressional review Act would put that rule into effect as opposed to the rule that replaces it now all these rules always have good titles this the current rule the rule that the Trump administrations put into place the affordable clean energy rule would replace the clean power rule and that's significant they both proposed to do the same thing one says they'll have clean power the other one says it'll have clean energy the difference is in the title is actually the difference in in effect which is one proposes affordable clean energy doesn't seem like a very tough decision you want affordable clean energy or clean energy that in my view was clear really not affordable what the new rule would do would be look at individual sources of energy and decide from a selection of things that can be done what to be done at those individual sources I was on this floor mr. president many times talking about this rule prior to the 2016 elections and had been held in advance by courts that said no it went to for the administration didn't have the ability to do what they were trying to do when I was on the floor all those times talking about what this rule would do to our state and our economy and similar things all over the country what I said was if you next time you write your utility check just write it out of your checkbook again because within a decade that's exactly what you'd be doing you between paying twice as much in Missouri for utilities as you're paying right now the cost would have gone up and it would have happened quickly thankfully president Trump and the administration with the support frankly I believe today of Senate Republicans will have charted a new course resulting in huge strides toward American energy independence we're doing that on other fronts in fact September and August were the first two months in 37 years that we had been a net exporter of energy not an importer of energy energy self-sufficiency is important and it's particularly important when you really have an all-of-the-above strategy from oil from natural gas from nuclear from wind from solar all of those things are now part of a portfolio of energy that needs to grow but doesn't need to grow in a time that cripples American families when they try to pay their bills or frankly when they try to get get a job to become a net exporter of energy we've done all those things while we were still cutting emissions a carbon dioxide emissions in the power industry are down 8% since 2005 without the clean power plan ever having gone into effect the EPA's affordable clean energy rule strikes exactly the right balance in my view and I believe today a view of the majority of my colleagues between reducing emissions and ensuring that Americans can still continue to have access to reliable affordable energy you know many families the energy cost is one of the big things they have to think about when they think about their budget in fact for many families there's not much of a budget to think about you pay whatever you're paying for your housing and then you pay your utility bill and then you see what's left over the luxury of actually getting to have a technical budget about how you're going to do all the things your family would like to do doesn't happen all too often now it would happen much less often if the utility bill is twice what it is today the action we take here today supporting the affordable energy rule and walking away from the clean power rule will make a difference for those families makes a difference in the utility bill at home and it makes a difference in the utility bill at work lots of jobs just simply don't work at twice today's utility bill it was a foolish rule it's been properly replaced with a rule that makes sense I urge my colleagues to vote to maintain the rule that we're headed to rather than the one that we're running away from

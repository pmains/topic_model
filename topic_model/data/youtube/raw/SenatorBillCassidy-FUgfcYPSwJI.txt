go to uh senator bill cassidy of louisiana he knows something about heat joins us right now out of the nation's capital but i i am curious senator what you make of the dilemma that californians are in right now because this is the same state that by 2035 wants to ban all uh you know the gas powered car sales and by then hopefully they say have everyone be you know tooling around in these fancy schmancy and often expensive electric vehicles but the grid can't handle it and already the governor himself is advising those with evs to cool it on charging them what do you make of that and deal i think you're absolutely right they don't have the grid and it's unclear that they will have the grid by then in 2035 13 years they're going to have to permit and finance a tremendous amount of expansion in a state which in many areas is incredibly densely populated and which has many challenges to permitting not in my backyard is a very strong phenomenon in california it brings to mind steve jobs old quote that aspiration without implementation is hallucination and you're wondering if some of those lawmakers aren't hallucinating you know it does get back to a basic issue about the reliability of our grid even taking evs and charging them through utilities out of the equation we can barely keep up with things now this is sporadically popped up in a number of states even texas a couple of winters ago you know i'm just wondering when this thing really explodes to your point it isn't that you need enough electricity to meet your demand or future demand you need redundancy on top of that and so california has to increase both the amount that they have for what they predict but then go a little bit more right now they're relying upon electricity imported from other states what happens when those other states begin to put in evs and have to keep their electricity in their state i think the demand upon california is going to be huge and i think it makes you have to say stop let's think about these plans let's see if we can implement and then let's do them at a pace at which we can implement you know senator cassidy well i have you here and i was just talking about this with uh caleb mcgee white over at the washington examiner this focus on a former president trump and and and the documents taken from his home apparently a lot more than we earlier thought i'll get into that later sir you're probably up on it more than i am but that the fixation with constantly getting into this uh whatever the justification has a number of republicans worried that there's no talk of the economy no talk of what's happening to our grid to your point what's going on with inflation and that this is sucking up all the proverbial oxygen in the room but do you agree with that i think there is a danger of that the press is obviously hyper focused upon mar-a-lago last night president biden made a speech as head of state which was incredibly partisan and was really that which is a political leader of a certain party and that mar-a-lago parade allowed him to do so and if you will it's a shell game don't look at the issues before us an out-of-control border associated not just with people but but fentanyl coming across our border inflation which although easing is still terrible the the price of natural gas and therefore utilities continues to climb and then crime itself he's able to divert from that to speak about mar-a-lago and frankly the press goes along with them fellow republicans in in in defending him right maybe maybe with the best of intentions but also keeping the conversation going i think we got to talk about we got to talk about the issues before that kitchen table and if we talk about real solutions to those issues critique them but offer own solutions we win if we're talking about something else they're setting the agenda real quickly on that very point senator the president has just told our own peter ducey uh quote i don't consider any trump supporters a threat to the country now the tone of his speech last night to your earlier point was anything but it sounds like he or people around him regret those remarks i don't think they regret it at all he's just given some after the fact cover they are trying to change the narrative away from the economy away from crime away from the border this is part of their tactic and then later on they do a do-over no they're trying to set the narrative we need folks you know properly concerned about what's before them about the kitchen table issues about the border uh if if that then our country will be in a better direction because frankly i think republicans will win all right but you said that they might endorse those remarks no matter what he's saying that's still alienating half the country you think they're okay with that uh yeah i think they're probably okay with that they know they have to get their base energized and and he wasn't speaking last night as head of state or as president he was speaking as a partisan political leader that's why none of the broadcast networks covered that speech senator cassidy good seeing you have a safe weekend you too neil senator cassidy on all

are risking their health to stay on the field alright Zachary Keys joins us now to explain how federal health officials will try to get athletes coaches and parents to play it safe Zachary yeah that's right the Center for Disease Control has been studying head injuries for about the last 15 years specifically concussions related to sports and in injuries they know more now than they've ever known before and and that's the real troubling thing here is that culture is tough to change every concussion is brain damage let it shuttle in in front of a group of student athletes congressman bill Pascrell and a doctor from the Centers for Disease Control zeroed in on new concussion research they were teaching tools there were new studies about long term effects of brain injury but the most alarming and toughest to address is the culture around the game games like the fourth quarter you need to score according to the new report nearly 70 percent of young people with a possible concussion continue to play with concussion-like symptoms which means a lot of this falls on the athletes themselves now that you kind of know you can sensitive your heads really this group of guys play football for Garfield high school they were invited here because they're an example of what's working I'm proud of Garfield their coaches take head injury training they're educated about concussions but at the heart they're conflicted they tell me they practice you around for eight regular-season games that's hard work Christian Bermudez had all the right answers then I asked him straight up what would you do in truth it's not a laughing matter it's a tough issue and for players who love their sport and who have dedicated their life to do it doing the right thing is often the toughest dr. grant Baldwin was CDC we need to build a culture in sports where athletes are encouraged by coaches and parents to report a concussion regardless of how important the game is the CDC report includes a number of different strategies including improving the way that coaches and players talk about concussions and how they're reported but I think the big one here that we touched on in the beginning and the peace talks a lot about is changing the culture it's hard being tough and you're playing through pain and the teenagers they don't worry about what happens twenty years do not want to be perceived as weak out there right they want to you want to have that instinct and in football for example it's a combat sport so you know what you're getting into to start with you think that maybe some of these bumps and bruises come with the territory but this is really serious stuff ya know the more we learn about it the more serious it does get down the road you have a concussion as a kid all right exactly thank you learn stuff we appreciate it and of course last year Fox 5 took a close look at the danger student-athletes face on the field you can see Dan Bowens Fox doc report on the Fox 5 and why YouTube a well a large view look at that a large tree fell

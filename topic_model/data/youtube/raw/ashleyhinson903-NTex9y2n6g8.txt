well good morning everyone and thank you so much for joining us for this episode of hot seat with hinson i'm congresswoman ashley henson i'm actually out in dc this week working hard for iowans and i wanted to introduce you all to a great candidate from texas who is running to help us flip the seat flip this seat in texas and turn our house red so cassie garcia thank you so much for joining us this morning uh tell us more about the district that you're running in and a little bit more about your race in texas well congresswoman i'm so honored to be here with you this morning and we're so excited about have a real opportunity to flip the seat um running in district 28 which extends down in the rio grande valley up into laredo san antonio into guadalupe county it's been democrat control for 110 years so we have a real opportunity to flip the city it just became a toss-up and yesterday cook announced its new ratings we're now a d plus three seat uh from a d plus five and uh people are fired up and energized especially with the red wave that sent myra flores to congress on june 14th that's the same red wave that's going to send me to congress and the same red wave that's going to send nancy pelosi packing come this november absolutely well and you are just such a good example of why um you know we're seeing this change across the country and especially in the rio grande valley i had a chance to come down there as you know i'm in early june cassie and and see what was happening at the southern border there and um that is truly a catalyst for for change in that area for people who feel like they've been left behind specifically the hispanic community and you mentioned myra flores obviously that's the first time we've been able to flip a seat there in the rio grande valley to a hispanic republican woman and we're going to in essence you know because we're hearing this from voters and republicans and conservatives are listening um it's a really great chance for us to flip those seats down there so um what are you hearing from from the people who are uh you know approaching you down there in texas what are the biggest issues that are impacting your daily lives so you mentioned the border so thank you so much and you've been a big advocate in the port patrol working with them closely with the sector chiefs and seeing firsthand the crisis on our southern border and we talk about to when i talk to voters every single day they are frustrated with theirs what's happening on our border um especially specifically in laredo sector and rgb which also is in part of district 28 um and they're sick and tired that the administration is not paying attention to what's happening on southern border when you talk about the hispanic community we support a strong and secure border uh and we support legal immigration not illegal immigration the fact that the administration is okay with us releasing 7 000 migrants per day is unacceptable on our southwest border uh we need to protect the people in our country in our communities we got to keep them safe we've got bailouts that are happening every single day people are migrants that are dying you know they're paying cartoon members it's a billion dollar industry in our southern border especially laredo and they're making a ton of money but people are dying the amount of fentanyl drugs that are coming across our southwest border especially specifically the rio grande valley laredo and del rio sector is impacting communities every city is now a border a border city and the top issues when i talk to voters every day is the economy they're talking about inflation i talked to moms and dads to tell me cassie i have to make a decision whether to put gas in my car or buy eggs and milk but yeah we have people coming in this country illegally they're getting cell phones that are getting transportation into this country and i yeah i have to make you know my children are eating one meal a day that's unacceptable and that's why i'm fighting that's why i'm in this race to to win the seat and talking to voters every single day and you know what's been so powerful talking to democrat voters saying cassie i've voted democrat my whole entire life i'm voting for you i'm voting republican because your values align with my values and the reason why i am running for congress is to defend faith family and freedom and the democrat party has left the hispanic community at the end of the day the hispanic communities are are dealing with this uh catastrophic crisis on our southwest border especially in district 28 and it's not fair and come this november we're going to see more democrats more hispanic democrats vote republican come this november because of the issues because of the horrible biden policies that we're seeing on our border right and i think it goes without saying that president biden and this administration inherited a secure southern border and when i was down there near mcallen i had the chance to see in person literally the steel that is destined or was destined for that wall construction to actually help keep our country safe and stem this tide it's literally sitting there resting away in a parking lot basically in mcallen area so i had a chance to see that in person and and you hit on cassie the the inflation and the true economic issues that are affecting our families right now uh 9.1 inflation a 41-year record high meanwhile we're seeing democrats here in washington dc continue to push increased spending at a time when we are seeing this rampant and out of control inflation and then they're talking about raising taxes on our small businesses as well so can you talk a little bit about that impact and what that would mean for your small business community and you know a lot of these hispanics have truly come to the united states the right way um and and establish their businesses and their lives and their livelihoods there in texas yeah so the our small mom and pop shops are definitely being impacted and they are even impacted when we had the non-essential travel shutdown remember the 19 months uh we couldn't have we so we share a border with mexico and we have the number one land port of entry in laredo texas 16 000 commercial trucks across that border every single day but people that residents at legal visa holders were not allowed to travel back and forth we have so many businesses in our downtown market in laredo specifically uh they were being impacted by that and now you want to raise taxes and these you know we one we can't get workers to get back into you know we have restaurants they're looking for workers and we have guests uh you know you name the business you know that are being impacted right now and now you want to raise taxes when we're seeing 40-year record high inflation 9.1 and i've talked to business owners yesterday and they said cassie we are feeling the pinch right now you know i'm happy to think about you know next year am i going to be able to continue hiring people you know am i going to lay off you know they're barely making it right now you have kamala hair saying that we have more money in our pockets i talk to business leaders i talk to the community i talk to families they don't have more money in their pocket and so the solution is not to continue to spend you know we're almost at a 31 trillion dollar federal national debt right now we need to control we need to watch our spending we need to provide relief to our communities to the business uh community folks that are being impacted by this every single day you know i talked to moms too and i know you're we thank you for your efforts and and congresswoman andy stefanik on the baby formula shortage we had uh shortages in our shelves in district 28 and we were trying to figure out where to get milk and uh formula we had moms that were actually traveling to mexico to reynosa to tamalipas to go buy formula and bring that back over here we talk about gas prices right now we have families that are traveling to mexico for to pay a dollar less in gas and then come back over here because of the the biden uh agenda their war on the oil and energy that's affecting our district here in 28 as well so it's it's just crisis after christ after crisis but our you know our mom and pops that make up our economy here that employ so many people in district 28 they're being impacted by uh this inflation and so we need to provide real relief and that's why they're turning to me and saying cassie you know i've voted democrat my whole entire life their values don't align with with with our values you know and i'm you know i love the fact that you're fighting for us a small business owner and i'm fighting for everybody everybody for every mom dad rancher uh landowner you know every law enforcement official our healthcare frontline workers i'm fighting for everyone i will work hard every single day and i'm going to work hard to earn the vote of every voter district 28 and we're gonna together with this red wave uh flip the seat come this november and we're gonna take back the house and we're gonna fire nancy pelosi absolutely i think we share a lot of common goals there so we're gonna what i think is abundantly clear to me and you mentioned crisis after crisis we have a true competency crisis in the white house and with the leadership if you want to call it that in congress so um it's time to fire nancy and you are going to be a huge part in helping us to do that so cassie i am so proud to support you and get behind your campaign how can people watching today learn more about your race yeah so you know i'm honored to have your endorsement in in my race here and so we're asking anybody if you want to volunteer if you want to donate uh to get my message across so that people can know about why i'm running for congress we i ask everybody to go to cassieforcongress.com i'm not going to let the new york times or anybody else say that i am a unique as a breakfast taco or say i'm a far right latina i'm an american first you know i'm pro god pro family pro country and together we are going to show everybody that we can we can't flip the sea i can't make history we can make history um a republican conservatives never represented this district 28 before and we are going to show them and we are

thank you for joining i'm glad you're able to take the time here this morning i appreciate this opportunity to have some great panelists to share with their share their insight and and perspective

small business ventures so joining us today is dell geinz the senior community development advisor for the federal reserve bank of kansas city the omaha branch also joining us today is the founding ceo of the grow nebraska foundation janelle anderson irkey and janelle has led the organization since 1995. it's great to see the growth of her organization there next is andrew verbos uh ceo and founder of pacha soap in hastings and his company was inspired by a service trip to peru actually as a junior at hastings college in 2013 it's uh great to see his his company grow too uh his footprint is around the globe finally is a kevin griffith founder and ceo of amplify capital kevin holds an nba cpa and a juris doctorate he is a subject matter specialist in financial management and strategic planning before the covet 19 pandemic our economy was at record highs as you know in businesses small and large were really prospering now due to unforeseen circumstances our communities are faced with significant obstacles but we know it will be our small businesses which which bring us back so efforts such as the paycheck protection program created by the cares act have saved over 51 million jobs according to the small business administration while programs such as the ppp have been able to help many small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic it is the knowledge and hard work of our employers and workforce which have made a huge difference in our economic comeback and our communities in order to help small business owners further today's panel will focus on one of the issues i deal with daily in my work on the ways and means committee as a whole and that's small business growth thank you everyone again for participating i'd like to begin by providing each of you with the opportunity to share your perspective on how you've navigated the coronavirus and how you or your organization supports your clients or customers with the goal of sustaining or growing your business throughout and beyond the pandemic mr guyton so would you like to begin sure first of all thanks thank you for having me congressman smith it's always um thank you you know great to to to stay in nebraska and chat about nebraska since i'm from nebraska um i'm from the federal reserve bank of kansas city out here at our omaha branch and for those of you may not be familiar with that it's a central bank of the united states so we're responsible for monetary policy my specific focus is community development where i focus on small business and economic development primarily focusing on um entrepreneurship ecosystem building and i think that's probably where most of you that are watching or will watch um recognize me you know for across the state of nebraska and so as you may suspect monetary policy has been a pretty big big deal during this time um we've effectively lowered the interest rates to zero in terms of trying to stimulate help stimulate the economy during the recession and then also we've launched the main street lending program to kind of support um you know banks as they do their lending process but more specifically what i've been working on is to try to help organ communities well first of all to understand what's going on during the pandemic especially with our small businesses and then to prepare strategy for uh the recovery for our small businesses and so we've really been working diligently on gathering information sharing it with our president esther george so she can go well not go but be present virtually in washington to make monetary policy decisions this is really important because you know what happens in new york and what new yorkers are experiencing is not the same as what's happening in uh mccook nebraska which is one of my favorite towns outside of omaha um so we we try to be as diligent as possible in you know gathering information from from a wide variety of folks and sharing with esther and then also trying to communicate out to our communities you know things like what's going on with the ppp or eidl or other stimulus funds that are available i'm trying to continue to gain insight so that we could share publicly with what our small business stakeholders are facing because relatively speaking while this is really a public health and a small business pandemic when you uh compare it to kind of 2008 and 2000 uh recession uh there wasn't that much energy around the small business sector this has been front and center um but what it showed us is that we have a huge gap in our entrepreneurship ecosystem um across the united states and in nebraska in particular and this is something that people have been working to address so i've been on the um blueprint nebraska small business committee and we tried to extend that into um the nebraska builders uh you know work group that's designed to build a better ecosystem in the state of nebraska so we've been working on that it's been going slow but we're still working on that process and then we've released a guide well we will be releasing the guide and doing substantial outreach over the next 12 months called the small business owners of color recovery guide because while it's impacted our entrepreneurs across the nation significantly as it attacked our entrepreneurs of color even more so with early stage projections even though it goes up and down based upon the impact of the stimulus and opening and closing the economy that 42 percent all african-american businesses across the nation closed um roughly 30 percent of immigrants and hispanics almost 20 percent of white businesses and uh right around 20 to 30 percent for women-owned businesses as well so we have a strategy of outreach to kind of help create what is called recovery communities to kind of organize their local ecosystems kind of address the needs during the recovery and then we're still really supporting the entrepreneurship ecosystem building methodology to try to be able to and i'll give you just as a great example so if we look at our neighbors in kansas they have a phenomenal program some of you recognize called network kansas it's an entrepreneurship ecosystem building model that was passed through state legislation back in 2004 the kansas growth act launched in 2007 another in 66 counties with the exception of one it's all rural it allows communities to self-organize around access to capital connecting the dots with their other peer group stakeholders and financial institutions and entrepreneurs and i really like to see something like that um in nebraska even if it's not the same program conceptually and we already have a lot of other things that are working so with that you know i'll turn it over to other folks and when we have q and a if we get to that point we can talk a little bit more about it sure thank you dell janelle what can you tell us this morning thank thanks again for joining us and appreciate your perspective take away thanks congressman smith it's always a pleasure to be in part of the one of your panels i feel very humbled there's a lot of great information what we've really been um thriving to do with the nebraska small businesses that we have the pleasure to work with is is get them to digitally pivot um what's their digital footprint it's been interesting as we're helping businesses um transition to a complete or at least have an online presence it's it's a a new normal that we need to do things like what we're doing here the face-to-face um networking is you know right now something that's definitely on pause and how do we help businesses develop clients and contactless payments curbside pickup we are we're very happy that grow nebraska has established a very strong relationship with google i'm gonna you know probably tout this till the day i die you need to make sure google loves your business um i would have named my daughter that if i would have known what i know now um it it is so important we have a high impact gold partner we're the only organization in the state of nebraska and so we do a lot of training on google a lot of people are like well you know why is my google maps so important well now more than ever your seo and have a google love you and have an apple map and all these wonderful things that um get in your wheelhouse and also having multiple channels of e-commerce how people can find you um we were thrilled the businesses that we had the opportunity to work with especially i did some stats on third district um their sales during corona on online were up 150 percent now i only wish that we could have done more and we're working very hard right now in the communities um right now we'd have a project in alliance sydney and mccook um but how do we get businesses to make that transition so that they can thrive and survive when they're not able to have customers come in so we're really working on developing a number of strategies helping them connect with other organizations making sure they have strong business plans obviously so they can get financing but you know we're also working on the you know the facebook ads the algorithms we're doing two webinars um that are open to the public always the third and fourth thursday of the month i'm going to be honest i'm a little zoomed out and webinared out everyone's kind of shaking their head but but we've got to get knowledge is power and now more than ever we've got to get our small businesses that knowledge and power we're ramping up for one of our most successful holiday seasons for a number um for the small businesses and it's going to be tough i mean we're competing everybody's moved to a online presence and so now more than ever um you know having your google adwords in place we're doing a lot of work with that so i guess at the end of the day um congressman we're just really working on how do we get businesses to digitally pivot or have an extremely strong digital footprint so that way if they search something nebraska businesses come on top and that's not easy but we're going to keep working on it very good very good thank you janelle uh andrew andrew boss your thoughts you need to unmute yourself andrew thanks uh thanks congressman smith um i don't have a lot to say i i guess i just go over our experience and what happened and um maybe some of the things that we did but um sure for us a lot of our business was wholesale in retail so when retail stores were shutting down we had to really stick to core products and also look at other products to get into so we got into some different products that people were obviously looking for like hand sanitizer so that was a help to pivot to new categories some of which will stay in for the long period and i think just maybe more of a soft um action that we took was communicating that this is going to be okay it's not the end of the world we're going to all get through this and providing some positivity like we had a campaign called we got this that it was good for everybody to be part of to just um show that we're going to survive this as a business we're going to survive this as a country and we saw a lot of our consumers appreciate that message in a time when that was really scary so when when it flipped to be really hard and difficult and uncertain i think just providing a message of yes it is but we are americans we have gotten through uh we've gotten through this as a nation before we'll get through it again and so it's almost just providing a path forward and then and then you whenever that's communicated to your team or um every part of your company or even your consumers then it kind of frees up the imagination to solve the problems but i echo it janelle said obviously we see a huge shift towards online so there's tactile things that we're able to do but just from a soft perspective i think that really helped very good very good thank you andrew and kevin griffiths i'm not sure i'm gonna have much to add um we saw a lot of businesses pivot uh to digital we saw capital markets contract so the government programs were very helpful with that you know a lot of uncertainty and so it was very much a day by day thing you had both a revenue problem you had cost problems you had to retool factories that they were healthy they were safe for workers to go in um very much a day-to-day type thing and like andrew said just constantly reminding people you know there's not there's an end to this uh we'll we'll get through it and so that that's really where our focus has been um that and one other thing would be the remote workforces trying to understand those business models how that works a lot of uh businesses that were had invested in information technology structure and had good partners they were able to pivot pretty quick on that very good very good um well we'll certainly open it up to questions and while folks are thinking about their questions i i have some questions um dale i was wondering how much you're hearing about workforce issues workforce availability and obviously we've got this balancing act that's hard hard to accomplish with some unemployment and also what i'm told is high demand for employees especially on the supply chains and so forth dell can you speak to that at all yeah it's really it's it's really interesting because obviously every industry was hasn't been impacted equally so you still have you still hear the the the huge shortage in skilled labor which was a pre-covet challenge we know that we faced in nebraska too so you're looking at you know things like construction workers um truck drivers things of that nature that are still there um and you you still see some of the other um industries that were in high demand that that were there obviously health care i mean that goes without saying um and it and it's so it's really is is industry specific one of the biggest challenges we had having a lot of nebraska is actually underemployment um and i think you know as we see the unemployment rate continue to decrease based upon the opening and closing of the economy that that's that's still going to be present and so you know trying to figure out it it's such a this is such a unique and weird time i mean i guess that's the only way you can can put it because it's throwing off any of the things that were used to be consistent and making it inconsistent so by and large though um you know in your in your historical industries that we've seen shortages that you know you're still seeing them and in certain industries that were significantly more impacted by covet and of course you look at some of your uh industries like restaurants and others that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic um things like salons things require you know hands on you know have been impacted and so i think we just what we really need to do and i'm so appreciative of the the individuals on who who've said you know we we can weather this you know we're nebraskans we can we can deal with this and we'll come on come on the other side but i think while we're doing it we really need to to broaden out our look at how our workforce is being impacted how our small businesses are being packed and start planning now um because we have a dual dual track pathway we have to consider which is how do we end up you know making sure that our small businesses recover in a healthy way and actually do better because nebraska has always been middle or low to the pack in entrepreneurship and then simultaneously how do we look at our workforce needs and continue to say okay well we still have these deficit gaps in skilled labor cdl etc but we also have this huge you know group that we're going to have to figure out how to redeploy into the labor market based upon what happened in the pandemic and so to me this requires nebraskans to come together especially those in these fields and really put our noodles together and say okay we know we stopped to deal with the pandemic today it's still here it's still real it's still increasing i think i read we had another record number uh recently but while we know that it's going to end so so what do we need to do to ensure that nebraska is positioned to be the most competitive that it possibly can be coming out of the virus and that's kind of where i'd like to see some of the conversations pivot to very good um janelle when you say pivot to technology and an online presence um i'm just wondering what is generally required for you know say a business that that doesn't have as much online as there would be capacity for and what what does it take for them to kind of transition into that like cost wise or even labor and and then if if you might even toss out some examples um absolutely i i think the the first thing um congressman smith when we really work with the businesses we're developing their digital game plan do they have a website you know a lot of businesses will say well i have a facebook business page great but at the end of the day you still need to have your 24 7 you know your web page you know and you need to make sure that you're using really strong meta tags key search words um can people find you the most wonderful thing that's happened with technology is now through wordpress uh wiki you know back pack you had to bring up 1995 when i started i'm kind of a dinosaur you know websites were thousands of dollars you know back in the day and but now um through technology i'm you can get a pretty decent um you know we call it what we call it a brochure website um and you know it's it's not very simple you know not it's not very sophisticated but it does a nice job tells the story obviously now the key thing with digital pivoting is you've got to be able to tell a story through photos and you know people don't want to you know gone with one novel but you know telling your story that you're real and people love the fact that you know i feel sometimes that you know covets giving our small businesses an advantage people love to support small businesses and know they're real and so we're really working with are you telling a really good story so obviously that website's really important you know here's an example of a digital pivot so dorothy lynch most of us know dorothy lynch okay so they'd had no not online presence and so they came to us and um said we want to create an online presence we know that our um clientele is you know janelle sort of your age you know 50ish and up people are though those are the people otherwise you know we're competing with a younger crowd that loves ranch so um if you go to dorothy lynch's website you'll see that they've added a purchase or buy button and it goes to our amazon listings that we're designing we also work and there are large companies so they they are working with a marketing firm swanson russell or our buy nebraska um site so i tell businesses you know pretty affordable we can do what we call a collection page where it actually clicks to our shopify site and if you take a look at um pacha uh soap company has a beautiful shopify site um andrew high five you know we take a look at your site and use it as an example all the time um i do think you have to have a facebook presence we would do a lot of work with um facebook and then that google map now again i'm going to go keep saying you've got to love google you can put events on google last month our by nebraska store had over 50 000 views of photos of our nebraska businesses that we reciprocally then link to an e-commerce site it's building a brand but you know i tell people we've got 50 000 views off our google map they're like wow janelle but i'm like we have 247 photos on our google map okay 247 pictures on our google map we add photos to our google map each and every week the other thing congressman i'm going to say is you know creating a strong digital footprint is something that has to be done intentionally and consistently so there is some expense because some time but you you've got to reinvent yourself and you know once you get into the habit like for example my job is every day i go in and i look at our um twitter page and i retweet and i'm and you know that's my job it takes me about 10 minutes you know about the same time it takes me to brush my teeth obviously you know i've got another team working on our facebook and now there's tick tock we're doing some things on that um but most small businesses i'm telling them we're also seeing some great success on pinterest but you know get on a couple things have a strong website generally facebook is where most of our clients are at this point and figure out have numerous you know channels for e-commerce um we're also spending a ton of time you know i'm gonna say you need to love google but the other one we've gotta love which is a big beast it's called amazon okay we're not going to get away from amazon right and so you if you can and we offer upc's we need to get as many of our nebraska products on amazon and then you know that brings in a whole new structure because these sites aren't free but you know so there's it's it's hard to know what um to tell you what a range of expense but it definitely needs to be part of that business plan and part of that you know financial needs of you know making um put in money for your digital marketing because it's it i i i think it's everything and i think at the end of the day if a business wraps their arms around it it gives us a true advantage you know i we've got an eyelash company that does magnetic eyelashes in the wonderful town of alliance nebraska and she's doing some phenomenal stuff with her shopify site because she's in you know she's finding her niche and doing some great things so i i don't know if that really answered your question congressman but i think that sort of gives you an idea i i appreciate that i appreciate that and you know it has been interesting uh you know just personally speaking as as uh my family and i we've been here in in western nebraska since march with a few exceptions of heading to dc for votes and so forth um but obvious i mean our personal habits are much more digital uh related to you know finding stuff online um here locally you know it's the the curbside service at target i think has really enabled them to compete against you know say amazon that does things a little differently um it's just been fascinating now i i've noticed where our uh entrepreneurs are selling um beef and pork online huge opportunity they've been selling out obviously they probably have more capacity to sell product and then they can supply and so we're trying to work on that from the federal policy standpoint of what can we do to empower these smaller processors to be able to meet the needs and fill orders and so it's as you can imagine it's no easy task especially when you're talking about food safety and you know all of a sudden a huge demand and i really appreciate the entrepreneurial aspects of of these operations who you know they're they're cranking things out and it's it's quite impressive um kevin i i wanted to ask you what you think of um you know kind of where the federal government has helped financially in in the business sector and what gaps and actually this is for the entire pan am panel um what gaps do you think remain i mean we we've seen some proposals for relief out of washington that you know just when i i think went far beyond what they needed to you know we need to be bold certainly uh but i was just wondering what kind of gaps are you're seeing now i've i've talked to a a ppp recipient very grateful for what they needed and it's not that things have gotten easy all of a sudden either but they said the next the next round they won't need that and so and i have i mean their their needs are going to be in other areas covet impacted um but i i was just wondering what gaps you think there are that we we should look at in washington sure um well i think to start off you know where where we started the ppp program was was a big help uh the edil programs were also very big helps fed actions were incredibly helpful just to ease uncertainty right in terms of finance panics are huge problems and so the the quick actions that happened you know when the pandemic hit across the board really put people in a comfort it put them in a position where like okay if somebody can help me bridge the next three months i can figure out what to do that's really what um was the problem that we were facing a lot was you know where'd this come from and now all of a sudden everything that we were planning is gone and we need time and so that's that's what that ppp really enabled i think you know uh as dell mentioned earlier it's by industry you know the housing market the housing sector really hasn't seen a slowdown and that's a huge driver of the economy you know the commodity prices are depressed so that's going to have impact on your agricultural companies agricultural based companies oil-based companies things like that so i think it it and then obviously your service businesses anything retail has slowed down tremendously and so i think you know i there's not like 100 million people employed in the service business i'm not sure what it is in nebraska that's really where i think the focus should be i think your more b2b larger companies are probably going to weather it okay and i think capital markets are starting to calm down uh especially for that for that group so i would say the gap still looks to be um you know those service businesses and making sure the really small call it 10 and under employees have that financial backstop because no they don't have two weeks of cash uh in the balance sheet and so that's that's really where i think the focus should be going forward okay others anyone else um looking at you know and obviously i i wouldn't choose for us to be in the middle of this pandemic obviously i am fascinated though to see what we can take from it you know whether it's federal policy whether it's you know where some entrepreneurs have stepped in and and really uh filled a gap filled a need that's uh that's out there and so with every new day there's more data and so i hope that we can see data that is available for for entrepreneurs to sort through um if any of you see things that you'd like more information on uh please let us know that certainly uh appropriate for us to share from the federal government i just think there are opportunities for us to find a lot of instruction whether like i said whether it's you know federal policy or economic uh strategies and so forth i i just um i think we can be stronger for it as painful as as it is and going through this and i um you know talking to airline pilots who are furloughed uh that that's obviously a problem i think there are some parts of our economy that we had taken for granted um and it's going to take some time even under very positive circumstances it will take some time for things to to realign i i think if one thing we want to make sure is that we get at the federal level we get our unemployment policy rights a one-size-fits-all approach i don't think is is the answer uh that's certainly what i'm hearing from small businesses across nebraska they they would prefer nebraska not have the same type of thing as new york in california um and so some of that has expired but there's a huge push by the speaker to go back to the 600 a week bonus or enhancement above and beyond state unemployment compensation and so that's that i know that concerns a lot of nebraska employers and like i said we we want there to be a relief uh in a in a good way in a smart way that that actually doesn't build barriers to getting getting our economy back on track so any anything uh anyone want to add to that or or uh or disagree too but that's okay and again this is my personal opinion not necessarily the views of the federal reserve banker system one of the things i think worked really well was um the expansion of unemployment benefits to small business owners like that's historically been a very challenging thing for small business owners um and i think during the pandemic that's that's been useful and i think it'll actually uh end up saving a lot of small businesses um you know so my wife owns a small fitness studio and fitness training facility and immediately all of that business was shut down during the pandemic and so her ability to go out and you know get unemployment benefits for that which if memory serves me correctly these may have been one of the first times that was available for the small business owner was a significant thing obviously you have to use intelligence you know when you apply these strategies because you're like you said congressman you the ultimate objective is to you know restore strength in the economy restore balance in the economy and restore good quality growth in the economy and in nebraska specifically in this this conversation but you know speaking about it from the entrepreneurship lens i think a few things that we've seen is that ppp and eidl has worked i mean it's not without hiccups we know that there's challenges with how the funds were distributed across diverse you know industries business sizes and populations but on net we've heard a lot of benefit from that the eidl program and it raises the question of going forward can we look at more forms of intelligent capital flexibility for small business owners we know that continually we're seeing these gaps in the credit marketplace between traditional banking microfinancing um you know nebraska would do well to to beef up their angel investment their venture capital it would do well to look at alternative in scaling up microfinance and city of firebase lending and other forms of lending um both you know as we're going through the pandemic and also when we recover because you know capitals the lifeblood of businesses so i think if anything if there's a silver lining in any of this crazy pandemic stuff is that it's shown us that we can do things differently like janelle was referencing like some of the other business owners were referencing there's ways that we can lift the world differently in terms of our business the way that we organize our financial institutions and processes and the way that we organize ourselves and hopefully some of the positive lessons that we learned can carry through in scale so we can make nebraska healthy and stronger yeah it's interesting uh my wife and i we we opened a small airbnb behind our house here in gearing last winter so right before covet hit and we'd started to build up some reservations we'll covet hit wiped out almost all of the reservations and you know i felt a little bit sorry for ourselves but uh like i also thought there's a lot more pain elsewhere so we're not so bad off and literally just when things started to reopen i mean that that thing filled up and is still full today and i mean just a lot of activity we had folks from colorado because colorado was still shut down longer than nebraska was so they they had cabin fever they wanted to come up we had folks you basically telecommute uh for a week you know who drew up here from denver um so my point is that you know there's this desire you know by consumers to just keep going to perhaps even go more than they would have uh otherwise and so i think there can be some some economic opportunity through that process as well um i'm curious on our panelists what what you might have seen over the last several months that you were kind of surprised when you first saw it but now when you think about it it's going to continue that you never thought would have would have happened anything come to mind for any of you it's uh anyone there it's a good question yeah and i think you know we had we had been long-seeing shift to consumer buying patterns to online uh this certainly accelerated it um one thing that was interesting that i thought you know had amazon you know been been growing quite fast and retail online retails about 10 of the retail market i'm not sure what it is now but you saw other are you walmart target other retailers compete quite well online and offer different business models and i think you know the way that consumer shops both online and then in person i think we'll uh will continue to evolve uh because of this and and we'll see how i think now you know we we're kind of in this fatigue phase of the pandemic and you know the question to me is like well how will we revert to old behaviors or will it be some kind of permanent change uh going forward and that that that i'm not sure andrew did you have something um yeah i was gonna mention the click and pick that kevin's talking about that surprised me so people buy online and then pick up uh at curbside um it was kind of niche but then the numbers came back from walmart and target that kevin shared with me and it was just far and away growing like crazy and i don't know i guess we we think about that a lot where um online there was always this push for online even prior to the pandemic but we look at it and a lot of people lose a lot of money trying to market online because they just pour money into ads and maybe they don't get the return if they don't watch it carefully so we're always proponent of having a and that omni-channel strategy of brick and mortar and online and how do they work together but click and pick is not really brick and mortar it's not really online it's a hybrid and so and people shop click and pick differently than they shop e-commerce and differently than they shop brick and mortar so it's almost like a new channel um and i i think of course big cpg is going to master it and have already done really well to understand how people shop that differently but it it's a new in some ways it will bring in like a new psychological element for how people shop and it'll be interesting to see do people want to keep that going or are they tired of getting brown bananas so they really want to go in and see what their bananas are like i don't that's the question i guess that we have a lot yeah i hear you i hear you any anyone else on that topic um congressman i was just gonna say how important video became um and online payment portals you know obviously even like alliance rec center um we were helping a number of traditional service businesses set up youtube channels um facebook live sessions um to really and they pivoted really well and you know we're able to maintain and actually go grow their customer base um even a couple insurance agencies you know so um and i really feel strongly that that will continue and um people will realize that this is the new median because you know we look at our buying population you know the younger generation a lot of them don't even have tb so now everything that we can do that's you know through you know different other channels than our traditional media even though that's important is and andrew brought up a really good point um we have to continue to really stress that businesses are watching their margins and as their sales value you know we're doing a lot of you know interesting work i feel in with facebook ads and google ads but at the end of the day you have to really watch other numbers there even our ecommerce emails you know are we getting return because there's costs associated with all that so really sitting down and knowing your numbers now i think is more important than ever before [Music] i would add i would add congressman you know what we're doing today like i've i've spoken at over 30 different conferences around the nation and since kova begin some in places i would never ever be had it not been for the pandemic people it was about a lag of about probably a month and then everybody said wow we can do this stuff online we don't have to organize in person have all this travel costs and these big events and we can get speakers from all across the world to come and speak at these events and i think a lot of that is going to change or is is going to stay there i think you just cannot like this would have been a much richer experience in person just because we would have been able to see each other and and hang out and then the conversations that we would have uh you know on break or before after which you can't really replace via zoom but in terms of actually getting out and and and having these kind of things now now it's become easier because it's so easy i think that's going to where people with a lot of long time that make so we got to get jared we got to get jared's beer going post pandemic uh and have do some other things where i think people's you know suit patterns are gonna change right uh like i haven't worn a suit since the pandemic started and god willing that's gonna that's gonna be a new norm like the questions of professionality like you know i'm joking about it but these things are really things i think about that have changed um as we're doing things like this from our basement as we're figuring out different ways to connect with each other and in the last point on this i think it's awesome for nebraska that we're going to a more virtually connected world because it gives us an opportunity to build new relationships with people across the state that is now no longer siloed in the omaha lincoln western nebraska dichotomy so i think that's a great thing and i hope nebraska continues to embrace it as we build bridges from right to left and north to south so that that's my fingers crossed uh optimistic you know uh ambition going coming out of the pandemic now we we did have someone adele weigh in that says they follow your facebook and uh you've you've offered information on how your suits fit on on facebook now i yeah that's my good friend jason tuller uh you know like well that's and that's a good point i i probably don't wear suits because i gained that cove at 15. so you know maybe it's it's just me wishing we don't have to go back to suits because i won't be able to fit them after the crisis yeah well um you know it has been interesting just whether it's with my job and studying numbers and and hearing from constituents and and various folks out there as was mentioned you know the housing economy has remained strong uh despite the fact that you know the labor can be difficult was difficult beforehand as well as was noted um building materials very expensive these days and so you know i'm constantly wondering you know what how how long does this last what what's next um talk to car dealers who can't get the inventory they feel they need to sell and can sell um you know just supply chains in general you know started out with supply chains relating to the personal protective equipment and you know now we we hear concerns about supply chains literally across the board i mean the shortage of kitchen appliances and that's you know that's a a reflection of the supply chain challenge as well what you know while that's a challenge yes i also see that as an opportunity though for the american economy because i i think we have better policies in place now as it relates to trade i think that you know we're much better positioned now now especially with our tax policy than we were before with with more competitive tax policy to keep keep companies in the us rather than fleeing to lower tax jurisdictions like they were before our tax action in washington um so i i just think that you know there there are some aspects here that that we can be well poised to to get back on track more quickly than we would have otherwise what else anyone else want to comment on dell's facebook exchanges no just teasing uh janelle well i'm let's go go ahead as you can see i'm glad that nebraska stayed open for the most part and um you're seeing a mass exodus out of states like california because people really weren't able to work from the state laws so um you know it's really an advantage and you i have more and more people not thinking it's so crazy that we're in nebraska now so that's good um so for states like ours it's um i'm i'm appreciative of how things have been handled for the most part from a business perspective yeah good good uh broadband access janelle do you come across many of your members who um just don't have the access that they uh that they need or that they feel that they would want to expand and grow congressman that's an excellent question i have to say that i really feel that um nebraska has really worked hard on on that topic i think there are some pockets that are still you know like even um in the little town of wilsonville it's only about 30 miles away from me there's some places that you can't get cell service you know obviously um we've done some really good work there with their internet but i'm i'm not seeing that um much with the over 400 businesses that we work with most of them have come up with um solutions i mean um and i i want to applaud i think our our tele our internet providers in nebraska are doing a pretty decent job which gives us another you know total advantage you know being where we're located and um and i'm going to say that i have to echo andrew's point i was really glad that nebraska was fairly good about letting our small businesses stay open and keep things rolling because there's a lot of small businesses that that was the only reason that they were able to to keep going and i'm really hoping that this next wave you know we've really worked hard but we have to continue to work hard um shutting them down is is is going to be tough as you know i mean it's just going to be be tough and and i think the other thing is you know having both now we need to look at a model that's both brick and mortar and an online presence and if a business can wrap their arms around that and hopefully have um like you said good broadband they can they can get it done you know um but it's yeah so i i'm not seeing that you know a lot of people ask me that but you know we've always done almost everything um because the foundation hasn't had a budget so we've always had an online newsletter and we didn't do a lot of print and so and we've had a you know website since 1998 so i i you know i'm not and but again i'm sure there are areas that could be improved but overall i think i'd give us a pretty good score in nebraska that's good good to hear i i you know i'm always wanting to stay ahead of that curve there um because you know i mere access is one thing capacity can be another that um you know if if someone if a family say had internet access before and they could you know browse maybe play some games a little bit you know it's a different situation where if mom and dad are both working from home online and two three four kids are needing to go to school online too that that can pose some challenges so i you know i always want to make sure that we've got the the um those options that are out there uh jason it looks like uh you you want to uh click in there and and bring up your point if you would like oh you can't says you can't talk okay i'll read it then it's unfortunate that federal broadband money can't be used in most of our small towns because according to the federal rules they have adequate internet those rules need to be updated to higher speeds and they need to include price when ogallala can have a hundred megs for fifty dollars and imperial at ten megs for 70 but imperial didn't qualify for federal funds because it had quote unquote adequate internet aloe came to imperial so it's better now but there are other areas that are in the same boat and uh yeah i i hear what you're saying and um we will you know like i said always want to stay on top of that and you know it's been interesting broadband i think is part of our nation's infrastructure now that doesn't mean it's funded the same way our highways airports and bridges are funded uh but i think there's pretty much common interest that we want to make sure that this type of infrastructure communications infrastructure is out there and available affordable as you mentioned and so filling in some of these gaps we're going to have to get more creative i think the first thing we want to do at the federal level is make sure we don't discourage investment from the private sector and i think the federal government tends to tends to end up discouraging investment even when they don't intend to but we want to leverage that investment in a creative way so that we can have have more capacity that's out there affordability uh as well so appreciate that anyone else i would just i would just refer people who are interested in that we've been doing some great work around broadband um we've produced a really great report called disconnected and my peer jeremy higley from who's in our kansas city maine bank he's been doing outreach convening a lot of the nation of the state's uh broadband directors or those that function in that equivalent to address this issue because we know it's a problem it's not just a real problem it's an urban problem too um you know i've heard things like jason referenced in terms of pricing for um you know 10 10 megs just to give you an example i have a gig internet from centurylink for 60 a month for life here in north omaha nebraska and you know people like jason reference they're paying 70 for 10 megs and then they can't get coverage projected out past their driveway so i i so appreciate that you said congressman that it has to be part of our national infrastructure because right now you know and so imagine a community that that needed to pivot to online strategy like let's say like janelle is suggesting and had no access so and then it's also a quality of life issue it's a population retention issue it's a entrepreneurship issue et cetera et cetera et cetera so i think this is something that we really need to pay attention to to ensure that you know all nebraskans have adequate access to the internet whatever we may consider that may be as long as it's it's at a relatively decent price regardless of how we get there i think it's a nebraska priority that we should have yeah um i've i've supported uh efforts asking the fcc for for some funds to upgrade systems and so that is a that's uh something that i've done on on my end and also looking at mapping we need to improve mapping right now broadband is mapped actually by census tract and so that is such a vast designation uh in a rural area that it's not useful so we need we need more precision uh on that front as well and at least in terms of the the rural aspects so anything else i know we're kind of running out of time here i really appreciate the discussion here this morning and certainly uh everyone sharing their their insight um there are other questions or points that anyone wants to raise uh please just let us know i i should note here that josh jackson out of my washington office has has been online uh on on the call here the whole time and um also jared out of my grand island office as well many of you see jared out and around the district so appreciate that i also should note here that sean caskey notes that the that unk recently conducted a rural study are relating to broadband so i'll be anxious to learn more about that thanks sean for for bringing that up and if you could get get me in my office more information on that that would that would be great so fortunately uh uh i'm glad i had the redundancy of my phone um and speaking of digital access since my ipad wasn't wasn't working this morning i'm glad i had my phone here but i really appreciate everyone's participation and like i said if we can be of assistance please let us know and hopefully we can meet in person one of these days soon so thanks again and have a great day and a great week take care

thank you mr chairman thank you mr chairman senator murkowski i know we're going to tackle this as we've always done in a bipartisan way it's a particularly important hearing we have three wonderful public servants two of whom i got to serve with in the house and in the senate and general skocroft your extraordinary services is legion and here's how i i come to this first i can't help but noting that the staff has pointed out that this is groundhog day and you know we've gone at this thing again and again and again and let me start with you if i i could congressman hamilton oh old friend you know on this question you know of volunteerism i mean it seems to me as as important as that is it's really not voluntarism it's good science all of these issues are constantly driven by good science policy i know you share this this view as well i mean at the end of the day if somebody volunteers we still have to find a way on the repository issue to make sure it's a safe place where you can keep it for a thousand years so if you would give me your sense of how we can figure out a way to link the idea of getting people to volunteer which nobody i think in their right mind could be opposed to can link that in a very practical way to getting the good science that at the end of the day is going to help us figure out how to do this well obviously you have to have good science you you cannot dump this stuff in a place that can't contain it for a long long period of time so what has to be done is that the federal government and it's my understanding at least under today's authorities and law it's up to the epa to develop generic disposal standards and the necessary regulatory requirements to go along with that so that those standards scientifically based would have to be a prerequisite if you would of moving ahead with regard to any site so when i was speaking about voluntary i i didn't mean to exclude the good science part of it obviously i understand the two things have to go together i think we'll want to follow up with your staff some more because obviously you've done a lot of good work in this area but that that was my one concern in terms of the big picture issue is how the link was going to work between volunteerism and good science let me if i might ask you three because of your expertise a question on the defense waste issue maybe we bring you into this general scope crop because of your military background this is something that concerns folks in our part of the world senator cantwell's constituents and mine hundreds of thousands of folks in the northwest because the columbia river hanford you know really our light lifeblood concerned about how the process is going to go forward to dispose of high-level waste from from the nuclear weapons you know program and over the years there's been a sense it really went to hanford because well hanford you know was there and when you think about you know yucca i mean one of the unfortunate secrets about about yucca was that it wasn't going to be big enough for all the waste that would need needed to be you know disposed of i mean it was for 70 000 tons of spent spent fuel your own report indicated that uh we would need much more than than that you all note uh continued operation of current plants would roughly double the amount of spent fuel by 10 10 50. so the bottom line is that our country needs to find capacity to dispose of a lot more nuclear waste than really has gotten out one and that putting all of the nuclear waste eggs in one basket like some thought about with respect to yucca seemed to me to be a questionable approach from the get-go i'd be interested in the thoughts of the three of you whoever wants to take it i thought of you mr hamilton and general silkoff but all of you senator domenici as well how many disposal sites do you all think the federal government ought to be pursuing to deal with this defense waste issue what what's your sense of that congressman hamilton you want to start or any of these three i think what we said in the report is one or more we really did not try to make a judgment about that uh i would think almost certainly it would be more than one but there were my judgment would be we'd end up with several there are plenty of sites i think available in the united states that would qualify but we did not make a recommendation nor did we try to say how many my time's uh getting uh beginning to run out uh general scowcroft senator domenici the review on that um uh i think that that is correct what what whatever happens to yucca mountain for example we will need another site we know so there will be at least two i think we have not we did not have the resources nor the time to make the differentiation between government created we waste which is much of what it's at hanford and commercial uh reactor fuel so we have one of our recommendations is to urge a quick study on whether or not the government-owned fuels or the government-owned waste should should be a part of this system or whether doe should continue to manage that we simply didn't have the time to look into that last word for my friend senator domenici if he wants it well i think you ought to uh in response to your question that i would suggest that the committee take a good look at the at the reality of military waste or defense waste it is much of it is ready to be disposed of it's already been put in glass whatever the words are for that what do you call that one it's been it's gone through the process of vitrification and it's ready we did not have the time to to pass on whether we should separate that out and go with a repository for it all alone but we suggested that the executive branch look quickly and what should be treated differently and proceed perhaps with dispatch to establish a facility for the military actually if you wanted to prove up something you could do that one and do it first it it's ready and it is not reusable i mean it doesn't have to be wait around to be to be reused it is finished it's it's going to be deposited in that form and never used again and there's a lot of it ready to go thank you mr

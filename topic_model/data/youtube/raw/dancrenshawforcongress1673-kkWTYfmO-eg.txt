- And it's about bringing our
Texas values to Washington and shielding Texans from Federal overage. We talk a lot about Texas values. I know my competition
does but I'm not so sure they know what that means, so I wanna give you a few ideas. I think Texas is freedom, it's patriotism, it's the shining lone star
of these United States. It's hard work. It's giving your kids a
better life than you had. It's teaching them the right values, respect and self sacrifice
and love of life. It's self sufficient
but it's never selfish. We give more to church
and charity in Texas than any other blue state I can think of. Texas is church on Sundays, best barbecue on the planet,
it's world famous rodeo, and it's chasing pictures
in fields of blue bonnets. (crowd cheering) Texas is a place where
patriotism still has a home where the spirit of 1776
is still alive and well and we remember the values
that made this country great. It's a place where we went
on our own independence. Started the Battle of 1836. We won that from Mexico. We know what it means to never quit. We know grit and perseverance. We demonstrated that right after Harvey. We know what it means to never quit. I know a little bit is bounce back, too. And I can tell you one
thing, one thing for sure, I will never quit on you and
I will never quit on Texas.

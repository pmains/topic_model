recognize the gentlelady from that represents Gator Nation uh miss Cameron who's a great friend of mine thank you Mr chairman and yes we do represent the gator Nation home to one of the best damn football teams in all of the nation as well as a wonderful research institution so Mr chairman thank you for your support not just of the Gator Nation but of this issue I think it's critically important that we address this issue and I feel like we've hit on all of the topics really in some way or another so I do want to give you all the opportunity to narrow in on something that hasn't been addressed here yet today but before I do while you're thinking of that I would like to ask you guys particularly when we're seeing federal agencies collect data from various companies and then using that data in ways that may or may not I'm not going to say ethical but uh there's a bit of a gray area in how that data is being used what are some of the National Security implications for that data collection and then the subsequent breaches that we've seen and I'll start with you miss rich and then we'll go down the line well um there's so many ways this has International implications that's that's a big piece of this for one thing well for one thing you know U.S companies are having serious problems in Europe because Europe uh believes that the US doesn't have strong enough laws it affects trade it affects companies ability to uh process European data and then as in the U.S because they're not allowed to transfer it which creates a lot of inefficiency so that's a serious trade and credibility issue we have um as we deal with with uh issues of hacking and surveillance from other countries there's not only uh is the data exposed but we have very little credibility as we deal with those other com countries and you know it comes up you know in The Tick Tock situation um people talking about banning Tick Tock well I think we'd have more credibility talking about that if we had a Privacy Law of our own um and and then there's the costs of on disproportionate costs on U.S companies of complying with multiple laws and I appreciate that I wanted to make sure I give Ms Stevens and Mr Mudd an opportunity as well as quickly as you can so I agree with my colleague and I do think that the biggest risk to all of this is the unfettered collection storage and sharing of data and that creates cyber security risks that creates National Security risks and so that's why we have to pursue a framework that minimizes the amount of data that companies are collecting and storing and puts limits on how they can share that information Mr Mudd very much agree with that in you know in the tech world we call that surface area right the more the data is out there um uh the the bigger the risk right data is infinitely replicable and can be stored at you know forever and so the degree that we're able to limit it through technology through regulation um then we reduce the risk National Security and otherwise do you think that we should require or have a way to incentivize that data servers be housed here in the United States as part of the National Security framework when we're talking about housing our data misgivens I think that gets you into risky territory really quickly and part of the reason is we need the global flow of information around the world it's how the global internet functions it's how we're able to communicate and do business with other nations it's the way in which the US is being a leader in Innovation around the world is through that free flow of information so instead of just throwing up firewalls what we need is strong data protections across the board that make sure that everyone's following the same rules as opposed to having to impose these really hard to enforce walls on data localization something that I haven't heard yet today is the emergence of AI Chachi PT how AI is going to essentially revolutionize the data collection models and what what are some of the implications of using AI with some of these algorithms and these platforms we can go down the line and then I'll open it up to you in the one minute and seven seconds that I have left Miss rich one implication is this is an area where technology has become so sophisticated and the FTC laws basic laws can't get at it in the way they they were able to get at issues earlier thank you Congress is going to be grappling with this issue for a long time as AI transforms our society one of the first things we need to do is just get a handle on which companies are using these tools and making sure that they're going through a responsible process when they're deciding how to design them and how to deploy them through impact assessments and that's one of the provisions in the adppa and why it matters excellent thank you Mr Mudd would make two points first um uh that regulating the use is really important as as Ms Rich mentioned and and flexibility to adapt um you know to further use cases along the way is really important the second is um I think that explicit bias detection um can play a really meaningful role in in in in this uh and then the last would just be around transparency right understanding uh when AI is at use um and and so consumers have some understanding of of the end result excellent my time is expired so I'll have to yield back so sorry uh thank you generally maybe Mr Roman maybe Mr uh overnults he'll give you a few moments Thank you very

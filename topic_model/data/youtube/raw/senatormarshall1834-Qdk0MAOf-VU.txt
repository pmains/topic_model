Thank You mr. speaker mr. speaker it's always good to go back home and this weekend was especially rewarding for me my wife and I left UDC this past Friday afternoon flew through Dallas landed in Wichita sometime shortly after sunset as we hopped in my truck as snow it started to fall and it was a beautiful Kansas evening we got home and got to see our two boys I woke up the next morning early sterling Kansas for a business meeting then went over to Salina and got to meet some more of my friends on the way home I got to listen to the radio listen to a Kansas State Wildcats basketball game and hear the Wildcats win that game by one point and then when I got home a special treat I got to watch both the Kansas University basketball team win and watch my Kansas City Chiefs win and I got to watch those games with my two boys so it was a trifecta for Kansas a great day the next morning I woke up early for church and went to early service and basically had to hop in my truck and come back to Washington DC last that that same afternoon on that way home on the way back to the airport I got a little bit of time to reflect and one of the things that had come to mind was something that my good friend my mentor the former Majority Leader the longest-serving Majority Leader in the sentence Senator Bob Dole had told me one thing senator Dole says every time I see him is to always remember where I'm from and I think I get that I think most of us get it that that we were from is so so very important to us and I've always done a good job with that but the other thing that he talked about I approached him one time when we were having a tough issue here in Congress one of the first issues I had to vote on and what he told me rather than giving me an answer giving me as a pain was to go back to Kansas and the people of Kansas would tell me what to do so was ironic as I went back home for these meetings and to go to church is everywhere I went I heard the same thing I heard the same thing from from people in church that I had no idea that they knew so about what was going on in Washington in salina and sterling everywhere I went people asked me when is Congress going to give the president his money to build the border a very simple question so it allowed me to kind of ponder the issue a little bit more I've stood president since day one on this issue when I was running for Congress I made national security border security the top priority on what I was going to stand for and today I've been to that border as a physician of 25 years and now a congressman for two years I would tell you this there is indeed a humanitarian crisis on the border as well as a national security issue on the border when you whether it's considering the 2,000 people that come across that border illegally every day every night we house some 40,000 people we give them a bed we feed them every day two tons of illegal drugs come across our borders two tons of illegal drugs come across our borders mr. speaker that sounds like a humanitarian crisis to me and sounds like a national security crisis to me people didn't often ask me well why don't we compromise and I would tell you this I feel like we've compromised already the president myself most Republicans we asked for 25 billion dollars to secure those borders and to provide humanitarian help for people we thought we probably needed to build a thousand maybe 1500 miles of border we've compromised from those numbers back to asking just for 5.7 billion dollars and now we're asking for monies to build about 234 miles of not a wall but a barrier of fence I think that that is compromised and Mr Speaker I would ask that you come back to the table now and negotiate in good faith mr. speaker people often talk that there's seems to be that this has to be an either-or opportunity that we either have to have border security or show compassion we can do both America can do both we can have border security we can provide for the humanitarian needs of people and we can come up with a compassionate long-term immigration process this system needs to be totally overhauled I'm all in we've had several great bills that we try to get through so mr. speaker back to the table let's open up the government and let's secure our borders Thank You mr. speaker

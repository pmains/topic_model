AND WHO KNOWS WHERE WE WOULD BE  IF WE HAD, YOU KNOW, LOST A FEW  MORE SEATS IN THE HOUSE AND TIM  McKAVRTY HAD BEEN THE NEW  SPEAKER. THEY VERY WELL MIGHT HAVE  OVERTURNED THE RESULTS OF THE  ELECTION. THEY SEEM TO BE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK  FOR THAT IN THE NEXT  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. SO LOOK, WE DO HAVE AN ENORMOUS  AMOUNT AS A COMMITTEE TO LOOK  INTO ALL THE EFFORTSO OVERTU

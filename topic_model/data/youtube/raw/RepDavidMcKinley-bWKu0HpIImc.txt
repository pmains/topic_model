thank you chairman and i just want to remind the committee that uh kevin sunday's wife is about to deliver a baby his his second son so we all have to appreciate the attention that we are getting his attention on this very important day but let me let me direct some questions to you to see how alert you are uh kevin so the first is are you aware that the international energy agency and others have stated that it's virtually impossible to reach net zero carbon emissions without carbon capture uh yes sir okay and so to capture carbon won't power plants and industrial facilities need a new source review permit to add this equipment it's fact specific if they'll need if nsr would apply but they're going to at least need to go through the lengthy determination process thank you and since nsr is a complex and convoluted process epa for example epa has issued more than 690 guidelines and policy documents on it over the recent years would you agree that this process discourages implementing carbon capture and other clean energy technologies yes i would agree with that okay so in your testimony you just said we need therefore we need to reform nsr my question is is there nsr reform in this package not based on my reading of the bill no thank you so why should we expect anyone across this country is going to do carbon capture uh so when you factor in it takes two to three years to get a permit a a an nsr permit that cost millions of dollars to achieve and that assumes two or three years without litigation and then add to five to six years for the engineering design the permitting by the states and the installation of this equipment we're talking about it's conceivable that a utility company or manufacturer would take seven to ten years to install carbon capture so i back to you sunday is it reasonable then to assume that we can expect an eighty percent reduction in co2 emissions by 2030 uh no sir i believe that'd be a very tall order without further reports what about 100 reduction in co2 emissions by 2035 in power plants now same thing okay so let me let me change just directly just a little bit on this and go to plastics because that's part of it under section 902 during the pandemic do you recall the shortage of plastic masks gloves shields and gowns under ppe yes yes and america was it was painful and life-threatening for our healthcare workers to not have access to ppe so if the current manufacturers were unable to meet the demand last year in the year before why would then would it make more sense to make more facilities have more facilities to produce more mass gallons shields and and gowns yes we should have a streamlined permit process to accommodate that type of dynamic market so i i i it's fundamental here now so you turn to section 902 of this bill it withholds permits new permits for facilities that would produce plastics or the raw materials to use to produce plastics could this section therefore prevent the opening of the new petrochemical complex north of pittsburgh in menaka pennsylvania or the one being plan in eastern ohio yes i believe that language would jeopardize future investment into those types of facilities so seriously we just experienced a shortage of ppe and this bill calls for more restrictions on the plastics industry mr sunny am i missing something no sir and uh beyond ppe we use plastics in automotive devices uh weatherizing homes uh recreational products like canoes uh and backpacks we actually use some petrochemicals in not just storing and transporting the vaccine but the the components itself to capture the messenger rna so it can cross the bloodstream these are vital life-sustaining products and medical devices that we rely on as you mentioned just to be clear my wife is not going anywhere like at this moment we're a couple days away from that so i'm not being uh negligent by any means but i appreciate the uh the well wishes there and the opportunity to speak before you this morning well thank you again mr sandy i get i gotta say it's just bizarre that in a bill of this importance that there's something in there on under section 902 i just hope we look at that very seriously the impact it could have on us and i yield back my time

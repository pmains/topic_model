we got a lot to talk about tonight and joining me tonight are some of my colleagues we'll be talking about the effect of the shutdown in their area let me welcome my colleague and dear friend for many many years Jim Costa from California mr. Costa I want to thank the gentleman for yielding congressman Garamendi has demonstrated leadership over the years both here in our nation's capitol and when we work together and in Sacramento and I commend your efforts and thank you for giving me this time government shutdown is simply irresponsible it is irresponsible the American public understands that a Congress debates a budget the president submits his proposal we go through our committee hearing process we make modifications changes you win some and you lose some but by October 1st we are supposed to have a budget since to sent to the president and he is supposed to sign it into law now guess what a budget is among the most important things we do as members of Congress and it's the nation's spending priorities and it's thousands of spending priorities and and there are some things we like in the budget and there's some things that we would change but our nation has to have a budget just like every family has a budget every business has a budget and in that family budget the business measures there are things you maybe just assume not not pay a house payment a car payment but we have obligations and commitments to may be responsible and and this government shutdown this manufactured crisis orchestrated by the president in which he proudly proclaimed that he would take ownership of it that they can call it the Trump shutdown as he said so boldly in December is the Trump shut down and it's simply irresponsible and I think the American public for good reason regardless of your registration is frustrated and I suspect many of them like myself are fed up I went through the airport security this morning as I did last week as I did the week before and I thank those security officers with TSA for doing their job they're doing their job and guess what they're doing it without pay that is disgraceful it is just not what the shining democracy of America is about leader of the free world but it doesn't stop there there's over 53,000 TSA employees around the country 54,000 ice officers 42,000 coast guard active duty members that are working without pay working without pay mr. president I ask how would it be if you were to suggest to your employees at your hotels that your golf courses who you have to pay every two weeks or every month that you want them to come to work but you're not gonna pay them it's immoral and it's certainly not the American Way we don't expect people to come to work and then not pay them and this manufactured crisis and believe me it is a manufactured crisis is the real cause for us all to be concerned about national security I mean the challenges we have at the border these these Border Patrol agents these Coast Guard active duty members are protecting our security and we're saying well but you know we don't care if you have a house payment we don't care if you've got a car payment we don't care if you've got other commitments or obligations we expect you to come to work and protect our security and and we're not going to do anything you know to in fact take that into account in a way that is clearly a dereliction of our duties and mr. president it's a dereliction of your duty because you have a responsibility just as we do to ensure that our government is fully functioning we have passed you bills and sent them to you that would fully fund and reopen government last Friday congressman Cox and I had a informal workshop at the Subway sandwich store in my building or my offices in the office where I worked on behalf of the people of the San Joaquin Valley and in that 10 story office building or 1,300 IRS employees that Subway sandwich store has lost over 50% of its business in the last month the two owners the man and the wife I mean they're being impacted the store in the lobby it's lost 70% of its business and there's another kebab restaurant in which he's helping sometimes the employees that are still hanging around they're giving them sandwiches but this is this business I mean so it's not just the the direct impact of over 800,000 government employees across this country people who work for the USDA the United States Department of Agriculture who operate the farm services agencies throughout our constituencies our farmers our ranchers are German they can't go to those farm services offices and apply for loans and other things that are important with regards to this crazy tariff war that is taking place because guess what those offices are closed but it's also the ripple effect for businesses that have contracts with the federal government whether it's with the United States Forestry Service or whether it's with you know other departments and agencies they're not getting paid but guess what they've got employees and they've got a contract that they signed with the United it's government that says they were going to get paid every month and they have commitments to their employees this is mr. president your shutdown and thirty two days into it none of us should be proud of where we are today third-world countries are looking at us and wondering America doesn't do that but we're looking like a third-world country countries around the world just don't shut down their government let me close on this note this is a phenomena that's happened really in the last eight years we had a government shutdown in the mid 1990s by President Clinton and speaker Gingrich and that was not a good thing but normally as congressman Garamendi suggested you have budget requests you have debate in committees you pass segments of the budget and it comes together in an orderly process and ultimately both the house and the Senate passed that budget and send it to the president by October 1st I think there's a another principle here that we need to be very clear about to the American public I don't care which party it is we should not allow bad behavior to be rewarded in this sense if you don't like something in the budget well there are a lot of things I don't like in the budget but at the end of the day you gotta have a budget and to hold hostage a difference of opinion and that's what's happening here this is a manufactured crisis that the president is using to hold hostage a promise a campaign promise he made two years ago to build this wall by the way what's in Mexico we're gonna pay for the wall I believe so yeah that's what I heard congressman Garamendi I may be in over I I heard it not once not twice but more times than I care to remember and clearly Mexico's not going to pay for the wall and and so you and I know but we can and there is bipartisan willingness to improve border security you and I know because we are from California that the majority of the drug trafficking taking place and the other crimes that are occurring are through what we call ports of legal entry now that sounds like a complicated technical term but it just means it's a it's an open border crossing between the u.s. and Mexico in which thousands of people cross every day and many of these border crossings and that's where the overwhelming majority of the illegal trafficking is taking place and that along the ocean and no build no bright and shiny 30-foot wall will make a difference El Chapo who were holding out in prison built walls to get out of prison there are walls under the existing our tunnels under the existing walls that the president was briefed on when he went down to the border last week so I don't care how you build the wall it is not going to improve border security and and mind you we have over 500 miles of existing barriers fences in the San Ysidro border and some of the other portions of the US Mexican border where it makes sense and I'm sure I'm certainly willing to provide support to improve those existing barriers and to provide the sort of equipment of drones and other technical devices that Border Patrol agents and ice agents tell our our cutting-edge that will improve our border security and that's what we should be doing but what we not should be doing is holding America hostage because of a political campaign promise that was made two years ago that's wrong that's simply wrong and so congressman Garamendi you are to be commended for again taking a leadership role in this effort and we've got to do some things here that change the debate and how we produce a budget so that we don't allow group of either party are extreme elements to decide well gee I'm not gonna I'm not going to go through the regular process I'm gonna hold this Congress and I'm gonna hold the American people hostage this is impacting our GDP and and and you know if the president doesn't believe us he should ask his own Council of Economic Advisers because they came out with a report last week and it's not only affecting our economy but it therefore affects the world's economy and that's why we need to reopen government have a thoughtful debate on how we can on a bipartisan basis improve our border security the 1.2 billion dollars we have allocated in last year's budget for border security this administration I'm told to spent around 10% of that 1.2 billion dollars and now we were going to give him another 1.6 and then the president III know it's we're getting close to the Super Bowl but to use a football analogy on December 18th when we thought we had an agreement he decided to move the goalposts I can't say it any plainer than that can you congressman Garamendi well that's that if I might mr. Khosla that's exactly what he did when in the negotiations before inviting the leaders in agreement had been reached both houses we were going to move forward the president changed his mind commanded five billion took credit he said I'll shut the government down and I'll take credit for it and and indeed the credit goes to him you said some things that are very interesting you went back to the Gingrich shutdown and that reminded me that at that time I was actually at the Department of Interior and there was nobody in the department of Tyria except three of us in that entire department that were working then there was the Ted Cruz shutdown and then there were two other short shutdowns having to do with one or the other of the fiscal cliffs in every case our Republican colleagues Gingrich Ted Cruz other leadership and now the president have used the American government as a hostage to get something that they wanted senator cruz wanted the elimination why to kill the Affordable Care Act I don't call what I think the Gingrich was over some tax issues or some financial issues fiscal issues but in every case they used the government as the hostage and now over in the Senate the Senate Leader mr. Mack Sennett er McConnell is cobbling together a piece of legislation that would affect the rest of Americans let me just show you some things here I'm glad you brought your information with you this is handy yes he he's taking a piece of legislation that we passed last week it was a supplemental disaster relaxed to provide additional money in this case this is paradise California where some 30,000 18,000 homes were destroyed and 87 people killed the president was there together with Governor Brown and our new governor mr. Newsom the Supplemental disaster recovery program that we passed last week is over in the Senate and I understand that Senator McConnell is going to take that bill and literally hold not just paradise California but also here we go Puerto Rico remember the hurricane in Puerto Rico this is becoming a habit dropping these things well I was in Puerto Rico last weekend and the recovery funding is a serious matter as it is in paradise and it is simply wrong it's wrong and immoral for us to do this and he intends to hold Puerto Rico hostage along with South Carolina and Houston Texas and Southern California the Ventura area all of which have incurred a natural disaster and in this case the dam breaking in puerto rico in the case of paradise california the great fire that occurred there and the wipeout of a community of thirty thousand people now being held hostage for the border wall so not only to have the US government hostage and the American economy eight hundred thousand employees who are not getting paid and now using the disaster recovery supplemental disaster recovery some twelve billion dollars that would go to recover these communities that have been wiped out now being held hostage so you said earlier that there's something immoral about this that to use people's lives and their ability to recover their ability to sustain their family to get a paycheck to work for the American government to keep this economy moving to be held hostage somehow is terribly terribly wrong but that's what the president is doing and apparently that's what Senator McConnell wants to do with this new bill that he intends to introduce that would hold the disaster recovery program hostage for a five point seven billion dollar wall somewhere on the border undefined something's terribly terribly wrong here now there's an alternative and I think you mentioned it we passed legislation repeatedly beginning on January third the first day of the new Congress and every day thereafter I think that's about eight days now that we passed legislation to open the government that is the new Democratic majority has done that to open the government all of those bills are over on the Senate side there's a clean bill that is also open for discussion on the Senate side this week it is the bill that we passed last week it would fund the government at the appropriation level that the Senate agreed to 1.6 billion for border security and all of the other programs all worked out and agree compromise that bill passed the House last week it's sitting over on the Senate there would be one exception to full funding for the remainder of this year that is until September 31st and that is the Department of Homeland Security which controls the border that would be a temporary continuing resolution until February I think it's the 28th of February I think to the end of February and with what we'll listen to to meet the appropriate border security on a committee process in the house and in the Senate working together with this administration the president there would be give and take there would be compromises and I think if we got back to doing the people's business in an appropriate fashion without taking hostages because it is simply wrong and and and we should not let the American public think that we have lost sight of what the regular order is of the United States Congress to pass appropriation bills and to ultimately pass a budget and and that's where this this incredible egregious activity is taking place in recent years and I think we know that at some point there's going to be a series of compromises and we're going to reopen government so why don't we just do it sooner than later and in the pain and the anguish of hundreds and thousands of people protecting our security that are working hard-working men and women of our country without paychecks and all the other independent contractors who do business with the government who have employees or have small businesses like that Subway sandwich shop in Fresno are the the market or the kebab restaurant and and let these people do what they do best work hard and make a living for themselves and their families and and contribute to our economy because what we're doing right now well mr. Coston you miss la Subway sandwich shop when I was back in district over the weekend I was contacted by a small company operating in Davis California that has a technology that the TSA would employ at the airports to keep us all safer they're going to go out of business they have 13 employees their contract is setting on not finished they're not getting paid for past work that they have done and they just said we don't know how we're going to continue here it's a good program it's necessary for security at the airports that's just one example you mentioned the farmers I've got farmers in my district same problem I've got universities whose contracts with the research contracts are being held up all of that is being held up the reality is that the most important government of the world is not operating oh when they say it's just 25 percent that's 25 percent of the money it happens to be like 80 to 85 percent of the activities of the government and the ripple effect and the ripple effect all the way through department stores let me just close by underlining one comment that you made earlier congressman Garamendi and I know as a member of the Armed Services Committee you are one of our leaders as it relates to our nation's security and I'm engaged with a host of other efforts in the Foreign Affairs Committee and our European allies when you said that that no one could be happier about this series of events than the President of Russia President Putin let me underline that because we're doing to ourselves what the Soviet Union and Russia today have never been able to do us which is undermine our security undermine NATO's security undermining the security of the free world and and that's how serious this is this manufactured crisis has now raised to such a level that we are doing to ourselves what our adversaries have never have never been able to do to us through decades of Republican and Democratic presidents and congresses in which at the book at the water's edge we all bind together because it's America's security and right now I mean they must be I don't know how they celebrate in Moscow but they must be very pleased this evening with smiles on their faces as we look at the 32 days of this government shutdown thank you for you allowing me to use some of your time mr. Costa thank you so very much for joining us and bringing to our attention the issues in your district as well as your experience and the final words that you've said bring in my ears and I'm sure they ring in the ears of people around this world that are looking at our government and going looking at the United States and going what's going on there what is this all about thank you very much mr. Costa

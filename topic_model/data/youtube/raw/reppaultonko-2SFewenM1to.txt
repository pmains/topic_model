mr. Tonko you're recognized for five minutes thank you and thank you chair Womack and ranking member Norcross and members of the committee I appreciate the opportunity to testify today on the fiscal year 2017 budget last year Republicans and Democrats came together to pass a long-term surface transportation bill this was long overdue and an important step to address our nation's aging infrastructure but while there is an awareness of our crumbling roads and bridges underground water systems are out of sight and not getting the attention they require and certainly deserve clean and reliable water for residents and businesses should be a given but sadly our water infrastructure is in terrible shape in 2013 the American Society of Civil Engineers gave America's water infrastructure a grade of D this hidden infrastructure has received national attention recently due to the ongoing crisis in Flint Michigan where aging infrastructure and system mismanagement have combined to create a shameful tragedy there is no excuse for the actions taken by public officials to cut costs at the expense of public health and public safety a decision which will harm a generation of children in Flint Michigan I certainly support more action in federal funding to assist Flint but the situation there is symptomatic of a larger systemic issue our nation's drinking water infrastructure is failing it is extremely difficult for financially distressed cities let alone small and rural communities to find the funds to repair and upgrade their water systems some older cities have been hollowed out and they're unreliable century-old water systems make it nearly impossible to attract new businesses and new investments without adequate water systems small businesses major manufacturers electric utilities and farms cannot function let alone grow the effects are very real as communities ability to create and sustain jobs is at risk in my own district in the city of Troy a major water main break this year cause significant damage and forced businesses and schools and Troy and neighboring community to shut down for a number of days these breaks can bring economic life to a halt when 10 million gallons of water pour forth there's all sorts of flooding situations and concern we have seen you know what this can be in areas like flint michigan Sebring Ohio Los Angeles California in Troy New York and they are not isolated cases the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that estimates that there are 240,000 water main breaks per year on tap atop of that leaking pipes lose an estimated seven billion gallons of clean drinking water each and every day there are over 10 million lead service lines throughout the country last year I toured multiple municipalities water systems in my district while in seeing these systems are immense the city of Albany for example has approximately three hundred and seventeen miles or the distance from albany new york to baltimore in pipes underground this system includes five center 135 years old dating back to when rutherford b hayes was in the White House on my tours I heard countless stories of pipes bursting and public service interruptions all due to a decades-long habit of a disinvestment and complacency when it comes to maintaining developing and improving the way we utilize one of our most important commodities we must heed these warnings local budgets especially in legacy cities with declining populations are struggling to find the funding to improve and maintain their aging water systems this cannot stand there come back opportunities are taken from them other catastrophes can be avoided but it will take federal leadership and investment starting by reauthorizing the drinking water state revolving fund the srf and increasing its funding levels significantly the EPA's fifth national assessment of public water system infrastructure in 2013 showed a total 20-year capital investment need of some 380 4.2 billion dollars between 2011 and 2030 this is a real increase of about a hundred and fifty seven billion since the first is assessment was released in 1995 we are going in the wrong direction we have a responsibility to maintain the infrastructure that is the foundation for a modern society and a modern economy otherwise we leave our children and grandchildren a tremendous maintenance bill while jeopardizing their public health and future prosperity I plan to reintroduce legislation to reauthorize our drinking water state revolving fund the primary source of federal funding to support drinking water infrastructure and I'll do that later this month the drinking water srf was created in 1996 but its authorization expired in 2003 it has not been reauthorized since last year the drinking water srf was appropriated at 18 60 3.2 million 43 million less than fiscal year 2015 funding levels have been relatively flat since the drinking water srs inception causing greater and greater burden to fall upon cash-strapped local governments and communities our budget is more than just the blueprint it is a statement about our priorities and our values as a country and as a congress investing in our hidden infrastructure is the responsible thing to do and it must be a priority of this budget only through robust federal investment and partnerships with States can we hope to reduce the growing funding gap and help water utilities do what is expected in a modern society and that is deliver clean safe drinking water to homes and businesses and manufacturing sites again thank you for letting me appear before you today this Congress must wake up and acknowledge the unseen need for investment in our nation's drinking water infrastructure and the critical role that our federal government must play in order to meet that need I welcome any members input to improve the partnerships between federal state and local governments to tackle this funding gap protect public health and bring our water infrastructure into the 21st century with that I yield back the balance of my time would be happy to respond to any questions that you gentlemen might have no thank you gentlemen mr. Norcross thank you for your testimony certainly the cost of doing nothing is what happens in Flint Michigan we appreciate it at this time as we wait on further members to testify before members day at the budget I will declare this hearing in recess subject to the call of the chair you

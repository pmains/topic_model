New York is one of the bills co-sponsors and he joins us now congressman wonderful to see you it could be here is this one issue that is truly bipartisan well yes it has been very bipartisan Peter King on the Republican side and I and the Democratic side a lot of other people have been working on this together for several years now you and I are from New York in fact you are my congressman I live in your district does it have does the bill have the same resonance for those people who don't live in New York are not directly connected to 911 well it should and it's not only a 911 bill it's a bill that clarifies the jurisdiction of American courts to hear claims by Americans against foreign governments that allegedly aided in acts of terrorism against the Americans on American soil so god forbid if this is something should happen from some other government this would apply there too now the president is going to veto he said he's going to veto the bill we haven't heard we haven't heard that president directly threaten to veto the administration has has has had a lot of problems of the bill and they've said that they didn't like it and they I think it's fair to say they're just not to pass it but both houses passed it by unanimous votes and I'm not so sure they're going to be to it so so have you talked to members of the administration about what the president should do when it lands on his desk well we haven't talked to since the bill passed we have not talked it only passed a few hours ago on I'm sure we'll have some conversations next week do you think you can persuade him not to veto it I'm not going to hazard a guess but I would I think there's a very good chance that he will not veto the bill after all the bill passed by unanimous votes in both part in both the House and the Senate and which means that there's a reasonable chance the veto could be overridden Congress has never overridden a veto by this president and I don't know they particularly wanted that they'd want to risk it now in addition to which the stated reasons for opposing the bill they were worried about the Saudi reaction center right the Saudis have a lot of interests that we have in common and they'll get over it well the Saudis claim and by the way it's bipartisan for and bipartisan against their some Republicans were against the bill as well yeah could it spill over this is what the Saudis claim and other people who are against it or not necessarily carrying the water for the Saudis they say it could spill over and affect other issues is that possible I don't think so the history of relations with the Saudi government over the years i'm just reading a book on this going back to the end of World War two is that the Saudis will do what's in their interests on a given subject on relations to the United States generally it's very much in their interest not to have good relations with us they are undergoing major shakeups in their society they're having struggles with Iran they need our help in many ways they'll be annoyed at this but I don't think it'll go much beyond that well congressman al are good luck with the bill with selling it to the person in particular thank you very much for joining us appreciate it you're quite welcome

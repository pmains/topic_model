thank you chairman wyden and ranking member krepo for your leadership and for the strong bipartisan process on this bill i think it's really really important you know for for most of the time that i've been in the senate almost all of the changes this body has made to the tax code have been to benefit the wealthiest americans and make our income inequality worse an exception was our work last year on the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit which for once made working families our priority and it was our response to an economy that for 50 years has worked extremely well for the top 10 percent of americans but hasn't worked for anybody else an economy where 90 percent of americans haven't had a real pay raise even though the cost of everything from health care to housing to higher education has continued to climb and climb and climb and the people who come to my town halls mr chairman tell me they're working incredibly hard but no matter what they do they can't afford a middle class life they're living paycheck to paycheck they can't save the families i used to work for in the denver public schools whose kids are mostly living in poverty will say that no matter what they do when they're working two and three jobs they can't get their kids out of poverty this has left a lot of working families hanging by a thread with virtually no margin for error in fact a study from the federal reserve found that 30 percent of americans would cover would struggle to cover an emergency expense of 400 and that was before we had these high levels of inflation in the economy driving up the cost of everything from gas to groceries to rent all of this makes it much harder for working families to save for a rainy day much less for a secure retirement among the poorest 20 of americans just 1 in 10 have a retirement account and for the next 20 the rate is 3 in 10. that means if you're looking at the americans who benefited the least from our economy over the past 50 years somewhere between 70 and 90 percent of them aren't able to save that is not the sign of a healthy economy it's not the sign of an economy that is working for everybody it is a threat to our democracy when people don't believe they have opportunity for themselves or their families so we have a lot of work to do as a committee and as a congress and as a country to deal with that and i know the urn act isn't a silver bullet far from it but it is a step forward and i really appreciate i'm grateful that this legislation includes five bipartisan proposals that i've worked on with my republican colleagues on the committee my enhancing emergency and retirement savings act was senator lankford with lead workers take an emergency withdrawal of up to a thousand dollars from their employee sponsored retirement accounts and iras without a penalty so they can cover unforeseen expenses like a car repair or a doctor's visit or a sick kid without having to take on more debt or take a hit to their credit score two of my bills with senator toomey would help public safety officers people like firefighters and police officers and state and local corrections officers they work physically demanding jobs and they often retire early as a result but when they want to access their retirement funds they're hit with a penalty our bill puts an end to that i have another proposal with senator collins to help the spouses of active duty service members save for retirement it does this by giving small employers a tax credit of up to five hundred dollars a year if they make spouses eligible for the employer sponsored retirement plan and the last bill i want to mention mr chairman is the compassionate retirement act with my friend senator burr it would let people battling terminal illnesses such as als access their retirement savings early without penalty and i am so grateful to my republican colleagues for working with me on these bills and i want to thank again chairman wyden and ranking member crapo for including them in the broader package i also want to thank them for their leadership on making the savers credit fully refundable which will ensure low-income workers can claim the credit and nearly double the number of people who qualify all of these provisions respond to the profound and persistent financial insecurity that too many americans still face in this economy and while these bills can help our real ambition should be to build an economy that enables people to not only make ends meet today but also save for a secure future and turn a better life over to their kids and their grandkids an economy where every american not just the wealthiest 10 percent can earn enough to put something away for a rainy day and have confidence they can retire with dignity that should be our level of ambition in this committee and in this congress and i'm prepared to keep working with any of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure we deliver it joe thank you mr chairman for giving me the opportunity to speak and i look forward to supporting this bill thank you senator bennett and you are a major author of this bill i mean you have made significant bipartisan contributions this is what this committee has always tried to be about with respect to retirement i thank you for the good work

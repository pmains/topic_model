yesterday you introduced the keeping violent offenders off our streets act tell me about it yeah when um Daryl Brooks was released on a thousand dollars Bond it uh certainly I think demonstrated once again that uh not only Chisholm uh certainly is incompetent which I think many of us that have been in and around his actions over the last 20 some years uh knew but unfortunately uh you know it was clearly demonstrated in this in this case uh and then a governor who is reluctant to Simply do his job and and fire Chisholm uh we we try to come up with a strategy and and I'm I'm still open to uh what other members of Congress might want to do on this or some things that maybe they would be uncomfortable with but there's uh there's a grant program that the FED can hand out cash to Municipal level as well as the state level it's called the burn grant program and it's funding uh that that is all part of the consideration on pre-trial release uh we we came up with a system that says listen if you're not going to provide that information so that we know that these people can be accountable instead of seeing this tap dance like Chisholm has been doing now for the last year as we come upon the anniversary of what happened in Waukesha then uh you're going to have that funding reduced I mean it seems to be the only thing that might get a Democrat uh DA's attention when it comes to making sure that they uh they don't ignore some of these previous cases like we saw with Brooks so uh you know like I said earlier it's it's something that would cut across state lines it would be more information that would be available to the DA's and the judges and then ultimately I think uh would give up more complete picture of these dirt bags that continue to end up in in front of a judge on a regular basis ultimately though isn't the only way to ensure that appropriate bails are set to vote for district attorneys and judges who will set appropriate bail absolutely and and I think you know one of the things that this would do would uh demonstrate improve that you know there is an ignorance uh as to whether or not they have all of the information before them because that's you know that's clearly what we've been getting from Chisholm in some of these other DA's is that well you know this was something that was shuffled through the system or we didn't have all the information or we did we're unaware of these other crimes that were committed in another state uh we just didn't have kind of a complete picture so uh you know what I think and we should work towards this and also come up with additional items that absolutely demonstrate and underscore the idea that everybody knew what was going on here and either a D.A completely chose to disregard that when it came to bail uh and and that would be one way that voters could certainly hold them accountable

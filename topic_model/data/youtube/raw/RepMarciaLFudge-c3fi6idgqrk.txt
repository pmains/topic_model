early prime minister benjamin netanyahu is defending his upcoming speech before Congress next week in a radio interview this morning Netanyahu says his speech about the Iranian nuclear threat is critical because Iran's ruler quotes calls for the destruction of the Jewish state and they plan on doing it with nuclear weapons congresswoman Marcia fudge is a Democrat from Ohio the former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus and congresswoman thank you for being here and I want to gush it thank you i want to go through these three issues very quickly starting with DHS there does seem to be some movement now taking place in the house of representatives are you confident as a member of the house that a funding bill at least a short-term funding bill will pass before the deadline tonight joy I'm very confident something is going to pass tonight the Senate has actually gone home so they have said to the House of Representatives you must pass a spending bill and I do believe we're going to pass one I don't know if it's going to be a short-term or if it's going to be a long term which is the same thing that the Senate passed this morning and that is my guess it is going to be a long term and not a short-term bill and does John Boehner have the strength to pass a bill and is he still insisting on it being a majority of the majority or will he wind up having to come to your party come to Democrats I believe he is going to have to come to us there's no question in my mind that part of the delay we've had today is because they don't have enough votes to pass it and so I am confident that we are going to be a full participant in making sure that DHS is funded today and I want to ask about the the bibi netanyahu the benjamin netanyahu speech that is still scheduled before a joint session of Congress many Democrats saying they're not going and a lot of members of the Congressional Black Caucus really really led the charge to stay away from I know its not being called a boycott but to stay away from the speech what do you make of the fact that it's still going forward do you believe that its long-term harmful to Israeli US relations I think its long-term harmful I really do because I think that there has never been an issue about Israel that has divided this house the way that this speech has divided this house all of us including myself are strong supporters of Israel and I think that it was just a bad calculated move on the part of BB as well as obviously on the part of John Boehner to do this at a time when we are negotiating a deal that we think is going to be good not for Israel but for our country and the other countries involved I think it's poor timing i think it's ill plant and i think it's a huge huge mistake yeah lastly Attorney General Eric Holder has said he believes the standards for bringing a federal civil rights prosecution are too high and that Congress should change the law what do you make of that I think he's absolutely right i think that until we actually get a handle on how we can address some of the issues like a Ferguson like Cleveland like Dayton and some of the others I think that we're going to continue to find ourselves where we are now which is kind of with our hands tied yeah and on that matter on we do know that the Senate that is going to eventually consider the full nomination of the reddle inch the other body across the road what do you make of the fact that she has been questioned on some issues when she did seem to have sort of a clean way to go through but that she is still being held to account over things like immigration things like property seizures do you expect looking from I guess me out there looking in in a sense because it is the Senate that she will sail through when she went her nomination comes forward I believe her nomination will pass because I think that there are enough people in the Senate who understand her qualifications and her real temperament to be the Attorney General of the United States I do believe she will pass I just hope that it is sooner than later all right congressman Marcia fudge enjoy can I just say this before I go I want you to know that you are the best you are a consummate professional you are a gifted journalist and a great person god bless thank you very much and I would say the same about you you are an outstanding person as well and it's been great to get to know you in covering Congress over this past year thank you so much congressman appreciate it all right

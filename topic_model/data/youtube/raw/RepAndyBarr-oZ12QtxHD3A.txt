of this this amendment will ensure that we embrace all of the above strategy for fighting homelessness and don't artificially limit our options for partners to help us win that fight in uh this bill we are spending five billion dollars on homelessness assistance now i'm not sure how the majority came up with that figure five billion dollars i hope there is some methodology behind picking the number five billion dollars because it's an awfully large uh number i hope that it correlates to some data related to pandemic connected uptick homelessness but because the the majority has not disclosed their methodology i i worry that this is a number that literally has been picked out of thin air i say that because while experts believe that the number has the number of homeless has risen during the pandemic mainly because of uh an increase in unemployment there isn't yet any official data on the pandemic's impact on homelessness or the people experiencing it i would also note a uh a report by the associated press that coronavirus hasn't devastated the homeless as many uh as had feared uh and i'm quoting from the article while shelter saw some large covet 19 outbreaks the virus so far doesn't appear to have brought devastation to the homeless population as many feared researchers and advocates say much is unknown about how the pandemic is affecting the estimated half million people without housing in the united states but let's just stipulate that homelessness has risen because of the unemployment uh and the pandemic let's stipulate that uh this vulnerable population has experienced a a a a uptick in in covid uh contraction uh i think that uh for this population it is our responsibility to ensure that whatever funds we expend are used effectively to help the greatest number of people when it comes to addressing the scourge of homelessness especially during a pandemic that has brought so much hardship we shouldn't be limiting our options we should review the data and understand what types of programs work and what policies may be standing in the way of success my amendment would simply stipulate that 20 percent of the funds not be allowed to carry prohibitions on providers requiring participation in assistance services as a condition for that aid the amendment says that a portion just a portion of the money would not be subjected to the so-called housing first policy because that policy excludes so many transitional housing facilities in the private sector and other service providers despite an objective track record of successfully transitioning people out of homelessness it doesn't say that all one billion dollars must go to facilities with those conditions it doesn't say five billion dollars that we're appropriating here has to uh go to facilities with those conditions it just allows some of those facilities to be eligible for a portion of the funds specifically one billion dollars or 20 percent of the total there are a number of facilities in my district who operate amazing programs that successfully transition people out of homelessness but are excluded from many federal funds because they require sobriety counseling or career development training as a condition of participation many of these are faith-based organizations but many are not the franklin county women and family shelter in frankfort kentucky for example helps many low-income women often with a history of substance abuse and their families get off the street janet gates my constituent the shelter's director operates on a tight budget but has an impressive track record of success because of the effectiveness of her program in mission the facility requires its residents to remain sober as a condition of of their residency and they are expected to help out with chores around the facility i've spoken to the women in this shelter who have told me the sobriety requirements help them because being near drugs or alcohol will compromise their own hard work to get clean these preconditions however disqualify the franklin county women and family shelter for many federal funds under this misguided housing first policy in fact they've had to turn down grants equal to more than half their annual budget because the housing first conditions would necessitate an abrupt change in their mission to help homeless women in becoming self-sufficient and able to move beyond homelessness toward permanent housing there are many other examples here but what i would say is this for those of you on this committee who believe in housing first this doesn't change uh the eligibility for most of the funds to go to housing first programs it just says that uh that one-fifth of the money 20 or up to a billion dollars be eligible for many of the organizations in my district and in yours who do it differently who who provide additional wrap-around services not just putting a roof over a head but also giving them meaningful help in tackling the underlying cause of their homelessness with that i urge support

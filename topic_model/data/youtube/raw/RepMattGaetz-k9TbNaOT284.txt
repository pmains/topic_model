we bring in Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida I've been booked for another reason on the program tonight you've seen all this video congressman your thoughts I was criminal justice chairman in the Florida Legislature when Trayvon Martin was shot and so we're familiar in Florida with a dynamic that can animate people in protest certainly the calls from Lawrence Jones to ensure that protest is peaceful is important but I think what people are upset about is the lack of speed at the local level and that's why it's so important that President Trump has been responsive President Trump understands the need for fairness in this case and justice it's why he's involved the Department of Justice to ensure that if civil liberties were deprived and certainly in this case there seems to be strong initial evidence that that was the case that we elevate this to a national concern and hopefully that will give us comfort like you said that the folks in law enforcement are in fact here to protect us but just like there are good and bad TV hosts and good and bad congressmen we've also got folks in law enforcement that sometimes fall short of the high standard that the rest of that profession sets and when people fail to meet that standard we need swift justice and that seems to be precisely what the president's focused on and you know one of the things Matt we have followed so closely is the 1% that abused power in the FBI that don't represent the premiere law enforcement agency in the entire world that's why I've been saying director ray clean up your agency

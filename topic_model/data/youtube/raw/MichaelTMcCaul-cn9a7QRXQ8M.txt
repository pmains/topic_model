I want to update what's going on with the group that you know some call Isis we here I soul Islamic state but whoever this group however you name them however you call them who are they well that's a question I get a wide as I came back home where did they come from how did this come about we've been focused on Isis for over the last year they have festered have become a growing threat not only to the stability of the region in Iraq and Syria but also to the United States and the homeland but what's the genesis of Isis I think is a question because they were part of al Qaeda but no longer right so there was Al Qaeda in Iraq during our presence in Iraq during the Iraq war as r-ky way you may have heard about him and he has started this al Qaeda presence in Iraq very extreme tactics which we saw core al-qaida and Zawahiri denounce which they have done today as well I mean imagine that that an al-qaeda affiliate that's so extreme you have zawa hearing in corral qaeda denouncing them but that was really the genesis of vices today we were able to defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq through the awakening program that we had to reach out to Sunni tribal leaders to disassociate themselves from al Qaeda but since that time what has happened in my judgment was a failure to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement to leave a residual force on the ground in Iraq to provide that stability and at the same time Prime Minister Maliki's inability to provide political reconciliation with the Sunni tribes so the Sunni tribes now have sided with Isis over Maliki because it's only way they can defeat Maliki we need to reverse that course and I think what happened in the awakening is is I think illustrative in terms of how we can tackle this thing head-on in terms of political reconciliation they do have a new prime minister now in Iraq by do you think these airstrikes are very important to not only stabilize Iraq and Syria but also to take on when I perceive to be the greatest threat to the homeland since nine eleven let's talk about the strikes and then we'll talk about what that threat might be it sounds like there the president is considering additional strikes into Syria where to Syria fit into this and where does Congress fit into these potential strikes no good question Syria is really where the command and control of Isis exists I think Dempsey the Chairman Joint Chiefs was right and saying you can't really defeat Isis unless you go into Syria now that that causes more controversy I'm not in favor of boots on the ground we have Kurdish forces Iraqi military that can provide that boots on the ground what we need are the advisers to guide the airstrikes and I believe that this is an opportunity now to not only contain Isis and right but to defeat them in Iraq and Syria we're not going to be able to fully defeat them unless we do expand the airstrikes into Syria we have the Free Syrian Army in Syria which we need to support to counter these groups like Al nusrah al Qaeda affiliate and Isis I would far greater that prefer to take them out there then over here in the United States it's a matter of time before these jihadists could come into the United States in fact we have one documented case of a man from Florida who returned to Florida then went back and was a suicide bomber that's the kind of profile that intelligence officials and homeland security officials are most concerned with because I'm like Afghanistan and Pakistan you have a safe haven now larger than Afghanistan and Pakistan larger than what bin Laden had where they have Western passports they have free rein to western europe and travel back to the united states there one plane ride away from hitting us here and i think that is the great concern we have what we're trying to to stop in terms of ease of travel identifying these individuals and stop them before they can come into the United States and attack the homeland do you think if obviously this strikes into Syria or on the table for the President does that need to go through Congress I do I think you know the authorization of use of military force was in nineteen or 2001 it's outdated I think we need to update that I think it would be good for Congress the administration has been in consultation with the Congress under the War Powers Act when that expires i believe the administration would be important for them to go back for additional authorities and update what's called the AUMF to give that authority to the President Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution and I think it's time for the Congress to exercise that authority meantime another story that people follow course border security and and I'll kind of segue from this conversation into that we are hearing a lot of Republicans including here in our state including governor perry saying that we have a porous border and that you know extremists can utilize that coming through Mexico into the u.s. is that legitimate I mean do we have evidence that that is occurring or how big of a issue that might be I mean it is a concern and this is why it's a concern to me we do pick up what they call special interest aliens from countries that have terrorist ties at the border that concerns me I met with general Kelly who's the head of Southern Command which is you know basically our US military for basically Mexico the Mexican border all the way through Latin America in his point of view was if 60,000 children can freely cross the Rio Grande Valley sector then who else is going to be crossing to get into the United States there are threats out there and I think Isis after the beheading of the journalists really opened the eyes to the American people as to what the threat is we're facing now imagine they have legal travel documents but the ease of travel across the Mexican border obviously presents a concern to homeland security officials so even though for example the plane trips that were taken by like this example from Florida that's one potential area but you think that another potential at least in theory would be crossing the border from Mexico that's another another entry route into the United States you know in the bin Laden compound we did find documents where he was interested in obtaining access to the United States through our southwest border so I take that very seriously my job is to look forward as to what the threats could be and how to stop them from getting inside the United States almost out of time but I do want to get your thoughts about when you return to Washington after the recess the house did approve border security plan regarding what's going on in South Texas does it does it look like that has a chance anywhere beyond the house um you know it's unfortunate that we passed a bill responsibly to deal with the crisis and we lead and then the Senate the very day before we passed it left town to go on vacation I think that's irresponsible I do think we're going to have to address this issue when we get back into town in September in the meantime we have to reprogram is how they call it money's within the department of homeland security to make sure that Customs and Border Patrol and ice and other defenses on along the border are fully funded that's the number one priority for me and we're going to make sure they have that money but we need to pass some legislation we need to you know we did in our bill as we funded the National Guard presence on the border which the governor's already deployed and we don't think it's appropriate for the state of Texas to have to bear that burden when after all Paul it's a federal responsibility

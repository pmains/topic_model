republican congressman michael mccall from austin the chairman of the homeland security committee is with us good to see you again thanks paul thanks for having me we're here on the anniversary of the boston marathon bombing it appears that everything went fine with this year's event but take us back to this past year in terms of intelligence gathering and and from your uh assessment of it how it went well you know my committee held hearings over the last year conducted an investigation as to what happened not as a gotcha exercise but find out what went wrong and what can we do better to protect americans in the future fortunately this marathon i think has gone forward without any incident that's safe successful but you know a year ago 260 people were maimed and injured three were killed including an eight-year-old boy and an mit police officer as well um and what we found was that the you know look this guy was under the radar the the fbi under investigation uh kesten's flags went up on him when he traveled overseas to the very extreme part of the world in dagestan the chechen region um and yet nothing was done about that and so we had some concerns about what took place during the investigation what could have we could have done better i think to have identified a radicalization taking place in the united states but also when he traveled overseas when the russians warned us he would do that to join extremists and come back when that was flagged but nothing was done about that that raised serious questions about how the united states government is cooperating with state and locals or not in this case with boston police and then what do you do with that information he was on four different watch lists and yet nothing was done i think he had they taken a second look at him when they came he came back uh from this extreme area part of the world uh they'd taken a second look just maybe they could have could have stopped so maybe communication among agencies and uh others involved that's still a work in progress to be able to get that done and what we found was that it was this long after 9 11 and not connecting dots but also a failure to share information not only with state and locals but the fbi agent supervisor said had i known he traveled over there as russians warned that would have changed everything in his words and so unfortunately it didn't happen in this case we made recommendations that i'm glad to see the fbi and homeland security are now implementing in terms of information sharing that i think will better protect americans you know back here in texas of course earlier this month we had this second fort hood shooting and i know that you started to talk about maybe some of the procedures that are in place and of course we don't know a motive officially yet as to why this took place but mental health became an issue and you pointed out that there is no mental health evaluation for those who are enlisting do you see a change based on maybe what we learned from this shooting as to what the procedures ought to be well one thing i was surprised to hear i think most americans is that we give a rigorous physical straining screening but not a mental health screening and it seems to me that makes sense and i have co-sponsored a bill with several other members of congress to have initial mental health screening performed when when people enlist in the military for two reasons one that can screen out people that prior illnesses prior suicide attempts from entering the military but also create a baseline so when they do come back from theater of war you can compare that to where they were before they left and before they went to war i think that would have been very helpful with all these veterans returning as they did in iraq and now in afghanistan to to basically compare where they are in a mental health position because this is an issue that we we need to deal with and we owe it to our veterans who are many of whom are suffering from ptsd to take care of them you also mentioned in the immediate aftermath of this shooting that you felt perhaps it would be a good idea to allow soldiers to be able to carry weapons on post do you still feel that way well i think we should be having a discussion about it i think the real answer would be putting more military police on the bases particularly fort hood that we know as a target has been in the past but if we don't have the funds to do that we're in tough budgetary times and president's budget goes back to world war ii levels then why not have a force multiplier where you have senior military leadership give them the ability to carry weapons it seems to me if we can trust them overseas in afghanistan and iraq that when they come home particularly the senior military leadership to carry that could better protect base we've seen too many tragic episodes lately something that's just occurred here is a drone strike dealing with al qaeda and uh have you been briefed on this particular drone strike and what could you share with us as far as the significance of it well you know i can only comment on the reporting and that is that approximately 30 extreme militants have been killed by drone strikes over there why is this part of the world even relevant to people in austin the al-qaeda and the arabian peninsula are probably the most lethal and external threat to the homeland to the united states they're the ones developing the bombs to put on airplanes that can go undetected the the leader of aqap is the number two in the line of command under zawahiri in al-qaeda and they have the top bomb maker in the world for the jihadists so as we look at who they're taking out that if we can take that threat out over in yemen that helps prevent that threat from coming to either western europe or most significantly to the united states if we were able to kill the bomb maker which we don't know right now that would be hugely significant to eliminate that expertise and threat that i see and get briefed on quite frequently that threat that i see to the homeland i think we can squeeze in one more topic with you and that regards regarding maybe the administration's approach to russia dealing with ukraine and uh maybe uh the association of bill that you've introduced that could go hand in hand with the situation well i had some unique experience to travel to russia to look at security for the olympics and um i must tell you it's a police state they're the nationalistic pride uh resurgence of that uh you're seeing a a eagerness to return to the glory days of the empire so i think that what mr putin is trying to do is expand uh the lines into more the baltic areas and into ukraine to take back areas where he has russian-speaking people and this is not by by happenstance this is by a very clever design on his part and so far he's winning um i think that weakness invites aggression and i do think that mr putin knows that he can advance without being stopped and i think until he knows that that we will some will stand up to him uh he's gonna take advantage of that situation which is what i think he's doing today with respect to the bill one of the the strangleholds that russia and mr putin has on ukraine and the baltic states is their reliance on energy from russia and that's that's the way he controls them and can strangle them that's what he's done with ukraine we in the congress believe we should be exporting more lng liquefied natural gas and crude oil to the ukraine region to help them against russia so i introduced a bill that got referred to foreign affairs on which i serve to advance that piece of legislation that i think not only will help texans as we produce more energy in the eagleford shale but also exporting that to an area of the world that could be more dependent on on us rather than the russians and i think at the end of the day it creates a better foreign policy and a national security policy for the united states okay unfortunately out of time but congressman call as always we appreciate you being on the show thanks for having me you bet appreciate it

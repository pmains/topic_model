I thank the speaker we just heard a few moments ago a colleague of mine of ours I should say congressman Charlie dead to has served with great distinction and honor a classmate of mine and I simply want to say that he is a role model for all of us in terms of how to to legislate and a thoughtful and deliberative fashion and to reach across the aisle in a way that I think is conducive to getting things done and he certainly is a great example of of how we should all reflect in terms of our work here every day we will miss him we wish him the best of luck in his next endeavors mr. Speaker I also want to talk about the challenges that we face in California as it relates to our water needs the San Joaquin Valley that I have the honor and privilege to represent is one of the largest agricultural regions in the entire country and therefore the world we grow half the nation's fruits and vegetables we 70% of the world's almonds 50% of the world's pistachios the number one dairy state in the nation and the number one citrus state in the nation and the list goes on and on and on over 300 commodities that we have the ability to grow because of an incredible Mediterranean climate and water which is the credit the crucible because we like to say in the valley that where water flows food grows and clearly the ability to have water reliability is so essential to ensuring that we can continue to maintain our agricultural production which every night puts food on America's dinner table and therefore allows American consumers to have the healthiest the best nutritious quality of varieties of food and food products at the most economical cost to them and their families anywhere in the world and we're so good at it in producing food not only in California but around the world around the country American agriculture that I think sometimes Americans take it for granted because less than 3% of our nation's population as in California less than 3% of our state's population is directly involved in the production of food and fiber and so I sometimes feel that the majority of Americans believe that their food comes from a grocery store well it doesn't I mean you get it at the grocery store or you get it at your favorite restaurants wherever that may be but before that food gets to the grocery store or before it gets to those restaurants it comes from farmers and ranchers and dairy men and women across this great land of ours and certainly California plays a key role we've had difficult difficult drought periods in California we had a six-year prolonged drought that reminded us that the climate continues to change and what impacts we as people have on the change of that climate is debated but clearly we know that we have an impact and it continues to change and therefore to be responsible we have to plan to ensure that we have adequate water supplies to maintain our agricultural production for it is the sustenance of life water or water flows food grows it is so important obviously throughout the country but critical in maintaining our incredible cornucopia of agricultural production in California for you should understand that 99% of our agriculture in California is irrigated and so I have for over thirty years worked to strengthen the water reliability not only in the San Joaquin Valley but throughout California because in a Calot in a state like California where we have so many resources and so many cutting edge technologies in terms of efficient irrigation methodologies drip irrigation conserving and conserving and trying to figure out ways in which we can recharge our aquifers we're using all the water tools in the water tool box when I was in the California Legislature my out there legislation to create the Kern County water bank led to successful water bond measures that provided funding to provide more than two billion dollars to improve California's water system provide for safe and reliable water drinking we have places in California and other parts of the country where our groundwater has gotten contaminated and therefore we need to make adjustments to ensure that every American every Californian has clean drinking water in Congress I've secured approval for the Madera irrigation district water bank the San Luis inner ty the North Valley Regional recycled water project bringing hundreds and thousands of acre feet to secure more water a more reliable supply of water for our San Joaquin Valley but also for other parts of California as well for if we cannot solve the water problems in California I really am very concerned about the future of our nation and our planet for again we don't think about it but food is a national security issue it truly is we take it for granted but we only we not only have the ability throughout the country and in California to produce enough food for every American but we produce more than we can consume and therefore we export many of our food products throughout the world but a in with the impacts of climate change oceans rising the planet that two years ago clicks seven billion people by the middle of the century will have nine billion people and guess what happens when you add two billion more people to the planet you got to feed them and therefore food not only for America but for the world is a national security issue but you can't have that abundant supply of food that reliable supply of food unless you have a reliable supply of water let me give you some perspective 200 years ago we had 1.7 billion people on the planet so in two hundred years we've gone from one point seven to seven billion and by the middle of the century it's estimated there will be nine billion people on the planet that yes will need food and only if we have reliable water supplies can we ensure that we have that reliable supply of food and if we can't figure out ways in which to manage our water resources in California the fifth largest economy now in the world ace edge a cutting edge state and technology if we can't solve our water problems in California I'm truly concerned about other parts of the world that depend upon a reliable water supplies to feed their population so throughout the years that I've been both here and in Sacramento I've worked on a bipartisan basis to pass water infrastructure improvements for our nation the Lin Act that we passed some two years ago was signed into law in December of 2016 it was a part of an overall effort to provide solutions using all the water tools in our water toolbox that will make it more flexible to move water through California's system of waterways the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta system in which we can have the flexibility but still try to deal with the environmental concerns and maintain water quality for our cities but also provide water for our farmers in addition to that provided the state over three hundred and five five million dollars for water infrastructure projects including matching federal funds for new surface storage in California for the temperance flat project for raising San Luis reservoir for expand for creating the site's reservoir and for other important funding purposes in which a federal authorization will allow us to match both state and local dollars and all of my time in working to improve the lives that the people of the valley that I have the honor and privilege to represent rarely have I presented with a project that has such obvious potential as the new exchequer dam that was built a number of years ago the water that is currently impounded actually it's a dam that was built in the 20s and then expanded in the late 50s provides irrigation for an incredible amount of productive AG land in Merced County it also allows for groundwater replenishment in many of the nearby communities and it also provides environmental benefits for fisheries wildlife wildlife refuges downstream from the dam recently the Merced Irrigation District performed a detailed analysis of the hydrology of the watershed upstream from exchequer dam which is the mountains that California has been blessed with the incredible Sierra Nevada mountain range over 600 miles in length 150 miles of with mountains that go to 12 to 14 thousand feet that provides the snowpack for California its mother nature's icebox for California for those of you who are not from California should understand we get all of our moisture in California from November to March and above four or five thousand feet that rain turns to snow and then in the springtime it melts and it comes down and it fills our rivers and the reservoirs that we have on our rivers and it allows us to have a supply of water throughout the summer we don't have any rain in the summer recently this project as an example was determined by the district they married Merced Irrigation District that if we raised the spillway gates by 8 feet that Lake McClure behind this dam could add an additional fifty seven thousand acre feet of water fifty thousand seven fifty seven thousand acre feet of water is a as a good additional supply without impeding Merced's Wild and Scenic River designation so we maintain that but at the same time we add fifty seven thousand acre feet of water to the supply that's important however to move forward with raising these spillway gates the flood control and operations manual for exchequer dam must be updated and that's the responsibility of the Army Corps of Engineers you should understand that many of these water projects in California and other states across the country have multiple purposes they're not only supply water for people they not only try to benefit the environment but they also provide water for farmers and at the same time many of these projects provide hydroelectric power and they provide flood control protection so in this case when you increase the spillway gates eight feet the Army Corps of Engineers has to modify the flood control manual so that when we have heavy storms and rains as we did a year ago in California we're able to operate the facility in such a way that also provides flood control protection unfortunately the current manual that is in place was from 1959 when the dam was expanded the second time the Army Corps of Engineers policy requires that flood control manuals be updated therefore then to reflect the new data in the changes of the project that would occur as a result of raising these gates in 2017 the Merced Irrigation District wrote the Army Corps of Engineers requesting a revision of the flood control manual and that's what this legislation that we are introducing will work on the Army Corps indicated they could not update the manual at the time citing budgetary constraints Merced Irrigation District proposed to pay for the public process to update the flood control manual to incorporate this new hydrological data data if in fact the gates were raised the Army Corps responded by saying it didn't have the legal authority to accept funds for the purpose of a non-federal section 7 project like this new exchequer dam despite being able to do so for other Army Corps facilities thus the non-federal reservoir operations Improvement Act legislation that I've introduced would resolve this disparity by allowing the owners of a non-federal reservoir in this case the Merced Irrigation District that are regulated by the Army Corps to provide protection for flood control to contribute the funds so that we can update the manual so that we can in fact raise the gates eight feet which the Merced Irrigation District is going to pay for along with their water users that's all they pay for it and as long as well as paying the Army Corps of Engineers to update the flood control manual now this sounds like a lot of common sense doesn't it I think so and so that's the purpose of this legislation it's part of a long effort that I've been engaged in to improve the water supply the water reliability the water quality the environmental benefits for the challenges that we face in California as it relates to maintaining the water needs for a state that has 40 million people the fifth largest economy in the country the number one agricultural state in the nation and so we know that with the growing demands the competing demands on water that Crucible that critical absolute must resource to ensure that we can survive as people so that we can where water flows food will grow that we can maintain the ability as a national security issue to ensure that all Americans all Americans have the kind of sustainable good quality nutritious food that is so critical to our diet and to our well-being so that's really what this is all about this is a local project but it's a part of much larger effort that I have been engaged in with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to address the needs the long-term needs of California's water supply and that's what's at heart here so we'll continue to work together I hope that this legislation will be enacted this year so that the Merced Irrigation District can be able to go ahead and plan and construct the increase of water supply for the needs of the people of Merced County and the surrounding area that will have a multitude a multitude of benefits this is a part of an overall effort that I will continue to be engaged in in Merced County and Madera County and in Fresno County throughout our Valley and throughout our state to ensure that in the long term in the 21st century we can count on the fact that we have a long-term water supply for all Californians that will allow us to continue to maintain our agriculture economy and at the same time provide water for people who live in the cities improve our water quality and to ensure at the same time that we protect the environment those are the goals it's complicated it's complex and it's never easy Mark Twain supposedly was credited with over 100 years ago saying having spent some time in the West that it was clear to him that when we talk about water and water resources and the incredible demands on those water resources a hundred years ago supposedly Mark Twain said that in the West it was clear to him that whiskey was made for drinking and water was made for fighting we hope that we won't fight over our water resources but that we'll work together on a bipartisan basis to solve these problems that's what we are sent here to do to work together on a bipartisan basis to solve a whole host of issues that we deal with but it's very important that we focus in this instance on this legislation with passing a bill that takes a great deal of common sense I yield back the balance of my time

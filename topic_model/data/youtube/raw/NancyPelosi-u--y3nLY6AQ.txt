thank you very much mr. speaker almost good afternoon my colleagues today we have a very important decision to make in this Congress I joined with the speaker and acknowledging the hard work that so many have put in on this important subject I want to thank the President of the United States and his administration for being available with their cabinet officers and the rest to explain to us how they see what is in the trade the TPA the fast track when we call it fast track so we get separate this out and what two prospects are for the trans-pacific partnership I want to thank our friends and labor environmental groups faith-based groups who have expressed their opposition to so much of what has been presented all of which will be constructive as we try to move forward with a better trade promotion act fast track not so fast fast track we all understand that we live in a global economy some of us as I do represent cities that are built on trade at city of San Francisco and I grew up in a city where the famous clipper ships brought product to and from our shores in baltimore maryland it's a great it's an exciting prospect for expanding markets for our products and having us global leadership I was hopeful from the start of all of this discussion that we could find a path to yes for the fast-track legislation that was being put forth some bumps in the road along the way some potholes along the way unfortunately I think sinkholes as well but that doesn't mean that that road cannot be repaired I just believe that it must be lengthen each week each of us goes home to our districts and in the case of many of us we put our hand on a very hot stove we hear the concerns of so many families who are having financial instability and uncertainty some of its still springing from Tucson 2008 2008 where they were threatened with the loss of their homes their jobs their pensions have you live on their savings inability to send their kids to college all of it undermining the American dream as the economy has improved and the leadership of President Obama still middle-class economics have not fully turned around the country because the consumer confidence that people must have in order to invest to spend to inject demand into the economy is simply not there so my concern about all of this it's about time it's about time why are we fast tracking trade and slow walking the highway bill it's about time that people have not recovered from again oh aight sufficiently to again have consumer confidence to turn around our consumer economy and so i think that today we have an opportunity to slow down we all know we have to have want to engage and trade promotion and the rest of that what we have to slow down this replica is not whatever the deal is with other countries we want a better deal for America's workers another element of time that I'm concerned about is the time that is running out for us to do a rain in the consequences of climate change I want to just talk about myself for a moment and are bragging i told myself second to none in this body on the subject of protecting the environment and recognizing that your challenges of climate crisis when i first came to the Congress when president george herbert walker Bush was president he signed my legislation which is now called the Pelosi amendment to the International Development and finance act of 8 1989 and that said that said that any of our directors on any of our multilateral Development Bank's had to have an environmental assessment made and made known to the indigenous people who are affected by whatever development was there and made known to the world the connection between the environment and commerce is inseparable and for over 25 years the Pelosi amendment has been in effect when I became speaker my flagship issue was energy independence and climate so I speak from some authority on the subject the son of George Herbert Walker Bush president george w bush signed the energy bill of 2007 we work together to find alternatives to fossil fuels he wanted nuclear I wanted renewables we have one of the very successful energy bill of 2007 done under the auspices of the Select Committee on climate and energy independence that I established a speaker which has been abolished since then Pope Francis in another week will be announcing his his initiative on climate and while this is all going on while schoolchildren know that this is a challenge that we must say to protect our planet well people of faith join us and say this is God's creation and we have a moral responsibility to because the stewards of it in this bill today the customs bill that's on the floor right now that it prohibits the USTR from negotiating on climate change how could it be 25 years ago close the amendment was passed and we because we saw melting snow in the regions where the snow is melting areas as big as United Kingdom burning in the Amazon 25 years later and we're putting in the build you str cannot negotiate on climate change you cannot separate commerce an environment and while I salute the president he has been magnificent and courageous going out there and making the fight for America's leadership on climate change he has been great he has an agreement with China which is almost could not have been foreseen except for his leadership and the cooperation between our two countries so it's not that he isn't doing his part it's that Congress again it's about time slowing down our responses when we should be proactive and yet fast-tracking fast-tracking a legislation to do that and what's interesting is we in the house or we are we labeling us ourselves the lower body and giving new meaning to that term where the Senate could have opportunity for amendment after amendment if they're if their colleagues gave them the votes but in this house fast track the fast track no chance to amend any of it just voted up or down I find that unnecessary unacceptable and one place we could go to have a discussion on how to improve the fast-track legislation but at the same time the Republican majority is allowing in the customs bill amendments to the fast-track ville this amendment on climate other amendments on immigration other amendments and they were spelled out by mr. sessions earlier with great pride amendments to fast-track in the customs bill but no amendments for Democrats so that again I I don't see how this Congress can ignore that I don't see how this trade agreement can ignore it much has been said about securities issues that are involved now in this agreement that we have to make a geopolitical case for for this trade agreement I've course we always have safety of the American people as our first responsibility their security is what we come here to protect but how could it be that we are allowing again let me say it another way as I've been very prayerful about this Pope Paul the sixth another Pope mentioned Francis earlier I didn't by name but Pope all the six said if you want peace work for justice economic justice and I don't see that happening in this fast track bill lifting people up in the rest of the world or if they or having trade agreements that do not increase the Paycheck of America's workers that should be our first order of business environmental justice looking at these prohibitions on dealing with a climate in 11 other countries in the world and then our own now again I commend the president because in the end the fast-track bill there are some good provisions on the environment issues I'm talking about an ethic an ethic a responsibility a comprehensive view of the future and again the but the plaza amendment addressed to the indigenous people all of these people who will be not of the first shall we say priority for many of these countries as they make their economic decisions and on the subject of security last year 16 former three and four-star generals and admirals who serve on the corp corporate CNN cna corporations military advisory board released a report 16 former three and four-star generals said that climate change is a catalyst for conflict climate change they said will have an impact on military readiness strain base resilience both at home and abroad and may limit our ability to respond to future demands we've rejected fast track before after NAFTA President Clinton sent a fast-track bill to the Congress and it didn't even have enough votes to be taken up the second time it was rejected when we had majority in the house we did not have passed track for President Bush so when people say this is the first time a president never had isn't so we instead under leadership of mr. Levin mr. Rangel instead we had the may 10 agreement with the basic principles of how we should engage other countries that is part of and thank you mr. president that is part of what the TPA has as its goals but we were dealing multi bilaterally one country at a time this is a multilateral agreement with 11 other countries 12 countries and growing and we need we need to slow this fast track down I think it is possible now one of the questions that arises is the question of the Trade Adjustment Act most of us have not only voted for this bunch been champions of it over time I was one of the first issues I dealt with when I came to the Congress speaking about myself again it's really important but as some of my colleagues have said our people would rather have a job than trade assistance Trade Adjustment Assistance I talked about that red-hot stove that people put their hand on when they go home mr. Cicilline talked about his district mr. Norcross about his mr Boyle about his and the list goes on and on how do we say to these people we are here for you you are our top priority when the impression that they have is that this is not a good deal for them but it can be I'm hopeful that it can be and so while I'm a big supporter of taa if taa slows down the fast track I am prepared to vote against taa because then its defeat sad to say is the only way that we will be able to slow down the fast track now I understand there will be some manipulations here one way or another what bill comes first what can come up what can't but the fact is this the facts are these actually that the the if TAA fails the fast-track bill is stopped they way take up the vote as they said they would not but they've changed they may take up the vote but it doesn't go any place it's stuck in the station and for that reason sadly because the Senate has sent us the bill that way connected sadly because if the PTA the fast-track passes will need PTA will need ta a trade adjustment assistance sadly I would vote against the taa and I just want you to know where I was coming from on that for these and other reasons I will be voting today to slow down the fast track to get a better deal for the American people bigger check be bigger paychecks better infrastructure help the American people fulfill the American dream I thank mr. Levin again for his leadership and I thank all of our colleagues have worked so hard on this really on both sides of the issue and I yield back the balance of my time

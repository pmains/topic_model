Thank You mr. Chairman I think it's been an excellent hearing very good witnesses and let me start by saying I think the principal question for our panel and for our challenge in the days ahead is how our country is going to respond to what has been described as some experts as China's green mercantilism and there is a new paper out this morning mr. Chairman I would just ask unanimous consent to put it into the record they in the paper define green mercantilism as essentially policies that give other countries an unfair advantage in terms of our interests allow them to boost their exports limit imports of clean energy technologies and mr. wolf for me you really summed it up when you said in your testimony you asked essentially is it acceptable for chinese industrial policy to shape the US economy and i think that that sort of incorporates the essence of this issue with respect to green mercantilism and it also goes beyond the trade issue which i think is important for us I also chair the finance subcommittee on international trade I'm interested in expanding trade I don't think trade free trade means trade free from rules and what is appealing to me about the way you asked it it gives us a chance to shape the challenge both in terms of trade and other kinds of issues so why don't we start with the other four witnesses responding to mr. Wolfe's question his question was is it acceptable for China's industrial policy to shape the US economy give me your response to his question and if you think it is unacceptable for China to be shaping our policy what do you think we ought to do in a proactive way to combat it start with you mr. woo thank you for the question um no I don't think it's it's acceptable I think that the point that also senator Murkowski brought up earlier is whether or not we should you know emulate China I think the question that the answer to that is also know the fact the matter is you know the economies of the United States and China are different and and the reality is also that China has a vast amount of energy demand that's still growing and they have a very high reliance on coal at the moment and that's a very different situation to what we have here in the United States and I think I agree what dr. scissors mentioned earlier about sort of the gas the question about gas which is yeah I think China is looking a little bit with envy over to the United States regarding the the our ability to exploit shale gas which you know China does have vast reserves of but so currently lacks the technology to to exploit it on the level that we have done here in the United States so I think the answer is no I mean I think we have to take very different a very different look at the way the economies of the United States and China are and finally I would just like to add that you know with with regards to metrics yes I think China has done very well in what it's done very well which is manufacturing trying to makes a lot of things not just clean energy goods so it has exploited its advantage which is to manufacture a solar PV and also wind turbines on a very large scale and has done so in a very cost-effective manner which we can argue whether it's good or bad for who and for whom but also one fact one perhaps benefit of that is that it's been able to reduce the cost of renewable energy significantly at least four for China for a semester consumption mr. president i know that you don't think it's acceptable for china's industrial policy to shape the US economy what do you think our country should do in a proactive way to combat it well it's like you know circle and we have to use our heads I don't think that it's acceptable for China to shape our economy but at the same time I don't think that we need willy nilly to imitate everything that China does I mean everybody Eric it's not everything China does is not necessarily right so I think what's required is for us to spend some time thinking hard about what is it that's really important to us and then take the measures that are necessary to counter the negative impact on us achieving our goals of some of these mercantilist policies so you know for example we know that an element and aspect of the mercantilist policies tends to be excess investment in the promoting country followed by dumping typically in the u.s. we wait for an affected company or entity to file an anti-dumping complaint before we do anything about dumping we don't have to the Secretary of Commerce has the authority to self initiate anti-dumping cases so one thing that I've advocated is let's monitor industries where other countries have active proactive industrial policies look at the extent of their over investment and and their anti doubt they're dumping activity and self initiate cases take them to the WTO write them up way to wait preempted that's one one element typically such countries have currency manipulation policies typically they they're not just China Singapore Taiwan Korea they intervene in currency markets every day to keep their currencies undervalue take measures to counter that impose capital controls if necessary Tim Geithner can do it doesn't even have to ask the Congress for from for permission set up consortium Allah SEMATECH or PV tech or whatever it is I think that a big factor in the United States is investment taxes I think that very often the inside for investment in the United States are not nearly as attractive as they are for investment abroad Singapore is the world champion at attracting foreign investment we could do learn well to copy a lot of what singapore does and so it's a matter of you know what's important to us all right then what's our strategy and a combination of carrots and sticks to get what's important for us the one one point and just to emphasize what Alan said is this typically you know I know Alan and I have been involved in this some of these discussions for a long time typically you get into these debates in in the administration whoever's administration and the argument is we don't pick winners and losers you know we should be intervening to subsidize or provide corporate benefits and what's lost in that discussion is that I in a situation in which you're facing an active industrial policy abroad a decision not to intervene is a decision and you know decision not to pick winners and losers as a decision to pick a loser you're not going to be in that industry I that I think doesn't get understood typically I know my time is up if we could just mr. Holliday and dr. scissors again responding to question doctor mr. Wolfe said no sir I don't think it should dictate our international policy but we do need to be focused we need to have vision we need to understand where our country's going and where the global technologies and market are going so that we can be strong and successful and to build on the not picking winners and losers the consortium model it's perfect for that you pick the technologies you have a collaborative model where you don't just spread the dollars around you better leverage our universities and our national labs to really impact the industry and it's critical that we do that dr. scissors I have one objection to the green mercantilism designation the word green is unnecessary they're mercantilist and they're big which means we cannot avoid chinese industrial policy affecting us economy we don't like it but it's it's it's true to me the best response is to get them to do less of it we're not going to get them to stop and that should include threatening them there are things China doesn't want to give up and we need to push them to try to get their industrial policy to back off in certain areas in where where that isn't going to work sometimes their subsidies help us they make things cheaper here for American consumers sometimes they hurt in ways we can't respond to so I think my colleagues on the panel have all said a variation of the same thing we need to identify not everywhere they affect us no avoiding it but where we don't like them affecting us and where we can respond properly and that's a subset so we need to focus down and say all right here's the big big group of things where can we do something that's useful that really matters Thank You mr. chairman

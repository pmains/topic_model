well since March the 15th we have lost three really important provisions that we've used for over a decade now to fight terrorism and espionage the provisions that aren't at stake are provisions that really created some problems for Carter page and others the FBI inappropriate use of the FISA warrant generally will not be impacted in any way by any vote we take this week that's on a different time schedule it clearly needs to be dealt with actually I'd hoped when we offered the house the extension of current FISA laws for 90 days so that we could include that discussion of what the FBI had done wrong with Carter page what they may have done wrong with Michael Flynn but the three provisions that we would like to extend this week were provisions that like the lone wolf which Zacarias Moussaoui was we were able to prosecute him through that provision in 2011 the roving wiretap where people take burner phones you've got the ability to listen to what they're saying but you don't have the ability to know what phone they might be using or maybe most importantly the business records provision which was used dozens of times last year in in espionage cases and in terrorism cases is not available to us right now it's available in all business activity cases it's available in all IRS cases it's just not available if you're going after a terrorist and that's a big mistake we have not had access to those kinds of records again for almost two months now we'll have a chance I think this week we'll have a vote that will give us a chance to extend those provisions while senator Graham and his committee and appropriate committees look at the overall FISA use and how can be guaranteed to be even more protective of the American people and individuals that would be the subject of those FISA warrants but right now we don't have tools that we've used effectively and repeatedly since 9/11

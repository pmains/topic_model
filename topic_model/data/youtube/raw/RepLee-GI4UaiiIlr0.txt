barbara Lee joins us now and congresswoman I thank you for your time thank you much you've been very critical of the the effectiveness of the war against Isis you as many remember were the person who filed that lone dissenting vote in the 2001 optimization of the use of military force I want to kind of go through this check by check and when you are critical of the u.s. is attempt to tant downtick to eliminate Isis is it a lack of resources or this is it an ineffective strategy from your perspective I believe that we need a more comprehensive strategy to really begin to degrade and dismantle ISIL one the military option is always there and we recognize that and of course our first job is to keep Americans and our country safe and having said that we have to look at how we can broaden the strategy to make sure the region is leading it to ensure that we do not allow for the insertion of American troops ground troops in this Civil War and in this terrible war that's taking place in the region but also how we can support a regional effort to look at a diplomatic and political settlement long-term because when you look at and you cited the 2001 resolution to use force that resolution unfortunately and the one that authorized the use of force the military war against Iraq those are still being used now in terms of the US mission in this new war and so minimally we need to have a debate in Congress which is what I am saying and many others is saying now and we need to put forth a new authorization with which would set forth what in fact the American people in Congress deems necessary to really begin to dismantle and discredit Isis the president sent over a draft resolution back in February of 2015 others have made proposals how far do you think Congress is from simply declaring war against Isis or do you think that that it will happen this session the president was rec'd when he sent over an authorization unfortunately the speaker just sat on it that resolution went nowhere many of us have written to former Speaker Boehner have communicated with our current speaker Ryan to say and this is bipartisan to say it's our constitutional responsibility to have a debate and to really allow the American people a voice in how to begin to really address this very terrible terrorist organization what is taking place in the Middle East now we see some movement members are beginning to talk about it the speaker is making public comments he's saying some public I think sending some signals publicly that he may be considering allowing a resolution an authorization to use force to come to the floor but I think it's very important that we continue to hear the voices and any and really listen to the voices of the American people and know that they want to have a safe and how we are addressing this very terrible terrorist organization and so I'm more hopeful today than I was last year but once again we have to make sure whatever authorization comes forward that it's an authorization that a specific that is not as broad as the one that I voted against that was a blank check in 2001 it's still being used unfortunately as the legal basis for this new war this is 14 15 years later it's been used over 30 sometimes and so hopefully what we're hearing now it means that at least by there's a bipartisan effort to begin to be real about this and to make sure that we do our job as members of Congress all right California congresswoman barbara Lee thank you for your time thank you much

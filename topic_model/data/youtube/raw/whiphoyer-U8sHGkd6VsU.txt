thank mr. you'll kneel for yielding the gentleman from Pennsylvania as he well knows is one of my favorite members he is a good friend he is a man of great integrity the mr. speaker both the House and Senate bills are bad bills and this is a sad day in the house hypocrisy is on stark display responsibility is absent and politics and donors have subverted policy this conference is a sham an attempt to make it appear that the House and Senate are going through regular order sadly we have not gone through regular order the thought is we will reconcile the two versions of the dangerous Republican tax increase and deficit bill I call this a debt tax because it will explode the deficit as happened in 1981 when under Ronald Reagan for 8 years we increased the debt of this country a hundred and eighty nine percent the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee mr. mentions mr. Obama who increased it eighty eight percent or less than half of the Reagan increase in the debt and we were promised then as we're promised now that cutting these taxes would grow the economy would that that were the case but there won't be any real regular order in this conference just as there hasn't been throughout this entire process there will only be further closed-door backroom antics by leaders on their own asking Republican members to take it or leave it and this motion to instruct of course will be defeated but Democrats are offering it because from the very beginning we have made clear that we are here to work toward the kind of tax reform that the American people want tax reform that I worked with in 1986 and they don't want an elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes which our motion would instruct the conferees not to do the deductions for state and local taxes support schools and first responders in our communities and the American people don't want to kick 13 million people off their health insurance coverage so our motion would instruct conferees take this dangerous provision out but no motion can address all the ways the Republican tax bills put our people and our future in danger the Senate bill raises taxes on somewhere around 78 million working Americans middle-class households now as a pejorative but as a income spectrum why to offset massive tax cuts for those not at whom with whom we're at war but who are doing very well and don't need our help it plunges our children and grandchildren of which I have a number an additional one point seven trillion dollars in debt and I think that's the minimum making them pay tomorrow for what Republicans refuse to pay for today and for what for what mr. speaker are we being yet to ask to do all these things for economic growth for jobs we know it won't grow our economy and any substantially way faster why because almost every economist tells us that and we know that the few jobs the Senate bill would create and listen to this that they claim that they'll create will cost 1.9 million dollars per job the vast majority of Americans won't benefit from this plan but those who are already extremely wealthy will benefit greatly as a matter of fact 52 times what the gentleman will tell us the other additional one minute I thought I was recognized for an additional minute mr. speaker there's a saying that Texans like to use this dog won't hunt it doesn't do what it's purported to do it doesn't take n Stein to predict what will happen this time around when he said doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result his insanity I've been here I've seen this I've heard this argument to result the same thing now I have more to say but my time is up and let me say to the gentleman protects us the chairman of the committee he's going to tell me how much people in my district get a tax break tell me about my children and my grandchildren whose debts you will pile on them to borrow money from China or someplace else to give this tax cut that they will then have to pay off in their time tell me how much my children will have their taxes raised mr. chairman and I yield to him apparently doesn't know that said I yield back the balance come in yields back

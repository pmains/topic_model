gentleman from California mr. speaker for the last decade Congress has passed bipartisan sanctions to get to the point where we are today and the purpose of these sanctions was to dismantle Iran's nuclear weapons program but this agreement does not achieve that goal in fact this agreement puts a run the world's largest state sponsor of terror on a glide path to nuclear bomb proponents say it's the only alternative to ward but I believe that is a false choice I recently met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and he agreed that our goal should be a good deal but that we cannot put our security risk for a bad deal and make no mistake this is a bad deal for America and for our allies and it will not stop Iran's nuclear program it will leave around with the ingredients for a bomb and infrastructure to build it and it will spark a nuclear arms race in the Middle East it will give Iran a cash windfall freeing up over 100 million dollars billion dollars Islamist terror and incredibly this agreement lists restrictions on Iran's ballistic missiles which the Ayatollah himself said that they will mass produce there is only one reason to develop an ICBM mr. speaker and that's to deliver a nuclear warhead across continents which means the United States a top Iranian general Bragg recently that his country will have quote a new ballistic missile test in the near future that will be a thorn in the eyes of our enemies President Reagan his famous negotiating advice was to trust but verify we can't trust a regime that has cheated on every deal and president rouhani says his country's centrifuges will never stop spinning and that they will quote by so on develop any weapons we need and will not ask for permission or by by any resolution and now the White House is counting on verification measures spelled out in secret side deals between Iran and the IAEA which secretary Kerry testified to me that even he has not seen and astoundingly the AP reports that the side deal allows Iran to self inspect its own nuclear sites now the American people through the representatives in Congress are expected to vote on this measure without seeing these secret deals which goes to the heart of verification this and my judgment is nothing short of reckless let's be clear eyed about what we are debating this was not a negotiation with an honest government it was a negotiation with terrorists who chant death to America and are responsible for more than a thousand American casualties in Iraq alone if we allow this deal to go forward we are putting the security of the world at grave risk and finally mr. speaker for the sake of our nation's security and in defense of the free world I cannot in good conscience support this agreement in I yield back antelman yells that recognizes the gentleman from New York mr. Engel Thank You mr. Speaker I now yield the three and a half minutes to a gentlewoman from Florida debbie Wasserman Schultz

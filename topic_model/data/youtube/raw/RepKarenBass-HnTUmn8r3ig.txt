thank you very much mr. chair and I want to thank all the witnesses that are here today dr. Abbas Alka I pronounced your name correctly either offer you my condolences along with everyone else and sadly know your pain I wanted to know if after the tragedy if in Europe an outspoken if you have received any threats or harassment experiences of people harassing you for speaking out as a Muslim I personally did not I did read an email last night that warned me of coming here and testified but after the tragedy there was a tweet that said 1/3 down 1.6 billion to go there was a lot of tweet I said great cakes should be given the Medal of Honor and and released from custody thank you I'm very sorry to hear that miss Patterson you mentioned that you had some specific recommendations for us in terms of regarding white supremacy and I wanted to know if you could give us a couple of examples of your recommendations moment we would like a national commission to be formed to study all forms of white supremacy we think there should be a joint law enforcement civilian task force to study white nationalism and to outline an organized counterinsurgency strategy we like we don't like the notion of the lone wolf narrative we think there's an organized white nationalist group around the world that is being connected we want to study the role I'm glad you all that brought Facebook and Google here to study the role social media has played in enabling this threat we need to develop a clearinghouse for data collection reporting and analysis on white nationalism we need to fortify the Fifteenth Amendment so that there's more voting on the part of disenfranchised groups because we think there should be humane immigration policy one thing I think we need to talk about is that right now there are Latino children in cages we think this is a definite manifestation of white supremacy and white men think thank you very much I think one of the first steps in addressing white supremacy though is really acknowledging the seriousness and the fact that it exists at all before before our last election we had four acts of domestic terrorism the week or two before and they were not called that from the man who had the bombs that fortunately didn't go off the individual that was in search of African Americans to kill in Kentucky he tried to enter church and he couldn't and so he killed two random black folks the horrible massacre at the synagogue and then the shooting several days later at a yoga studio where someone was looking for specifically women of color but in that we have the FBI that is very concerned about black identity extremists and I just wondered miss Clark if you could tell me of examples how many acts of domestic terrorism were carried out by African Americans in the last few years well it is our view that this black identity extremists designation is false this was something created by the FBI's domestic terrorism analysts analysts units to essentially target black activists today were focused on issues like promoting police accountability we don't see any evidence that blacks civil rights activists pose a threat to our democracy do you know of anyone I know that there was a case in Texas where there was a young man who was arrested and incarcerated for a while supposedly for being a black identity extremist do you know of any other cases like that I'm not not familiar with other cases but I will say that we have a pending Freedom of Information Act request that we sent to the FBI several months ago and just a few days ago we received mere acknowledgement of our request we think it's time for us to shine a light on what's happening at the FBI it's time for us to get more information about the scope of their activities who they're investigating but most importantly it's important that we find out why they're diverting resources away from the real threat that drives the purpose of this hearing today white supremacy and white nationalism thank you very much I just wanted to also acknowledge when there was a threat by the threats that were made President Trump was asked about whether he sees white nationalism as a rising threat around the world today he responded that he does not but that quote it's a small group of people that have very very serious problems and I believe the woman from the anti-defamation league when you talked about the incidences of white supremacist terrorists acts in the United States what would the percentage that has risen over the last ten years it was 54 percent over half last year it was 78 percent of extremist murders were by white supremacist it's unfortunate that the president considers that insignificant and it's also unfortunate that after all of these acts whether they've taken place in the United States or around the world and he cannot bring himself to have a full-throated denunciation of white supremacy thank you

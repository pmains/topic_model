i got to tell you i'm amused to read the stuff about no compromise if we didn't have if the people who founded this country didn't compromise we wouldn't have a country if you recall from your sixth grade history the constitution was all about the great compromise where they figured out how to handle representation from the big states in the small states and ironically the great compromise was the united states senate human beings never reach full consensus nobody ever gets everything they want it has to be about doing the best you can and we have to have the wisdom to to stick the wisdom and the courage to stick with our principles but we also have to have the ability to realize that the other folks have a point of view too a legitimate one that needs to be recognized and that nobody's all right and all wrong

senator Cruz Thank You mr. chairman welcome to the both of you thank you for your testimony today China is in my judgment the greatest long-term geopolitical rival to the United States presidents and both parties have believed for decades that America could turn China from a foe into a friend through trade and diplomacy or that allowing China and the rules-based institutions would turn China into a rules-based country instead sadly the opposite has happened America can't sever commerce with our largest trading partner nor should we but we must recognize China for the threat it poses to our national security there are three urgent matter matters before America and our allies number one to insulate our vulnerability to Chinese espionage and interference number two to deconflict our commerce from enabling the parties human rights abuses and number three to compete to secure our interests let me focus principally on the first many of us are increasingly concerned that China is gaining access to American secrets by using non-traditional all of government or even all of nation approaches to espionage against us and our allies Huawei is a Communist Party controlled surveillance agency veiled as a telecommunications company it is maneuvered itself into a dominant position providing infrastructure across the globe including two partners within the five eyes intelligence network of Great Britain Canada Australia New Zealand can you assess the risks presented by Huawei's commercial participation in the 5g build-out within these countries sir at the very least now I don't have the ability to independently assess the degree to which Huawei is controlled by the party and whether or not there's backdoors that could lead to vulnerabilities and civilian or critical infrastructure as well as impacts on military infrastructure but what I can say is at the very least a Chinese company like qua way has to do what the Communist Party asks them to do even if Huawei is a hundred percent private which which I'm not an economist but based on some of my studies even private corporations have very closed government ties even if there are a hundred percent private even if their leadership has you know no love lost for the Communist Party in the end if you're gonna operate in China and it's critical enough for a Chinese national security and core interests that the party asks you to do something you have to do it and so given those connections I think between companies in China to the government we have to be very careful in the national security front however I think we have to be careful also not to this is not for Huawei but other examples use national security issues for protectionist goals because that really undermines the areas in which national security is really threatened and I think we need to be think differently about counterintelligence we're in a different age of an Intel threat that is very different than before right the insider threat is no longer someone that just wants money or something like that we have China who is very proactive at getting information through cyber means but also just mass they're not very good at it but they have so they have so much effort at it so there really does have to be a broader effort in the counterintelligence the sphere to your first point we should not assume we should plan on the assumption that for the purposes of the national security goals of the Chinese state private companies companies that are technically private or are not private and as a matter of fact they've been pretty explicit recently in increasing the presence and invisibility of the Chinese party can Communist Party committees which are attached to every company even private companies and so I agree with dr. Mastro and we've said this in the Commission for a number of years there are obviously differences between state-owned enterprises and private companies for certain economic purposes but you have to assume they're all going to do the will of the state and you mentioned 5g this is a competition that the United States must win and the Chinese understand this and they are pushing very very hard they're going to control the standards if we're not careful and they're going to control the devices and if they do that then SP now is going to be very easy for them right last year I offered and passed an amendment the National Defense Authorization Act to prohibit DoD from funding Confucius Institutes which are one of the tools the Chinese use to penetrate American higher education I've also introduced the stop higher education espionage and theft Act to require the FBI to designate foreign actors conducting espionage in our colleges and universities in your judgment what further steps can Congress take to insulate our universities and research research institutions from Chinese espionage certify I don't mean to pivot but can I add one more concern from the point of higher education absolutely which is the elevate the cases of scholars who are punished or retaliated against based on the research where they're writing or even us-based companies that will censor some scholars work overseas I myself have just cancelled a trip in two weeks to China because I'm concerned about my own safety and that's the first time I love going to trying to spend a lot of time there but I'm concerned that that would not be a priority back at home if in retaliation for what's happening in the hallway situation if China started harassing or detaining US citizens and so I think that the Intel aspects is very important but we also have to recognize that individuals are being retaliated against that work in these institutions whether it's deny them access visas or what have you and so that also I think has to be a part of the national discussion prostate be the theme there I'm night for example on the Commission we've looked for years they'll deny and this is a little outside I read they'll deny or holdup visas to foreign reporters wanting to come into China and of course we're letting Chinese reporters in the United States all the time when Senator Dorgan was on the Commission I mean he and I used to talk but why do we do why don't we respond in kind in those kinds of situations just and why shouldn't they keep doing it from their point of view we don't react thank you thank you senator Cruz senator mannan is a very brief

25th district congressman Roger Williams a little follow-up visit this morning congressman because friday we talked to you and you said you're headed down toward the border to see firsthand what's going on down there the problems we have what did you see well what i saw was that the border is not secure and i saw it was eye-opening experience i went down with the idea talking to mayors business leaders the Border Patrol people that really are engaged to hour by hour down there and basically how can we happy and what's your biggest issue and you know you talk to the mayor's and of course they remind us the drugs are the drug trafficking is driving a lot of this and you know of course a couple with President Obama's promise of amnesty to everyone is create a bad situation down there but i think you know when you talk to the mayor's they agree that the border patrol needs more more people they also say look at we need border patrol but we also need some people to work with psychiatric issues with these young people you don't need border patrol trying to capture the bad guys and deal with tran changing a diaper we don't need that we all talked about this 2008 law that was passed that for reasons that never were thought it would have happened like we see happening now but 2008 law says that people from contiguous nations which in canada are from mexico can be apprehended and turned around if not they have to have their day in court that's all I probably we need to change we get back to Congress to make it easier for these border patrol people to respond accordingly and then from a city standpoint locales there spend a lot of money sitting McAllen right now projects lv at 1.5 million million dollars now their budget like the mayor says I want my money back so it's a real issues we need to find a way compassionately to send a message you can't spend your life savings in risky life comes America even have to go back home congressman Roger Williams was at the border this weekend and giving us an update on what he saw let's talk about the children that are gathered there and you mentioned the fact we need to figure out a way to compassionately send them back what are the conditions that they're in right now what are they being exposed to what's being done to help well I was at the mcallen sector my my hand goes out to the Border Patrol they're doing a fantastic job and it's tough I mean look at anybody that we are compassionate nation and when you see children in in holding areas divided among age and xx and so forth it just rips your heart out what we saw down there what I saw down there was the children being fed the children being a minister too from a health standpoint and some being closed but you know tremendous amount of influx of people going through there and it is not you know it's not something fun to see but at the same time we've got to come up with a plan that will recognize due process with these with these children and reunite and back with their parents but it's not it's not something that is fun to see but it also it also brings out in front the importance of having a border control and reminding people you cannot come to American who thinks illegally there's a way to do it and and we want everybody to understand that well I hope you get back to uh to work in Washington and come up with something to to shut this board a problem down just to shut it down will be the first step the problem and then get everybody back home I don't know where you begin well it's at emily kay it's a it's a daunting task but when you talk to that when you talk to the Border Patrol people in and the administrative folks they remind you how behind back in the 80s and 90s we had a lot of this same problem mm but it slowed down because at that time they were able to to turn these people around and send them back home congressman Roger Williams joining us from the 25th district they don't send them home now and that is the issue thanks to the time this morning congressman 753 a 25th

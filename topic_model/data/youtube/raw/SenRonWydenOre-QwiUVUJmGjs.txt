thank you very much madam chair director Brennan first of all congratulations I appreciated the chance to talk about a number of issues with you previously and I'm gonna be asking you some additional questions about drones and targeted killings in the days ahead but for today my congratulations director clapper I want to ask you about what I asked you about a year ago and that was the matter of surveillance and particularly what the rules are that an intelligence agency would have to follow in order to electronically track the movements and locations of an American inside the United States and I asked you about this a year ago and you said that your lawyers were studying this and I hope that since a year has passed we can get some answers to these questions so first let me ask the question if an intelligence agency wants to electronically track the movements and whereabouts of an American inside the United States how much evidence do they need well first of all let me just say sir that particularly in the case of NSA and CIA there are stretchers against tracking American citizens in the United States for foreign intelligence purposes and that's what those agencies are set up to do I think though when I might ask director Muller to speak to this because what you're referring to is I think devolves into the law enforcement criminal area so let me and I do want to hear from director Muller but I'm trying to get some general principles out with respect to intelligence and you've cited certainly some areas that that are relevant but what I'm really trying to do is get an unclassified answer to a question about what the law authorizes the law is of course as you know is embedded in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which was recently the amendment and - which was recently extended for five years and it places very strict strictures on the intelligence community's tracking of us persons where there is a terrorism Nexus and that is overseen very strictly by both the FISA Court as well as within the executive branch both by my office and and the Attorney General so there are very strict rules about that as you know as we discussed but as you know there are some fundamental questions about the balance between security and liberty that transcend justifies a question so what I would like to do is see if we can get a direct answer to the question about when the Intel community needs to get a warrant for example when a lesser amount of evidence would do and second the circumstances when no specific evidence is needed at all and the FISA law does not specify whether a warrant is required so that's the reason that I'm asking the question I asked it I'd like to ask director Muller that helped me with that question and mr. director I'm anxious to hear from director Muller who I greatly respect but I also need to hear from you with respect to the intelligence community that's why I asked it a year ago I said a senator wyden in the case of CIA and NSA who were engaged in foreign intelligence collection that's a practice they've they do not engage in it well senator you're talking well let me start by saying that there's no real distinction in what we do between the criminal and the national security if we required in a secure and criminal SCI we required national security we treat them the same there is no distinction between our intelligence cases in terms of undertaking the activity you you suggest and our criminal cases that being said in the wake of the Jones decision which I'm sure you're familiar with that is put some things in an area where we're waiting to see where the courts go but obviously they said if you were going to trespass to install a device then that requires a warrant the standard on that warrant is still up in the air and consequently to give you a more precise answer to a particular question on a particular monitoring I would have to be more more factually based on that apply the law to that particular set of facts director Muller you have identified the exact reason why I'm trying to get an answer from director clapper because there's no question we are going to watch what the courts do in the days ahead the question is what will be the rights of Americans while that is still being fleshed out and the fact is FISA does not specify whether a warrant is required and I know I'm out of time for this round I just want you to know director clapper respectfully I will be asking this question of you just like we did with respect to the legal documents for targeted killings which we finally got after seven requests over a two-year period until we get an answer because I think Americans are entitled to a direct answer that question thank you madam chair would you like director Muller to respond I think I think it would be helpful madam chair I think the director did and he gave a very thoughtful answer which is that the courts are still wrestling with the various interpretations of it I think that is a correct answer by director director Muller but we still have the question remaining what are the rights of Americans as of today while the courts are wrestling with this and that is the matter we have not gotten an answer to I thank you and this for you director clapper again on the surveillance front and I hope we can do this in just a yes-or-no answer because I know senator Feinstein wants to move on last summer the NSA director was at a conference and he was asked a question about the NSA surveillance of Americans he replied and I quote here the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions of doses on people is completely false the reason I'm asking the question is having served on the committee now for a dozen years I don't really know what a dossier is in this context so what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans no sir it does not not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly

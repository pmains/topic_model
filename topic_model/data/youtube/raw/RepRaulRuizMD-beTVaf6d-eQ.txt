2017 my constituent jennifer kepner passed away due to pancreatic cancer connected to her exposure to burn pits during the military service in balad iraq in her and the countless of veterans who are sick permanently disabled or who have died from illnesses due to exposure to burn pits i introduced an amendment to the ndaa to prohibit federal funding for the military use of toxic burn pits my amendment was not included but it is imperative to acknowledge the serious health risks that open-air burn pits have on our troops yet our military still uses them to dispose of waste on the battlefield the epa's website has a brochure discouraging burning household trash because burning waste releases dioxin and other pollutants to the air and at the ground level where they are most readily inhaled in addition many counties across the nation have banned open trash burning because of air pollutants that pose a risk to our health if we can't burn trash here at home because of the health effects why do we keep exposing our service members to dioxin and other toxins and carcinogens that are released by burn pits we must address reducing the use of burn pits in our military thank you mr speaker

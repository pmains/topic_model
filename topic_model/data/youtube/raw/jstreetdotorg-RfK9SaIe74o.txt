good afternoon everybody again good afternoon and thank you all for coming for this session shaping the Palestinian future voices of the next generation my name is Samuel maklouf I am the CEO of a Palestinian organization called Zaman Palestine thank you and I am going to be the moderator today for this session with my friends and colleagues but before we start I would like to ask you all to put your phones on silent so we do not disturb our speakers and this session in general I'd like to also to mention that by the end of this session we will give around 30 minutes for questions and answers and I would like although those who would like to ask questions to line up here in the middle behind this microphone and you will be taking three questions together and then have our speakers answer their these questions so since we are talking about the Palestinian future which is something that is very hard to predict given the very unstable and changing environment that we live in in a very troubled region as you all know and follow-up we would like to give our distinguished guests and speakers to give a sense about how they see the future or the near future and how they work with the future generation and creating a better future for the Palestinians and Israelis and the region in general I would like to start with giving a very quick introduction and the context about the reality right now which I am sure that most of you are aware and know the palestinian-israeli situation has been deteriorating for a long time since the peace process started and with the peace process more than 25 years ago the hopes were very high and people were really hoping that we were very close to closing a deal and striking a deal and a deal that will start a new era of peace and cooperation and better future for both people but unfortunately these talks collapsed and we witnessed the breakout of the Second Intifada and if you all remember this is the time where the notion or the myth of there is no partner was created and specifically by the former prime minister hood Barak when he started blaming the Palestinians and saying that there was no partner for peace and this is where that notion started and since then not only the situation has been deteriorating in a very serious manner despite that we had several rounds and several times of negotiations and renewed negotiations with all mert and the last one was with the Kerry John Kerry Secretary of State effort and in each round the optimism was very high and when these peace talks were filled people left with more hopelessness and more disparity and the damage was very big the developments that happened as well in the region in the past year were past years with the so-called Arab Spring and the violence that we saw and witnessed in the Arab region and internally within the Palestinian situation which did not get any better where we had a coup committed by Hamas and the separation between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and the internal division inside the Palestinian territory which affected our ability to deal with the biggest problem which is the occupation and the conflict and limited our ability to deal with this these developments showed that there is a serious problem on the other side and created or enhanced the idea and the notion that there is no partner for peace the developments that happened inside the Israeli society as well by electing the most right-wing government in Israel's history and since these this government was elected and the policies and the aggressive policies against the Palestinians expanding settlements aggression and legislations against Palestinians and and you name it you know many things that happened also created a very similar situation on the Palestinian side so after many years of a peace a failed peace process we found ourselves in a very very troubled community we found ourselves in a very unstable society and we are witnessing right now a very high state of hopelessness which I consider one of the biggest dangers that any community might face the level of hopelessness and the level of disappointment among the Palestinians is unprecedented and that is not a very good or healthy environment for only one who is working with a new generation to create a better future and these negativities in our society and in the region are major obstacles in front of progress and in front of having big impact through our work and through the work that organizations like our speakers do on the ground so I would like to start by introducing our guest speakers here I would like to start with who de Barco who is the regional director of all map in Palestine and in the region and Naveen sambuca who is a show social activist and well it's Lisa is the u.s. Program Officer of all map I'm going to give her just a very short and quick introduction and I will give them the chance to introduce introduce themselves the way they like to speak about themselves quickly and I would like to start with Hoda by asking each of our speakers what are the major challenges that you face on the ground what are the major problems and obstacles that you face in your day-to-day work on the ground and what are the biggest causes for the state of hopelessness that you see among your audiences and constituencies and also I would like to hear from you how are you dealing with such obstacles because I know that you are all doing good work on the ground and you became expert in dealing with this with this issue but I would like to hear about how you shift the state of hopelessness and this negative energy into a positive one through your work and finally how to your work you try to show a partner and whether you believe that showing a Palestinian partner is essential and important if yes why if no explain how you see this specific issue who'da Thank You Sammy and hello everybody it's very good to see familiar faces here thank you so much for taking some time and come and listen to this first of all I have to say that one of the biggest challenge is working with the Palestinians on daily basis is the fact that we have not seen any appreciation of the effort that the Palestinian as people and as leadership put towards peace if any we've we are always blamed for not giving enough we're not compromising enough for not being good enough partners and I can look at the history of the Palestinian people since 1974 when Muhammad Ali Abu Yasser Arafat went to Geneva and and urged the entire world not to let go of the olive branch that he was carrying we haven't seen any effort from the international community or for that matter or the Israeli government after the assassination of Robin that acknowledges the fact that the Palestinians have extended a long hand for peace and I want to give you one image that stayed with in my mind for a long time after the famous white house loan shake hand the Palestinians sent of the Israeli soldiers who were shooting at them few days before that shake hand the Palestinian use the Palestinian women the Palestinian activists and of the Israeli army with flowers and roses and we are still getting bullets for that and this is the challenge that we are facing with with youth mainly in Palestine on daily basis is how can we make an argument of us believing in nonviolent resistance believing in peace when Hamas comes in kidnaps one soldier and the next day the entire world is on its knees begging Hamas to release the the soldier in exchange for four Palestinian prisoners while 20 years of negotiations did not give the Palestinian Authority anything so the argument with the use in Palestine whether non-violence and peace activism work versus power violent power and this is a challenge for educators for activists for women for for fathers we have not seen any acknowledgment so far from from the world to the effort that the Palestinian society have towards peace and I think that the biggest challenge the Palestinians need to know that they have a partner in the world in the United States in Europe and let and also a partner within the Israeli society so that's one of the challenges that we are facing on daily basis thank you and Naveen if you can answer the same questions but if you can also please give us a sense of how much is the level of support for the two-state solution among the Palestinians and if this support is decreasing and why you see this support decreasing or increasing based on how you respond to this question and also I would like you to answer if you see that there is or the Palestinians do the Palestinians see a partner on the other side so we are always asking you know the Palestinians to show the goodwill and be showing a partner for peace do we see a partner for peace in Israel hi everybody thank you so much for those questions also not only a social activist but I'm also a co-director of an Israeli Palestinian organization called epic Rhee and basically what I'm about to present is basis on on our work as well so I think the main challenge that the Palestinians are facing specially maybe the Palestinian youth is a lack of vision not only a lack of hope but a lack of vision of what Palestine should look like the free independent state of Palestine and let me just give you some statistics that were actually published on the 1st of April it's not an April Fool's joke what I'm after to tell you so basically it says let's if you look at the level of satisfaction of the Palestinians who live in Gaza and the Palestinians who live in the West Bank only 5% of the people in Gaza are satisfied with their lives and only 20% are satisfied with their lives in the West Bank this is very dangerous because it means you can basically end your life because you're not satisfied with it on top of that 45% of the Palestinians living in Gaza want to leave Gaza it's that difficult living over there if you look at the the statistics that deal with the political situation so 48% support it is two-state solution while 50 percent oppose it and this is like have really dramatically increased over the past couple of years there you have 57 percent of the Palestinian population that says that solution is no longer practical so Palestinians have lost hope even at the level of finding a political solution and believing that there is no partner at the Israeli side 28 percent support a one state solution on top of that they say that in 10 years or in 100 years the situation would remain as it is which means that 9 percent only believe that there could be a political solution a political peace agreement and 77 percent say they don't feel safe at all with Israel which means that Palestinians really do not believe anymore that there is a Palestinian Israeli partner on the other side some other things says that this is also very important 39 percent of the Palestinian population believe that or do not participate any more in nonviolent resistance and a large percentage agree that we should go back to armed Intifada which means that on all levels it's actually going back and deteriorating that said this is all and also like what are the main pressing issues right now for the Palestinians they believe the main pressing issue is first of all ending the occupation at the political level the second thing is unemployment third and fourth is the siege of Gaza and the internal as a Palestinian administrative issues if you look at the rate of unemployment rate of unemployment in Gaza is 47% and in the West Bank its 12% and we're talking about a society that is 50% of it our youth so you can imagine the case of hopelessness and the case of lack of vision of what the Palestinians actually have which also means that most of them believe that in 10 years or 100 years it's going we are going to live together in one state and it's going to be an apartheid state and for me personally I always wondered is this really what the Jewish people want do they really want to be the oppressor and take the whole history of what they have been through and still posed the same injustice on another people I think now that the Israelis have a very hard job to do which is to prove to us the Palestinians that we have a partner on the other side you cannot keep like what the recent things that happened in Gaza right now we cannot turn a blind eye to it right now I'm asking every single Israeli or any single human being who actually believes in human human rights and in peace to actually look at what's happening you cannot turn and buy and die and say I don't know what's happening now that's it what we're trying to do at hip Cree is we're actually trying to define defy those stereotypes to show that there is a partner on both sides of the border how do we do that do that we actually bring people together on joint issues issues that are of interest to both sides environment for example water high tech entrepreneurship those are issues that are important for both sides and we bring people together to see that there is a partner on the other side we bring people together to see the potential of actually having a disagreement and ending the occupation this potential is both economic and social and at the same time we're trying to work with policy and decision makers and may taking one policy at a time and trying to change it this is at least our theory of change of and how we're trying to build partnerships between both sides thank you thank you salmon it's great to be here work good okay wonderful my name is Walid Issa I grew up in the Haitian refugee camp before I speak about the challenges I would like to share a little bit of my story because it's to just make it give you an opportunity to see how much this topic is very important to me personally the youth is to me personally is the most important topic that we must discuss as a 14 years old grow up in the Haitian refugee camp I'm number eight I have five sisters and three brothers when I was 14 years old in the heart of the Syrian Bethlehem I was in a coffee shop my school teacher was driving towards the coffee shop I left outside to go greet him and say hi to my school teacher and his daughter who was in the car a couple years younger than me suddenly a big white van coming from the other side trapped me in the middle and big scary men holding fully automatic guns they jumped out of the car I ran back to the coffee shop as a 14 years old and I start peering from the window and suddenly his faces of my school teacher and his daughter started disappearing and all I see is blood just covering the window I was the first one to run outside the coffee shop and go open the door to see my teacher and white and and I mused and my white shirt to wipe the blood it was it was a big trauma for me personally to see my school teacher you know his daughter she died and he survived but that was a defining moment in my life at that moment I saw nothing holy about the whole event I install nothing beautiful about that piece of land no matter what's your Israeli or Palestinian all I wanted to do is revenge I wanted to find an ak-47 big enough to kill these men who killed the child or in me my dad he took me home and he sent me to school that focus in healing and non-violence and through the school I ended up going to Minnesota with I lived with an American family my American mom American Dad hi Kate and Steve I love you and I thought I gonna go to Minnesota but I will go back to my ak-47 I go check Mall of America we'll go see minutes but I will go back to to revenge but when I met peoples Native American African American people from different culture it was that moment that I realized that it's bigger than actually ak-47 it's about building cultures that building connections so I know for a fact from my own experience that the youth it could be a ticking bomb that would actually be a disaster or a great opportunity if the energy is going to the right way I think the Palestinian youth are actually suffering from external and internal suffering they internally they are looked at nothing but political capital in 2017 for example by itself there was seven conferences addressing the Palestinian youth there was two conferences in January one in Cairo and one in Ramallah one from the Fatah Ramallah and Fatah Mohamed Allen in Cairo sending messages to the Palestinian youth there was a conference in March sending messages to the Palestinian youth from Tehran and one from Qatar and one from an April one from Turkey so all these conflicting messages sending to the youth to the Palestinian youth had given them a conflict of identity and it's it's it's a problem the Palestinian youth today internally they are lack a leadership they lack a mentorship they lack and a role model that they look up to and they see him as an example for them we needed word sight we need Mahmoud Darwish again to come back so the Palestinian youth can see an example of what is what do living for Palestine not dying for Palestine the other thing thank you externally there is many many many problems that actually hurting the Palestinian youth first the occupation you know there is no question I am I'm not gonna tell this audience what is the occupation because this is a this is a fundamental problem that the Palestinian are suffering from and the youth they see it every single day today 20 years ago after Oslo I could bring my cars and pretend that I could say King Hussein and play with it but today they actually can go to the internet they can see how you live here they can see how I live in Minnesota my nephew who's a 10 years old 12 years old he knows about my neighborhood the Minnesota more than actually as much as I you know because he has the access to see it they see how they live in France they see how they live in Tel Aviv they see how they live in in Minnesota and they see what does it mean to live in the occupation or and and under that under under a refugee camp so they are not the same they have that they have the access but they know how much they are suffering so for them the occupation is something that they see it every day they see it when they check the internet they see it when they CT look at the TV they see it when they walk outside their homes and it's actually creating a trauma every single day to them the other externally external issue that the youth have no clue the Palestinian I spent four months just came back I talked I tried to talk to many Palestinian youth from refugee camp to the cities and asked him what do you think about the Jewish community in America do you have what do you think about the Israelis it's a very simplistic answer it's very very naive answer the Palestinian youth no longer have access to meet Israeli youth in a mutual respectful platform as much as there is organization that they are doing great work I think there is that the need is very higher than the the resources provided for these organization the other thing externally which is the Palestinian economy is a is a donor aid is an aid based economy so the u.s. aid will decide that you want they wanted to give a grant for the use so there is a big economic development coming from Washington DC because they did a grant about youth in Ghana they come take the lead they take the opportunity and they do it for Palestinians so all the most of the projects that they have been done in the Palestinian side for the youth has been done without a strategy been done because there is an RFA outside there that someone wanted to actually build a program and it's act it's make it worse than worse than worst development for the use it cannot be coming from outside we have so many organizations that they are doing great work such as the organizations that they are here with the youth and we need to give them the opportunity here in the u.s. we say often that you give a man a fish and he will eat for a day you will teach him how to fish and he will eat for the rest of his life but both of them are wrong in that in that context because it's not about teaching them how to fish it's not about giving them fish it's about giving them an opportunity to go fishing based on their own reserve their authentic voice and that's what actually missing in the RFA a project-based economic development for the youth for the Palestinians there is other issues that it's actually affecting the Palestinian youth but these are the sort of the three main challenges that I would like to focus on today Thanks Thank You elite actually I would like to have three follow-up questions for our speakers today and I would like to start with Hooda and allow me to play the role of the devil's advocate and I really appreciate the work that you do but let me ask you a question about what also a need mentioned about the effectiveness of your work and you refer to the people-to-people work as a very important component that might heal the very bad situation and get us closer to a peaceful solution for the conflict do you think that we have enough time to do that because like the people-to-people work is a long-term approach and given the statistics that Naveen gave I'm afraid that we are approaching and getting very close to an irreversible point where the two-state solution might be gone and not applicable anymore do you think that this is the most effective approach that will get us or save the two-state solution or is there another way of injecting hope in the hearts and minds of the Palestinians and Israelis do you think that it is more effective to show Palestinians and Israelis sitting in one room discussing important and critical issues or do we have to show a critical mass in each society that is really marching non-violently towards achieving the national goals yes we we cannot say that people-to-people work is going to bring the two-state solution to reality if if we are the ones to dictate a solution on people then we will fail miserably just like the the policymakers and the politicians in the world but I am coming from a place of responsibility each and every one of us has a responsibility towards their own people and my responsibility towards the Palestinian youth specifically that my 28 nieces and nephews are part of is not to let go of that despair without discussing it with them most of what of my work with the Alliance for Middle East peace now is focused on building sustainable constituencies for people who can be resilient enough to keep hope but I'm not saying that we are going to be standing saying that I have a dream and in few years the dream will be realized that's not the that's not the goal in Palestine I think what the people-to-people organizations are doing sometimes in very very difficult situation is that they are holding the ground for people to continue having an outlet and alternatives because seriously what would be the alternative and I have to tap on the fact that the Palestinians could and should and maybe have million reason to be angry and hateful on daily basis and I want to address the Israeli people specifically and the Jewish community entirely that if you are coming from fear approaching the Palestinians in general from a place of fear and I understand and I respect the fact that the collective trauma is still very much alive within the consciousness of the Jewish people and the israelian people in particular I have a million reason for you to believe that the Palestinians are not going to be the ones who push you through to the to the sea this is this is just this is just a dominant narrative that has been used by many entities too many people ate that fear and I don't think that the Israeli society and the Jewish people should should continue giving it into that fear to that fear and I have one evidence that I mentioned yesterday the 100,000 workers who cross the checkpoints on daily basis that maybe everyone in the world think that they shouldn't but they should and they must because that's their own survival mechanism they go they they cross the checkpoint and I wish one of you can stand with me at 2 a.m. in the morning and watch what happens to them and yet they cross and they go and they do the job and they send their kids to schools isn't that a liberation action I don't think that people-to-people sharing I think what we are missing here I think what we are missing here is the fact that we don't have a role model and if the people-to-people a community is going to provide one role model to follow I think we should continue doing it I want you also to understand that the Palestinian people have succeeded immensely to bring themselves from a place of no place no visibility as old in the dominant narrative that they didn't exist it was a land without people to a place where they are sitting on the table fully being partners so this is a huge success for the Palestinian people under the circumstances that they have lived in when the leadership asked us to do negotiations we supported it when the leadership asked us to stop communicating with the Israelis who we did it when they created an office to build relationships with the Israeli society we supported it so there is no lack of willingness to do play opportunities for the Palestinians and the Israelis to meet and they do meet sometimes in very life-threatening situations by thousands and I would just remind you of the image of women HP is marching with Palestinian women in Jericho calling the entire world to unite for peace so III don't believe that we will all be Martin Luther King's or Gandy's but we have thousands of them among us what we need is to have Martin Luther King's and Gandy's in the international community dr. key okay hello works gonna so I you know I'm I just wanted to add to hood as you know I think there is there is their Palestinian internally they have to work and hope and in defining what what so what's the what do what do we exactly the messages that we wanted to give the Palestinians I'm the PA need to actually allow them to be part of the process they need to open the space to them there is no space for the Palestinian youth today unfortunately if you're talking there is the distribution of wealth in Ramallah in the West Bank it's a huge when you have someone's son receiving eight or nine thousand dollars a month and got someone because he's not someone's son and Ramallah that is not receiving that much money that is a problem so we have to redefine our nationality our patriotism to the Palestinians like what they wish when he said that I came to her for a rising Suns not to witness their settings I don't need a fascist to triumph I just want a a child to choose the day of laughter this is what Mahmoud Darwish told us we need to allow the youth to understand how politics work how the process works it should not be no longer the PA is an exclusive club for some and exclude others there has to be a way that the youth learn and understand what does it mean to be politics how does democracy work and need to be part of it from the Israeli side I think there is some internal work they need to do today we have no two-state solution or three cell solution we have 10 state solutions when you go to Tel Aviv and I have friends and ask them have you ever been in the West Bank no no no we don't go best have you ever been in a settlement was like no no no I mean I don't support the Occupy I don't go to the settlement so you've seen that the Israeli society is divided today and the Tel Aviv is very comfortable with the high-tech with so many things and and the Palestinian usually don't see the picture of the people of Tel Aviv they see the people of the Hebron settlements which is really that's how they define the pictures of the Israelis the Israelis internally they need to talk and they need to do a lot of work to say that our image is not only the settler who's actually throwing garbage and he brought to his neighbor two Palestinian neighbor and that's internally and externally I think the Palestinian and the Israelis we need to support them people-to-people work is not only a cute little thing hope is not a privilege to them hope is is a necessity in that region hope is not something that we have the privilege to Peck or not it's very stubborn to me hope is that stubborn thing that keep insisting every single day no matter how hard it is but there is some one thing that we need all of us especially here in the US like I know for a fact if it's up to the Jewish and the Palestinians the conflict will be ended because rabbi Hillel told us one day that if I'm only for myself then who am i if I'm now for others then who's for me if not now then when I mean the Jewish the Jewish ethical at the reality will never ever allow the Jewish people to treat the Palestine and other than you know under the Jesus said that's a fact we must not allow anyone to hijack our narrative the Palestinians today in the US and others there is a certain groups who are hijacking the Palestinian narrative to serve their ideological purposes and we have seen this in the US anti-semitism should not be justified by pro-palestine group and in the same time the pro-israel camp need to understand that don't sacrifice your ethical and your morality because a narrow-minded ideological support from a Christian blah blah blah for Israel right so these people should not hijack and take over the Jewish narrative of supporting of Israel I'm really concerned because for the first time ever that I feel that the US support to Israel is turning from a political support to ideological support which is very dangerous for me personally and I think this is need to stop we must to create we must claim our narrative and get back and say this is a political conflict and it will end and we have a solution and it's the two-state solution that is the only solution all other solutions is that illusion and we have to accept that fact okay I just want to add something to that since you mentioned there all of the us also the statistics show that the Palestinians have lost faith in the American role specifically after the last statements by President Donald Trump so basically they you the US has have lost this it's it's unbiased neutral a broker being an honest broker they've lost that stance so any initiative that's also going to come right now from the US administration is not going to be welcome to by the Palestinians unfortunately okay thank you all I would like to ask between last question and then we start with the questions and answers from the audience given that you said that the American administration is seen very biased from by the Palestinians and you mention about the lack of vision among the Palestinians which I agree partially with because internally we are in deadly need for a vision that will get out of this deadlock that we are witnessing on many fronts inside the Palestinian society but politically I think we do have a vision and I would like to refer to the peace plan the Palestinian peace plan which by the way is the first time in history we have a Palestinian peace plan usually we have the American Peace Initiative or the query parameter the Clinton parameters even the initiative by the civil society in Israel which is there's a le Peace Initiative but for the first time we have other than the Arab Peace Initiative we have the Palestinian Peace Initiative which is presented officially by the Palestinian President so I could consider that this is the plan that he sat or presented in front of the UN Security Council last January and I would like to ask you if we could consider there or if we considered this as a strategy for peace how are we going or how are we able to advance this and how are we going to promote it internally with the Palestinians among the Palestinians what is needed to inject hope in Palestine and among the Palestinians but also how are we going to promote this plan among the Israelis from your point of view and from your work that you do as well I think if it's a very difficult question to answer I'll tell you why because I think the Palestinians have done a lot to actually show that we have to show the Israeli public that you have a partner on the Palestinian side like for example the Palestinians have created the Outreach Committee which is part of the Palestinian Liberation Organization to just do outreach to the Israeli public and discuss with the Israeli public the Palestinian narrative show them that we actually they they actually have a partner on the Palestinian side to work with peacebuilding and Rios so far I don't think it has been effective or it has had impact at all because there's still the the B narrative amongst the Israelis which is hijacked by the current government Canon any government that there is no partner that Palestinians are terrorists and we want to throw you at the sea which is not true I don't want to throw anybody at the sea but I think that that has also led to another problem for the Palestinian Authority is that they have actually also lost connection with their own Palestinian constituency so III don't really envy the Palestinian Authority in that and in one way they're trying their best to outreach for the Israeli public and they're faced with an Israeli right-wing government extremist right-wing government and the other side the Palestinians view them as traitors unfortunately the latest statistics show that more than 60% of the Palestinian public do not approve of the Palestinian Authority security apparatus and coordination that exists so I don't know who it's going to word I think it actually would take to create a strategy between peace building organizations and the Palestinian Authority to create a strategy that would also include youth representative women representatives people from Gaza people from Jerusalem to do actually an outreach how we're going to promote our peace plan as well and at the same time let's also be honest we cannot keep putting the Palestinians as equal as Israelis in terms of power Israel is the most powerful we are the weak ones and we're all always asked to protect the stronger one so it's quite problematic I just wanted to say that we have to create an accountability force we have tried a grassroot effort and bottom-up and I think we need to have some more engagement from here to support the effort that we do on the ground over there we're not doing enough let's not killing ourselves let's not claim that we're doing great we're here we're supporting we care I mean we can do more we can do a lot more these organizations that they work really hard to promote these agenda of peace and connect people with each other and bridge the gaps they should not they should not focus on funding and resources in the last ten years with what's happening in the rest of the Middle East in Yemen in Iraq and Syria all the major foundations all the major organization they have been reach an allowing their funds to other parts of the region which is make sense because they have a lot of crises happening but we need to actually find a new mechanism and we need to support increase the funding for these organizations that they are great work in the ground especially from the US because we need them to focus on the work not on the fundraising we need them to cooperate not to compete and we have this is our challenge here in the US and we must work on it and the defense budget instead of actually you know this is something important this instead of actually giving weapons to protect someone building a bridge and we need to start sending than funding and the US aid and the US government they need to take these programs seriously because today people to people program is the future and we have to start today and we have to increase the funding to them well thank you all and I can see like there is a big line already so I would like you please to ask your questions shortly and directly to the point if you have a comment please say it quickly but please jump into the question and if you have your question directed specifically to one of our speakers please say the name of the speaker and please I'd like you all to comment on Abu Mazen you've mentioned there's no leadership that there's no models for young people what who do you see coming up he's an old man who's who's behind him that's one thing to Gaza the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority how do you see some connection it's you know these that's been failed attempts to unite and then you have Hamas who's who Israel won't talk to and finally you mentioned Gaza it's a mess what from the Palestinian perspective what's what's the solution to Gaza other than lift the embargo because you still have Hamas and you don't have any real authority so please answer those oh sure hello hello let's see all right so a couple things it was mentioned that the Palestinians haven't been in knowledge as a partner of peace since Rabine was assassinated but in 2008 Barack offered between 92 and 97 percent of what they were asking for and the Second Intifada came shortly after that so I don't really like that comment also the whole push into the sea the Hamas charter calls for the entire destruction of Israel so I think we should be realistic that their charter still says that they want to destroy the entirety of Israel so my question is what are Palestinians doing internally and I love that Waleed touched on the youth but to change the political structure of what's going on in Gaza and what's going on in the West Bank and hopefully to bring them together because I think we can all admit that there are clear deficiencies in the political structure of what the Palestinians have right now hi thank you very much for your points I would like you to elaborate a bit more about what you're seeing and on the street on the political map the support for Fatah Hamas has never been a majority there's a mainstream in Palestine that votes one way or the other so now with the first station that people have with both fact ahead Hamas right they both of them have failed them do you see people going towards a third party or do you see a movement in Palestine that's gonna push or pull in fact Hamas and Fatah towards another direction because both for the hamas show elasticity in that sense you tell the differences between the current Palestinian peace plan and previous peace plans and how that are ensure that is that the future Palestinian state remains democratic so what was the other peace plan Palestine a peace plan and the other okay thank you so I will stop here and have our speakers unset this questions and then we get another set of sessions so I wanted to talk about Hamas and the West Bank and Gaza look the goal is to create a viable Palestinian state not just about the Palestinian state that can operate as a state a Gaza is part of the state and the West Bank is part of the state neither one of them could actually survive build a state without the other one and we must actually accept that fact we should not take the West Bank for granted there is a lot of stress there is a lot of fear and the youth is not our suffering and we saw waves of violence waves of 15 14 years old kept going stepping you know it's a we need to address these things that aided the West Bank but look the youth is not only should not only be a political capital for the Hamas or Fatah whenever Hamas feels like they are losing the ground they need to send the fat that they use to do riots or the West Bank I think today unfortunately we have to create an accountability force from the outside the Palestinian diaspora on us who's outside we need to actually work and create an accountability when Salam Fayyad was in office he was fighting corruptions building institutions and that was a big threat to a lot of the people we should we we us here in the room and everybody we should have stood up and supported him and we said no we want him to be in office because we need to fight corruption and we need to build institutions our responsibility today that we need to support the good leaders who are making difference on the ground we should not let them go away and that is a lose for for us and for for them in terms of a third party I think from my you know in 2006 when the when the election happened I was just turned 18 for the first time in my life I gonna be practice democracy I gonna go vote so I want to vote I remember this very well there was you know Hamas and there is there is Fatah and one side I mean my never been ideological I don't I don't I don't support you know kinda ideologies and the other thing I know that the the experience with Fatah was a lot of corruptions as an 18 years old kid at that time I just put it empty the people who did not even write and if I could not I could not have the the moral responsibility as an 18 years old kid to actually vote we need to open the space to a third party and unfortunately three years ago when I start working to support 0:02 to start an organization the West Bank till today after spending around fifteen thousand dollars to register an organization a 501c3 a simple organization to support the Palestinian youth till today is not registered in the Palestinian side because apparently they don't want foreigners or outsiders to to influence the internal politics we must accept that we need a third party and we need to open the space for democracy and the liberal Jewish organizations they should stop just you know cheering for whoever you know tell them what they wanted to hear if they are they need to create an accountability not only tell you I want the two-state solution you need also to be a leader that fight corruption and building institutions now just take what I wanted to hear and dismiss corruption and all other things because he's telling me what I wanted to hear as an organization that support my my two state or my my my mission so we have to connect accountability fighting corruption building institutions with the talking point that we receive when these leaders or these institutions speak to foreigners or the Americans over here and we should not let Hamas and Fatah deal with each other without an accountability from the outside thank you the leadership question as I mentioned we live in a leaderless place world and we actually have no alternative that's why the the investment in news in I hate the word empowerment but creating an agency for the youth is important for those who think long term plans in Palestine I don't think that we have an alternative but to be fair also the Palestinian Authority leadership has been compromised its power has been compromised by the lack of honest broker ship or balance broker ship in in the in the Palestinian Israeli peace peace negotiations every time the Palestinian Authority offers something it's rejected sometimes when the Palestinian also are offered something that is related to Jerusalem everyone in this room know how Jerusalem is dangerous in terms of political power so it's not fair to blame it only on on the Palestinian Authority as an authority because their Authority has been compromised and I'll mention one example when at night they they police the Palestinian police as are asked by the Israeli army to go into their stations and close their doors and not be in the street so for the army to come and arrest Palestinians that's a compromise ation of the power of the Palestinian Authority and so that's a loss of a role model that's a loss in faith in the power of the Palestinian Authority when the American side that is supposed to be an honest broker take sides all the time and puts pressure on the Palestinian Authority all the time to set it to failure also they will lose their agency within the Palestinian society so to be honest with you there is no faith in Hamas or in fact in that sense and I talk to use all the time there is no alternative also read about the change the Hamas has done in its charter please just punch it on Google and you will know stop giving in to the dominant narrative please be informed more about it is not Hamas should not and cannot be the only sword representative of the Palestinians and you should not judge judge US based on Hamas and and I would say that the Israeli government sits with Hamas and talks with Hamas because they understand the language of Hamas and the Israeli government supports the power the Hamas gets every time they bomb Gaza Hamas becomes the only entity that defends Gaza and that's why people believe in Hamas as a defender so stop blaming people for the power manipulation in the region if anything that we need to focus in on is how to save gazans from being killed by every entity that has power on it including Egypt so I am not shying away from saying that Hamas has responsibility the Palestinian Authority has responsibility and Israel has a responsibility and each one of these powers is contributing to the power of Hamas and the stronghold of the people in Gaza one thing I would blame Kasdan's for is why not taking to the street and taking down every power that oppresses them and when they tried in in March 31st they were killed by snipers and the whole movement of nonviolent resistance why was hijacked by Hamas and if you want to read more I wrote an article about it at the forward it was a very courageous courageous statement from me saying that we need to take responsibility for what happened together so don't come here and tell us that we are defending Hamas if any we are resisting in unbelievable conditions the monopoly of power between the two of them and if we have if we have an agenda as people is to bring them together to create a unified unit for the Palestinian people Thank You Hilda okay let's take three more questions and keep your note for the coming questions please go ahead okay so my question is in the face of when diplomacy electoral process lobbying and also violent protests have all failed what can we as people outside of the region of conflict in America but also in Israel and also in Palestine what can we do to instill new leadership and to re-instill hope when the conventional methods have often been stabbed in the back I'd like to hi I'm Diane I'm actually originally from Uruguay so I can speak from like a different perspective from the American jury perspective about the conflict often times I hear that this conflict has not been resolved or it cannot be resolved because the Palestinian authorities or their wannabe authorities do not recognize the State of Israel and do not recognize its right to exist and I was just wondering if you could elaborate more on that and also if you have any statistics about excuse me what do the Palestinian people think in that regards whether do they believe that Israel has a right to exist hi so I've heard floating around this idea of a Marshall Plan for the Middle East a lot from Peter Geffen and other people sort of this idea that by bolstering the Palestinian economy you would get raised the statistics of happiness and fulfillment and hopefully lower terrorism so I'm wondering what you guys think of that okay thank you thank you we'll stop here and we'll have our speakers answer we have about the failed diplomacy what are you going to do and the leadership a very important question about recognizing Israel's right to exist I would like one or more of you to respond to this and finally the Marshall Plan that this gentleman heard about or keep hearing about so please going back a little bit to history how do you think the Palestinian Authority came about the Palestinian Authority came about after the Palestinian Liberation Organization recognized the existence of Israel and signed the Oslo Accords with with Israel so the Palestinian Authority itself is is the result of the recognition of Israel even Hamas itself changed its Charter and even Hamas itself participated in the Legislative Council which were also part of the Oslo accord which means that we do believe in the existence of Israel we do believe that they have a right to exist what we're asking for is a Palestinian state next to the Israeli state neighbors so yeah again the whole narrative is being hijacked by the extremists who actually want the Israelis specifically to live in fear all the time it's a very good mechanism to control people in that sense I'll just also wanted to say one thing on the Fatah Hamas thing I think that both Fatah and Hamas came about as leadership through the First Intifada because they were leaders through the First Intifada they were the ones who actually led the people along other political parties and let's not forget that there were democratic elections in 2006 but the world did not like the results of those democratic elections so and they punished us for practicing all our rights instead of just giving us four years to see where it's going to take us and until today as Palestinians we are paying the price of this punishment we don't have elections at a presidential level or at the legislative which is like kind of the power Parliament or Congress level and if we do there's not gonna be any sort of a third party even statistics show that Fatah and Hamas are going to win Qatar who will lead Hamas a little bit less and only nine percent will elect third third parties and that's basically because there's no space where you can actually foster and grow a third a third option for Palestinians there's not an emerging leader in that sense also something else what can you do as the u.s. I think you already answered it who that please change I think I think you you have the power you are the Americans you know howhow lobbying works and advocacy work and the US Congress and I think you just should support the people who you can actually affect to bring a change to that region so yeah we need your support also do your own internal homework in the States in that sense okay thank you we'll get three more questions but I would like to ask our speakers to keep their answers a little bit short so we can have as many questions as we hello I'm with one voice from DePaul University waleed you mentioned earlier that there aren't enough opportunities for Israeli and Palestinian youth to interact I was wondering what you believe the role of public education has in facilitating those interactions hello I'm Terry Altair I'm from American universities J Street chapter um I was just wondering uh since we're talking about kind of measures by from the Palestinian peace camp I'm just wondering what your thoughts on BDS is since considering the fact that BDS has not only gone predominant support in within Palestinians but it's also becoming a huge issue in America as well considering the recent anti BDS legislation that's been proposed all over America all right I heard a moderate Palestinian spokesman speak on PBS and he was talked about two issues that Palestinians believe are the cornerstone and one is the right of return and for Palestinian refugees the others returned to the 1967 borders and he said those are two critical issues that cannot be compromised do you agree with that or we're not well let's stop here and then we'll get the last round so we have three questions that are important I guess so a speaker a speaker said about the right of return and 1967 borders the BDS and the interaction between Israelis and Palestinians so please feel free to answer whatever question you would like to answer take the BDS because I was waiting for the question so thank you for mentioning so we are a society just like any other society even if we live under occupation and we have to face oppressive systems internally and externally on daily basis but the Democratic nature of our conversations are funny and very very creative so when you think of us as a community that has the capacity to have an intellectual approach to the conflict BDS is part of it I know I understand completely the threat that it imposes imposes psychologically speaking and and even sometimes emotionally speaking on the Israeli society and the word BDS could get you out of the room if you are in a meeting in a peace meeting with peace activists sometimes but we have to admit that in in in the absence of any political will to end the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring justice to the Palestinians and to the Israelis bring security to the Palestinians and the Israelis bring peace to the Palestinians and the Israelis everyone has a free run on doing their own theory of change so can we be oppressive to them we tried you know I the challenge of VDS in in Palestine is the fact that they are actually not very strong among the Palestinians who are living in the West Bank or Gaza and I would talk about anti normalization which is the one way offshoot of the BDS they are an intellectual elite they are a part of the Palestinian conversation on how we approach this conflict I respect the fact that they are using sometimes nonviolent tactics and when they use violent tactics we'll go after them trust me the the my issue of anti normalization groups two things first of all they go after the weaklings in the peace camp and normally these are the girls or the women who participate in the so-called dialogue programs assuming that women in Palestine have no agency have no brains and can be easily brainwashed no sir I'm sorry we are very very strong and asked my grandmother the second the second anti normalization have been used as a propaganda tool by the Israeli government to contribute to the dominant narrative about the Palestinians that they are not interested in peace so be aware of that in general I as a peace activist don't support this or that but as a peace activist also willing to engage in a conversation if I'm willing to engage in a conversation with a settler I must also be willing to be engaged in a conversation with BDS and anti normalization we still have two questions the 1967 and right of return I assume our the gentlemen who asked this question kind of asking about what could be a contradiction here so if you can clarify this issue so I I'm a refugee my my grandfather is a refugee 1948 he has the key to his house that he left in 1948 and I do have Israeli friends my grandfather he showed me the key to his house every single day I looked at it I touched it you know defined my morality defined Who I am I always question what does he exactly want me to do with it does he want me to fight does he want me to kill you know what's what's my grandfather's experience with the key is different than my experience it's a physical experience to him to me it's it's something that I touch that I know shaped the core things in my identity and I feel lucky because I touched the things that shaped me each one of us in the room today has that key that shape your identity it could be your religion could be your sexuality it could be your nationality that shaped the core values of your identity look to me personally as a refugee I think I have no power over the past but I do have power over the future I not anywhere to actually give up my grandfather's story and narrative everybody need to realize that my grandfather is a story but I need to compromise on what I have to create a better future and peace to me personally and I think a lot of people you know would like would not like it I need to separate the right from the return the right I cannot compromise and because I have no power over it it's my grandfather my history my father is a story but the return I need to compromise on it because that's how I actually allow my future my daughter that it's coming in the way and my neighbor's daughter that the two lived lived together in peace the right to return is very hard to deal with I know a lot of people it's a very sensitive subject but we have to be pragmatic but also we have to recognize the past and and and that we have left them the other thing is look in terms of BDS there's I don't like that it's it's there today there it's a became a political ladder for some leaders that they use it to maintain their power and and today it's not only that we don't have leaders it's worse than that we have war mongers we have status call keepers my grandfather used to always tell me we Palestinians have the best cause and the worst the worst attorneys and I think we need to change the players we need to change the attorney and and and the strategy we cannot just depends on tactics that not gonna lead us anywhere we need to have a national strategy that will actually end the conflict we don't need Palestinians and Israelis not need to yes but but the Palestinians really don't need to confirm each other's identity what they need is it's a political conflict they need to enter conflict a solid solution that will end the conflict for once and forever thank you and by the idea suggesting changing our attorney our session comes to an end I would like to thank our speakers for their contribution and thank you for coming and participating for this session thank you so much

come back to midday congressman Roger Williams says that many of the problems facing our nation today could be fixed by getting people earlier this month congressman Williams introduced the final piece of legislation in his seven bill tax reform plan jumpstart America congressman Williams kind enough to join us here on midday discuss this legislation and a few other hot topics going on around our nation congressman is a pleasure to have you with us good to be here thank you let's start with that your plan to get people back to work how does jumpstart America work well it empowers Americans which i think is the biggest asset we have small business owners moms and dads we have an 18 trillion-dollar debt right now it's rising I think the only way to fix it is to put people back to work again and that is empower small business to do that so we talk about jumpstart America what we do we talk about lowering tax rates both corporately personally we talk about reducing capital gains and dividends we talked about don't Lee doing wave the inheritance tax most unfair tax anywhere in the world and we actually have gotten that passed already out of the house which gone to the Senate we talked about we talked about doing things like a hundred percent right off on fixed assets so if a family buys a computer or a business buys a computer business buys a delivery vehicle or whatever they can actually write it off the year that they choose to do so as opposed to scheduling it out and so and cutting payroll tax in half is a big deal for employees employers it puts money back in the system and will allow small businesses to make money and hire people and get people off of food stamps and put people back to work again and you know what you're talking about when it comes to small business your family and you have a history in small business right here in Texas well on a small business guy I mean I'm one of the few people actually in Congress are still owns a business I mean I'm fighting regulations just like everybody else is so you know we have a family owned business been in business 76 years my daughters and our third generation they run our business and so look at America is a great country America the grass as I said are Americans and we need to realize that if the more we're consumption-driven nation the more money we have churning in this case job opportunities were going to have makes a big difference many Republicans to switch topics may many Republican Republicans including yourself has spoken out against the nuclear deal with Iran President Obama's nuclear deal can enough be done at this point to halt the deal well I think so I mean it's just a bad deal I mean when you when you make a deal with people yelling death to Americans and death to Israel that's just a real bad start and we're just turning you know we're giving them back 150 billion dollars we're opening up their banks we're giving them opportunities to move their nuclear assets around before inspectors come in it's a bad deal so I think I don't believe it will pass the House I think it won't pass the Senate President Obama said he veto that but we'll see what happens but it's a bad deal and I think it's Neville Chamberlain all over again let's talk about the the presidential race you've been you've had a big part in a presidential race you were with george w bush back in North Texas in the you two thousand of course we're coming up on an election year Donald Trump is leading the pack as far as the Republican field goes is he as a Republican in Congress is he hurting the Republican Party I don't think so look at we have what 17 people running I personally think they're all better than what the Democrats have to offer and I think the process will work look at Donald Trump is saying things that a lot of people say across America and so forth so I Lane think that we let the process work and we'll come up with a nominee that I think will win in November 16 let's finish with one last thing about jumpstart America can anything be done of this magnitude without a change in the White House no I mean look at everything we've talked about today I'm not naive enough know that pres Obama would he wouldn't support any of this in fact when we passed the inheritance tax out of the house I got a message back from the White House saying that he would be told that if it got to his desk but look you know I was elected by by my district who to represent the people of district 25 quite frankly small business owners across the country I need to do the right things that I think will turn America around regardless and let's get the process going and let's see how it comes out congressman is a pleasure to have you thank you good to be here thank again for midday

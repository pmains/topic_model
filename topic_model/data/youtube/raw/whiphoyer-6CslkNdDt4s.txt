beaker let me talk about an issue first of all let me say that we have the leader has announced a number of bills for consideration next week I ventured to say that an extraordinarily infinitesimal amount of the American people have any ideas what those bills do or are urging those bills to be passed I do not mean there without substance I mean that they are not the issues on the mind of the American people this is the people's house the speaker mr. speaker appeared on television on a town hall on CNN some 14 months ago he made a promise at a sin in Town Hall to a dreamer that asked him a question House Speaker Paul Ryan strongly suggested to that young woman that and I quote revocation on protection for the dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out notwithstanding that the President of the United States put that dreamer and hundreds of thousands of other dreamers indeed close to 2 million dreamers at risk by withdrawing their protections which speaker Ryan indicated would not happen quote will not be carried out that was some six months ago Mr Speaker not to CNN that was 14 months ago I have talked to the speaker and I brought it up continuously on this floor and I've been told by the Republican leadership don't worry we've got until March 5th to do something I was told that in October I was told it in November I was told it in December I was told it in January I was told it in February don't worry we've got until March 5th March 5th came and went no action none that dreamer to whom the speaker spoke is still at risk still worried still twisting in the wind 86% of the american public mr. speaker says that young woman should not be kicked out of the country that she knows brought here as a child went to elementary school middle school high school some to college some practicing medicine some practicing law some being social workers many being teachers I was told don't worry they were told don't worry March 5th is a long way away it has come and gone and we're told this week we will consider HR 1116 the tailer Act I'm not training in my constituents have talked to me about the Taylor Act HR 42 63 regulation A+ Improvement Act I doubt that a single one of my constituents has talked to me about that act they are fillers mr. speaker they are fillers while we fiddled while Rome burns I have asked leader Pelosi has asked frankly leaders of the Catholic Church and other denominations have asked put the dreamer bill on the floor in the people's house the speaker of this house when he became speaker said we will not duck the tough issues we will take them head-on don't worry we got till March 5th March 5th is behind us and we consider these bills which I think are filler bills and controversial bills at that we have asked mr. speaker that the majority party put on the floor three bills on an issue of vital importance to the American people that every American knows about that the people's house all I have the right to speak on and express the views of the American people and establish policy they support 86% of them so I would again ask the majority leader mr. speaker to put the DREAM Act on the floor to put mr. Goodlatte bill on the floor to put to put the bipartisan bill sponsored by mr. Hurd of Texas and mr. Aguilar of California put them on the floor take the issues I know they're tough the speaker said and you want to take the issues head-on mr. speaker not duck show some political courage and not only that respect this institution and every member in it who wants to express their opinion on this legislation of critical importance to at least one point eight million Americans vital to their future to their life and 86 percent of Americans believe they ought to be protected just as speaker Ryan pledged they would be 14 months ago when he said revocation of protection for the dreamers brought here as children will not be carried out mr. speaker that bill ought to be brought to the floor to carry out that representation in that assurance I've been patient I've talked I've worked I've come to meetings I met with the president of United States mr. speaker with my colleague and friend the majority leader and mr. Durbin and others twenty five of us sitting around the cabinet table mr. speaker when the president said we'll take care of daca and he said you send me a bill I'll sign it and I'll take the heat he was not telling the truth mr. speaker because we had a bill called the common sense crowd about 25 United States senators brought a bill to the floor and a couple of a couple of the things the president wanted to take care of but it wasn't good enough for him notwithstanding the fact in fact he said you send me a bill you decide ie the Congress the co-equal branch of government who now stands suppliant in the face of saying we'll pass something only if the president will sign it that's not what the framers meant mr. speaker we are a co-equal branch not a subservient branch of the Congress of the United States of the government of the United States mr. speaker if we brought those three bills to the floor that I just referred to the DREAM Act co-sponsored by Ileana ros-lehtinen a Republican and Lucille roybal-allard a Democrat and the Goodlatte bill to the floor sponsored by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a bipartisan bill sponsored by many Republicans and many Democrats the herd aide from Texas and mr. Aguilar from a Democrat from California if we brought those bills to the floor the problem is they know the heard eggroll our bill would pass which would reflect the views of eighty-six percent of the American people no mr. speaker notwithstanding fact that American people are overwhelmingly for that we're gonna be considering HR 1116 HR 45 45 HR 42 63 ignoring that 1.8 million people ignoring that promise that the speaker made to that young woman that she would be protected because told me over and over again oh I want to do this I want to do that I'm gonna have some task force so I'm gonna do this that and the other March 5th that's come and gone nothing's happened I used to be the majority leader I could bring a bill to the floor if I said something was going to happen I tried to make sure it happened if I sound angry it is because I am angry if I sound frustrated it's because I am frustrated the people's house ought to be given the opportunity to express the will of the American people on this issue there's another issue and we do have a bill the so called Rutherford bill that we're bringing to the floor on suspension we're probably all going to vote for the Roth IRA bill thank you but we're going to ignore a bill as we've been ignoring for years under Republican leadership a bill that is even supported even more than the daca dreamer bills and that is comprehensive background checks which clearly will save lives which will close the loopholes which will make sure that those with criminal records don't get guns make sure that those with mental health issues don't get guns will make sure that terrorists who can't fly on airplanes can't gut guns mr. speaker we have been urging and pleading for that bill to be brought to the floor over and over and over again the National Rifle Association not for that bill I can't understand why rather we bring a bill to the floor that will help schools I think that's positive do what they can do right now should we help them of course but we are not to pretend that we are doing something to make our children safer in their schools to make concert goers safer at their concerts to make church goers safer in their church to make people who go to a nightclub safer in that nightclub to make people who go to shopping centers safer in those shop we are not to pretend that Rutherford bill is going to do that real comprehensive background checks do it all it will not there are other things I think ought to be done but at minimum at minimum the American people think that we ought to make sure that everybody who purchase a weapon has a background check to make sure that they're not a criminal somebody with a substantial mental health problem that makes them unsafe to own a gun spousal abuse mr. speaker the bills we're going to consider next week I'm sure have some merit from some perception from somebody's perception but the two bills that I've just discussed are on the minds of the American people and millions are at risk if we do not pass legislation dealing with that issue I do not criticize the Rutherford bill but it will not solve the problem and everybody knows it will not solve the problem nor frankly will you know universal background checks in and of itself solve the problems but experts say it will save thousands of lives over time it would have saved lives in Charleston South Carolina nine people killed in mother Emanuel Church in Charleston South Carolina Mr Speaker I like to work in a bipartisan way but that requires respecting one another my Republican friends wrote a book in which they were very critical the way we ran the house because it wasn't open in transparent I would ask them to reread that book I've read it my friend is smiling in that book they really wanted to change the way this house runs make it open transparent take the tough issues head-on that's what the speaker said mr. speaker they're not taking the tough issues head-on they're hiding from the NRA their fire hiring hiding from some of their hard and lying people who want to kick people out of America that want to take that lamp that the Statute of Liberty holds high and bring it down yes I'm disappointed yes I'm angry yes I'm frustrated I came to this body to express my opinion on the important issues confronting my country and trying to make it better so Mr Speaker I wouldn't plead with the majority leader - perhaps delay those four bills rutherford's could be on suspension won't take much time to lay those three bills that a miniscule amount of Americans there may be a hundred there may be 200 Americans who will be concerned those bills aren't brought forward and put on the floor the three bills I refer to the DREAM Act the good light bill and the hurt angle our bill and let the people's house express its opinion that is not an unfair request and let the background check universal background check bill come to the floor and let the house vote I know that there's some Republicans don't want to vote on that bill because the public is so overwhelmingly for it and they may upset the NRA that's what this business is about miss speaker expressing openly and clearly what we think the policies of our country ought to be to make our public better to make our country safer so I would end on those two issues and yield to my friend the majority leader murrs are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the president

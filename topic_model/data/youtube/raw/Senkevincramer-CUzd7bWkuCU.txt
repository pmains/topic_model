joining me now is north dakota senator kevin cramer he's member of the environment and public works committee senator great to see you thank you for being here uh that 1.2 million barrel per day deficit that we're still at right now despite the fact it's good news that we had 16 more rigs open up but but it doesn't affect the overall picture that 1.2 million barrels per day is ha is more than double uh what we were getting from russia i mean their national security implications to not producing enough oil aren't there there are and there always have been david thank you for the opportunity to be with you i've been saying for 20 years that energy security is national security and and we used to say that because we used to think about the incredible amount of money that the united states spends defending you know this the straits of vermouth for example and the movement of middle eastern oil to the united states well now when you look at it in the context of ukraine and russia you look at places like venezuela and saudi arabia or iran who's a major oil producer the united states can not only produce more than enough for the united states we can produce plenty for many other parts of the world especially where our allies live so that they're less dependent on our adversaries and quite frankly why we don't use more of our the the the peaceful tools of energy development rather than the weapons of war to keep our enemies at bay is beyond me that's a great point well he what's happened is that the democratic party which is yielding to people like aoc and and prime minister bernie sanders and their extreme agenda they want to transfer their climate guilt to the big polluting countries as though somehow they're doing something for climate change by by turning out the spigots in the united states makes it zero sense senator there may be a country maybe norway or a country in europe that produces oil that produces it cleaner than the united states but not all these people that the blind administration is turning to nobody's dirtier than venezuela i know venezuelan oil company very well they're filthy the way they produce oil uh the kind of oil they produce the way it's refined etc so if you want to clean the environment you drill more here it's that simple but it's the connection between price and supply that that i was referring to with regard to national security because putin just couldn't couldn't fund his war machine as as easily as he's doing if the price hadn't jumped up because of the lack of supply that's exactly right for the petrol states for whom energy and particularly oil and gas production is the largest part of their economy this is a really big deal to them and we could choke them off by what i advocate for david is is an america first energy policy where we actually work with our allies in places like europe for example who's who have now created a standard a carbon border adjustment as you know that they're using for trade purposes if we if we adopted with them a standard that we and they already meet but vladimir putin will never meet and by the way how about we consider a labor standard as well where we don't have the human rights violations we have high labor standards and i'm not talking about adding costs i'm not talking about adding regulations i'm talking about just doing what we're doing with our trading partners in a way that will not not only will shut off the money supply for vladimir putin's war machine but it also forces all of the players to increase their own standards as well that'd be a far far better approach than just trying to choke off the supply in the united states with the hope i guess that you'll choke off the demand which is not the case we've been we've been talking a lot about oil and that's usually where people go to first but there's natural gas is even a more important issue uh of course it is to folks in north dakota and other states that that do a lot of fracking but but you think of what's happening all of the the extra regulations that have been laid on natural gas which are causing a reduction of production of natural gas have led to us using more coal we used to get in 2020 we got 20 percent of our energy needs from coal now we're getting 24 so the air is getting dirtier because we're cutting back on natural gas again it goes directly counter to their claims for environmentalism well there's a lot of hypocrisy and democratic energy and environmental policies and like i said earlier they're really just transferring their guilt to other places and makes no sense this is why you need a truly all the above energy strategy that's that's really an environmental strategy as well because to the natural gas point just as one example um vladimir putin's natural gas that he produces and then ships via pipeline to europe are used to um is 41 greater greenhouse gas emissions that it emits than natural gas produced in the united states of america and shipped when you consider the entire life cycle of the product and while you talk about other places that produce pretty clean fossil fuels and there are places that do but when you consider the entire life cycle and all of the other standards that surround it it's a really big deal so you're exactly right remember when natural gas was called the bridge fuel and hillary clinton famously said it's a bridge we need to cross really quickly it's that kind of a tone that sends chills up investors spines because how do you how do you how do you respond to a uh you know a cry like that says okay we'd like you to invest in your energy but we want it to only be short-term investment you know needs to be repaid well another example of that another example the lack of of knowledge with regard to how stuff is created and sold is is there attacks on the pipelines and then when that's brought up i mean it was the first thing that biden did was close down the xl pipeline they say gensake and others say well but you know a pipeline isn't isn't oil or it isn't natural gas well you don't produce oil or natural gas unless you're sure you can ship it out of there right that's exactly right and by the way the cleanest way to ship oil and gas is in a pipeline right i mean well yeah by the way now they are they're talking about getting canadian the oil and gas that was going to go through xl they're talking about shipping it down because they can't use a pipe that's much more dangerous and ecologically dangerous than than using a pipeline right it is both of those things as well as it emits about double the greenhouse gas emissions that a pipeline emits so the whole thing is absurd on its face or at least absurd when you scrape a little bit of the surface off but they don't want you to do that david that's the problem they they swim in the shallow end of the pool when it comes to economic policy and the american people are not fooled by it because when they go to fill their car with gas or they look at their light bill they know it's going up and it's going up way too much well we're we've got kevin hazard coming on a little later kevin is going to be talking about the so-called putin price hike which is actually started long before putin had eyes on ukraine or at least was massing the army there senator we've got to leave it at that thank you so much for coming in appreciate it good to see you always my pleasure good to see you david thank you

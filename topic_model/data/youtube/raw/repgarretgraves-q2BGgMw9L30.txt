this really is amazing to stand here right now i want to remind y'all that when when hurricane katrina made landfall it's estimated that there was somewhere around a wall of water that was about 25 feet high that was right here the the water came along the mrgo came along the gi w and this was just this major confluence this golden triangle area this wall of water went in and just just sacked new orleans sac jefferson parish it was it was uh complicated further by water coming the industrial canal this project right here everything you're seeing right here this this whole wall this was on the back of an envelope on the back of an envelope after hurricane katrina this was on a just just sketched out there are other parts of this project that have been around literally date back to the 1960s and 70s this this was on the back of an envelope after hurricane katrina this structure nearly a billion and a half dollars was completed about five or six years after that this is absolutely amazing it's incredible incredible feat but let me tell you something a little bit about how we got here we got here because there were projects that had been devised for this area for to protect this area but as i said they date back to the 60s and 70s and those projects were moving along way too slow and what we're talking about what we're celebrating right now all this is on the backs of about 1500 of our fellow brothers and sisters that perished in hurricane katrina all this is on the backs senator kennedy talked about the cost of taxpayers i want to remind you all we spent about 150 billion dollars of american taxpayer funds responding to responding to what happened here with hurricane katrina and hurricane raid in 2005. 150 billion hundred lives the mayor talked about how we've gotta look at all this stuff holistically we've gotta build levees we have to build pump stations we have to restore our barrier islands we have to restore our wetlands this is a system my gosh shame on us if we ever get complacent if we ever slide back into that old approach that old system of of being complacent it shouldn't have taken those lives it shouldn't have taken those dollars to get us here but look this is an amazing accomplishment and as so many people have said there are hundreds and thousands of people that have that have contributed to what we're celebrating today and you know what senator kennedy it was 14 or 15 billion dollars but this thing it's worth every single penny and i know you you know that there were people after hurricane katrina that were questioning whether we should come back here whether we should even rebuild here look this is one of the most amazing places on earth the people here are great the resources here are amazing and look at it exploding and flourishing now this is a this place is worth protecting it's worth every single penny and as noted in 2012 hurricane isaac you remember it's sitting right there it wouldn't move this thing protected our community this system protected our community and hurricane ida had all kinds of reporters calling us from louisiana and across the country saying do you think it's going to flood is that system going to hold and i told him then so there is no doubt in my mind i have every bit of confidence that system's not going anywhere and it performed it has paid for ourself itself but i also want to remind you moving a little bit over to the west from here a little bit over to the west we have president jewell coming up the upper baritaria system going to protect seven or eight parishes all the way up from saint charles and lafourche up to ascension parish we just passed the provision through the house committee to authorize that billion and a half dollar project and like i said about not being complacent look yeah we spent 14 or 15 billion dollars doing this but you know what we're not done and we should never stop we just authorized an additional 1.8 billion dollars to improve this system to make sure that we continue raising it widening it making sure that it's stronger as we learn more about changing conditions and what the future is going to look like it's awesome that we're here today this is an incredible engineering feat but we've got to remember the lessons learned from hurricane katrina this is a system our barrier islands our coastal wetlands our natural forests and other barriers as well as our walls pump stations it all goes into this system and we can't ever stop improving ever stop learning from our mistakes and successes and continue building because i'll say it again south louisiana is worth protecting

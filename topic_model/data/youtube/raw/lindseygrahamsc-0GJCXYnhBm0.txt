a new breakthrough in the Benghazi investigation the terror suspects responsible for leading the attack that left four Americans dead including our ambassador Chris Stevens have been identified so why hasn't the White House given the green light to arrest them is justice for the Benghazi victims being put on the back burner South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham has been at the forefront of this issue he joins us now morning senator good morning this may be the new low in a story that seems to get lower by the day so is this accurate that we do that investigators do know who the prime suspect or suspects are in the murder of our four Americans but why aren't they being arrested if that's the case well here's what we know we know that CNN was able to go to Benghazi two weeks ago maybe a little bit longer and get the head of Ansar al-sharia who's responsible for the attack and meet Abu khattala the leader of that organization and get an on-camera interview he said he was at the consulate not responsible but nobody from the FBI the living government's ever talked to him and he's a person of high interest according to our government CNN found him within two hours apparently we can't find him maybe we need to contract out to the media to go get these suspects but yeah this is a pathetic effort to bring people to justice center if this administration is known for its drone attacks and they do they are very confident that they've gotten a great deal of the al Qaeda nucleus why are they so timid when it comes to these guys I've had Special Forces operatives an intelligence community personnel come up to me over the last two months and say they've got great leads nowhere other members who planned the attack are located in Libya and can't get approval to go after them this is not a phony scandal this is a pathetic effort to bring people to justice I think if you got got these folks you would find out how terrorists centric this attack was that it was never based on a video maybe they're still looking for the guy for the video and that's why they can't find these folks I don't know but my belief is that the the people who killed our folks are roaming around live yeah in the wide open and we're not doing a damn thing about it but we can't get the approval to take the action I'm glad you mentioned the phony scandals things because you know there are a number of scandals problems for the administration I haven't heard him tick off yeah IRS that's a phony scandal yeah the DOJ phony scandal Benghazi phony scandal but that's clearly what they're trying to get people to think is that this is being ginned up by guys like you on the Republican side to make this administration look bad yeah attacked the critic at the end of the day we're almost a year out from Benghazi not one person has been put in jail but CNN that was able to find the leader of the organization responsible for the attack after a two-hour effort in Benghazi no one's been brought to jail we still don't know if Hillary Clinton approved the consulate to be open after it fell the security inspection we still have no idea who changed the talking points to start this lie that it was a rid of video riot caused by video the basics of what happened in Benghazi Benghazi are unknown and the Congress has never been able to interview one survivor they're writing books they're appearing on TV this has to stop this is not a scandal this is a national security failure where four brave Americans died and we're doing nothing to bring the people to justice to understand how it felt alright well put lindsey graham south carolina senator sir thank you very much thanks to my senator we also

Center in Hawk today did a great job of talking about the defense bill I think it's clear that over the last 10 years our technological advantage is not as great as it was it's we are still technologically better than anybody else this bill makes the kind of investment that will keep us there it also makes an investment in people that's extraordinary the biggest pay increase for people serving the military in a decade 3.1 percent there's also a provision in here that would direct the Defense Department to work with the Council of state governments to see that spouses when they're moving from one assignment to the other with their serving spouse can be quickly certified to do whatever it is that they're qualified to do in January in Missouri the first spouse coming to Fort Leonard Wood became was immediately sworn into the Missouri bar that had never happened before and whether you're a lawyer an electrician a health care provider a teacher a truck driver whatever you're certified to do the quicker states can do that the more appealing their military base becomes this bill encourages that and it should and I certainly hope my state is at the lead and certifying people to get to work at the skills they're able to get to work with at all levels but particularly moving military spouses

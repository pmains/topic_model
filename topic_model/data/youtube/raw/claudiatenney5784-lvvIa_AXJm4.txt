well thank you very much claudia and i'm sorry i'm a little bit late we had a big big gold star family event at the white house and they were just so fantastic they were so fantastic and i figured you'd understand if i was 10 minutes off because these people i want to listen to every one of their stories and it's it's sad and yet beautiful but the gold star family is incredible people and i just want to say a special hello to new york i hate to see what happens to new york with your democrat governor and your democrat mayor it's a disgrace what's going on is a disgrace but the republican areas are doing well the states the cities are doing better than ever before very very low crime we have uh big problems with democrats and that's what we're doing we're moving them out i'm thrilled to talk to you today about the critical decision voters are facing and going to face if you're unable to vote in person you can request your absentee ballot or we call it a solicited you solicit for the ballot they send it to you and you send it back but these other what they're trying to do with the other ballots unsolicited is ridiculous but absentee ballots are good but going out to vote is great so you know you'll make up your decision on that but i believe this is the most important election in the history of our country and i need every patriot of new york 22nd congressional district to get out and vote for claudia kenney she's an incredible person i got to know her very well she really is outstanding i think she was voted with me close to 100 of the time and it's called make america great again or america first it doesn't matter claudia is with us she's strong she's she's very very incredible just in every way i really i miss her and we need her back and we need her back as fast as we can get her she's an attorney a small business owner very successful a former member of congress as you know and also of the state assembly and the proud mother of a united states marine she'll vote to protect your jobs defend your second amendment which is under siege by the way it's under season and your section of the state which i know very well you got to have the second amendment 100 but they are going to if we didn't win this election you're going to lose your second amendment safeguard your social security strength in our military which i've done 2.5 trillion dollars we have a whole brand new the best in the world secure our borders rebuild our economy and hold china accountable for their lives and deception and congress claudia authored the bill to protect health care she's very very strong on health care coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions she was a strong supporter of our historic tax cuts which were the biggest in history and also went to small business a lot of cuts to small business including regulations and she was a great champion for the american workers fighting to bring jobs and factories back to the usa and because of what she did some of the incredible work you see them a lot of them are moving back right now claudia's opponent anthony brendisi is a puppet of nancy pelosi he's turned out to be a total disaster he's not for your new york he's for everything that you don't stand for and he's a member literally of the radical left brendisi pretends to be a moderate but he votes in lockstep with nancy pelosi more than 90 percent of the time brenda c is uh promised that he would vote against impeachment he said i'll never because i won that section of new york by a lot i won actually outside of the corps the middle i won by a lot upstate new york where they just have treated you so badly between all of the things they could be doing but uh just terrible but he promised that he would vote against impeachment in fact he almost sounded like he was a republican except for one problem he got down to washington he did everything that pelosi and schumer told him to do and then he betrayed the people of upstate new york by voting for the impeachment witch hunt three different times it's a disgrace i mean totally misrepresented and lied and he's ineffective nobody listens to him he's just an automatic puppet vote anthony brendisi and joe biden oppose america first agenda at every turn they opposed us at every single turn he voted for the democrats anti-police bill and would gut your local police department so take away your second amendment and gut your police department which is what he wants to do even marched alongside the radical anti-police protesters claudia tenney will never defund your police and like me she'll always stand with the heroes of law enforcement she's totally into the heroes of law enforcement and protecting them new york we need claudia attendee in congress fighting for our police and your safety your jobs your borders and your god-given rights including the right to keep and bear arms she's an incredible advocate she's really uh something very special she's a person who is very very special and special to me we need her in congress and i know she's going to make it she's leading in the polls and we have to make sure it stays that way so claudia i want to thank you for everything i want to thank you for doing this and you are going to be there for a long time and i'm going to get up to your district and we're going to say hello to everybody but in the meantime get out and vote and make sure that the name claudia tenney is on that ballot or going in person and vote you take care of yourselves and i'll see you soon i love new york

NOW MORE THAN 17 MILLION DOLLARS ARE COMING TO THE METRO AREA AND BATON ROUGE FOR SAFETY UPGRADES AND COMMUNITY PROJECTS . THE MONEY IS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SECURED BY IN PART CONGRESSMAN TROY CARTER FROM THIS DISTRICT HERE IN NEW ORLEANS.  CONGRESSMAN CARTER IS JOINING US TO EXPLAIN MORE ON WHERE THAT MONEY IS GOING, WHERE IT'S COMING FROM AND WHAT COMMUNITIES WILL BENEFIT THE MOST.  WE'LL ALSO TALK ABOUT UKRIAINE IN A COUPLE OF SECONDS.  CONGRESSMAN CARTER, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING.  ERIC, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  VERY PROUD TO TO ANNOUNCE THESE COMMUNITY PROJECTS WHICH WILL PROVIDE TREMENDOUS HELP TO OUR COMMUNITIES.  WE'VE GOT SIX MILLION DOLLARS SUJIN WATERBOARD.  WE KNOW HOW MUCH TROUBLE WE NEED THAT WE HAVE WITH THAT WASTEWATER STORMWATER IMPROVEMENTS SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR FROM OUR OMNIBUS BUDGET BILL, EIGHT DOLLARS MILLION FOR THE NEW ORLEANS CONVENTION CENTER FOR THE SANITARY SEWER AND STORMWATER PROJECTS, A MILLION DOLLARS FOR MENTAL HEALTH FOR THE CITY OF BATON ROUGE, TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR LSU HEALTH SCIENCES TO DO FURTHER COVID RESEARCH.  XAVIER UNIVERSITY WILL A TWO POINT FIVE DOLLARS MILLION TO CREATE A STEM CENTER AT ST. MIKE'S DORMITORY ON CAMPUS NINTH WARD STADIUM WHICH IS ONE THAT I'M PARTICULARLY PROUD OF IS TO CREATE AN ATHLETIC CENTER AND THE NINTH WARD WHICH WILL BE A DRAW TO ONE GIVE A BOOST IN THE ARM TO TO THE NINTH WARD TO CREATE CROSS REFERENCING OF NEIGHBORHOODS TO COME TOGETHER AND STOP OUR KIDS FROM HAVING TO TRAVEL SO FAR FOR ATHLETICS THIS PART OF THE WORLD WILL NOW HAVE ITS VERY OWN ATHLETIC STADIUM WHICH IS HUGE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR EASTERN NEW ORLEANS FOR MULTI-MODAL TRANSPORTATION UPGRADE AGAIN A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN EASTERN NEW ORLEANS, ONE THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR A COMMUNITY THAT IS RICH AND STRONG BUT NEEDS A SHOT IN THE ARM AND THEN OF COURSE THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR BELOVED WALDRIP PARK.  WE KNOW THAT WALDRIP PARK HAS BECOME A GREAT VENUE FOR FRENCH QUARTER FEST.  THE FRIED CHICKEN FESTIVAL FOR THE VARIOUS EVENTS ALONG THE RIVER >>.  IT'S ALSO REXON AND XULA BE DONE ON LUNDI >> GRAS AND ZULU LANDGRAB ABSOLUTELY.  SO THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO REVITALIZE THIS 30 YEAR OLD PART WITH SAFETY MOBILITY, ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF ALL OF THESE PROJECTS ARE INCREDIBLE.  THIS IS A 17 POINT ONE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT AND IF YOU ADD THE LAST TWO IT'S ACTUALLY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT THE 2ND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.  I'M VERY PROUD THAT WE'RE ABLE TO TO BRING THESE HOME.  >> AND IS THIS ALL PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, THE BIPARTISAN BILL THAT EVEN SOME IN LOUISIANA VOTED AGAINST?  WELL, ACTUALLY THIS ONE IS NOT A PART OF THE PARTIES THAT WE AT ONE POINT TWO TRILLION THAT WERE PART THAT'S A PART OF THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL . THIS IS A PART OF THE OMNIBUS BUDGET BILL WHERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY THOSE PROJECTS IN OUR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE MERIT IN THESE ALL HAVE STRONG MERIT.  THEY MADE IT THEIR WAY THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS, WERE ABLE TO TO DEFEND AND PRESENT THIS AND FINALLY SEE IT IN THE FINAL BUDGET WHICH NOW HAS BEEN SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT.  SO THESE DOLLARS ARE LOCKED IN AND COMING TO THE 2ND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.  AND SO >> THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE OF THE MONEY FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT WILL ALSO BE COMING TO LOUISIANA >> . THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT.  IT IS IN ADDITION TO WHICH IS AGAIN UNPRECEDENTED HISTORIC TIME A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR LOUISIANA THAT WE HAVE NEEDED DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AS PROVIDING RESOURCES.  THE NINTH WARD PARK I MEAN THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE ADVANCEMENT FOR THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS.  A MILLION DOLLARS FOR RESEARCH ON MENTAL HEALTH IN BATON ROUGE ,THE MULTI-MODAL TRANSPORTATION HUB EAST NEW ORLEANS INVESTING IN OUR UNIVERSITIES LSU, TULANE AND XAVIER.  THESE ARE ALL INVESTMENTS THAT WILL BRING INCREDIBLE RETURNS ON INVESTMENT FOR THE COMMUNITY . AND >> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE CAPITOL TODAY.  A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS WILL BE WE'LL BE WATCHING THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE TO ADDRESS THE JOINT SESSION ASKING FOR MORE HELP.  HE ADDRESSED THE PARLIAMENT IN CANADA YESTERDAY SAYING THAT THAT HIS COUNTRY NEEDS HELP AND HE TOLD THEM IMAGINE IF YOUR HOMES ARE BEING BOMBED AND STUFF LIKE THAT.  HOW MUCH MORE CAN NATO COUNTRIES IN THE U.S. DO FOR UKRAINE?  WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN AND WE ARE IN A VERY BIPARTISAN WAY OF WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT TO ADVANCE AS MANY RESOURCES AS WE CAN.  THE CONGRESS PASSED LAST WEEK A THIRTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR RELIEF PACKAGE IS BEING SET DIRECTLY TO THE UKRAINIANS . WE HAVE PUSHED TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE WE ARE NO LONGER PURCHASING OIL FROM FROM RUSSIA . WE'RE ALSO TOUGHENING OUR SANCTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CRIPPLE THEM ECONOMICALLY.  SO I THINK THE CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB WITHIN THE NATO PARTNERS TO KICK IN AND DO EVEN MORE AND WE CONTINUE TO LISTEN . TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM PRESIDENT ZELENSKY AND WHERE WE CAN LEND WEIGHT WE WILL THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHY ARE WE INVOLVED WHEN WE PROTECT OUR FOREIGN FLANKS, WE PROTECT OUR DOMESTIC FLANKS,  ITS IMPORTANT THAT AMERICA AS A WORLD POWER WEIGHS IN AND WE HOPE AND ACCOUNTABLE WE NOT ALLOW THIS KIND OF UNWARRANTED UNPROVOKED AGGRESSION TO GO UNCHECKED.  AND THERE HAS >> BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER THE POLAND'S OFFER TO SEND MIG FIGHTERS INTO UKRAINE BUT THROUGH A U.S. AIR BASE THE PRESIDENT IS NOT FOR THAT.  YESTERDAY SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY SAID HE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA THAT IT SHOULD HAPPEN ,HE SAID.  MR BIDEN THAT HE HAS A WISH RATHER THAN A BACKBONE.  WHAT ARE YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT ? WELL, I >> THINK THE TIME FOR FANCY QUIPS AND THOSE KIND OF ANTIDOTES ARE QUITE FRANKLY UNPRODUCTIVE.  WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IS SWINGING TOGETHER.  WE NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER ,NOT CRITICIZING AND FINDING CUTE SAYING WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO JOIN TOGETHER TO HELP OUR UKRAINIAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND PROVIDE RESOURCES AND FOR THE MOST PART IS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THAT.  WELL, THERE >> IS THIS BIPARTISAN ACROSS THE BOARD BUT I THINK AND TO SUGGEST WISHBONE VERSUS BACKGOUND, I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S THIS PLACE FOR THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS.  WE'RE TALKING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES.  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING RESOURCES.  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A UNIFIED CONGRESS.  WE ALL STOOD ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL LAST WEEK IN UNISON IN OUR SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE.  MANY OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE BROUGHT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WERE BROUGHT IN A BIPARTISAN WAY.  THE PRESIDENT HAS LISTENED AND ACTED.  I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY CRITICISM AT THIS POINT IS ANYTHING BUT BRINKSMANSHIP.  WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD THAT.  I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS STAND UNIFIED AS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SEND A MESSAGE TO PUTIN THAT WE WILL NOT SUPPORT HIS WAR, WE WILL NOT FUND YOUR WAR.  WE WILL STAND FIRMLY WITH OUR NATO PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS IN PLACE AND PROVIDE RESOURCES SO UKRAINIANS CAN ADEQUATELY DEFEND THEMSELVES.  AND >> QUICKLY BEFORE I LET YOU GO, CONGRESSMAN, YESTERDAY THE SENATE PASSED UNANIMOUSLY TO DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME PERMANENT.  DO YOU THINK CONGRESS WILL DO THE >> SAME?  YOU KNOW, I SURE HOPE SO.  I THINK THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S OUTDATED.  AS YOU KNOW, THIS WAS CREATED IN 1940 TO FOR REASONS THAT ARE NO LONGER NEEDED FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS.  I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO ADVANCE THIS ISSUE I'M VERY PROUD AND HAPPY THAT THE SENATE MOVED SO SWIFTLY WHICH PROVES THAT THEY CAN MOVE FAST WHEN THEY WANT TO AND NOW WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO FINALIZE THAT AND SEND TO THE PRESIDENT AND I'M HOPEFUL WE'LL DO JUST THAT >>.  AND IT WAS A UNANIMOUS VOTE YESTERDAY WHICH DOES NOT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.  ALL RIGHT.  NO, NO

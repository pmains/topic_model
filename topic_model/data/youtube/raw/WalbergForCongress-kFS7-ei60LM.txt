in these difficult times I'm reminded how blessed we are to live in a community like ours while we're doing our part to stop the coronavirus first responders medical professionals and essential workers are keeping our community going packing our groceries protecting our families and healing the sick they are the best of us and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude from the bottom of our heart thank you I'm Tim Walberg and I approve this message [Music]

thank you admiral i appreciate it very much i also enjoyed our conversation that we had uh before thanksgiving and uh congratulations on your nomination and i'm sure you're going to be confirmed sir without any problems with that oh i'd like to know a little bit you know first of all we do an awful lot of the training in west virginia and uh we have uh had a tremendous opportunity to to work with special ops and we're hoping that you're all looking into that that some of the other service branches of service can use or look at our state from the standpoint of the effectiveness and the cost effectiveness especially and the location being so close to uh to dc and i don't know if you've had a chance to visit some of the operations we have if not we'd like to bring you and show you what we uh have been able to develop here the server i have not had the opportunity to visit the facilities that you discussed but if confirmed would look forward to spending some time with those troops we'd love to get you out as quickly as we could so that'd be great uh i was pleased to read about that about the focus you have towards interoperability i know we touched on it briefly and this has been your advance questions interoperability with our allies is something that i'm sure that you spent quite a bit of time designing implementing as commander u.s fleet forces can describe some of those experiences and tell us uh how you plan to expand them uh with all of our allies yes senator thanks uh the the uh the key issue for me as the fleet forces commander or as sixth fleet uh and strike force nato was to build interoperability so that we could fight together but not interoperability for interoperability sake but interoperability for integration so that we could work better we could fight better uh together um uh immediately interoperability is one thing integration is where we need to go and uh and work and train together so if confirmed as the as the vice chairman it will be a high priority of me to work with our allies and partners on interoperability as it leads to integration and then our ability to fight and win together sir also cyber command space command are two of the combatant commands that influence nearly every weapon and support system in our inventory tell me if you will or your plan to resource each of them as the challenges and capabilities and these domain increases yeah sir thank you and um uh the working within the space domain is uh is absolutely critical and a very high priority it underpins everything we do as a military just as our military underpins what we need to do in space so if confirmed as the vice chairman space as a domain and it's important to recognize that it is a domain like everything else will be a high priority for us for me going forward if confirmed i'm going to ask you it's a hypothetical question because i know something might be a little bit out of your out of your domain but with what we see going on in china and taiwan and the south china sea and also we see going on now with russia ukraine do you have any comments or any thought pro thoughts on that that would be uh kind of helpful in our deliberations yes senator thank you i think um you know if you start in uh with russia and in crimea um and with ukraine it's a very dangerous and destabilizing situation that we're working our way through um it's important for us to ensure that uh we work with our nato uh partners um and uh continue to recognize the uh the challenges that are uh faced by um russian activity in that uh area of the world and then remain rock solid in our commitment to ukrainian sovereignty to ukrainian self-determination and their larger goals of ultimately perhaps moving forward with alliances and whatnot i think in the western pacific the challenges are uh are equally uh important as we have discussed that's the the pacing threat in the pacific and into pacom um and we're gonna have to meet those uh on a on a daily basis again two peer competitors we're gonna have to balance those going forward very quickly on the other one sir as a commander i'm interested to hear about any concerns you may have in logistical capabilities or the capacity to surge necessary combat power to any part of the region but if need in regions that if we needed to combat a north korean or a near peer aggression what would be your thoughts on that and how do you think we could meet those concerns yes sir um i think contested logistics is an incredibly important part of uh our theory of the fight going forward i think that's why we recognize that it is one of the four pillars of the new joint warfighting construct and so contested logistics whether it allows us to fight in uh in in korea or in the indo-pacific or even in europe um is uh is going to be incredibly important to what we do we're pretty good at logistics but there's room to improve and that's why it's such an important pillar of the joint warfighting construct let me thank you again for your service and also uh your continued willingness to serve and i look forward to voting for your confirmation so thank you i ask everything

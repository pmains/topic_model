  MINUTES. THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE  GENTLEWOMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA. MS. ROSS: MADAM SPEAKER, I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I MAY  CONSUME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MS. ROSS: MADAM SPEAKER, I RISE  TODAY TO URGE SUPPORT FOR MY  AMENDMENT. MY AMENDMENT TO THE PUMP ACT  WILL HELP ENSURE WOMEN HAVE  SUFFICIENT NOTICE OF THE NEW  PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO THEM IN  THIS BILL. BY ENSURING THAT ELIGIBLE PEOPLE ARE PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT  INFORMATIONAL RESOURCES, MORE  WOMEN WILL BE ABLE TO EXERCISE  THEIR RIGHTS AND THE LIKELIHOOD  OF EMPLOYER DEFECTION WILL BE  REDUCED. IN MANY PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY,  INCLUDING MY HOME STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, IT'S EASIER TO TAKE A  SMOKE BREAK THAN FOR A MOTHER TO TAKE A PUMP BREAK. THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. BY PASSING THE PUMP ACT, WE CAN  END THIS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST  BREAST-FEEDING WORKERS AND  GUARANTEE THAT NO MOTHER WILL  HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN EARNING A LIVING AND FEEDING HER CHILD. BUT A LAW IS ONLY AS EFFECTIVE  AS ITS ENFORCEMENT, AND WE HAVE  UNFORTUNATELY WITNESSED  COUNTLESS OCCASIONS WHERE  BUSINESSES HAVE FAILED TO INFORM WORKERS OF THEIR RIGHTS. IN JUST THIS LAST YEAR, THE  DEPARTMENT OF LABOR INVESTIGATED SIX BUSINESSES IN NORTH CAROLINA FOR VIOLATIONS OF BREAST-FEEDING RIGHTS UNDER THE FAIR LABOR  STANDARDS ACT. MY AMENDMENT WOULD PROVIDE THE  NECESSARY INFORMATION TO ENSURE  THESE WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS DO  NOT CONTINUE. WE OWE IT TO OUR NURSING  MOTHERS, THEIR FAMILIES, AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE VIGILANT ABOUT OVERSEEING THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LAW. THIS IS A GENDER EQUALITY ISSUE, A LABOR RIGHTS ISSUE, AN  ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE, AND IT  DEMANDS OUR ATTENTION. I ALSO SEEK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THE RECORD LETTERS  FROM THE DIRECTOR OF LA LECHE  AND THE NATIONAL W.I.C.  ASSOCIATION.

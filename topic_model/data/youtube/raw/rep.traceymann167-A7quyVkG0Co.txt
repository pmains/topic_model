i believe strongly that we should be in washington dc right now uh sitting around the table having this conversation or wait ten days till we come back but since we're not i decided to drive to a sorghum field in my district my district the big first of kansas is the number one sorting producing district in the country we're also number one for wheat production we're number one for beef production i did 63 town halls all over my district every one of my counties this summer the elimination of the stepped up basis came up every single time and mr chairman respectfully i just heard you a few minutes ago say you were willing to do everything you could to make sure we preserve the stepped-up basis this is a great opportunity for you and every member of this committee to be on record being willing to protect congressman man members please please when you're not on and speaking keep your phones muted please okay thank you go ahead you know i'm a fifth generation kansan uh i grew up on my family farm the house that i grew up in is the house that my parents still live in today and is the home that my great great grandfather ordered from montgomery award catalog in the night the early 1900s my brother now farms full-time with my dad for our family the farm is the way of life and that's the case for thousands of farm families across my district and tens of thousands across the country families rely on the land and their crops for livestock for their livelihoods so when we talk about eliminating protections for the very people who feed and fuel and clothe all of us we're taxing those very people again and again and again on the same property like this field i'm standing in that's been in their family for generations we better believe that it's going to get heated and personal this change doesn't change the game for agriculture it ends the game for tens of thousands of farmers my amendment would establish the sense of this committee to protect farmers and ranchers and producers from the looming tax burdens that we are sure to see in this reconciliation bill the amendment is based largely on the language from a letter that many members of this committee sent to other congressional leaders to make the proposed ag exemption to the new stepped-up bases taxes a full exemption simply put don't tax our farmers and ranchers and their generational property over and over and over again don't destroy their livelihoods we should have their backs and these are the people that this committee should be protecting defending and working to represent make an exception for them keep the 2018 farm bill's definition of family farm to include nieces and nephews and first cousins alongside spouses and children we all know family farmers who have various family situations this makes common sense permit common farming practices like leasing land without additional taxes to family members and non-family members provide equal treatment to all heirs regardless of their on-the-farm status do not impose the deferred tax obligation for any eligible error i urge you to support my amendment please this is the very least that we can do mr chairman i also ask that the letter from several of our democratic colleagues to congressional leadership regarding their opposition to additional farm taxes like these be submitted into the record this is an opportunity for everyone on this committee to be on record to say that they are for preserving the stepped-up basis it's time to put words into action and send a resounding message to the rest of this congress to the ag industry and to the senate that the house ag committee strongly opposes unanimously opposes changing the stepped-up basis

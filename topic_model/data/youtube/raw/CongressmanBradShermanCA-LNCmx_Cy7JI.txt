today's hearing examines the administration's budget request for South Asia and our interests in the region we look forward to hearing from ambassadors wells MS steel and MS Friedman I'll introduce them at the end of my opening remarks in the four years from 2014 to 2017 our annual aid to South Asia averaged 2.2 billion dollars this included 1 billion for Afghanistan and nearly 800 million for Pakistan but our 2018 budget for South Asia has dropped almost in half and the FY 2020 budget is proposed at 1 billion dollars including half a billion or a bit more than that for Afghanistan and 70 billion for Pakistan this is a dramatic reduction in our efforts will be interesting to hear from our witnesses whether South Asia is dramatically less important to us than it was a few years ago as to India we have a strategic partnership in the indo-pacific I'm working to strengthen that relationship is co-chair of the India caucus our partnership is built around common democratic values Arak our economic relations and our strategic interests and of course there have been several steps forward in the area of joint naval exercises whether it be US India or US Japan India we do have a 24 billion dollar trade deficit with India I look forward to hearing from our witnesses how we're going to open India's markets you know India is going to open its markets so that American exports will increase as to Pakistan USAID projects of covered energy agriculture education and health sectors there's a small but growing middle class civil society independent judiciary and we've had to elected changes in government at least in the what should I say official government as opposed to whatever role in government the military plays beyond what's set forth in the Constitution that being said our aid to Pakistan less than a decade ago was 2 billion a year or now have cut it to 70 million I don't if I did the math quickly I'd just say that's under 5 you know that's a 95% reduction roughly Pakistan I think is very important to the security the United States there are those the things that argue that Pakistan is important because it's close to Afghanistan and I think it's just the reverse it's true that looking at history looking at 2001 Afghanistan suddenly became critical to our national security and the fact that al-qaeda was able to operate there when devastating effects on our country but looking forward it's clear that Pakistan will have a much bigger impact on on the United States and of course is a nuclear country with a nuclear weapons state with a growing nuclear arsenal I'm I want to hear about what we're doing with regard to forced conversions particularly in southern Pakistan where young girls are in effect kidnapped forced to convert and then first to Islam and then forced to marry the and I'll want to focus on human rights in Pakistan as a whole and particularly in Sindh province and of course Pakistan giving safe haven to terrorists that attack Afghanistan and India now given the importance of Pakistan I don't think there's anything more important than our public broadcasting to the people of Pakistan we have broadcast over only in one Pakistani language push pushed on which is both a Pakistani and an Afghan language leaving out the many tens of millions of Pakistanis that speak Cindy I've offered an amendment which is pending on the floor and my staff may have pulled me out of this room and if so it's for a good reason one that I'm sure all of our witnesses will agree with and that is to increase the budget of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty so that they can begin a Sindhi language service whether we'll be able to get them the full million and a half that they've said they wanted for a 24-hour service or whether it will be less will depend upon the legislative process so whether we get anything will depend upon the legislative process but given Pakistan's you mean Pakistan is for example the only state with nuclear weapons that has experienced a military coup and I'll turn to the historians on our panel to tell me just how many military coups Pakistan has had but that's one hundred percent of all the military coos in all nuclear States so we do need to reach out to the people of Pakistan and I'm by no means sure that the 70 million dollars we're spending is sufficient further I'll point out that the big thing we're doing for Pakistan is the IMF loan while our aid is 70 million the IMF loan is 6 billion and of course I don't think that could have happened without the United States and I hope that I'll be told by our witnesses that when Treasury's over there at the if they aren't just checking the boxes for fiscal purposes but are in fact taking policy direction from the State Department in Afghanistan we've given 130 billion in security and development assistance as 2001 the conflict continues the Taliban finds safe havens in Pakistan one of the reasons for this is because Pakistan fears a united Afghanistan that might make claims on its territory particularly at a time when Pakistan might be preoccupied with India the way to make Pakistan calmer and more solidly in favor of a peaceful strong and prosperous Afghanistan is to gain international recognition from the Durand Line I'll discuss with our witnesses what we can do at the United Nations to get a the entire world to recognize the Durand Line and to make it plain to Afghanistan and Pakistan that their border is that line and that they can live in peace without either side it was particularly without Afghanistan looking for an opportunity to expand its territory as for Sri Lanka we all express our deepest condolences to those affected by the tragic Easter Sunday terrorist attacks these attacks took place 10 years after Sri Lanka ended its civil war and I hope that these attacks will not impede the reconciliation efforts between the Celanese and Tamil communities as to democracy development and burden-sharing our foreign aid has supported development in the Maldives which might be the first nation submerged if we don't do something about global warming and global climate change Nepal and Bangladesh and I want to commend Bangladesh for hosting hundreds of thousands of Renga from named neighboring Myanmar as I've said in this room before if Mai and Mar or Burma is unwilling or unable to to be a good government for the Rohingya people that live in North Rakhine State then we should transfer and the United States should support the transfer than that portion of that state to Bangladesh which is willing to accommodate the people the people the Ranga people of North through kind state deserve a government that tries to protect them not destroy them overall our aid can consolidate democracy and advance development across South Asia Freedom House scores the region at 3.7 on a scale of one to seven where one is the highest this is better than the 4.8 score of Southeast Asia but the per capita income from South Asia's only $6,700 measures in purchasing power and which is 40% less than Southeast Asia's so there is much development work to be done in South Asia in recent years Australia and Canada have annually given 200 million Japan gave nearly 600 million to European countries have disbursed apparently 3 billion dollars to South Asia I encourage our allies to continue that element of burden-sharing as we of course carry the lion's share of the load when it comes to defense expenditures with that I'll see whether there are other members of the subcommittee wishing to make an opening statement mr. Pirie well with that we'll start with our witnesses will start with Ambassador Alice Wells the former US ambassador to Jordan who has headed the South Asia Bureau at the State Department for two years as acting assistant secretary of course our committee has been urging for the last over two years the administration to actually have permanent people in the positions and I know that the party line of the administration is you don't need permanent people but I I think we do I'm not saying that ambassador wells wouldn't be the perfect permanent assistant secretary but the idea that you can operate the executive branch without appointing people getting them confirmed and filling the positions is absurd that being said what we also will hear from Ms Gloria Steele who is acting assistant administrator for the bureau for Asia at the US Agency for International Development USAID and then finally we'll hear from Miss Karen Freeman who is assistant to the administrator for the office of Afghanistan and Pakistan Affairs again at USAID ambassador wells I want to thank all of our witnesses I'll now recognize myself for five minutes ambassador wells how important is for us to reach out to the people of Pakistan in the languages they actually speak in their home particularly in the language of Sindh I'm very important sir and we do our Karachi consulate have programming in Sindhi language to the 50 million person audience in that region we also have local staff whether it's in Karachi or elsewhere in country that are engaged in Sindhi language outreach so you're able to reach people by sending speakers out by convening meetings but if we did broadcasting in Sindy we'd be able to reach all 50 million people I hope you support that effort for the record we appreciate additional efforts to for of outreach in Pakistan now the big issue the big ad we're here talking about 70 million for Pakistan the big issue is the the IMF loan looks like that is going through ambassador wills does Treasury just do what they want for checking off some economic boxes or since this is the single most important thing we do with regard to Pakistan do they do they listen to you [Music] yes there's a discussion about the conditionality that we think would be appropriate for an IMF package to Pakistan we've not seen the IMF package yet we understand that there's been an agreement reached between the IMF and Government of Pakistan but certainly we have communicated our strong views and secretary Pompeo has also done so publicly on the need for any package to include a real structural reform to reinforce if I can interrupt what about dr. Afridi can we should we block this IMF loan until dr. Afridi his family are free here in the United States we believe dr. Afridi is being held wrongly inappropriately with Congress's help we have withheld a hundred and thirty million dollars in assistance to Pakistan already as a result of his incarceration and we continue to raise dr. Afridi's case but we're letting them get the what they really want which is the six billion from the IMF and if they default on that the American taxpayers lose well over a billion I have we offered any prisoner exchange for example dr. US Siddiqui who I know is cooperated in terrorism but is still given dr. Afridi's critical role are we negotiating are we seeking to negotiate with Pakistan some sort of prisoner release we have not offered a prisoner exchange for dr. Afridi dr. Afridi is being held wrongly he's not guilty of any terrorism charges um almost every prisoner exchange when we exchange spies with the Soviets the spies that we gave up were people working for communism and the people we got back were people working for freedom by our ball rights they should have been freed anyway I would hope that as another committee looks at those who are the first responders on at 9/11 that you would do more to get dr. Afridi released and make more can offer more on the plus side even if it's unjust and withhold on the other side because who's going to help her help America stop terrorism as long as dr. freeze in jail in I've talked before about the missing persons and forced disappearances particularly religious minorities in the Sindh province of Pakistan a I'll ask both well I'll ask all of our witnesses to what extent do we bring up these human rights issues and our interactions with Pakistani officials misdeal and and if and if it's ms Friedman who pretty much deals with the back then I'll just miss Friedman USAID root means concerned about all of the reports on human rights violations and not only do we raise that with the government officials but we also try to encourage the new initiatives with the with the government of Pakistan and strengthen civil society to that end thank you my time is expired my list of questions is not now go to a second round I believe everyone here has asked one round of questions this will her investor rules I didn't promise you you could get by with just one round the current Sri Lankan government came to power with overwhelming support in the Tamil community the government has disappointed many in the Tamil community as far as its dedication to justice peace and reconciliation there's little movement on a federal constitution giving autonomy to the Tamil regions and of course much more needs to be done on accountability for human rights violations that have occurred during the civil war and especially its last phases the Sri Lankan military and this is probably the most important aspect continues to hold on to civilian lands in Tamil areas and of course the longer that's delayed the the longer they delay the return of that land the more likely it is that the perm that the military occupation becomes permanent what you know will we continue to press the government of Sri Lanka on these issues of reconciliation with the Tamil community and especially the need to for the military to give up land that it is occupying yes and we invited the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister and foreign secretary here to Washington for a strategic dialogue and that was very much a part of the dialogue we welcome the fact that Sri Lanka you know has co-sponsored the UN Human Rights Commission resolution extending the international monitoring of its commitments to human rights reconciliation justice and accountability the progress has been slower than we would like to see I'll count on you to continue to to make that a priority for us what level of aid have we provided for the Ringo refugees in Bangladesh yeah miss Steele the the total amount of funding for the Rue Inga's both in black Burma and Bangladesh is approximately five hundred million dollars to date starting in seven 2017 so that's five hundred million a year no five hundred million since 2017 since 2017 so the and with the administration budget request what would it be if the coming fiscal year a significant amount of the funding that goes to the ringa is a humanitarian assistance which is not included in the budget that you have reviewed it's not included in the in the in the budget that we are discussing it is for use for USAID it's part of our office of foreign disaster assistance and food for Peace which is separate from the budget that we would I realize it's outside the purview of your agency do you happen to know what it is can you give us a number or oh I'm not I'm not aware of what the number is for budget outside of I'll have to put it together obviously Bangladesh is a poor country and has taken in people that would otherwise be not only ethnically cleansed but subject to genocide and I realized that well I believe ambassador wells your purview does not extend to my and marver ma no but the question I have and I guess this affects your purview is whether the United States will take the position that if the government of Burma Myanmar does not extend citizenship and protection to the Rohingya who were born there that we would support the transfer of North cracklin state to Bangladeshi sovereignty that's right on the border literally of your jurisdiction well I won't speak for my colleagues but uh I think it's as a traditional position of the State Department that we support the territorial Haggerty of countries the people of South Sudan or subject to horrific treatment by the Khartoum government we were in effect the midwives for the creation of an independent South Sudan and I won't say that that's worked out well but we did support the creation of an independent state when a government in Khartoum could not what we've what we focused on is you know can we get the conditions in Myanmar's so you can have ranga go and look and see what their neighborhoods look like are the conditions such that they have confidence in returning you know how can those it then in this is citizen join a citizenship and passports part of that the UN reports recommendations listed you know citizenship as one of the key issues that would help restore confidence I think right now you the Ranga would like to return home if the conditions support a dignified return and for those countries that are working in Myanmar and supporting the Myanmar government is then how do we get them um our government I would say if the Myanmar government doesn't announce that it is dedicated to the protection of these people and the issuance of citizens and documents that we alter our position and call for the transfer of north rakhine state to to a country that will protect these people this is their land they've lived there for generations that they and they've been subject to ethnic cleansing and one might say attempted genocide certainly if you lay that out compared to the facts of South Sudan a change in international borders would be called for the government of Khartoum never denied the citizenship of the people of South Sudan Oh turn to miss Steele what steps can USAID and the State Department take to partner with the charitable efforts of the South Asian Diaspora community in the United States to help the people of South Asia howdy how can you work with the the large and generous Diaspora community we have been working with them particularly with the Indian diaspora in order to identify area and they had expressed has the highest maternal and child mortality happens in India and some of the high most polluted cities in the world are in India and so we have agreed to work together our proposed plan to create foundation the us-india foundation using Indian private sector is intended to catalyze and mobilize Indian resources to address our joint interests in development I thank you and we often hear in Washington of public-private partnerships when I hear that phrase I get concerned that maybe the deal is too good for private investors seeking a profit but in the case we're talking about here we're talking about a public-private partnership with charitable intent and with that I'll recognize the ranking member thank you

tell me more joining us now is congressman adam schiff of california member of the january 6 investigation chairman of the house intelligence committee sir i know this is cramming night uh thank you for making time to be here i really appreciate it you bet first let me ask you for an on-air fact check am i correct uh in telling our audience tonight that the focus tomorrow will largely be the pressure on individual states to overthrow their election results including that bizarre set of forgeries those fake trump electors yes that's exactly right and i think you set up the sequence in its right order we heard about the pressure campaign in our last hearing directed at the vice president how that campaign put his life in jeopardy how it was premised on a completely unconstitutional theory uh and argument uh and now you will hear about the pressure campaign directed at state legislators at state elections officials even at local elections workers putting their lives very much at risk and this was i think really unprecedented in u.s history this broad effort to overturn a presidential election and you'll see just what the weight of the presidency brought down on these officials you told the la times a little bit more about what to expect in terms of tomorrow and i was struck by the idea of trump's individual involvement in the fake elector plot i think as those of us as just members of the public members of the media watching these hearings one of the things that's been hard to discern is how much the president was initiating some of these ideas how much the president was simply receptive to any idea that might allow him to hold on to power how much the president was being critical at all in terms of what he was being told was the fake elector plot something that the president took an active role in or was it carried out on his behalf by others he knew about it but didn't necessarily advance it himself tomorrow we'll be showing some of the evidence of the president's role in this whole scheme of pressuring state legislators to overturn the election now this scheme was illegitimate from the beginning donald trump lost these states the whole effort to pressure these state legislatures and legislators was premised on a big lie about massive fraud that didn't exist trying to get these legislatures to go into session or decertify the win for joe biden and certify electors for him or send these fake electors to washington all of that was illegitimate and we'll explore the role that was played by the president by his campaign by lawyers and present some of the evidence that we've accumulated that explains how that plot to pressure these legislative officials took place and what it did to turn their lives upside down you're a former federal prosecutor yourself because we're now venturing into the part of the committee's investigation the part of your findings that is definitely territory that we know is also the subject of criminal investigation both at the state level at least in georgia and at the federal level with the deputy attorney general saying publicly that some of these matters are under federal investigation by justice department prosecutors are you taking steps do you need to take steps to make sure that both investigations yours on the committee and those happening in terms of the criminal law are insulated from one another and that neither investigation does any harm to the other we are very conscious of the fact that there may be other criminal investigations going on our other investigations going on we want to make sure that yes we are very careful that what we do doesn't interfere with what they're doing uh and uh and also that where they have a need for information we can help them provide it but look we have a obligation in congress as barbara mcwade was pointing out quite independent of the justice department or other prosecutors and that is to protect our democracy and our institutions uh we couldn't very well sit for a year and a half and not investigate an attack on the legislative branch so the work we're doing is very important we hope it will be of great value to the american people and we're doing everything we can to make sure that we are complementary to the efforts of the justice department or other prosecutorial agencies and not in conflict one last question for you sir i know that you're not going to talk about individual negotiations around individual witness testimony but should the public expect that it is a real possibility that vice president pence may end up in that in that witness chair that of course would be sort of a qualitatively different moment uh in terms of public accountability here is that a live possibility i don't know how what you know how to gauge the likelihood uh he is someone that we have expressed interest and want to talk to there are others some very high profiles some not so high profile that we continue to have an interest in uh whether we'll be able to get them before the committee at this point i can't say but we are continuing to encourage frankly anyone with relevant information to come forward we've been the beneficiary of a great many tips from the american people and we continue to urge people to follow the courageous example of other witnesses that you see appearing before the congress and that you'll see tomorrow vice president pence call the tip line congressman adam schiff democrat of california remember the january 6 investigation chair of the intelligence committee sir good luck tomorrow we'll all be watching thank you

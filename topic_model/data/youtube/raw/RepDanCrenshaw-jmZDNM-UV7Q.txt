Houston is one of the largest human trafficking hubs in the United States that's why in October I hosted a human trafficking symposium to bring awareness to this atrocity human trafficking is an issue that many see is something terrible that only occurs in developing countries we never think that this horrible crime could happen here in America much less than our own communities but sadly human trafficking does happen regularly in America and especially in Houston at this human trafficking symposium experts explained how to identify and prevent human trafficking as well as how we can help the victims of this horrible crime by empowering people with the knowledge to recognize and address the signs of human trafficking we can save victims lives and put a stop to this horrible crime once and for all and we have to had a really bad run and I became a victim of this terrible something and I know that it's called the climate change trafficking I was a victim of it I wasn't crazy it didn't just all happen in my hand and maybe with this experience taking over I'm trying to give back you don't go out there and be proactive and find them then we can't help and so that again is the big reason I think we're successful is because we do a lot of these but are smelling large-scale this small scale operation and education is key so not just educating our communities on the crime but also educating each other on what resources are out there so it's really going to take all of us to come together not just law enforcement not just prosecutors and victim services but the community to bond together to fight this really trying you

thank you miss bass Thank You mr. chairman and thank you administrator green it's good to see what the committee and really appreciate your leadership at USAID I wanted to ask you about a couple of countries in Africa Sudan 30 years after taking power in a coup President Bashir now faces an unprecedented challenge to his regime as protesters continue a peaceful resistance movement now almost 4 months old in response the government has arrested several thousand people in further restricted political space while US assistance in Sudan is restricted Congress has long supported USA IDs effort to mitigate conflict and promote more inclusive and participatory government governance the administration's fiscal year 2020 requests proposes a major cut to such programs eliminating conflict mitigation and stabilization funding and cutting democracy and governance by 30 percent what impact would these proposed cuts have on the ability of the u.s. to support Sudan's opposition and civil society in their effort to encourage political reforms Thank You congresswoman as always it is great to engage with you on Africa I'm well aware of the love you have for the continent what's going on in Sudan is heartbreaking it just as deeply heartbreaking as you know us the IDS piece of the five track approach is humanitarian access for refugees and IDPs as well as some aspects of human rights protection and what has happened is obviously a setback in in so many ways and as I said it's it's deeply disturbing there are things that Sudan needs to do this straight up that the government must take on and I think it's fair to say that we have constantly impressed upon them the need for creating constructive engagement as opposed to what they're doing with transparency because if they don't address that it's very difficult to foresee a better relationship and a brighter path for the country well let me just ask because the the funding cuts as I understand them and maybe I'm misunderstanding impact our support to Sudan's opposition and civil society so I know you know if we're gonna go in a direction to have to enter into Phase two I wasn't even referring to that I was really referring to our support for democratic reforms and cutting those resources well as a general matter across the continent very obviously tough choices are being made we will do everything we can to make those dollars go as far as we can effectively and efficiently as to the particular implications for Sudan quite frankly I'll have to get back to you and make sure that we briefed your staff I'm just not familiar enough with the details okay and the next was about power Africa power Africa 2.0 which launched last year is an updated strategy to improve energy access in Africa and I wanted to know how this version differs from the administration's work in the past power Africa 2.0 I think is applying the lessons that we've learned in terms of the need for a better enabling environment so the greatest thing about power Africa has been how opportunistic it is in the sense of closing identifying and closing deals rapidly in 2.0 as much as anything we're working more broadly to provide or to push for the kinds of reforms to the enabling environment that opened the door for more investment which will allow us to have our greater impact across the continent so it's it's taking the opportunism that we've we've seen in applying it more broadly by applying the lessons that we've learned as to what a country needs to have available if American private investment is going to be able to take advantage of and then maybe in the last few seconds I know you were addressing the Ebola crisis that's happening in the DRC and perhaps you can expand on that what are we doing to get resources there in terms of what we're trying to do again working closely with CDC and trying to reinforce the Ministry of Health I've been in constant contact with dr. Ted gross at the World Health Organization urging a more aggressive vaccination approach which i think is called for in terms of the resort financial resources it actually isn't a fiscal issue there there's an there's sufficient money for fighting Ebola in DRC however with the vaccines that we have available to produce more takes 8 to 10 months and so we're urging a more aggressive approach not only in potentially Geographic vaccinations but also rebuilding supplies we have we have plenty of supplies currently available but with this new flare-up that we've seen we think more aggressive vaccination is called for and therefore that we need to see more advanced purchases to rebuild those supplies the

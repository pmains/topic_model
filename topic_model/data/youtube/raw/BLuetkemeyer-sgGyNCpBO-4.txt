hi mrs. Connolly primero no additional a buzz thanks for joining us this week this week I'll talk to us to what about some of the discussions has been going on regards to tax extensions of the tax cuts that were put in place in 2001 2003 coming for to the bush tax cuts a lot of discussion is focusing on where we need to go how much we need to what level do you need to put them in place the bottom line is everybody deserves to routine the minutes in their pocket you around here is from the administration money in your pocket is there money it's not I think that's a huge problem I think we saw that with the discussion this past week with regards to comment president made with regards to small businesses not being responsible for their own success I think that is negative it because of his attitude and his understanding its philosophy that the money in your pocket is there's the government therefore Bay the government where we haven't been able to produce the rover's of bridges because it was their money to begin with which you all know as much a nonsense but the bottom line is that the discussion on taxes is very real into the year they're going to expire in those tax cuts are not just tax rates also in those to all those tax bills are things that affected many other ways to people the rare spent leaves in their long-term capital gains is in there Altair Amendment taxes in there the child tax credits in there as well as estate tax which is a huge issue our farmers and our small business people especially so these are all things that while the administration will talk about rates while these things are very important to our families into our businesses to our job creators to be able to enable them to be able to live their lives with the monies that they earn our provide jobs and keep their business going they work their life to put together so where we're going to be working on these issues over the next several months just want to give you some information on today you know if these tax extensions are not made it's a five hundred billion dollar tax increase and the average person in our district would have a twenty 420 420 for dollar tax bill so they're very impactful we want to stop them we want to find a way to extend them as are as they are really are perhaps like a permanent if possible because people the money in your pocket is yours see you next week take care

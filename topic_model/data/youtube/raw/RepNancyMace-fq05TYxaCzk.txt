[Music] joining us now south carolina congresswoman nancy mace is back with us it's great to have you back on congressman thanks for joining us okay we know a lot of spending is going on republicans now plan to send president biden a 1 trillion dollar infrastructure offer it same seems like six trillion seven trillion in new biden spending we have three obama officials slamming biden's policies gina mccarthy larry summers and jason furman so what do you say to that i can't believe i'm going to say this right now but i'm in total agreement with former obama administration officials the biden presidency his administration has been hijacked by nancy pelosi's party the far left wing of the democrat party what they're saying is true his economic policy right now is his breaking his promise not to raise taxes he's going to raise taxes it's all affecting everyday americans at the gas station at the grocery store groceries are up over 20 percent sugars up over 50 percent you want to build a house or develop a piece of property lumber is up over 300 percent right now the cost of inflation we're starting to feel it in our pocketbooks so we have democrat larry summers he's obama's former treasury secretary to your point he's saying inflation is here first quarter seven and a half percent annualized that's big that's a tax on the middle class he's saying democrats could lose because inflation fueled and led to the elections of former president richard nixon in 1968 and former president ronald reagan in 1980 is that is it that big of a threat right now i think i think it's a huge threat and i do see comparisons between former president jimmy carter and and president joe biden i think that that is that is a serious i believe that analogy is correct when we're looking at the economic situation that we're in right now if you look at the rise in our debt 28 children trillion alone right now they're saying their debt is going to exceed the size of the economy by 107 percent this year i mean that's that's enormous that's debilitating and worse yet they want to keep on putting these huge massive trillion dollar proposals together and have the largest tax hike in american history to pay for all of this and compounded on the american people you know stanley druckenmiller and other wall street pros stanley drucker and miller you got to listen to him he made the right profitable bet on the on the euro excuse me great britain sterling leaving the european exchange rate mechanism in 92. i know that sounds wacky but what it means is what they're talking about is the u.s dollar loses its reserve global reserve status around the world because the people are saying hey listen u.s treasuries are not going to be a safe asset anymore with all this money printing and borrowing so that means the us won't be able to borrow more cheaply than other countries uh something we've enjoyed since world war ii because buying is destroying the credibility of the dollar with higher inflation do you know what i mean so in other words after world war ii the u.s was pumping out their factories the dollar became the global reserve currency could we lose that status absolutely and guess who that helps when we devalue the dollar if that happens we're going to help our adversaries in china and russia we're going to give them a leg up when that happens and you look at our spending right now 28 trillion dollars in debt our deficit is 3 trillion and counting the the federal reserve is going to print at least four trillion dollars this year adding to our inflation what was this this is a real threat and it's a threat to our national security as well quite frankly all right congresswoman mace thanks for joining us it's good to see you come back soon thank you

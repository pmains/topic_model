your your reaction to the developments that we picked up in the last 30 minutes here I will I'm looking forward to learning what that evidence is we still have a lot of questions that we as a nation are trying to get answers to the families trying to get answers to as to what happened who ordered it who was there where is the body now and it is a dialogue with Saudi Arabia we have you know it's related to finding out facts we also need to confront Saudi Arabia on the fact that it doesn't seem like they are being truthful there they're not being upfront and honest the RET we also have to be cognizant of the fact that the rest of the world is watching so when we get tested American resolve gets tested other nations are watching how we react to it so if Saudi Arabia if all the facts line up and they're responsible for what took place at that consulate you don't want other nations to be feeling emboldened to carry out attacks like this as well and it's a you know similar point to what we saw in the UK where Russia used an agent that is in violation of of an international treaty where the the world United States the UK other nations took actions and sanctions against Russia we need to get to the bottom of the facts first and foremost but when we move past it we need to be cognizant not only of dealing with what took place here but also understand the rest of the world is watching and we can't have other nations emboldened which is why we have seen such a strong response already we just played the sound for Lindsey Graham from this morning you just heard from the former ambassador to Saudi Arabia and here's Marco Rubio responding to if they did this here's what happens to our relationship going forward senator Rubio I think the bigger issue here becomes the role they play in our Middle Eastern strategy in the administration and I think wisely he that had built them as a key linchpin against Iran and their ambitions and their in their expansion in the region that's endangered now if they did this it makes it impossible for us to work with them closely in the short term until something's done about it are you with all that congressman yeah there's a huge trust issue right now I don't believe what Saudi Arabia would be telling us on key items right now they can't tell us the truth here on what took place with the entire world watching just over the course of the last few days so in working with a partner whether it is a friend of our country where our greatest adversary and many in between I would say that our relationship with Saudi Arabia takes a hit because we can't trust that Saudi Arabia is going to be honest with us on some of these other issues now Saudi Arabia does have an important role to play in combating Iranian aggression in the Middle East they have an important role to play with regards to related to that that desire to combat Iranian aggression they've they and other nations are looking at is Israel more friendly so hopefully there's a path forward but we can't look three steps ahead you know to that point where we just don't have accountability just as truth and honesty for something very wrong that took happen in it that took place and it also was in violation of our ideals and what is what is right in this world because you have a journalist who is speaking out against serious violations of their own government and whether it's the United States Saudi Arabia or anywhere around the world when you have that truth to power to bring a better future for your people you should not be losing your life as a result in the worst extreme so we need to send a very strong message from that standpoint to protect the right of the media speaking out and accountability against human rights violations and more

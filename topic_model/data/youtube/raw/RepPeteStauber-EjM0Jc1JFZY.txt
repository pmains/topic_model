hey everyone my name is congressman pete sauber and i have the privilege of representing Minnesota's eighth congressional district we all know that America's workers and farmers can compete with anyone in the world so long as there's a level unfair playing field unfortunately for too long unfair trade deals have put our workers at a competitive disadvantage the u.s. MCA in its current form will address these long-standing trade imbalances and deliver a win for those working in Minnesota's mines factories as well as our farmers and ranchers who want to export more of their products I look forward to passing the u.s. MCA and ushering in a new era of job creation in northeastern Minnesota

now to campaign 2022 a new poll gives governor hokel plenty to worry about she's got the lowest job performance rating since she took office cbs 2's political reporter marcia kramer joins us with the latest marcia dickenelis today's poll has energized governor hulkel's opponents and with the primary just over two months away they smell blood in the water and are trying to capitalize on it governor hochul was roundly applauded by a hometown buffalo crowd where she talked about her budget i feel like i just scored a game-winning touchdown with that kind of applause but a new siena poll makes it seem like she was stopped at the goal line at least for now voters turning thumbs down on her job performance only 36 percent have a positive opinion of how she's doing 69 percent give her poor marks on fighting crime 63 percent give her a negative rating on addressing economic issues and 65 percent say she hasn't restored trust in government and while 67 percent of voters approve of her changes to bail reform they don't think it will work 38 percent say the changes will have no effect on the crime rate just 32 percent say it will decrease crime 16 percent say changing the law will increase crime kathy hokel the unelected governor has now demonstrated clearly that she's unelectable the poll giving kathy hokel's democratic primary opponents congressman tom swazi and public advocate jahmani williams an opening to attack the governor on a host of issues from picking recently indicted lieutenant governor brian benjamin as her running mate pushing through a sweetheart deal to build a new stadium for the buffalo bills and for not getting the legislature to pass a stronger bail reform bill everybody who's done a deep dive analysis show that it's going to affect a very very small amount of crimes we need to give judges the discretion to consider dangerousness i believe what the poll says is that new yorkers are really tired of the status quo and how alden works and i will tell you the democratic party has had a problem dealing with that reality and the republican party has not governor holcol defended her bail reform package saying that it added a number of violent crimes hate crimes and gun offenses to the list of those where judges could set bail there are a lot of crimes that were just falling between the cracks where people would commit a crime and because of the laws we're able to return out to the streets awaiting trial with something known as an appearance ticket which is a parking ticket well one of the most troubling things for democrats is that 45 percent of voters say the vote for someone else in november if hoku wins her party's primary that could be a huge advantage for whoever wins the republican primary dick and ellis june is coming quickly june is coming quickly and probably it's going to be difficult to make up some of those numbers yeah she's got to move quickly thanks marcia thank you marcia next mill

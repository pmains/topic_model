like many of my colleagues i've traveled to the southwest border and seen the work the border patrol agents do on a daily basis an unbelievable task we've heard statistics of border security operations under your leadership versus previous dhs secretaries during the month of march there were 220 000 encounters at the southwest border 220 000 as secretary of homeland security would you consider the 220 000 migrant encounters in march a threat to the homeland security um senator let me if i can articulate something i'm not sure you heard me earlier this morning that the number of encounters does not equal the number of unique individuals encountered at the border because under title 42 the cdc's public health authority individuals are expelled they are not placed in immigration enforcement proceedings and that expulsion and the fact that they haven't been in enforcement proceedings allows for a high level of recidivism we have a responsibility to secure our borders so consistent with our were encountered as a threat to our homeland security um senator allow me if i may that it is our responsibility to secure our border consistent with our laws and that is precisely what we do so if an individual is encountered at the border and makes a claim for asylum relief i understand under our laws and the and their claim fails before an immigration judge i understand we remember the number that were encountered do you think it is a threat to our homeland security i i i believe i have answered your question that we enforce the law um that congress has passed and the law provides that individuals who are encountered who do not make a claim for relief that you're not promptly my question though i believe i am if i may senator and so those who do not make a claim for relief and do not have a basis to remain in the united states or those who do make a claim for asylum and whose claim is does not prevail before an immigration judge are removed from the united states but the number of encounters whatever that number is the number of encounters do you think that is a threat to our homeland security senator i believe that the u.s customs and border protection the extraordinary 23 000 individuals on our border now and more coming through our intensifying efforts ensure that there is not a threat at our border through their enforcement through their enforcement of immigration law that congress has passed that you don't think it's a threat to the homeland security is what you're saying at what point in your judgment does the growing number of encounters become a threat to our homeland security senator what i believe is that when the encounters uh the encounters that we are experiencing now are placing a strain on our resources which is why we have such a comprehensive plan that we are executing to address that challenge it has six border security pillars six vital lines of effort that we have been executing on since september of last year and if indeed we experience greater numbers it will place a further strain on our resources we are looking at how we could address that further strain some of those six pillars get to the heart of the matter working for example with our partners to the south of our border so that they manage their respective borders but it what also you see that it's a threat to homeland security you're saying because you have these people in place that there is not a threat at this time because they're doing their job and they're in place it's not a threat senator it is our responsibility to ensure that a threat does not materialize and that is why we have such a comprehensive plan to address what could be an increasing challenge at our border and working in partnership with countries to the south not only to manage their respective borders but to also tackle the transnational criminal organizations and the smuggling operations but fundamentally fundamentally i have heard the articulation of a problem at the border and yet no enduring solution because the enduring solution is legislation and everyone agrees that the immigration system is broken and so closing the border would not be a solution senator that would be a dramatic change in law given what the laws that congress has passed thank you senator senator hogan just to follow up on senator hyde smith's question you're talking about moral legislation why don't you enforce the tools you have why don't you enforce the tools you have why don't you enforce the remain in mexico policy why don't you enforce the third safe country policy why don't you keep public health order 42 in place and why don't you finish building the wall so that your border customs and border patrol people and the border patrol can actually get control of the border why not enforce the laws that you have now instead of sit there and ask for new ones

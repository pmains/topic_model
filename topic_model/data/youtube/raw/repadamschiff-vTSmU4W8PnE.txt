our country's ideals are built upon our faith in democracy the idea that government can actually work for the people that faith has been tested throughout our history from the civil war to economic distress to world wars injustice and periods of national tragedy yet we have emerged a stronger nation always striving to achieve a more perfect union donald trump's presidency was a test unlike any other and while he is no longer president the road map that he left behind for any aspiring autocrat is a danger to all of us the protecting our democracy act is our response to this threat here's how it would work first we will restore accountability and prevent future abuses of power by a president that means that they won't be able to use their office to enrich themselves or their family they can't dole out pardons or dangle them to protect themselves second we will restore our system of checks and balances that means strengthening the enforcement of congressional subpoenas and reasserting the power of the purse it means strengthening whistleblower protections and the role of inspector generals finally it will protect our elections from foreign interference americans must decide american elections listen this isn't about one man it's about protecting our democracy and our response has to meet the moment we are in and the catastrophe of the last four years none of this will be easy and along with protecting the right to vote we need to use every level of power to pass our democracy agenda now is our moment to build a democracy that will last for centuries to come we must seize this moment because our democracy is worth fighting for [Music] you

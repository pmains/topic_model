question I stand for parents I'm one of you I stand for your rights to have control over your children because they're your children they do not belong to the government I'll stand with parents she'll stand with Pelosi so it's important to talk about education let's talk about access to education again I thought it was really important and thank goodness we have a governor who got our kids back in school and made sure that we had an interesting learning option I apologize 10 more seconds please okay thank you well again I will stand up for parents the situation at Lendmark shuts parents out of that conversation allows them to change their gender at school without telling their parents I think parents deserve to have a seat at that table and I will stand up for you every single day

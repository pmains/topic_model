hi I'm congressman Donald Payne jr. I'm proud to announce that my legislation to enable state and local first responders to achieve interoperability communications known as the Swift enhancement act has passed through the House Committee on Homeland Security moving one step closer to becoming law the September 11th terrorist attacks and hurricane katrina made it clear that his first responders can't communicate with one another they can't save lives in the year since these tragedies steps have been taken to improve emergency interoperable capabilities ensuring their first responders can successfully communicate and achieve coordinate activities States have been able to rely on grants from the US Department of Homeland Security to support their statewide interoperability coordinators or swix these individuals work with emergency personnel across all levels of government guiding the education and the training of first responders and communication staff they are also responsible for leading all coordination efforts including statewide planning and developing a strategic vision for interoperability unfortunately due to the elimination of DHS grants some states are getting rid of Swick's as a result activities critical to maintaining and advancing interoperable emergency communications policies are not effectively coordinated the Swick enhancement act enables States to maintain the progress that has been made towards achieving interoperability by requiring States to have a Swick or to delegate activities related to achieving interoperability to other individuals we shouldn't let our interoperability efforts fall apart and leave first responders unprepared for emergencies Congress should pass the Swick enhancement act so we can continue to advance our emergency communication efforts and support those who keep our communities safe

Thank You mr. chairman general Hogan's in first I want to say I have a very warm spot in my heart for the National Guard as governor I had one of the largest call ups in our state's history when we had a disastrous ice storm that knocked about half of our people off the electric grid that the guard was absolutely indispensable so I have a very strong belief in the efficacy and the importance of the guard a specific question the guard is now being called upon as you mentioned in your testimony in areas of these protests around the country do the guard units that are being called up in that regard have any special training in the in the area of crowd control and training to deal in these kinds of very difficult situations where we way civil liberties against public order senator thank you for that question and yes they do and we rely on our state adjutant general to make sure that any of our soldiers that are employed in that manner are trained and equipped prior to them assuming those duties Thank You general groves I mean general Poorna you've got one of the most important assignments in the United States government right now and I wanted to touch just on a couple of points that have been made previously this administration rather famously has some disdain for international cooperation and international organizations left the World Health Organization I hope that you will continue to cooperate with international efforts to find a virus this virus doesn't care whether you're Brazilian or American or English and so it just strikes me that there may be additional science and wisdom being developed in other parts of the world that we should take advantage of one of my mottos is all of us are always smarter than one of us and can you commit that you are open to working with international partners on this project I do commit to that senator they all the all the questions today have revolved around the relationship between safety and speed I think it's very important to refer back to 1955 and the the cutter vaccine which was administered to 200,000 children in the Midwest and West forty thousand of whom ended up contracting polio if we're going to inject something into the arms of 300 million Americans we better be damn sure that it's efficacious and also safe this is a there's going to be tremendous pressure to do this in a hurry I hope that you will exercise all possible efforts to be sure that the the vaccine that's being used is will in fact protect us and also not make a sit I give you my personal insurance on that I every day think about my three granddaughters and my parents to that end have you been offered defense production act authority have you been explicitly told if you need it you have it I do not have authority at this time but I feel 100% that I have immediate access to it through secretary a czar at secretary Esper I hope that you will ensure that that's the case so that when the moment comes there's not a long delay waiting for that authority to be granted final question how is the price going to be determined of this vaccine bearing in mind that the United States taxpayers have already or will will already have made significant investments in these private companies in order to enable them to develop the vaccine senator we're in negotiations with each company to make sure that we are going to obtain the right price for the vaccine I you that I will personally be involved in those conversations and that we will not be gouged to taking care of the American people you for that and I hope you'll really pay close attention to that big and the other piece is of course who pays for the vaccine for those millions 25 30 40 million Americans who don't have health insurance we've got to be able to discuss that issue as well because already this disease is not an equal opportunity killer and we don't want that we don't want the vaccine to be anything but equal opportunity for all Americans who need it thank you general I look forward to working with you and appreciate your willingness to take on this incredibly important project thank you

thank you very much and thank you to all of our witnesses mr. dank murder let me begin with you as you know I'm from a rural state and many members of this committee are from rural States and we are very much interested in bridging the digital broadband divide in those areas recently senator Cortes Masto and I introduced the streamlining permitting through enable efficient deployment of broadband infrastructure Act the speed act and it deals with the permitting process for deployment of broadband this will give this will help accelerate deployment in rural America in such areas as 5g as you know Congress and the president are working on infrastructure and we'd like to deal with that as soon as we get through with the tax package is our next big issue what are your thoughts on how Congress can ensure that satellite providers can be included in any broadband infrastructure proposal Thank You senator wicker for your question we are very anxious to to participate in delivering broadband more to rural America the thing that we would find the most useful would be to have a technology neutral policy which would allow whatever infrastructure investment is made to deliver the greatest amount of broadband service to the greatest number of people with the best service at the lowest prices that would that would be our suggestion for getting the most value out of investment that we make well okay technology neutral in terms of where we put the investment should this be done at the FCC level or according to the statute one of the opportunities and the caff program the connect America fund program has been list I mentioned already the connect America fund program has a concept of a reverse auction where different providers using different technologies could make bids to say how much would it cost to deliver this broadband to this area with these features and there are different technology attributes that the FCC has looked at one of the dominant ones is speed another one is bandwidth third one is latency fourth one is price what we see in the market and our experience in the in-flight connectivity business is a good example of this is that the things that really dominate users perception of the quality of broadband is the speed of service that they get and the amount of bandwidth that they get that is not having to have usage caps that would limit the amount of bandwidth that they use and the next one would be as tight as both of those would be price so our recommendation would be to use something like a reverse auction process but to use market-based factors that would reflect the desires of subscribers for getting the best service that they can and that would also allow the government to achieve the greatest penetration of subscribers that that is possible given that amount of money are we gonna need to amend the statute on that or does the agency already have this so far or our perception is that that the FCC has not weighted it in a market reflective way that the that the weighting that they've put on latency is so high that a satellite service I'm going to give you an example a satellite service that would deliver one or two hundred megabits per second at a given price and two more people would be penalized so severely that a lower latency service of even 10 or 25 megabits per second may be selected in the auction we don't think that those weighting factors accurately reflect what subscribers really want in a broadband service miss Cooper were you wishing to weigh in on that issue yes thank you senator we agree that there's some review needed of the any program that's looking at broadband partly because you want every tool available to you as you try and reach every citizen in your state for the connect America fund we found for us the latency issue is not our chief concern because we believe our low earth system will have late in season 25 to 35 milliseconds but we found an area where satellites have simply been precluded from from bidding because the last generation of satellites didn't meet some of those speed and latency requirements so instead of a wholesale exclusion of an entire category of technology we would just recommend that the committee look at any of the programs or federal incentive or infrastructure programs to ensure that quality anything that qualifies any technology that meets those requirements can bid I would just say that satellites are sort of structured differently in that the incentive is not to build the infrastructure all the companies here are investing and building in the connectivity the infrastructure on the ground whether it's to an end location a terminal for the consumer or potentially some gateways to manage traffic is where that sort of scale is going to come in and we may end up coming back to you with some recommendations to make sure those elements can be captured as well but none of us here certainly not SpaceX are counting on that investment in our space in our space constellation to come to fruition thank you miss Cortez mesto it appears you are next

  RECOGNIZED FOR THREE MINUTES.  MR. WESTERMAN: I'D LIKE TO THANK THE GENTLEMAN FROM MONTANA, MR.  GIANFORTE, AND THE GENTLEWOMAN   FROM MASSACHUSETTS, FOR HER  SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MR. SPEAKER, THE WALNUT GROVE  LAND EXCHANGE ACT SHOULD NOT   NEED TO EXIST. IT'S A SIMPLE BILL WHICH SWAPS   FOUR ACRES OF PUBLIC PROPERTY  WHICH CURRENTLY HOUSES A   COMMUNITY CEMETERY AND CHURCH  WITH SIX ACRES OF PRIVATE  TIMBERLAND.  AND AS WAS MENTIONED, THIS IS A  CHURCH AND CEMETERY THAT WAS   ESTABLISHED DECADES BEFORE THE   FOREST SERVICE.  TO THOSE WHO HEAR THIS AND   THINK, 10 ACRES, WHY ON EARTH  WOULD IT TAKE AN ACT OF CONGRESS TO EXCHANGE A TOTAL OF 10 ACRES? REST ASSURED THAT I HAD THE SAME INITIAL REACTION.  NOT THAT THIS BILL OR THE CHURCH ITSELF ARE UNIMPORTANT.  ON THE CONTRARY, THE WALNUT  VALLEY COMMUNITY CHURCH IS VITAL TO THE RESIDENTS OF GARLAND  COUNTY.  THE CHURCH IS NOT ONLY A PLACE   OF WOULD BESHIP, IT HAS HELD   COUNTLESS COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND MORE.  ITS CEMETERY IS THE FINAL  RESTING PLACE FOR MANY OF  GARLAND COUNTY'S SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN AND THE CHURCH ITSELF HAS  SERVED AS A SEARCH AND RESCUE  COMMAND POST IN THE PAST.  HOWEVER, UNDER THE CURRENT LAW,  THE CHURCH DOES NOT OWN THE LAND ON WHICH IT WORSHIPS OR BURIES   ITS DEAD.  AS SUCH, THE FOREST SERVICE HAS  THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE THE   CHURCH'S USE FEE EACH YEAR AND   HAS DONE SO OVER THE PAST  DECADE.  WORSE YET, ANY IMPROVEMENT OR  RESTORATION TO THE CHURCH MUST   BE DONE WITH THE EXPLICIT  PERMISSION OF THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT.  AS A RESULT, THE WALNUT GROVE  CONGREGATION HAS NOT BEEN ABLE   TO MODIFY OR UPGRADE THEIR   80-YEAR-OLD BUILDING, DESPITE  THE NEED TO EXPAND TO MATCH THE  GROWING DEMANDS OF THE   COMMUNITY. MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION HAVE TRIED FOR DECADES TO RESOLVE   THIS ISSUE WITH THE FOREST   SERVICE. THEY HAVE CALLED, WRITTEN AND  PETITIONED BOTH THE LOCAL AND  REGIONAL OFFICES TO PURCHASE OR  EXCHANGE THE LAND. THEY HAVE WILLINGLY TAKEN ON   MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPERTY AND  HAVE GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED HIGHER  AND HIGHER USAGE FEES UNDER THE  GUISE THAT AN EXCHANGE WAS   COMING.  AN EXCHANGE NEVER CAME.  MR. SPEAKER, IT'S TIME WE  STOPPED THIS 20-YEAR MERRY GO  ROUND. THIS BILL IS VITALLY TORN TO   THIS -- IMPORTANT TO THIS  CONGREGATION AND IT'S PAST TIME  WE HELPED THEM RESTHOVE ISSUE. MY BILL HAS WIDE BIPARTISAN AND  BICAMERAL SUPPORT, HAVING PASSED THE COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY AND  HAVING A COMPANION MEASUR

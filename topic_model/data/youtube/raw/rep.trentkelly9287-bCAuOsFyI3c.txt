[Music] good morning everyone and welcome to midday super talk mississippi i'm your host gerard gibbert along with rhino in the element wealth studios uh kicking off a brand new week guiding you through the middle of your day with fox fodder and fine music and starting off the program this morning congressman trent kelly good morning congressman thanks so much for calling in good morning gerard uh glad to call in always love to be on supertalk yes sir so i gotta start with this incredible paradox we had last week joe biden is sipping champagne metaphorically speaking on the south lawn of the white house there sir while at the same time the dow is falling nearly 1300 points and they're celebrating what should be an economic achievement in terms of public policy this so-called inflation reduction act how tone deaf can we be here it is amazing how tone deaf they are whether we're talking about inflation him sitting up there taking a celebration lap while the stock market is crashing i mean people can't afford to go to the grocery store they're having to decide between an electric bill and buying groceries for their children real wages it is amazing and that's not even talking about the border and all the other things that they're toned up on until until until people start showing up on their doorsteps and then it becomes a crisis uh hundreds uh in in martha's vineyard are our issue yet tens of thousands in texas aren't an issue for these guys they're just tone deaf it is truly unbelievable and certainly as you point out congressman the hypocrisy that's uh uh on display here with respect to martha's vineyard and of course washington dc with uh mayor muriel bowser there these are the same people that were all in all about open borders and and humane so-called humane treatment and just absolutely blasting the prior administration the white house press secretary is recent this friday still doing that still pointing to that and how they cleaned all that up and fixed it why are they opposed to helping out if you're for open borders shouldn't you want to help out and and help these people that are seeking asylum well they want other people but remember all these are the same cities that were sanctuary cities inviting them to come and now they don't want them there it's like everything else they do they say one thing and they do the other and this inflation reduction act so-called that they call it this is nothing but fueling more inflation the president's student loan forgiveness on helping out his rich buddies and all those who went to these ivy league schools while our hard working class people in mississippi are not getting anything it's just the tone deaf across the board and they're hiring 87 000 more irs agents to make sure that folks are paying their taxes and i have no doubt that they will target hard-working small businesses and republican voters of course and and you know that's the case because there's not not enough that they can uh extract from the people that they think they're gonna or they're at least portraying they're gonna go after the so-called rich people in this country you know it's gonna trickle down throughout uh all income ranges and and these are the folks that are gonna end up being honestly harassed and isn't that another concern congressman do we not are we not seeing the weaponization of so much of the bureaucratic infrastructure if you will within our federal government the fbi the irs the dhs excuse me the doj it seems out of control we're seeing a weaponization of that and there's going to be an accounting hopefully we'll win back the house in the midterms and the senate and there can be some oversight over this but i'll tell you they're targeting republicans you know they think they're going to keep us and silence us and muzzle us uh by threats of of indicting every republican but i'll tell you we are go we are going to take them to task and we are at least going to highlight for the american people the injustices they are doing and the way that they are targeting republicans what's the environment like sir in the u.s house of representatives i mean is is is there any interest in in trying to work together on what might be the the handful of of common causes it just seems like we're so polarized on everything other than the funding bill that they will try to pass this week there is no interest in them on working on anything that helps the american people last last week we're talking about whistleblowers which is not really whistleblowers it's so that their whistleblowers can whistle blow on our whistleblowers and and and and discredit them in an anonymous fashion uh they are not worried about anything other than the politics and the election in 2022 and if we don't get our folks out and vote they are going to take back the house and if they do that i'm not sure that our nation can withstand another two years of the democrats in charge well i share your concerns congressman the wall street journal editorial board published an outstanding article over the weekend basically going through the details of what is at stake and just how close we are to to enacting some ridiculously radical policy starting with voting rights that's like number one on the list they want to get rid of the filibuster so they can ram that through which would of course make mail-in voting up virtually at any time the law of the land across all 50 states essentially federalizing our elections this is incredibly dangerous it is that if you'll remember that was the very first thing when they took the majority was their hr one the voting rights yeah and it's not voting rights it is setting it up so that democrats win all elections and you know and i have issues when you lead every time until they start counting votes after the election and every time they get 90 of the votes that are late and they turn an election from you being four points up to being five points down it is crazy and we just saw what happened in alaska with this frank voice that ranked ranked on choice voting yeah where 60 voted for republicans yet the democrat won yeah in the rcv voting process and and i'm sure you're aware other states are considering implementing that as well that structure yes and so we've got to educate our folks that this is not a good policy when someone who gets less than 40 percent wins in an election that is not democracy and that is not one vote for one person yeah i totally agree with you on that so the other thing that that's on their radar is the pro act which would essentially eliminate the choice a worker has on whether or not they want to join a union in a union shop listen they're always about unions and always trying to do that and we've seen that in mississippi what they want is to take over the workforce and be able to control who works and how much they pay so they can uh have their cronies get the best jobs and do the lease work and we just we're going to fight everything that they throw until we can take the gals hopefully in january of next year let's stay optimistic let's suppose that uh republicans are able to uh take over the house the majority of the house what do you see happening might we see any sort of proceedings drawing up impeachment papers for the president for for garland my orcas perhaps i think you'll see some of that stuff you will see a lot of oversight first too to make sure that we know who's done what so i mean we're already starting oversight proceedings uh on our side but we don't have the subpoena power so once we get charged we will bring those folks in call them to account and i think you'll see some impeachment proceedings for some of these folks who have abused their power and abused their power of office to take advantage and to use it as a political ploy it seems like unfortunately it's like the only tool we have to stop this uh this politization and weaponization of these agencies it is uh all we can do is do the oversight you know we can do referrals to the department of justice but we all know who the attorney general is and so our until we get another republican president it's very unlikely that this doj is going to do anything with the referrals that they're going to get from the house but it's important for the american people to see the wrongdoing that they do anyway yeah and before we go you mentioned it you guys are trying to figure out uh a way to plug this funding short shortfall my understanding is we've got about 47 billion dollars we need to complete the year the fiscal year which ends here in a couple of weeks september 30th uh what's g what can we expect this week uh well i'm sure they'll have something that has a whole lot of things that are not good for america in it they always do but the bottom line is uh if they can't do this it's on them they have the house the senate and the presidency and all of these failed economic policies are on the democratic party every single one of them republicans would do well i think to continue to focus on that as we approach the midterms in the meantime the democrats are focusing on abortion and trump absolutely uh but that's because they don't want people to know how much it costs them when they go to the grocery store or that our fuel reserves are the lowest point since 1985. they want to distract from what the issues are but the american people know they are not better off today than they were when the democrats took charge always good to talk to you congressman appreciate you joining us and keep up the good fight sir all right thanks a lot have a good day you too come

mr. Walker welcome back to the committee you were here not not long ago we're glad to have you back sir Napoleon said war is history Freud said Anatomy is destiny King says structure is policy I'm I welcome the new office because I think you're creating a structure that will facilitate good policy in this area because without some area of responsibility in the department that's focused focused specifically on the problem of cyber security and resiliency I'm afraid the response and the planning and the programs will be defusing and unfocused so I hope that you will move quickly to facilitate the formation of this office and to get it to stand it up so that it can it can meet its urgent purpose yes sir that's the goal it's important for us which is why the secretary announced it and you know one of the things I learned early in my career is is you design you design organizations around process and how you want to drive the policy and that was part of the the distinguishing factor in establishing this department specifically for cyber security and you'll note the second part which is energy security which incorporates that that just closely you know type physical component which is absolutely necessary for us to to focus on particularly as the interdependency exacerbates our risk now the problem here and this isn't your problem this is a government problem and I just came from a hearing in the Armed Services Committee with the nominee to head Cyber Command is that this country lacks a coherent strategy of deterrence in the cyber realm we are either you can argue we are either at war now or war is imminent in terms of cyber attacks on this country small and large and yet we have no deterrent policy we have no there our adversaries feel there is no cost to their attacking us in a variety of ways large and small so again this isn't your responsibility but I hope that in the council's of government as you're discussing these matters we can't simply rely on defensive measures we can't keep patching software ultimately people who are making a calculation as to whether to attack us have to believe there will be a response whether in the cyber field or sanctions or some other area but this is something that that I'm urging everyone I don't have the the Secretary of Energy of the Secretary of Defense or the president sitting here so you're it and I hope you will take this message back because without a deterrent strategy we're simply sitting ducks and and there will be not maybe there will be an attack unless we can we can deter our adversaries I hope you will take that message back yes Ari well thank you mr. Lee I know you did some analysis on the Ukraine attack is that correct yes growing out of the response to that Senator Risch and I have introduced a bill that's here that essentially is a back to the future bill because one of the learnings I understand from the Ukraine attack was that they had some places where there were analog switches and there were human human intervention that enabled them to recover more swiftly our concern is that if if we're totally digital that there as you I think testified a few minutes ago there may be unintentional provisions in there that allow us to not be resilient and we've asked the National Labs to look at some of these ideas is that something that you think makes sense thank you for your question senator and yes I do I was actually able to write some comments to the house companion for that I thought it was very well positioned I think you for your leadership on it there are a lot of I didn't know you were gonna say that but I'm doing it so Twp but I there is a lot of functionality we're putting in that doesn't make sense this is not to say we need to go back sort of to the Stone Age but we cannot stop innovation and we should not I mean a lot of optimizations make sense for the businesses that run but there are certain locations and certain functions of protection equipment and safety equipment that doesn't need to be able to run minesweeper and solitaire on it they can do a more basic function which in in a sense makes it a much more difficult information attack space for the adversary so I do thinks it makes a lot of sense in the right application well I hope we can I hope madam chair that's a bill that we can move again it would it would talk to the National Labs instruct the National Labs to work on this concept of where in the system not the entire system and not taking it back but where in the system could we place some of these elements that would be more rudimentary if you will but would protect us from a catastrophic cascading of software mr. bunker I hope that you can and I'm at a time but I hope that you will get back to us with thoughts as you're standing up this office and one of the critical points here is the relationship between the government in the private sector we don't run the electric grid we can only help work with the utilities to do so and to the extent that there are impediments to full coordination and cooperation in other words things like utilities concerns about liability or costs or how do we do this in a way that's not the heavy hand of government but is a cooperative relationship what I'm asking you is if you observe and develop and I would ask this question also to the to the electric cooperative and and to the utility industry generally if there are impediments here please let us know what they are so that we can try to address them because this is a crucial issue and we've it's got to be close coordination without smothering as I guess the way I would put it sure that and and thank you for the point and I surely if I run into an impediment I have not seen one yet we have a fantastic relationship with EE I Appa and an Rekha and then working through the Ong Coordinating Council and and the electricity sub sector Coordinating Council you know we work through these issues and the great part about these forums is we've got we've gone got the same and similar mission we approach it from different angles perhaps but we've got the mission is to make sure that the energy infrastructure is available when needed and fortunately we have great partnerships with it with those members and I'm out of time but with the chairs indulgence I hope one of your elements of your work will be red teaming so that you can demonstrate to utilities where they have problems yes we are we're taking a very progressive proactive approach on many of these issues thank you thank you madam chair

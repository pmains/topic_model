I thank the speaker I thank the Chairman ladies and gentlemen I rise today not so much to oppose this legislation as to deride it as a sham as a fraud as a pretense of fiscal responsibility if you want to balance the budget just do it I've served here for years and years and years when my Republican colleagues have controlled the House the Senate and the presidency do it don't talk about it now I come here as someone who's voted for balanced budget amendments in the past but I have become extraordinarily cynical at people who vote to cut the costs of their product way below the price of producing it that is a formula for bankruptcy in any business any place in the world for Republicans to bring a balanced budget amendment to the floor just weeks after adding 1.8 trillion dollars to deficits in tax breaks for the wealthiest is the epitome of hypocrisy nobody nobody believes anymore that Republicans care about deficit reduction or balancing the budget let alone their own members now ladies and gentlemen on the Republican side of the aisle let me call to your attention the chair remarks of your freedom caucus hear me I'm going to quote mark betos mark Bello says quote the freedom caucus the most conservative elements supposedly of our of the Congress mark Meadows says this there is no one on Capitol Hill and certainly no one on Main Street who takes this vote seriously mark meadows conservative Republican Tom Massey a Republican a very conservative Republican says this quote audacity noun boating a constitutional balanced budget amendment only for legislative days after ramming through a massive deficit spending because you believe this stunt Massey's word not mine this stunt will convince constituents that you care about balancing the budget not my words two of the most conservative Republicans in this house and Republican senator bob Corker said this Republicans control the House the Senate and the White House if we were serious this is the Republican senator saying if we were serious about balancing the budget we would do it we know what it takes to balance budgets Mr Speaker we did it during the Clinton administration four years in a row now my Republican colleagues may jump to their feet and say yes but we were in charge of Congress that's correct and President Clinton would not let them cut the price of our product because to do so would have led to bankruptcy so what did we do we balanced the budget four years in a row the only time that's been done in the lifetime of any listener to these words well what happened our Republican colleagues took office they took the house the Senate and the presidency and they cut the price of the product but they didn't cut the cost of the product and what do we have we increased the debt by 87 percent in the Bush years Democrats instituted pay-go rules to pay for what we buy and they worked and we balanced the budget Republicans came into the majority and scrapped those rules now we're mired in growing deficits the CBO baseline Congressional Budget Office nonpartisan released on Monday shows that accounting for Republican policies passed since President Trump took office just a few months ago the deficit will reach this year do you have but we can give you an extra minute this is a great stuff and you get a full 60 seconds right gentleman is recognized for one minute since President Trump took office this year fiscal year eighty nine hundred and eighty billion dollars in deficits next year a trillion dollars every year thereafter during the Trump administration another trillion dollars of debt it will total some 14 trillion dollars after Republicans passed their tax law they knew they'd be on the hook for its enormous deficit price tang so immediately they said they wanted to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid the other safety net programs to do it this amendment would essentially write those cuts into the Constitution hear me Medicaid Medicare Social Security right those cuts into the Constitution this is a backdoor effort to get the programs that help working Americans get ahead I said I rose to de ride this amendment it's a fraud a sham a pretense but it's also bad for our country bad for our people I urge my colleagues defeat this silly waste of time gentleman's time has expired the gentleman from Virginia is recognized mr. speaker it's my pleasure to yield three minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas mr.

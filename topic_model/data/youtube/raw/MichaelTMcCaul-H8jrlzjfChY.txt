in the last hour the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee who has been briefed on the case is traveling in Florida today for meetings at the Special Operations Command and he told reporters about the 24 year old suspects weapons my understanding was that he was carrying an ak-47 with multiple rounds of ammunition as we saw in Tunisia an ak-47 can do an extensive amount of damage as it did yesterday so he had not only that but multiple weapons as well Tunisia of course is a reference to the two recent Isis plots they are hitting a beach resort and also the tourists Bardo museum there Gretchen okay

i i stand before you today um uh ms martin as a uh recovering governor and uh one and a father of two boys here now one is out of college one is uh uh actually over in new delhi india working for national research institute and other boys down at uh william and mary when i was elected governor in 1992 uh we spent we said we're going to spend the next eight years doing whatever we can to raise student achievement and we did a lot of a lot of good things delaware's very proud of our state and grateful to secretary duncan for his wonderful leadership but uh delaware's race to the top competition finished in in first place in part for uh some of the great work that's done by our current governor current administration our state uh teachers association i mean it's just a lot of a lot of good partners i uh i've wrestled for a long time with what is the role of government uh with respect of education whether it's state local or whether it's a federal government and lincoln used to say the role of government is to do for the people what they cannot do for themselves david osborne used to say it a little bit but he would say the the role of government is to steer the boat not to to row the boat and i think ernie is suggesting we're not interested in running all the public schools across the country here from washington d.c that doesn't work but what i need to do is to to make sure that better insurer maybe we can help level at the federal level we can help level the playing field for kids who come from dysfunctional families where nobody's at home nobody cares about that kid nobody cares about a kid's education parents who didn't uh do well in school who were not comfortable in school and frankly have no interest in being involved in their child's education to better make to better ensure that people who are bringing kids into the world understand their responsibility to be the first teacher for their uh for for their child to be a partner with the the teachers and the principals that those uh and the schools that those kids will someday attend that's a big part of what's going on here nobody's really talked much about that but that's an appropriate role for the federal government to work at the early years to make sure that when a kid walks into kindergarten at the age of five or first grade at the age of six they're ready to roll they're ready to succeed they're ready to to uh to to compete the other thing is is that a couple people said arnie knows i've said we one of the shortcomings of no child left behind is we did leave it up to the states to set their own standards we said uh back in the 90s president clinton obviously we're not going to set national standards uh people say we're going to we're going to run government or run this education out of washington which we don't want to do so we basically said states set your own standards measure progress toward those standards that you set and uh and guess what they did initially they set their standards high uh it was hard to make progress toward those standards so they changed their standards they dumbed down the standards they lowered them a race to the bottom and what part of what we what we set off we can't do that i'm really encouraged by the gathering around we've got common core standards particularly for for math and rigorous standards that we could actually measure uh with the uh with the right goal in in in mind but uh this this is not rocket science this is not right this is a lot of common sense and and a lot of people say we've got to figure out what works and just do more of that the national governors association has we have a former chairman here the re immediate past chairman of the the ngas a role that i was pleased to hold once where we actually have a center for best practices within the nga and we worked real hard on an education center for best practices so we could find out what's working we're not just like trying out what's not going to work but we actually have an idea what's working to raise student achievement let me close with uh with this the uh among maybe three things that i think that are most important here are number one work on the early years and we can do a lot of good work on that number two making sure we have rigorous academic standards and encouraging uh schools to align their standards to what's going on in the classroom actually reflects the standards that have have been said the third thing we need great principles show me a school with a weak principle out sure your school is not going anywhere i don't care how good the teachers are uh i don't care how involved the the parents are but we need really strong principles and one of the great things that come comes out of teach for america is they it's really like a farm farm club like a farm baseball like a farm club for for school us for school leaders and we need the schools and the last thing we need are great teachers great teachers and and great teachers aren't necessarily born although in a way they are but you actually teach somebody who's a decent teacher to become a great teacher and we just really need great teachers who one know their subjects love to teach know how to make the the learning fun and love kids and we need more of them to reward them as as they grow that's those are the points that i wanted to make

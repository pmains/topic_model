thank you welcome gentlemen congratulations on your nominations I want to continue in the discussion some of my colleagues have started with the and raising the importance of Amtrak's long-distance passenger rail service my communities in Nevada Elko Winnemucca and Reno rely on the Amtrak service provided by the California Zephyr Amtrak line including the annual average of about 84,000 Nevada riders who travel on the line in a year just want to put in perspective and I know my colleagues have talked about this but the importance to rural communities like mine mayor Putnam of winnemucca which is a community of around seventy three hundred people wrote me stating that rural Nevada needs your help the Amtrak service train service is an important part of the economic vitality and social fabric of my community many of our veterans and seniors use Amtrak to access medical services in Reno and other areas and also I want to reference the line is vital to a mayor of West Wendover who was also inquiring about an Amtrak stop and how important Amtrak is to connecting communities in rural Nevada and I I bring this up because recently the Greyhound bus service is pulled out of this route meaning there are even fewer towns are able to connect to major populations for services as well so mr. Dearborne let me start with you because I appreciate the comments that you've made already but let me ask you this because I know one of your priorities is increasing ridership and I'm hoping that your focus is fruitful but in rural Nevada it's going to be very difficult right right because you you only have so many people living there but I will note this I know the California Zephyr line runs through five states of those five states those senators sit on this committee and you've heard from two of them yes so my goal is to stress the importance and get a commitment from you about the importance not only this suffer line yes we want to improve ridership at at the same time the connectivity it brings for our rural communities to needed services and other areas I want to stress that so can I ask you this if you had a choice to choose between lowering operating losses or shutting down a long-distance line what would you choose I think it's a national passenger rail system I think the long distance lines are important I hope I'm never faced with that decision and even if I am I would want to learn everything I possibly could I think operating costs are important but I think these long distance lines are an integral part it's part of the national network again my focus will be on increasing ridership making it a choice that people want to take trying to see what we can do it about taking congestion off of our roads around our major cities and all that revenue gain I'm hopeful will help to continue the services that we have on our long-distance routes so can I get a commitment at least that you're committed to protecting Amtrak's long distance service including working with the senators on the California Zephyr line you have my commitment to work with you and your staff that long distance service for me is an important piece of the national network and I'll do everything I can to work with you to make sure to continue as a vibrancy thank you let me jump to another topic that's important for Nevada mr. Obermann again thank you for being here one concern in Nevada that we have in and it's unique obviously is there's this ill-conceived proposal to move and store nuclear waste him into Nevada one concern is the safety of transporting nuclear waste long distances by truck and rail through metropolitan areas and towns across the country it would require the shipment of waste from 76 sites in 9,500 rail Cask within 2,800 trains and 2,650 trucks hauling one case each to Yucca Mountain for over 50 years millions of Americans and majority of congressional districts in the country would be impacted and 300 miles of new railroad would be required which brings in the STB on the stds website when it talks about yuck it includes a question-and-answer section that quotes it says will the st will the STB consider safety issues an answer absolutely although frail freight rail safety is a primary responsibility of the Federal Railroad Administration the STB must take safety concerns into consideration this includes both public safety and the safety of railroad employees safety concerns are usually raised and addressed in the stds environmental review process and in as some context in a recent visit by some yucca proponents there were two train derailments in close proximity to Las Vegas within the 36 hour period of their tour where these outsiders to Nevada implied there were no safety issues well I can tell you I have concerns based on what just recently happened so I ask you as a member of the Surface Transportation Board can I get a commitment from you that during your term on the board you will be transparent consider these safety concerns and work to include me and my office on any matters related to this flawed concept of siting any new rail lines in Nevada the answer is yes if I could elaborate just very briefly one of the things that has drilled into the head of anybody in a railroad of any kind and this was drug Metra and rick has talked about it is safety safety is first in the railroad industry in every respect if you can't be safe you shouldn't be really just you shouldn't run the train so I don't have to be impressed about the importance of safety I'm already there the STB has a broad mandate dealing with new lines in the words of public necessity and convenience and it has an environmental mandate and so yes safety issues are there for the board's consideration and the licensing function of approving new lines so yes they have to be considered as I understand it there's a long pending application from do-e which hasn't been voted on and I would be called may someday be called to vote on so I couldn't express an opinion on how I would vote but I'm certainly very sensitive that those issues have to be considered if if and when the board has ever called on to take action on that application thank you I appreciate that and thank you I notice my time is that Thank You mr. chair

we got two words for america today crack pipes crap pipes not crack pots did any of us ever think sitting in our senior year in high school at our government class that we'd be part of a nation where its government gives crack pipes out as as a tool to a and just a permissive society i don't think any of us would have ever thought that our socialistic government would do something like that as i finished up some town halls this past weekend 15 town halls i can tell you i've never seen americans so upset i've never seen so much fervor i thought joe biden had bottomed out at the end of last year but i'm telling you he's still searching for the bottom of his popularity right now as i listen to my folks at these town halls i want you to listen to what they're telling me this is what americans see americans see two million people maybe six million people cross the border illegally last year and they see this administration reward them with an all expenses paid vacation trip to any american city of their choosing america sees riots and vandalism and this administration applauds them america sees looting and shoplifting and this administration says don't prosecute this america saw over five tons of fentanyl across our border last year just imagine five big semi trucks loaded with a ton of fentanyl and i remind people one teaspoon of that fentanyl could kill thousands of people and like my dad the police officer said crime and drug abuse go hand in hand it's like peanut butter and jelly the more drug crimes you have the more crime we're going to have as well and then finally america sees our law enforcement officers being told to turn their back on violent crimes and not pursue america sees the white house and their party turn their back on their law enforcement officers america sees weak knee judges and attorneys prosecuting attorneys and then back to our crack pipes what they're seeing what americans are seeing is insane policy is demented policy it's unthinkable it's unconscionable our president could change all of this if he had the will

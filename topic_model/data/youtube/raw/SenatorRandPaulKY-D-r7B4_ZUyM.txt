newly unveiled letter from the office of former President Barack Obama written back in March now leaking out privately bashing Senate Republicans for investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in Ukraine claiming the investigation was given quote-unquote credence to a Russian misinformation campaign joining us now is Kentucky Senator Rand Paul a member of the Foreign Relations Committee senator good morning to you good morning why do you think Barack Obama is weighing in do you fear there's something they're trying to hide here yeah there's been rumors for quite a while that people within the Obama administration knew about the corruption problems with hunter Biden that they warned the vice president and maybe even the president about it I think that there could be a smoking gun that there's actually a record of some of these complaints that were going on at the time there have been some articles written quoting unnamed sources saying that they were assistants and people around show Biden at the time we're saying this hunter Biden thing looks bad and you should really put a stop to it and they never did but I think even President Obama knew about this so it's not surprising to me that he would try to keep a lid on it and not let any records come to the public well and as you remember in Adams shifts investigation there was that testimony from George Kent I believe the diplomat who said that he went to the obama-biden team essentially particularly Vice President Biden Stapp privately way back then when they were still in office and said this could be a real problem a conflict of interest and he said it was largely ignored here's a quote from the letter former President Obama writing the current request is not a proper use in terms of documents that Republicans want it arises out of efforts by some actively supported by Russia to shift the blame for Russian interference in the 2016 election Ukraine in the interest of countering the misinformation campaign underlying this request we were prepared on this occasion to provide the committee's access what are you what are your thoughts on whether you're ever gonna get answers about hunter Biden's dealings not just in Ukraine but places like China you know I know Ron Johnson is looking into this and one I think really is trying to find the truth about this I think what you've found is is that every time we look into the corruption of hunter Biden the other side says oh no no this is a you know the Russians interfered in our election not not hunter Biden in Ukraine but no-one's really saying that Russia didn't interfere in the election or that Russia and Ukraine couldn't have tried to interfere in the election but the one thing that probably had more effect on the election or threatened to have more effect on the election was you know the firing of the Trump campaign Chairman over things that came out of Ukraine these documents were released on purpose from some secret note book saying that the former chairman had been paid by entities in in Ukraine yep that probably was more damaging as damaging as any of the released emails on Hillary Clinton two quick questions you're back to work obviously on Capitol Hill the Senate back in session I want to get defies in a moment first let's talk about a fourth stimulus plan your colleague from Kentucky the leader Mitch McConnell is saying he has sort of a wait-and-see approach Oana and you've been very critical of a lot of government spending are we gonna see a for stimulus or do you think you're gonna wait and see how the first three are working - people ask me I remind them that we have no money we have no rainy day account we have no savings account the three trillion that we've already passed out is imaginary money it's it's being borrowed basically from China so the irony is we got the virus from China and now we're going to be more dependent by borrowing more money from China the only thing that recovers our economy is opening the economy it's not a lack of money it's a lack of Commerce if you let people have Commerce if you let them trade if you take them out from forceable home arrest our economy will recover but if you keep everybody out of their home arrest and say you cannot practice your business you cannot sell your goods there will continue to be economic calamity and all these blue state governors you don't want to open their state now they're clamoring for federal money to pick them out because no state revenues coming in senator don't have any money absolutely a senator last question before the pandemic you were very vocal about saying you were not going to allow a renewal of the FISA surveillance law unless there was real reform the Attorney General says he needs that he believes you know it's a terrorist tool he has to have this what are your thoughts on what comes next here real reform would be that we never ever allow our intelligence communities to investigate political campaigns so I'm for banning that completely we should never allow our intelligence community and all their secret power and their secret courts to do what they did to President Trump to someone else and I encourage the President to veto this veto this unless it fixes that I have an amendment that says Americans should not be investigated by the secret court because it is not constitutional so pay for foreigners but it is not okay for Americans and particularly for American political campaigns so I ban it outright and we just take all of that out of FISA and we only use FISA for foreign intelligence not to spy on American campaigns other people have some I think window-dressing kind of reforms but I don't think they're enough and I think we'll still get what happened to President Trump again so I hope he vetoes any of this weak sauce or a fake reform got it senator good to see you back healthy back to work on Capitol Hill things coming on thank you

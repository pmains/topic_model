thank you my dear friend i appreciate it so much president gee and to wvu and all the staff there that's made this possible for us to put this historic event on i believe that there's nothing like it in the country being done the way we've done it today to having all my colleagues there and their staffs representing them there today uh senator capito staff and congressman mooney and congressman mckinley and congressman miller staff i appreciate this is an all hands on deck because we want to offer you the best opportunity in the world i'm sorry i'm not with you all today uh i'm in training myself i know we call this the academy training day for you all to get a real life bird's eye view of what it takes and what to expect but with that i'm in training right now i had a knee operation and a shoulder operation two weeks ago so i'm in training with the physical therapist most of the day trying to get ready to go back to dc um when i say this is a historic event we've never done anything like this and in conjunction with wvu and all of their staff being able to bring all the military and the real life opportunities as you can see what goes on uh that makes the service academy so unbelievable the opportunity the greatest education the most prestigious education one can receive and serve their country by basically having the preparation at the highest level to do so uh that's something so so unbelievably special but the whole world recognizes what we do and how we do it much better they try to emulate it and they not succeeded because they don't have the commitment dedication that we have and also the rewards that come with it i want all the students there that are experiencing this today and look around at your loved ones your parents your guardians your friends those who have supported you it's often been said the person at the top of the mountain didn't fall there that person at the top of the mountain climbed their way up they had an awful lot of help you wouldn't be where you are today you might not have the interest you have today and the support that you're going to need from this day forward if it wasn't for the loved ones you have in your life and i hope you recognize that and i hope you thank them give them a big hug and a kiss and thank them and tell them how much you love them for what the sacrifices they're making for you i've often said this i believe in you more than you believe in yourself i know what west virginia can do i know we've contributed to this great country of ours and we're relied on every day we have the most patriotic state in the nation we fought more wars shed more blood loss more lies for the cause of freedom than most any state in the world in the nation i mean and with that we've mined the coal that made the still that's built the guns and ships defended our country and being patriotic you know we have answered the call every time this country has been challenged and with that on the vietnam wall in washington dc if you've ever walked by it or if you ever read about it or seen it there's more west virginia names on that wall per capita from any other state so when when when our nation has been uh calling for service we've always been the first to answer that i want to thank each one of you all for the interest that you're so that you're showing in serving our nation there's so much you can do in service i think that i think the public service is a noblest of all professions but when you're deciding to put a uniform on and serve in that capacity that's the highest level humanly possible for anyone because what you're saying is that i will sacrifice my life for you and my country total strangers you don't even know but you're willing to sacrifice your life with the training you're receiving now and willing to go and defend this country any place anywhere when when when duty calls you'll be there i don't know any higher higher honor that i can say and if we can bestow upon you then then thank you your nation is very grateful for the services that you're continuing to serve and wanting to give back so uh we have some graduates there i know aaron scheinberg he was on my staff and now he's helping the secretary of veterans affair to take care of our veterans i've often said this marin is a west point graduate aaron i'm sure if you haven't met aaron please stand up so everyone knows who you are and uh also we have some academy graduates uh and also people that are currently in the academies can attest to and i'd like for jocelyn liam and paul they would please stand and be recognized too so you can see these are west virginians that have gone either graduated or still completing their education in academies joshua graduated from the air force academy in may liam graduated from the naval academy in may and paul was a second year cadet at the air force academy and will graduate in 2005. so let's give them all a round of applause for what they've accomplished and what they're continuing to do for our country as i've said to you all before joining the military is the ultimate act of selfless service and i salute all of you for willingness to share um i i can't tell you the patriotism that we have and what we feel in all of us is as divided as you believe our country is uh i don't believe that i believe our best days are ahead of us because i know the people of america and people west virginia will pull together don't let the politics of our nation today the toxic atmosphere of the politics divide you don't let the politics make you have to make decisions and choose a side there's only one side in this great country of ours and that's the american side we're all in this together we've made it through much difficult times through civil wars through world battles we have made it we have been at war with each other we have been at war with other countries but we've always came back united and stronger and that's what we're calling on for today so uh when you think of all this military heroes that we've had that's that's come before us and the last uh the last world war one veteran was frank buckles from the eastern panhandle uh and i knew frank and when he uh i knew him when he was living he was the last living world war one veteran uh one of the most highly decorated women's service members ruby bradley was from west virginia and one of the few service members to lie in honor of the united states capital just recently was west virginia's own woody williams if you haven't or you don't know of woody and you haven't read about him please please do that i think it would be very inspiring to see how this young west virginian determined to be in the battle in world war ii going in as a marine he was turned away at first because he was too short he's a five foot five he wasn't quite tall enough but as the war progressed on they lifted that barrier war he went in fought valiantly at iwo jima and received a congressional medal of honor and he was the last congressional monitor of honor living and his last one to perish and die and then when he did he was able to lay in state we were happy to have him but he represents the true leadership and also the true dedication and commitment of patriotism from west virginia so all of you today that are going down this path uh you're part of this lineage you're part of people that came before you and all of us who've inspired us as west virginians to do more and to give back and to continue to basically serve our country so whether you go to a service academy or if you go into rotc and i was in rossi at wvu and it's a great experience whether you adjourn join the guard or the reserves or enlist you're going to be destined for greatness because i can tell you there's not a military leader that i have ever met that hasn't told me the dedication of west virginians when they have a west virginian in their ranks they know they're going to have someone that will work hard dedicated committed and it's public service beyond all i uh i can't thank you enough i really can and everyone who made today's possible uh terry berkley kim berry my staff all the other congressional staffs for helping and working with us everyone is dedicated this is once in a lifetime it'll not be the last but it shows you truly these are academy truly academy service day that no one else has experienced anywhere in the country but west virginia is the first to do this and i hope that we extend this to the rest of our great nations so they can give their students who are willing to serve the same opportunities that you'll have today i hope this morning was helpful for you all that was entertaining but also invigorating and i hope the rest of the day is going to be just the same also so may god continue to shine on our great state of west virginia and our great country united states of america which we call our blessed home thank you all and god bless each and every one of you

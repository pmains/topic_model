thank you very much miss fudge you recognized for five minutes thank you very very much madam chair and thank you all for being here today you know it's just interesting to me that anytime the majority doesn't like something they just deal with it ad nauseam over and over and over again you know we have voted more than 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act they didn't even pretend to have a replacement just repeal it what would make you think they have a replacement now this is nothing more than just stalling till they can come up with a plan they have no clue what to do to replace it as a matter of fact the president said it's just complicated it's complicated I know it's hard 65 times with no replacement plan you know I listen to the chairwoman up talking about people coming to town halls I had a town hall on Saturday because I know that when I was elected I was elected to represent every single person in the district I represent even those who disagree with me that is my job and so I listen to what the people said there was not one who believed that we should repeal the Affordable Care Act can we make it better absolutely they want it fixed they don't want to destroy but what we want to do here is to destroy it because we have no earthly idea how to fix it I wonder how many hearings we're gonna have on this they didn't like NLRB we had 26 hearings when how many we'll have on this before they come up with a plan miss myths even though we've not talked about this today they have this great idea that health savings plans is the answer to all of our problems could you please talk a bit about how someone maybe with cancer or someone who has some long term illness would go into absolute bankruptcy with a health savings plan thank you for your question health savings accounts do not work for the vast majority of working people in this country income families who are living paycheck-to-paycheck basically ask people to pay full freight for their health care they're tied to plans with high deductibles that data has shown research has shown that most families do not have that type of money in liquid assets in any financial assets to pay two thousand three thousand dollars in medical bills so health savings accounts are not the solution for for working families they just cannot afford to put that money aside in a in an account where literally they cannot use it for anything other than health care they have an emergency fund for health care for their house for their children and so it's really not a solution and it's it's a cost shift to two families and would leave them exposed to bankruptcy medical debt even though some people think we live in an alternative universe I don't deal an alternative facts it is a fact that twenty million more people have health care because of the Affordable Care Act it is a fact that people are no longer going into bankruptcy because they are sick it is a fact that young people can stay on their parents and children to insurance until they are 26 it is a fact that right now a person who is sick can get help and not have to worry about paying their bills so let's just deal with some facts what happens if we restrict or reduce the amount of Medicaid expansion in our states what happens to these people who now have insurance who after we change whatever it is they go to change because I still don't know what that is what happens if we roll back Medicaid expansion Medicaid expansion has expanded coverage to millions of working people in this country the majority of people who have benefited from Medicaid expansion are working adults they would be left without any affordable coverage option and likely go uninsured we've seen people's access to preventive care and primary care improved thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that's benefited you know enrollees of the expansion as well as their workers who now have a healthier workforce I mean to work every single day rolling back the Medicaid expansion would have dire consequences for states who have seen an economic boost from the federal funds coming in it's created jobs and lifted up their economies and so the cuts have dire consequences for the low-income people who have relied on Medicaid for affordable coverage as well as their states thank you for just the facts Pam just the facts thank you I yield back thank you Miss fudge

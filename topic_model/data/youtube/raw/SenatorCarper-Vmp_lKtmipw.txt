please to join my friend colleague Santa Bravo to speak on behalf the nomination and Nicole Nason the service administrator the Federal Highway Administration the station is currently serving as the assistant secretary for administration at the State Department right now though there's no administrator leading the federal highway administration in fact it's been more than two years since we've had a administrator in charge at that important agency last time our country was president went this long without top leadership at the federal highway administration was more than 100 years ago back when the agency was known as the Bureau of Public Roads Henry Ford had just introduced the Model T and the idea of speedy and safe transcontinental travel was still far outside of our imagination and even further from being realized today the Federal Highway Administration oversees more than 220,000 miles of a national highway system and some 145 thousand bridges sad truth is that many of these roadways many of these bridges are in poor some cases even dangerous a condition having been in use far beyond the intended duration of their original design moments from now and miss Mason is confirmed and I hope that she will be but confirmed to be our administrator I think she's going to inherit responsibilities and political realities far more challenging and complex than perhaps all of our predecessors as their next administrator missed nation will find yourself at the center of a national crisis because our Highway Trust Fund is going broke and a system of paying for it is broken last year mr. president we spent about 11 billion dollars more from the Highway Trust Fund than we collected in revenues when that happens the Highway Trust Fund turns over to the general fund and the Treasury and says how about eleven billion dollars the general fund doesn't have the eleven billion dollars and so what Treasury does is issue debt in order to finance the hole in the trust fund the general fund so we can actually fund the hole in the Highway Trust Fund it is crazy to pay for the fast act in fact we took seventy billion dollars from the general fund and other programs for the next transportation bill mr. president we need to find an additional sixty eight billion dollars sixty eight billion dollars just to prevent the Highway Trust Fund from going broke for four or five more years and to keep our programs at the current funding level but we all know that the current funding is insufficient either despite spending more than we collect we still aren't spending enough the backlog of money needed to rehabilitate and improve highways and bridges in this country has grown to eight hundred billion dollars eight hundred billion dollars is the backlog roads highways and bridges so mr. president the 800-pound gorilla in the room is really an eight hundred billion dollar gorilla and we got to figure out how we're going to pay to maintain or better yet rebuild and modernize our roads our highways our bridges and transit system that should be near the top of our to-do list not just the Senate not just the house not just the Congress not just the administration all of us together or whether it's fair or not miss nation's job as administrator will be made either easier or all the more difficult by Congress's ability or inability the administration's ability or inability to responsibly address that fire that 800 800-pound gorilla on the topic of paying for infrastructure I was encouraged to hear for miss nation at her confirmation hearing that she believes and I quote all options are on the table her words all options are on the table I welcome those words we also discussed several other policy related concerns the miss nation will need to begin addressing on day one at the federal highway administration too many pedestrians so many bicyclists 20 drivers put their lives at risk when they use our roadways two years ago in 2017 there were more than 70,000 37,000 there were more than 37,000 fatalities on our nation's roadways in that same year nearly 7,000 non-motorized users uterus users were killed that is unacceptable I was encouraged that during her confirmation hearing this nation promised that she would have a focus on safety at the agency and work closely with Nitza and others to improve information sharing with states with localities and tribal communities too many Americans mr. president lack access to reliable transit or safe places to walk or to bike and in some states my state we've done a lot in the last 2025 years a lot more to do and frankly other we can learn from other states and maybe one or two of them can learn from us meanwhile our country's public transportation networks should connect people to Commerce and opportunity in every zip code not just some of them in every zip code inter many instances disadvantaged communities are spatially disconnected from commerce and from opportunity lower income neighborhoods are often far from good-paying job opportunities or safe and dependable transit options don't exist for those working outside of an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. schedule our country's public transportation networks should lift up disadvantaged communities lift them up federal highway administration must be a strong federal partner in that effort too many drivers lack access to charging stations for electric vehicles and hydrogen hydrogen fueling stations for for fuel cell powered vehicles this is especially frustrating for those those who made a homemade investments in this technology but may not have feasible options to use those investments mr. president that brings us to the glaring reality of climate change in its worsening impact on our infrastructure our vehicles travel patterns exacerbate the effects of climate change mobile sources our nation's larger largest source of greenhouse gas emissions I want to say that again our vehicles and travel patterns accelerate and exacerbate the effects of climate change and mobile sources our cars our trucks our vans our nation's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in this country and on the planet meanwhile increasingly frequent and extreme weather events are continuing to erode our transportation networks we've seen in my state my guess as we see it in every other state that's represented here sea level rise threatens the structural integrity and longevity of our roads and bridges I see it might we're the lowest lying state in America Delaware's seas are rising that's not a good combination the challenges are great but here's the good news so are the opportunities challenges are great but so are the opportunities today I'm supporting the nomination of mr. nation because I believe that the key to success of any organization any organization I've ever been a part of always leadership Navy state of Delaware governor here right now the federal highway administration needs a top leader and I believe in this nation they'll have one I think she I think and I hope about but I believe more than just hope I believe she's going to prove to be a partner with Congress and work with us to address some of the many challenges that I've laid out in the many challenges before us before us in the months and years ahead I would call an Oliver College Democrat Republican couple of independents to devote to rise up later today when the vote is taken in the in vote in favor of her nomination

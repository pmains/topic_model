Mr chairman and um for having today's hearing and let me just Begin by saying that it's been a pleasure to lead this subcommittee with you these past couple of years and I look forward to continue working with you on a number of important issues before this subcommittee next Congress and one of those issues is ensuring that Americans have access to Reliable Broadband Services the expansion of these services to more rural areas has long been a priority of mine here in the United States Senate and since March of 2020 Congress has allocated billions of dollars for Broadband related Services through covid-19 pandemic relief packages and most recently through passage of the infrastructure bill has provided Broadband funding at a price tag of over 64 billion dollars the nearly 80 billion for Broadband specific projects on top of the billions of dollars the FCC disperses annually under its Universal service fund is an unprecedented amount of money the good news is that for those areas where certain connectivity challenges remain unresolved this funding in addition to the sustained Investments made by telecommunications providers across the country should help close the digital divide the bad news is that this funding has spread out over 15 separate agencies and 133 programs with the Lion's Share of the funding going through ntia this is deeply concerning as I argue in Congress debating was debating the infrastructure bill ntia has previously fumbled attempts to bring Broadband access to more communities back in 2009 the stimulus Bill allocated 4.7 billion dollars to ntia to expand Broadband access in Rural and underserved areas it didn't go very well the agency struggled with implementation there were serious issues with a number of the projects the agency approved other projects resulted in a significant amount of overbuilding meaning that they resulted in the construction of additional Broadband infrastructure and areas that already had access to Reliable Broadband at the taxpayers expense more recently last year ntia called for volunteers to help determine how to allocate the 1.5 billion dollars Congress provided ntia for certain Broadband programs that's unacceptable and I'm afraid without stringent oversight ntia will make and has already made the same mistakes when managing the 42.5 billion dollar Broadband Equity access and deployment program and tribal Broadband connectivity program that is why last week I began an oversight effort to review the numerous Federal Broadband programs oversight of how these dollars are being spent is necessary to avoid agencies misusing billions of taxpayer dollars more importantly to ensure the funding is actually going to areas that are truly unserved if there are changes that need to be made to the various programs Congress has established we need to get to work to make sure they are as effective as possible and that they work as Congress intended one such program we've begun work begun work to make necessary improvements to as usda's reconnect program I was pleased to partner with chair Luhan and Senators Klobuchar and Fisher in introducing the rural internet Improvement act legislation that will streamline usda's Broadband authorities and Target funding to areas most in need we must also recognize the federal government will not solve the digital divide on its own it's important we maintain a regulatory framework that promotes investment and allows telecommunications companies to make the kind of choices that have resulted in strong networks unlike other countries Broadband providers in the United States were able to keep Americans connected when demands for fixed and mobile networks soared during the pandemic this is largely because of the United States light touch regulatory approach to broadband policy which has incentivized the private sector to make Network reliability affordability and resiliency a priority finally we must tackle permitting hurdles that delay the build out of broadband infrastructure my mobile now act which was signed into law in 2018 has been an effective tool in moving the federal government in the right direction but I continue to hear concerns about an unnecessary delays and costs associate associated with Broadband permitting the agency's processing permitting requests need to be held accountable if they're not meeting deadlines which is why today I'm sending requests to several federal agencies on the steps that they've taken to implement mobile now's Broadband citing mandates for too long we've talked about bridgeting bridgeting I should say the digital divide it's time to actually do it and the only way that happens is if this committee actually utilizes important oversight responsibilities to ensure that agencies under its jurisdiction make smart targeted Investments that use taxpayer dollars responsibly anything short of that will result in government waste leaving Americans still unconnected I want to thank each of the witnesses for being here today and I look forward to the discussion thank you Mr chairman

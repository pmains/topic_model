hi i'm congressman roger williams i represent the 25th congressional district of texas i am a small business owner and a member of the house financial services committee this week the house of representatives will vote to repeal the estate tax jason furman the chairman of president obama's council of economic advisers recently told reporters a repeal of the estate tax is quote not even a tax cut for employers well as an employer of 120 i can tell you mr furman is wrong he's dead wrong the estate tax otherwise known as the death tax is one of the most unfair taxes implemented by the u.s government not only does it hinder job growth it's a form of double taxation that tears apart family businesses and discourages charitable giving let me explain what i mean in 1939 a man started a car dealership to realize the american dream when he died he passed the ownership on to his son three days after he passed away the irs visited the sun and demanded he pay the federal government 55 percent of the value of the estate because the value of the father's businesses was not held in cash the son nearly had to declare bankruptcy fortunately he was able to pull the resources together to keep his father's dealership afloat which he still runs to this day that son is me as a business owner 44 years i see firsthand the effects of washington's failed policies on job creators every single day we are all aware of government waste recent scandals have highlighted lavish entertainment expenses for already overpaid government bureaucrats by taking billions of dollars from americans pockets the irs is trading in job creation charitable giving for big government is this where my father's hard-earned money is going to as your congressman i'm committed to protecting the free market personal choice and our individual freedoms as a business owner i know what it takes to encourage job creation and i have a plan to do just that jumpstart america is a business perspective on true tax reform my plan will repeal the death tax lower personal tax rates so american families can keep more of their hard-earned money and lower the corporate tax rate so the united states can become competitive again in a global economy i believe in fairness and i will not give up i thank you for your time

>>> WELCOME BACK TO "STATE OF  THE UNION." THIS WINTER AS PRESIDENT BIDEN  WARNED THAT RUFGTS WAS PLANNING  AN ATTACK ON UKRAINE ONE OF THE  BIG FEARS HERE AT HOME WAS CYBER ATTACKS. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED ON A LARGE  SCALE YET. HERE WITH ME IS THE CHAIRMAN OF  THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE SENATOR MARK WARNER OF VIRGINIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT  SIGNER IN A MINUTE, BUT FIRST  LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S BIG SPEECH YESTERDAY IN POLAND. HE SAID MANY THINGS ABOUT  AUTOCRACY VERSUS DEMOCRACY BUT  THEN HE AD-LIBBED AT THE END  SAYING THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN  CANNOT REMAIN IN POWER. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS CLARIFIED  THAT SINCE, SAYING THAT THE  ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SUPPORT  REGIME CHANGE. DO YOU THINK THAT STATEMENT DID  ANY DAMAGE? >> DANA, THERE IS ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S TRYING TO MAKE REGIME  CHANGE IN EUROPE AND THAT'S  VLADIMIR PUTIN TRYING TO CHANGE  THE REGIME IN UKRAINE AND I  CANDIDLY AGREE WITH THE  UKRAINIAN PRIME MINISTER WHO  REALLY HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY. WE, AND NOT JUST WE, BUT  COUNTRIES AROUND THE WAR HAVE  CALLED OUT PUTIN AS A WAR  CRIMINAL, HE HAS BEEN SANCTIONED BY MANY, MANY NATIONS. WE ARE TRYING TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE G 20. NOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY THE  REGIME IN RUSSIA WILL BE  DETERMINED BY THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AND I HOPE THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE  WILL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS GOING  FORWARD. CLEARLY PUTIN HAS OVERPLAYED HIS HAND IN UKRAINE, RUSSIAN FORCES  ARE REELING AND I THINK THAT IS  PARTIALLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY ARE INVOLVED IN AN ILLEGAL WAR,  BUT IT WILL BE UP FOR THE  RUSSIAN PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT  DECISION. ONE THING ALSO THAT I THINK THAT THE UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR MADE  CLEAR AND I SEE THIS AS I TRAVEL AROUND VIRGINIA, THIS IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN A WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. WHAT THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE IN  MANY WAYS ARE DOING ARE FIGHTING WITH THEIR LIVES FOR THE KIND OF BASIC FREEDOMS THAT WE TAKE FOR  GRANTED, FREEDOM OF THE PRESS,  TO AGREE OR DISAGREE, HAVING  YOUR VOTES COUNTED. I HOPE WE ALL AS AMERICANS  REALIZE WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE  AND CONTINUE TO SHOW THIS UNITED SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE.  >> BUT AS A SENIOR AMERICAN  ELECTED OFFICIAL, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE STATED POLICY SHOULD BE REGIME CHANGE IN RUSSIA OR NOT? >> I THINK THE STATED POLICY IS  AS THE WHITE HOUSE HAS POINTED  OUT HAS NOT CHANGED. IT IS UP TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE  TO DETERMINE WHO IS GOING TO BE  IN POWER IN THE KREMLIN, BUT WE  HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS PUT RUSSIA  INTO A STATUS OF A PARIAH  NATION, WHO MOST OF THE  CIVILIZED WORLD HAS CALLED OUT  AS A WAR CRIMINAL AND CLEARLY  THE RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE NOT  PERFORMING AS IF THEY WERE  FOLLOWING A LEGITIMATE APPROACH. >> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT CYBER. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNING FOR YEARS  SCREAMING FROM THE ROOFTOPS  ABOUT CYBER ATTACKS. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID THAT WEEK  THAT RUSSIA'S CYBER CAPACITY IS, QUOTE, FAIRLY CONSEQUENTIAL AND  IT'S COMING. CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT RUSSIA AND WHAT THEIR PLANS VIS-A-VIS A  CYBER ATTACK ON THE U.S. WOULD  LOOK LIKE ON BUSINESSES, ON  INFRASTRUCTURE, ON GOVERNMENT? >> WELL, LET'S BREAK THIS INTO  TWO CATEGORIES, FIRST OF ALL, WE DO KNOW THE RUSSIAN CYBER  CAPABILITIES ARE TOP NOTCH. WE'VE BEEN THE VICTIM WHEN WE  SEE THE RUSSIAN CYBER CRIMINALS  LIKE THE COLONIAL PIPELINE AND  MANY OTHER RUSSIAN CYBER  ATTACKS. THE RUSSIANS HAVE NOT LAUNCHED  THAT I CAN A TEAM CYBER ATTACKS  AGAINST UKRAINE. IT'S REMARKABLE TO ME THAT THE  INTERNET IS STILL OPERATING AND  THAT WORLD PRESS IS STILL  GETTING IMAGES OUT OF UKRAINE. I WAS HORRIBLY AFRAID THAT  RUSSIA WOULD COME IN AND SHUT  DOWN ALL THE POWER SYSTEMS, SHUT DOWN THE INTERNET AND THAT SOME  OF THOSE CYBER TOOLS WOULD BLEED INTO EASTERN POLAND, LITERALLY  POTENTIALLY SHUT DOWN --  >> WHY HAVEN'T THEY? >> WE DON'T HONESTLY HAVE A GOOD ANSWER YET.  >> REALLY? U.S. INTELLIGENCE DOESN'T KNOW? >> THIS IS A QUESTION THAT WE  ARE CONSTANTLY POSING. NOW, DID THEY THINK THEY WERE  GOING TO WIN TOO EASILY? SOME OF THESE CYBER TOOLS WHEN  YOU PUT THEM INTO THE WILD THEY  DON'T RESPECT GEOGRAPHIC  BOUNDARIES, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT  WOULD HAPPEN WITH A CYBER  ESCALATION, MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN  SAVING THEM TO USE AGAINST US. I DO THINK PRESIDENT BIDEN IS  CORRECT THIS SAYING AMERICANS  NEED TO BE READY, WE HAVE  INCREASED OUR SHIELDS, FINALLY  CONGRESS PASSED A LAW THAT HE  SIGNED THAT REQUIRES IF YOU ARE  ATTACKED IN A CYBER DOMAIN YOU  HAVE TO REPORT WOT GOVERNMENT SO WE CAN SHARE WITH PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS BUT I THINK  PARTICULARLY IN THE FINANCE  SECRETARY ERR AND ENERGY SECTOR  WE NEED TO BE PREPARED BECAUSE  AN A TIER OFFENSE CAN OFTENTIMES OVERCOME A DEFENSE, THE QUESTION IS HOW QUICKLY CAN WE THEN STAND BACK UP OUR SYSTEMS.  >> YOU SAY AMERICANS NEED TO BE  PREPARED. IF RUSSIA DOES LAUNCH A CYBER  ATTACK AGAINST AMERICA OR ANY  NATO COUNTRY, WOULD THAT TRIGGER ARTICLE 5 WHICH IS AN ATTACK ON  ONE NATO COUNTRY IS AN ATTACK ON AND WOULD THAT REQUIRE FROM A  RESPONSE? >> THERE ARE CYBER ATTACKS FROM  RUSSIA AND CHINA GOING ON ON A  DAILY BASIS FOR YEARS.  >> WHEN AND HOW SHOULD THE U.S.  RESPOND? >> IN TERMS OF LITERALLY CAUSING LOSS OF LIFE THERE'S STRATEGIC  AMBIGUITY ABOUT WHAT IS DEFINED  AS AN ARTICLE 5 VIOLATION. I THINK THAT IS STILL AN  APPROPRIATE GRAYNESS AT THIS  POINT.  >> WHEN DOES IT BECOME  UNAMBIGUOUS? >> THAT WAS WHAT I WAS AFRAID  OF, IF THEY SHUT DOWN THE  SYSTEMS IN UKRAINE AND IT BLED  INTO EASTERN POLAND AND  HOSPITALS WERE SHUT DOWN AND  POLISH CITIZENS WERE DYING OR  AMERICAN TROOPS WERE IN SOME  KIND OF ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE  POWER SYSTEMS GO DOWN AND  AMERICAN TROOPS ARE KILLED  BECAUSE OF THE REACTION TO A I  BELIEVE SOOER ATTACK, THAT GETS  US INTO AN AREA WHERE WE ARE,  AGAIN, IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY.  >> CRYPTO, ONE OF THE MAIN  CONCERNS -- MAJOR CONCERNS IS  THAT RUSSIA MIGHT BE ABLE TO  EVADE WESTERN SANCTIONS BY USING CRYPTOCURRENCY. YOU JUST INTRODUCED A PLAN TO  TRY TO STOP PUTIN FROM DOING  THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT THAT IS AN  ACTIVE STRATEGY RIGHT NOW IN  RUSSIA? >> I THINK DIGITAL CURRENCIES  AND DISTRIBUTED LEDGER HAVE A  GREAT, GREAT OPPORTUNITY, BUT  IT'S REALLY VERY OPAQUE AT THIS  POINT. FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW THERE ARE TEN MAJOR CRYPTO EXCHANGES  AROUND THE WORLD, TWO OF THEM  ARE BASED IN AMERICA SO WHEN WE  PUT OUR SANCTIONS REGIME IN  PLACE, THOSE CRYPTO EXCHANGES  GOT COVERED, THE OTHER EIGHT  DIDN'T. AND WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT,  WHETHER THE FOREIGN CRYPTO  EXCHANGES OR WHAT'S CALLED DEFY  THE CENTRALIZED FINANCE WHICH IS THE WILD, WILD WEST THAT RUSSIAN LEADERS, OLIGARCHS CAN FIND WAYS AROUND SOME OF OUR SANCTIONS. WE'RE TRYING TO SIMPLY PUT SOME  RULES IN PLACE NOT TO BE AGAINST CRYPTOCURRENCIES PER SE, BUT TO  MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT  BLEEDING OUT THEIR WEALTH TO  THOSE TWO.  >> MR. CHAIRMAN BEFORE I LET YOU GO WE ARE UNDERSTANDABLY FOCUSED ON UKRAINE AND RUSSIA BUT I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT  AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE THE TALIBAN  BLOCKED THE GIRLS ABOVE SIXTH  GRADE FROM RETURNING TO SCHOOLS  ON WEDNESDAY AND JUST HOURS --  IT HAPPENED JUST HOURS AFTER  SCHOOLS WERE SUPPOSED TO REOPEN  FOR THEM. THE STATE DEPARTMENT CALLED IT A BETRAYAL, A TOP U.S. DIPLOMATE  SAID, FRANKLY IT CAUGHT US BY  SURPRISE. DID IT CATCH YOU BY SURPRISE AS  THE INTELLIGENCE CHAIR? >> NOTHING THE TALIBAN DOES  CATCHES ME BY SURPRISE. THIS IS A BRUTAL, AWFUL REGIME. I SAW SOME OF THE REPORTS, GIRLS TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED NOT BEING  ABLE TO RETURN TO SCHOOL. WE NEED TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON. I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT  WE IN VIRGINIA ARE ACTUALLY --  HERE IN LOUDOUN COUNTY, THE  PLACE THAT IS CONTINUING TO TAKE IN AFGHAN REFUGEES. WE LITERALLY HAVE GOTTEN 130,000 PEOPLE OUT OF AFGHANISTAN. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THOSE REFUGEES GET A

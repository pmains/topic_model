yesterday out of ukraine or perhaps more accurately a publicity stunt from the biden administration with ukraine saying u.s secretary of state blinken and secretary of defense austin met with president zielinski today and kiev so basically exactly what boris johnson did two weeks ago except nothing like as inspiring here to react florida congressman and u.s army veteran mike walsh i mean what did you make of this um blink and austin secretly i mean it wasn't even it was zolensky that confirmed well i don't think it's even been confirmed by our governor and it's it's kind of feels very odd well they probably think to confirm the visit uh it would be too provocative to putin too escalatory uh and too offensive uh to putin's sensibilities so once again we have the europeans leading the way we have congress leading the way multiple members of congress have gone so i guess eventually the administration was shamed into it by sending some some leaders to really stand in solidarity with zielinski who's been standing on the front line fighting from day one but steve you know what i want to know is when you have these high level visits like this you need to come with deliverables you mentioned boris johnson he delivered anti-ship missiles that the ukrainians have been begging for since last year and we haven't provided he delivered armored vehicles that we haven't provided so what are they going to deliver and from blinken's standpoint i would hope that he's finally going to get serious about sanctions cut off the russian oil and gas yes exactly that are in all of our sanctions and go after the back doors with china with brazil with south africa we can go down the list and let's get serious about going after putin's war machine that's what i would hope their trip would be all about but right now it's just kind of radio silence it's very odd because well maybe it's not on it but actually that's completely the wrong term it's entirely predictable with these people because we saw it before with the obama people you know that this sort of you know became a joke didn't it leading from behind but you know that's really how they seem to think it's the same team around it that's how they seem to think about stuff it's like we're not going to really put anything at real we're not going to go out there they really are they believe in this stuff yeah well look when i was out there last year every single request the ukrainians made was met with the response from the white house to escalatory and too provocative now you have putin demonstrating his newest most modern icbm that can you can put a hypersonic on it that can defeat our defenses and our response from the bite administration has been to hide our capabilities peace is kept by demonstrating your strength by demonstrating that we have a nuclear arsenal too and therefore you better not even think about using yours but instead we keep giving putin more and more and more space to escalate and and finally from if we have our defense secretary out there let's give zielinski everything he needs to win instead steve we're helping him play to a tie putin is going to gobble up everything he can in the east go to the negotiating table lick his wounds over the next four to five years and then he's going to be back more we have to help zielinski win once and for all exactly well said congressman great to see you as always thank you

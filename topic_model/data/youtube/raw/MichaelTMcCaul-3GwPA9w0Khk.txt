um the question for chris in terms of information sharing i know that the energy sector is pretty far ahead and doing a really good job on sharing horizontally plus ministries and also things i mean what do you think i really want to stay away from sector generalizations everybody's a little bit different how they handle that from from an energy perspective information sharing is important it's important that we are sharing information with our appointed we are peers in commission sharing opportunities that are already out there that exist there are a number of participation opportunities that we've taken advantage of dhs we've participated in uh they have an ec program they have a control systems security evaluation uh team incumbent will come down and look at your uh your program and evaluate against the metrics and industry standards um we've been able to participate in intelligence community briefings at the classified level and you know we're in a very close coordination with our regulator the esi sac episode information is very important the most important fundamentals of information sharing is what you do with that information once you get it if you get classified information what does the backend system look like behind that information that's going to evaluate the threat determine what systems are impacted how many systems where are they located and how fast you can find information so our focus is to look outward to getting knowledge and information sharing but is to look at our back-end process how quickly can we respond threats from us sir something a peer may make house or something we detect ourselves it's the the back end has to run like hey well oh machine and yes you have to know the environment very very well and or any kind of information sharing with you effectively actually tommy in a minute here there are great examples of information sharing between public and private sector and there are places where we could do much better your job on a daily basis is to look at the threat look at how it continues to evolve and mutate where do you see the need right now for better information sharing what do you see as some of the um some of the vehicles if you will to do that very very good you know i just have to leave a little early i get to be transformed from somebody else to speak to someone who does some staff work for someone who's senior to me so i've got to start doing that in five by many cases it's a great question we see a lot of successful information sharing in place today across the board one of the objectives of the roger rupertsburger bill though is to in many ways put in place the right authorities that at least for our industry will help us really drive real-time information sharing whereby we can share our data sets that we see in the private sector with the data sets that the government sees and then the goal is to put in place the right technical measures to scrub the sources and methods the iccs and then if you do that and do it well you can uh reduce the time that the perpetrators of the threats have the ability to name your systems you know it's all about iding the unknown malware early and reacting you know in 24 hours or hopefully less or not at all so i think there's great scope for this real-time information sharing with january really executing machine-to-machine capabilities to improve the ability of the country to detect itself i have a question on supply chain logistics but i'll give the audience another opportunity ask andy hall please philosophical question my name is thank you bradley rotter air patrol corporation many of us in the battle of cyber are certainly resigned to the fact that this may be the first war in history that can't be won i'd be very interested in the opinion of your your pamphlets is it possible will the pieces be put together in such a fashion that this war can be born and this problem put a set aside so i'm going down the panel here frank fire away because everyone has a perspective based on the industry that they're in yikes so my initial reaction i i think all of us that are here we'll need that in fact it's it's a clearly need for for total collaboration um industry government academia and all of us looking at it from uh from a comprehensive getting our hounds around the whole problem space i think when you look at the resources of what we've done in our history there hasn't been anything where we said ooh that looks hard let's not do that so you know back to the 50s right so in the day there's nothing that daunting is just getting the mind share and resources all pulling in the same direction i think i i certainly hope that within x number of years we will have information exchange sharing back to simplified like watching tv and talking on your telephone is that reality i'm not sure but i do believe that in my heart that's where we're headed it's really a good question by the way and i know you referring pretty well um i guess i answer your question with the question how do you define winning just like with business how do you find success you know you may miss a financial metric by attempting a point and you may not be considered successful that's really how you could find women i think one of the metrics was mentioned earlier about intellectual property laws a trillion dollars just absolutely huge and think what that really does to a growing craving balance right um you know the the issue that that we as the countrywide issues that we're faced with is that many other nation states it's perfectly legal to do what they're doing the government may endorse it and embrace it so it really gets that question how do we define winning is the reduction in intellectual property loss every year is it a reduction in financial loss by by criminals to your point about actuarial data earlier frank which i totally agree with by the way you know cyber is still kind of a new emerging industry when you think about it and one thing we are faced with still today we don't have significant actuarial data to help us make effective decisions frank you were talking about prioritization based on a risk model how do i define rosi right return on security investment i need more actuarial data how did i reduce my probability of getting hacked based on that was the typical loss per incident so based on my security investment i have some appreciation for what that return is that allows the leaders of any organization whether it's a government entity or a company to rationalize their decisions but sorry to dwell on this but really i'd answer the question how do we define women and that's something for our nation to undertake quite frankly so it's a difficult question to answer from a financial sector perspective criminal criminal activity and fraud frankly they don't go away and how criminals conduct their activities you know they've changed we as a society do not tolerate bank robberies in the traditional sense and the conviction rate is equal to the task it's very high in the cyber world we're just beginning the the journey on how we're going to handle that as a society and how we're going to handle that as a global society i think that there is a need for increased international cooperation and improvements in the criminal code and uh criminal penalties so i i i think that this is really needs to really need to take a look at that this is a criminal activity and it's fraud and beyond that you know we need to be able to be able to identify and prosecute them

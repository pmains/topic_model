our next guest is a member of the newly created select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government let's bring in Florida congresswoman Kat kamek she's also on the house committee on Energy and Commerce and the house agriculture committee as I was reading that it struck me how sad it is that we have to have a committee with that name a committee a subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government congresswoman you know John it is sad but necessary that we go after the investigators that are investigating Americans illegally abusing their power you know at times it's necessary for Congress to really dig into the authorities and jurisdiction that they have and really hold folks accountable because that's what the American people expect and that's what they deserve so we have a broad jurisdiction we're going to follow the evidence and go after those that have sought to impede or infringe on the constitutional rights of all Americans and I'm excited and honored to be a part of the 12 that were selected for this particular committee so the the thinking is that this is a government that is going after its own citizens who are supposed to be you know the the the repository of power in the government it's our government yeah exactly you know and that's that's the crazy part you know I spent my first two years in Congress on the homeland security committee where repeatedly we had hearings where government officials individuals from uh the homeland security committee and others came forward and said that domestic extremism and domestic terrorism was the number one threat to the United States and then I would hear that parents who were concerned about their children's education they were showing up to PTA meetings or to school board meetings they were being labeled domestic terrorists and then of course if you were on Twitter or any social media and you posted a dissenting opinion that was contrary to the CDC or heaven forbid you posted about the hunter Biden laptop story you were censored or Shadow banned or shut down completely and that was really the collusion between the Biden Administration and the FBI putting pressure on Twitter Executives to censor these stories really it's pretty concerning because this is a government that is supposed to work for the people not Target them the head of that news subcommittee Jim Jordan of Ohio he has some concerns in particular with the FBI take a listen and their the select committee has some non-judiciary committee members on it members from the intelligence committee the Energy and Commerce Committee and Homeland Security are part of that committee the weaponization is is we have that because of what we've seen in in various agencies over the last couple years I'll just take the FBI for example the FBI spied on the president's campaign altered evidence in front of the fisa court paid a confidential human Source even after they knew that confidential human Source had lied to him the FBI has targeted parents the FBI as has done a number of things you know I'm one of those who grew up admiring and respecting the men and women of the FBI and now you have to wonder what's going on inside that agency well and that's exactly it John you know I think you and I and so many millions of Americans feel the exact same way we have tremendous respect for so many of the rank and file agents that do great work around the country but what we are concerned about is the top brass those that are seeking to push a political agenda down into the field offices where you're seeing reclassification of cases to push a political agenda case in point this domestic extremism these domestic terrorism cases when we should be focusing on things like the open border where we have seen just last year over a hundred individuals on the international terrorist watch list being apprehended we can legislate and investigate all at the same time this Republican Congress is going to prove that we're going to handle the issues like addressing crime securing the Border getting our energy policies straight while simultaneously holding those accountable that seek to weaponize our government agencies against the very people that they're supposed to be serving and so we've got a long road ahead of us but man it is more important than ever that we get this right our constitutional rights are under attack but for instance on the hunter Biden laptop Story the Department of Justice hasn't seemed to show any particular interest in in looking into that uh is Congress going to be your subcommittee really going to be able to get answers that that maybe other federal agencies either aren't looking for or don't want to reveal you know that's the great thing about the way that this particular select committee was structured we have vast and Broad jurisdiction along with subpoena power we're covering all elements of the federal government and we have been taking in whistleblower after whistleblower who's come forward with evidence and testimony that hasn't been readily available through foia request for example more people are coming forward as this committee has been stood up over the last week and a half two weeks and that's critically important because as you said the hunter Biden laptop story that was suppressed with Twitter with the FBI helping and putting pressure on Twitter and then of course we saw the political implications of that we know that they have been complicit in making sure that certain stories like the hunter Biden story stayed quiet because of political reasons because there was an impending election we saw how there was release of certain information that had been manufactured by that agency just before for an election so clearly we are seeing the political politicization of these agencies affecting everyday life affecting policy and I think every American deserves that accountability and transparency to know that there isn't corruption at the highest levels of government but so far the evidence is pretty damning it's shattering the trust of the American people is what it's done Florida representative Kat camek congresswoman thank you

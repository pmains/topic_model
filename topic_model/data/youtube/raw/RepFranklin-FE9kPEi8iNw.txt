thank you mr chairman and thank you to our witnesses today i really appreciate the effort you put into your testimony i found it all to be very informative um attorney general grey wall and looking at your comments um your testimony i see that you um you made an assessment that new jersey classifies white supremacists extremists and homegrown violent extremists as the most persistent hostile actors in the state and that was after the background you gave in your testimony you started with timothy mcveigh which i think for most for myself as an adult that was my first uh clear memory of domestic terrorism though i mean obviously back in the 60s we had the weather underground and other groups like that but that was a very significant event timothy mcveigh was clearly at least from what we learned of him um a white supremacist he was also anti-government uh you also referenced um the the attack in new jersey in 2019 that killed six and that was actually perpetrated by an african-american anti-semite uh you referenced the gentleman well not gentlemen but mr brahimi from new jersey he was arrested january 6. he's currently awaiting trial on a number of charges and then also the um the parkland shooting in florida that was attributed to a person with severe mental illness that that should have never happened and that was known and uh had the system worked uh you know that tragedy could have been avoided but i was i was kind of puzzled from your testimony to how you drew that white supremacy is such as the overarching threat to the state of new jersey and then i thought well maybe uh you made a reference to um a um a source that was cited also in this memorandum about the hearing we have today that was done by uh depart department of homeland uh securities the homeland threat assessment and in that assessment so i went looking for that thinking well surely there must be a lot of meat uh on that document there that i'd like to learn about what we received was an unclassified summary of a document so i have to assume that if we got an executive summary there's an underlying document this was unclassified our staff tried for a couple of days to dig that up we're finally told no we can't get that there's not an unclassified but apparently there's a classified document which i think would be very informative for this committee i would love to know what that document uh gets into i think it's something we should have a follow-up meeting about but within the the the bowlitized executive summary it says um the intelligence community assesses uh that u.s racial and ethnically motivated violent extremists with um who promote superiority the white race are the domestic violent extremist actors with the most persistent and concerning transnational connections the reason and the reasoning it cites is because they have similar ideological beliefs with people outside the united states and they frequently communicate with and seek to influence one another i to me i'm not really sure how those those two criteria there justify white supremacists being the most violent threat that we face as a country but i'm sure there's more in that classified document that i would hope we get to but you know when we look at events that have happened over the um well also the the the document makes further reference to other groups uh domestic violent extremists racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists animal rights environmental violent extremists abortion related violent extremists anti-government anti-authority violent extremists and then all other domestic terrorism threats so this this dhs document refers to a lot of different threats with white supremacy only being one of those and yet that seems to be the only topic the only focus of this hearing today that's a little concerning to me but moving on to uh professor simi i really appreciated your work obviously you spent a lot of years studying this topic and i found that be very informative um you you talked about timothy mcveigh as well the olympic bombings but then uh you mentioned that had the perpetrators been people of color or muslim you could be sure the response would have been dramatically different so i actually had our staff do a little research over the last couple days pulling domestic attacks just over the last 10 years and we really do become desensitized to this as a country i started going and there were at least 15 here but i've got to tell you you know some are high profile like the boston marathon bombing uh obviously that was a muslim extremist we had the san bernardino california shooting that killed 14 muslim extremists there the orlando nightclub shooting just down the road for me in florida central florida that killed 49 people also not white supremacy new york city truck attack in 2017 that killed eight again not white supremacy now there are examples of that and i'm not trying to say that there there aren't but there's a lot of violence in our country and a lot of people are being killed unnecessarily and yet we're choosing to zero in on a very small piece of this i know i'm almost out of time but um professor christine i'd love to hear your comments about what are terrorist extremists look like because it seems to me and to cite uh you know not not spitting on dr king's grave i have tremendous respect for him i think he would be ashamed of what's been happening in our country he would have never condoned two billion dollars of violence in a two-week period last year but it does make me wonder when you say um extremism and terrorism are not about what you look like extremism and terrorism are defined by a person's beliefs feelings and characters and just a question for you sir would it be fair to summarize that as saying that it's about a person's character and not the color of their skin okay the gentleman's time has expired but you can answer that dr seaman thanks for the question that would be fair in terms of what i'm trying to get it's about beliefs feelings and behavior not about what we think in our mind an extremist or terrorist looks like based on our preconceived notions and our biases and you know there is research that shows for instance of mainstream media outlets do treat uh acts of violence differently based on race and religion ethnicity of of the perpetrators so we do have you know these biases that are swirling around that affect how we see different types of violence i'm not suggesting that there aren't various sorts of different acts of violence committed by a whole host of different actors but we treat different kinds based on race ethnicity religion and other characteristics differently than the kind that we're talking about here today in terms of white supremacist and anti-government militia extremism thank you mr chairman i apologize for going along

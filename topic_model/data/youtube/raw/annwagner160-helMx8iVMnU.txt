missour miss Wagner Thank You Madame chairwoman for holding this hearing today on the heartbreaking crisis of homelessness which affects every community in America last year I was honored to visit loaves & Fishes the longest operating homeless shelter in st. Louis County I witnessed firsthand their tremendous work to help those who are experiencing economic hardships Catholic Charities of st. Louis st. Patrick's Center and so many other organizations in the st. Louis area are coming alongside disadvantaged and marginalized populations to help people get back on their feet I am eager to work with this committee madam chairwoman and this year to advance accessible and affordable housing for those who need it most in the st. Louis region and across the country I'm proud the Catholic Charities Saint Louis has just been selected to participate in a five-year healthy housing initiative to reduce chronic homelessness and frequent ER visits this multi-million dollar initiative is being led in collaboration with the st. Louis the st. Patrick's Center the Archdiocese of st. Louis Incarnate Word Foundation Mercy BJC HealthCare and SSM health care dr. Lucas I believe that local collaboration like this between hospitals and shelters can complement the goals of the federal programs what can policymakers learn from these types of collaborative programs well thank you for your question we certainly have learned that being able to collaborate not just in the efforts but in the sharing of data on what is being done frankly will take a step toward identifying what works and so there have been some investments in developing systemic responses where there are many stakeholders at the local level involved and those are the kind of things that right now only a fraction of resources are being devoted to relative to the six billion dollars that are already being spent each year on on this issue so many of these partners are in fact on the front lines and to share the data to share the information I think helps all fighting sex trafficking and providing services for women and girls who are trying to piece their lives back together is one of my very very top priorities here in Congress I'm currently working on legislation to increase the availability of housing to human trafficking victims Ms Roman I know your organization's or miss Darlie one or the other have been supportive of legislation to provide housing to runaway and homeless youth is there space for local housing authorities to partner with anti trafficking service providers to provide better assistance to victims of trafficking and can you discuss how we can most effectively provide housing to trafficking victims Robyn what does briefly and thank you for the question again I think housing really is a solution to so many of these problems and there's absolutely space for housing authorities to be working with organizations that are trying to prevent trafficking and I think targeting some of the PHA resources more to the most vulnerable people across the board would probably improve a lot of outcomes these are tremendously an important issue though as you point out thank you miss Darlene do you concur all right I would have to agree women experiencing homelessness living in a shelter or out in the open unfortunately are the most vulnerable individuals even sometimes more so than children but children are a part of the trafficking also so there's room for that Thank You mr. Lee I'm dr. Lucas you wrote in your testimony that the federal government has increased its investments in combating homelessness in recent years but we unfortunately haven't seen the results we may have expected can you briefly discuss local policy decisions that are hindering progress and contributing to the homelessness crisis throughout the country well thank you for that question as I mentioned briefly there is a fair amount of rigorous evidence that land use regulations that make it more difficult to expand the supply of housing have a very significant effect on our high predictors very strong predictors of rates of homelessness for one all right thank you I do you believe that there is a one-size-fits-all federal approach that is outdated and needs to be replaced sir well in many ways certain inputs the types of programs we do have been prioritized rather than the outputs that they're being that they're yielding so in that sense yes thank you I appreciate I yield back

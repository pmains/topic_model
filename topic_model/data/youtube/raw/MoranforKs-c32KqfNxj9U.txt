you know I visit with Kansans all the time and the most common conversation I have these days isn't about the price of wheat or a grant for a local business they say Jerry I'm worried about the future of our country what's it going to be like for my kids and my grandkids there's an anger frustration a genuine fear about where our nation is headed about politics really about politicians who have led us down why have we let the insiders those who are satisfied with the status quo take the front seat while our conservative values changing course stopping the president take the back seat now for me public service has never been about going to Washington DC to make friends with power brokers or the ambitious title seekers I fly back to the capital each week to stand against those who spend recklessly surrender continually and tax repeatedly and I've done that not just with this president but also my own party who have retreated from our values but we still have an awful lot of work to do and the stakes for our children and grandchildren couldn't be higher that's why I'm filing for reelection the United States Senate and I'll be clear about this we don't do this for a title we don't do this about a sign on the door that says US senator rather it's for a belief that we can and must return America to a country different and better than it is today you and I have been asked to do something with our lives that truly makes a difference to rise to a higher calling we know this calling it's something we feel down deep inside of us it is the demand that it is on us as American citizens as conservatives can't look the other way do not turn it over to somebody else or to quit so today I'm asking you to stand with me to not quit and to redouble those efforts not just merely to continue the fight but to win i'm gerry moran and i approve this message

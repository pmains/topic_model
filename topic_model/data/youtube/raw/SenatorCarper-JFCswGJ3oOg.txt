thank you sir i uh i rise today to speak in support of senate uh joint resolution 14 which we will vote on later today i want to thank senator heinrich senator markey senator king for their leadership on this resolution and i might be mistaken mr mr president but i understand when you were governor of colorado you might have been present at the creation of this point of view that's expressed in the resolution before so uh maybe salutes colorado the american people rely on the u.s environmental protection agency to ensure that our nation has clean air clean water and clean environment in a safe climate unfortunately in 2020 under the previous administration the epa strayed from its emission any number of times one of those missteps was that agency's methane recision rule which deregulated methane emissions from oil and gas industry our nation's largest industrial source of this dangerous greenhouse gas by passing this resolution congress today will reject and nullify this dangerous rule and restore clean air and climate protections from a nation's largest sources of methane pollution let me explain what methane is and why it's so harmful to our climate and to our health methane is a super pollutant it damages our lungs and our planet compared to carbon dioxide methane is a small part of our overall greenhouse gas emissions having said that though scientists tell us that methane is responsible for roughly get this one-quarter of the man-made global warming that we're witnessing today let me say that again methane is responsible for roughly one-quarter of the man-made global warming that we're experiencing and witnessing today over 20-year period methane is 84 times more harmful to our climate than carbon dioxide 84 times for small molecule methane punches above its weight when it comes to its contributions to climate change the oil and gas industry is our nation's largest source of methane responsible for nearly 30 of total methane emissions for comparison this amount of methane pollution has the same climate effect as the emissions from a nation's entire fleet of passenger vehicles in a year in addition to damaging our climate methane emissions also contribute to ground level ozone known as smog breathing in smog harms our lungs it aggravates lung diseases like bronchitis and asthma exposure to smog has been linked to premature death and children and elderly are particularly vulnerable to these health risks if we want to meaningfully tackle the danger to our health and our climate we need to reduce methane emissions from the entire oil and gas sector in 2016 as i was alluding to earlier mr president epa acted to do just that building on state actions such as colorado was former chief executives presiding at this moment ap for the epa put into place common sense clean air act regulations that required the oil and gas industry to update its equipment the rule also required the industry to inspect frequently in order to find and repair leaks and malfunctions that are such a big source of our methane problem based on feedback from the oil and gas industry meeting these new emission requirements did not place an undue burden on companies that raise cost for consumers in fact many oil and gas companies and industry groups supported the measures and they still do that's why it's so surprising it was so surprising when in september of 2020 epa issued the final methane rescission rule to roll back what so many believe to be common sense as a common sense approach for reducing methane risks while the trump administration moved forward with this damaging policy the consequences of climate change were roiling roiling our nation california california for example experienced its worst wildfire season on record with foreign fires forest fires covering an area about the size of the state of rhode island other western states including oregon montana and colorado were ablaze with unprecedented damaging wildfires at the same time other parts of our country are being battered by violent extreme weather the people of iowa experience one of the most costly thunderstorms in history hurricane force winds caused seven and a half billion dollars in economic damage and flattened i'm told over half of that state's corn and soybean crops in one day coastal towns in southern states like florida like louisiana like south carolina were battered by hurricane after hurricane after hurricane in the summer of 2020 last summer we saw the most hurricanes of the atlantic ocean in recorded history despite all of this the trump administration took a step to undo one of the key tools available to us to combat methane emissions that contribute greatly to climate change the methane reset rescission rule was a stark departure from the widely accepted science-based and common sense view that we should protect people and our planet from the dangers of methane in promulgating the methane rescission rule the trump administration ignored the global scientific community including epa's own agency scientists who warned that the extreme weather events in 2020 were just the tip of the iceberg of consequences we can expect if we don't keep global warming below an increase of one and a half degrees celsius between now and 20 40. the bottom line is that the trump methane rescission rule would allow more methane pollution increase public health dangers and bring us ever closer to the brink of irreversible climate catastrophe it is a trump epa action that my colleagues and i reject today through the resolution before us the methane rescission rule stated methane couldn't be regulated under the clean air act we reject that the methane rescission rule stated epa couldn't regulate the entire oil and gas sector from wellhead to storage we reject that the methane rescission rule stated greenhouse gases couldn't be regulated we reject that the methane recision rule also reversed epa's long-standing position on what is required to regulate a pollutant making it harder for epa to implement clean air and climate protections we reject that as well with approval of this resolution though epa can and should still move forward to strengthen methane standards for the oil and gas sector in the future this effort is also very timely coming on the heels of president biden's climate commitment for our nation to reduce emissions by 50 from 2005 levels by the end of this decade by 2030. passing this resolution will be good for our health passing this resolution will be good for our planet and passing this resolution will be good for america's economy that's why so many states so many environmental groups and even a number of significant oil and gas companies support this resolution joining over 60 environmental groups as well as 20 states attorney general seven major oil and gas companies support today's resolution to reinstate requirements to control methane emissions from the environment environmental defense fund to shell from the league of conservation voters to bp from the natural resources a defense council to ecuador there is a broad consensus among the stakeholders with different interests different interests that congress should reject and nullify the methane rescission rule so why do a number of oil and gas companies want congress to reject the trump rule restore existing regulations and pursue further regulations they know the best way to boost growth in their sector and across the economy is to keep methane and other climate pollution in check with unchecked methane releases in its operations natural gas production and use become part of the climate problem not a part of the solution as we endeavor to drive toward lower carbon fuels companies know where the global market is heading they know regulations will support innovation and technology deployment in their industry bringing down emission reduction costs for everyone i sometimes like to uh to quote albert einstein who said among other things this he said an adversity lies opportunity think about that in adversity lies opportunity we can see that in the issue of methane pollution and climate change it presents plenty of challenges yes that's true but it also presents a remarkable opportunity it's an opportunity for us to protect our planet improve the air that we breathe and strengthen our economy at the same time the product that the oil and gas industry is capturing can be sold to fuel more homes and businesses across the country i want to say that again too at the same time the product that the oil and gas industry is capturing can be sold to fuel more homes and businesses across the country that's why today i will gladly vote for this decision for this resolution rather which reaffirmed that the clean air act requires epa to take action to protect americans from dangerous pollution like methane in passing this resolution today congress is rejecting the trump rule baseless interpretation of the clean air act and in its place reinstating common sense methane public health and climate protections across the entire oil and gas sector we're also clearing a path for additional protections from methane and other hazardous climate pollutants as a senate we're making our intent clearer the clean air act gives epa the authority and the mandate to establish methane emission standards even stronger the ones and we reinstate with this resolution this includes all facets of the oil and gas industry now and moving forward from product production to processing and from transmission to storage we're saying to epa loud and clear it is your mission to protect the environment to protect human health and public welfare from the dangers of climate pollutants like methane there is a lot of work still to do before that mission can be achieved it's time that we get to that work we don't have a lot of time to waste and mr uh mr president i have a couple of unanimous consent requests i'd like to offer oneness has placed supportive materials into the record and i ask unanimous consent mr president to enter into the record several materials in support of senate joint resolution 14 that's before us today first the biden administration statement of administration policy supporting passage of the uh resolution second two letters of support for passing this joint resolution one from the 57 leading environmental and advocacy groups and another the shell oil company these ladders demonstrate the breath of support for regulating this harmon pollution a pollutant and rejecting the methane precision rule i ask unanimous consent that these uh be inserted into the record as appropriate without objection that mr president i got to yield the floor but before i do i want to salute you for your all in an earlier day in an earlier an earlier place your state of colorado for helping to get this started or in your debt good work god bless and with that i yield the floor

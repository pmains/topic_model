i wanted to listen to the testimony because i have been very alarmed by the growing trend of politicization of access to capital over the last several years we have witnessed financial firms publicly commit not to do business with certain legal companies in politically unpopular industries like the fossil energy sector and these decisions were not based on the creditworthiness or the financial soundness of the borrower but rather we're driven by a number of non-pecuniary factors political pressure from vocal critics public relations pressure from activist groups the moral judgment of corporate leadership all contributed but none none of those factors should play a role in determining which legally operating business receives a loan from a bank or gets investments through retirement funds or has sold a commercial insurance policy any decision should be explicitly and exclusively dependent on objective risk-based underwriting standards the politicization of access to capital threatens jobs and compromises entire industries based on the misguided opinions of a select few if you would allow me the indulgence of just making one final editorial comment before my questions and that is i do not believe that this esg movement is in any way about managing climate related financial stress what i believe this is really about is about causing financial stress causing financial distress for particularly politically incorrect industries the coal industry in my home state of kentucky being a prominent example a victim and the workers there in a victim of political correctness and the politicization of access to capital and these mandatory climate disclosures are about are not about providing material information to investors they are about the government putting its heavy hand on the scale to discriminate against certain legally operating businesses to pick winners and losers in the marketplace and to politicize access to capital in case you didn't know where i stood uh i did want to just make that comment i do think individuals should have the freedom to contribute their resources to political social charitable causes i think it's fine if someone wants to invest in an esg fund or invest in a climate-related cause with their own dime but that's the individual's choice when such choices are made for shareholders by agents acting at the corporate level using the investor's own capital then at best we are inviting abuse resource misallocation malfeasance and inefficiency but at worst we are enabling a practice that looks a lot like theft theft from shareholders and investors the actual owners of the corporation by corporate directors and officers either voluntarily or through government mandate and redirecting their money their money and their resources away from the core mission of the company and into an unrelated political errand that to me is immoral it is offensive mr uh ramaswamy in your opinion should the moral judgments of investment managers banks and other financial firms dictate which legally operating firms get financing especially if those opinions are based on unrelated social causes with all respect i do not and and i think that that is a source of that is a conflict of interest that i believe is more material to investors than any of the other social factors that we have discussed today because if there's one thing that protects the integrity of our public capital markets it is making sure that investors are aware of the conflicts that a given ceo or manager bears when making decisions using shareholder capital and if one manager is going to use shareholder capital to burnish their personal reputational brand or or burnish their own social causes at the expense of other social causes investors ought to know about that sooner than they ought to about other broader social related climate risks or other mr ramaswamy last question here uh in terms of investor returns i have no issue if investors choose to allocate their money to esg funds if there's transparency and if there's a mark if there's an appetite for them um but i have a problem to asset managers who exclusively offer esg options and limit customers options to invest in in fossil energy for example as an alternative do you agree that investment advisors and retirement plan sponsors should advise their clients based on what will drive the highest returns or make clients aware if non-financial factors are driving particular asset allocation or investment advice i do worry that the investors are getting hosed because asset managers are are politicizing the allocation of their their their capital as opposed to maximizing shareholder uh value i i i agree with your comments and i believe that that's actually a relevant area for future inquiry with respect to disclosure requirements mr chairman thank you for allowing me to wave on and and i as you can tell i'm interested in this topic and i yield back thank you we

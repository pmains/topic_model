  IMPROVE HIS CHANCES.  >> WE HAVE TOM MALINOWSKI ON  THE LINE WITH US.  MORE THAN 95% OF THE VOTE.  BUT YOU ARE A CONGRESSMAN IN A  DISTRICT THAT THE GOP HELD FOR  NEARLY 40 YEARS BEFORE YOU  FLIPPED IT.  IT APPEARS YOU ARE GOING TO BE  UP AGAINST SENATOR TOM KEAN.  FIRST OF ALL, WELCOME,  CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PRIMARY  WIN.  HOW ARE YOU VIEWING THIS  GENERAL ELECTION?  IT WAS A TIGHT MATCHUP.  JUST ONE PERCENTAGE POINT SENT  YOU BOTH APART.  >> THAT'S RIGHT.  FIRST OF ALL, GREAT TO SEE YOU.  I HAVE BEEN ENJOYING YOUR  COMMENTARY.  IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER CLOSE  RACE.  AND IN NEW JERSEY RIGHT HERE,  THIS IS THE RACE.  ALL EYES ARE GOING TO BE ON OUR  DISTRICT.  THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS  COMPLETELY UNIFIED.  WE ARE FORGING SOME VERY  INTERESTING ALLIANCES WITH  MODERATE REPUBLICANS IN THE  DISTRICT WHO DON'T LIKE THE WAY  IN WHICH KEAN EMBRACED TRUMP  AND THE FAR RIGHT IN HIS  PRIMARY.  THAT DIDN'T HELP HIM ALL THAT  MUCH.  I THINK WE ARE POISED,  OBVIOUSLY NOT TO WIN A  LANDSLIDE VICTORY LIKE I JUST  DID BUT TO WIN ANOTHER CLOSE  RACE.  >> DO YOU FEEL THE PARTY  SACRIFICED YOU IN THE  REDISTRICTING?  >> THEY DIDN'T HELP ME, BUT I'M  USED TO HAVING A TOUGH RACE.  THIS WAS A DID REPUBLICAN  DISTRICT WHEN I WON IT, I WON  THE CLOSEST RACE IN THE COUNTRY  IN 2020.  AND I CAN CERTAINLY SAY I AM  NOT THE BEHOLDEN TO ANY  DEMOCRATIC PARTY MACHINE IN THE  STATE.  I AM HERE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE  PUT ME HERE.  THEY KNOW ME BETTER AND BETTER  THROUGH ALL OF THE PUBLIC  MEETINGS AND TOWN HALLS AND  CONSTITUENT SERVICE I HAVE  DONE.  THAT'S WHAT GIVES ME  CONFIDENCE.  >> AND IN FACT, JUST TODAY, IT  CAME OUT THAT THIS NEWLY FORMED  MODERATE PARTY IS LOOKING TO  BRING BACK WHAT THEY CALL  FUSION VOTING, ESSENTIALLY  PUTTING YOU ON THE BALLOT  TWICE.  LET'S GO FIRST WITH, WHY DID  YOU AGREE TO DO IT?  >> I AM HONORED TO HAVE THE  SUPPORT OF MODERATE  REPUBLICANS.  THIS IS WHAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS.  WE NEED TO HAVE THESE ALLIANCES  OF PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE WHO ARE  RATIONAL AND SANE, WHO REJECT  THE JANUARY 6th INSURRECTIONS  AND CULTURE WARS AND VIOLENCE.  BUT MAYBE WE DON'T ALSO  SUBSCRIBE TO EVERYTHING THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY STANDS FOR,  WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER TO  SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS.  I THINK IT SENDS A GREAT  MESSAGE TO VOTERS IN THE  DISTRICT.  FRANKLY, I THINK IT IS A GREAT  MODEL FOR THE COUNTRY.  WHICH IS WHY I THINK WE HAVE  GOTTEN NATIONAL ATTENTION.  >> WE WERE TALKING EARLIER  ABOUT SOME OF THE SO-CALLED  CULTURE WAR ISSUES,  PARTICULARLY I AM THINKING OF  THE LEAKED SUPREME COURT DRAFT  DECISION.  DO YOU ANTICIPATE SOMETHING  LIKE THAT TO GIVE A BOOST TO  CANDIDATES LIKE YOURSELF?  >> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S BAD FOR  THE COUNTRY.  WE HAVE HAD IT AS A SETTLED LAW  OF THE LAND FOR 50 YEARS.  THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF  AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THIS IS  A DECISION THAT SHOULD BE LEFT  TO WOMEN TO MAKE IN  CONSULTATION WITH FAMILIES AND  DOCTORS.  NOT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD  GO IN AND TREAT WOMEN AND  DOCTORS AS CRIMINALS.  UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS ABOUT TO  HAPPEN IN STATE AFTER STATE.  IT IS ALL THESE LAWS THAT ARE  GOING TO PASS AFTER THE SUPREME  COURT MAKES THE DECISION.  THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT --  IT IS SOMETHING VERY FEW VOTERS  WANT TO SEE HAPPEN.  THEY WANT US FOCUSED ON THE  ECONOMY, FIXING INFLATION, NOT  BANNING ABORTION OR GOING AFTER  TRANSGENDER KIDS OR LGBT YOUTH.  AND THAT IS ALL THE ENERGY ON  THE REPUBLICAN SIDE RIGHT NOW.  >> YOU KNOW YOUR OPPONENT, WHAT  DOES THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL LOOK  LIKE FOR YOU NOW?  >> I AM GOING TO GO OUT, BE  ACCESSIBLE, TALK TO VOTERS,  TAKE THEIR QUESTIONS, TELL THEM  EXACTLY WHERE I STAND.  AND TOM KEAN IS GOING TO DO  WHAT HE'S DONE, GO BACK TO HIS  HOUSE AND NOT MEET ANYBODY.  I WISH I COULD INTRODUCE HIM TO  EVERY VOTER IN MY DISTRICT  BECAUSE I MIGHT WIN IN A  LANDSLIDE IF THAT HAPPENS.  I WISH THIS WAS A DEBATE ABOUT  ISSUES AND HOW TO FIX THE  ECONOMY, HOW TO MAKE AMERICA  STRONG.  UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK WHAT WE  WILL GET FROM THE OTHER SIDE IS  JUST A LOT OF DUMB ATTACK ADS  LIKE THEY TRIED THROWING  AGAINST ME LAST TIME.  WHAT I WILL DO MY BEST TO TRY  TO MAKE THIS RACE ABOUT THINGS  THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT, I THINK  IF I DO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO  PUT TOGETHER A COALITION THAT  COULD WIN.  >> PERHAPS WE CAN GET YOU TO  AGREE TO A DEBATE HERE ON OUR  STATION.  THANKS SO MU

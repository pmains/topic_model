HEALING WORDS, UNITING WORDS AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. MR. PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES, THE SENATE IS NOW CONSIDERING THE SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 3684, THE INVEST ACT. I RISE TODAY TO URGE OUR COLLEAGUES TO JOIN SENATOR CAPITO, SITTING TO MY RIGHT, AND ME IN DEBATING THE LEGISLATION, OFFERING IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO IT, AND THEN VOTING FOR ITS ADOPTION. IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, AT MY ENCOURAGEMENT, PRESIDENT BIDEN INVITED SENATOR CAPITO, SENATORS -- AND ME OVER TO THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT AFTER HE WAS INAUGURATED PRESIDENT TO DISCUSS THE NEED TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS IN OUR NATION'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. SITTING IN THE OVAL OFFICE THAT DAY, AS I'M SURE THE RANKING MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE REMEMBERS, WE WERE JOINED IN PERSON BY THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, KAMALA HARRIS. AND WE WERE VOIND VIRTUALLY BY -- JOINED VIRTUALLY BY THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION PETE BUTTIGIEG. I STILL WANT TO CALL HIM MAYOR PETE BUT HE'S TURNED OUT TO BE A DARNED GOOD SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION AS WELL. BECAUSE OF OUR COMMITTEE'S LONG-STANDING TRADITION OF BIPARTISAN WORK ON INFRASTRUCTURE, MY COLLEAGUES AND I ALREADY KNEW AS WE HEADED INTO THAT WHITE HOUSE MEETING THAT OUR NATION HAD FALLEN WOEFULLY SHORT, WOEFULLY SHORT IN MAINTAINING AND DEVELOPING THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS US, OUR FAMILIES, AND OUR ECONOMY. BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS 2021 REPORT CARD FOR AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE GAVE OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE AN OVERALL GRADE OF C MINUS. IN RECENT YEARS THAT RATING HAS BEEN AS LOW AS D-PLUS, D, D-MINUS. STILL A C-MINUS IS NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT. RATHER IT'S A WAKE-UP CALL FOR US TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER, IF YOU WILL, TO MOVE IT ON UP, MOVE IT ON UP. THAT'S WHAT OUR NEW PRESIDENT CALLED ON US TO DO THAT DAY IN ORDER TO HELP AMERICA MOVE ON UP AND MOVE AHEAD. WITHOUT CASTING ASPERSIONS OR AFFIXING BLAME, HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT AMERICA HADN'T BEEN GETTING THE JOB DONE ON THIS FRONT FOR YEARS, AND THAT BY WORKING TOGETHER, WORKING TOGETHER WE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WHILE CREATING MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS, A LOT OF THEM WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES, AT THE SAME TIME. HE ASKED US LEADERS ON THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS, TO HELP JUMP-START THE EFFORT TO GETTING THE WORK ON CRAFTING AND REPORTING TO THE FULL SENATE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION LEGISLATION. AND ALONG WITH LEGISLATION, REPAIR AND UPGRADE DRINKING WATER AND WATER SANITATION INFRASTRUCTURE AS SOON AS WE COULD. WORKING TOGETHER WITH ALL 20 MEMBERS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE -- TEN DEMOCRATS AND TEN REPUBLICANS -- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID IN RECORD TIME AND WITH RECORD LEVELS, HISTORIC LEVELS OF INVESTMENT. AFTER SLIT CONTINUING INPUT, I'M SURE MY -- AFTER SOLICITING INPUT FROM ALL 50 STATES, WE CRAFTED AND UNANIMOUSLY REPORTED OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TO THE FULL SENATE, UNANIMOUSLY. THERE IT WAS DEBATED, AMENDED AND ADOPTED BY A VOTE OF 89-2. 89-2, YOU DON'T HEAR THAT EVERY DAY, ON APRIL 29, 2021. WITH THAT BEHIND US, WE TURNED OUR ATTENTION TO SURFACE TRANSPORTATION LEGISLATION, ROADS, HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES, CLIMATE AND UNANIMOUSLY REPORTED OUR SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BILL TO THE FULL SENATE BY MEMORIAL DAY. THE FASTEST THE COMMITTEE HAS EVER ACTED, I'M TOLD, ON SUCH LEGISLATION. I THANK SENATOR CAPITO SO MANY TIMES, SHE'S PROBABLY GETTING SICK OF IT, BUT I WANT TO THANK HER AGAIN. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY -- EVERY MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE PRIVILEGED TO WORK ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE, ALONG WITH MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF FOR THEIR REMARKABLE WORK ON THESE IMPORTANT BIPARTISAN BILLS. SPEAKING OF STAFF, I'M LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER, I SEE SOME OF MY TEAM RIGHT BEHIND ME AND OVER THE OTHER SHOULDER, I SEE REPUBLICAN STAFF ON THE OTHER SIDE. I WANT TO THANK OUR STAFF DIRECTOR, MARY FRANCIS RIPCO, REBECCA HIGGINS, WHO LEADS OUR TRANSPORTATION TEAM. KENNETH MARTIN AND JORDAN BAW AS WELL. A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO JOHN KEAN AND ANDY D'AMATO WHO ABLE LEE LED EFFORTS ON WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. TO LAURA HAINES GILLIAM TO MY INDEFATIGABLE EMILY SPAIN. I WANT TO HASTEN TO ADD WE WOULDN'T GET ANY OF THIS DONE WITHOUT SENATOR CAPITO AND THE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WE RECEIVED FROM HER AND A.P.W. MINORITY STAFF DIRECTOR ADAM. ADAM, THANK YOU. AND HIS HARDWORKING TEAM. I WON'T MENTION THEM ALL BUT MURPHY BARRETT, AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS MURPHY BROWN AND TRAVIS COHEN AND JESS CRAMER. YOU EXPECT THE CHAIR OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE OR THE RANKING MEMBER TO BE PROUD OF THEIR COMMITTEE'S WORK, AND WE CERTAINLY ARE. BUT WE AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE WORKED HARD TO WRITE THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY, NOT BY A LONG SHOT. I WANT TO COMMEND THE BIPARTISAN WORK OF THE COMMERCE COMMITTEE AND ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE ALONG WITH THE EFFORTS OF THE BANKING COMMITTEE. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE BIPARTISAN GROUP WE AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO, SENATOR DURBIN ALREADY HAS, AFFECTIONATELY REFER TO THEM AT LEAST MOST OF THE TIME AS THE G-22, LED BY SENATORS ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO AND KIRSTEN IS SINEMA OF NEVADA. I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR HERCULEAN EFFORTS TO MAKE THIS COMPROMISE LEGISLATION A REALITY WORKING WITH NOT JUST FOLKS HERE AND OVER IN THE HOUSE BUT ALSO THE WHITE HOUSE AS WELL, THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM. WE HAVE ONE OF MY FAVORITE SAYINGS IN THE NAVY IS WHEN SOMEBODY DOES EXTRAORDINARY WORK WHAT WE SAY IS BEFORE -- IS BRAVA ZULA. IN TRUTH, THIS TOUCHES ON THE JURISDICTIONS OF MANY OF OUR COMMITTEES. THAT'S WHY THE LEGISLATION WE'RE CONSIDERING TODAY IS EXTRAORDINARY. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PACKAGE THAT ENCOMPASSES WATER, HIGHWAYS, ROADS, BRIDGES, TRANSIT, RAIL, AIRPORT, PORTS, CAR SYSTEMS, DAMS, BROADBAND, CYBERSECURITY, ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION, AND MORE. I'D LIKE TO PAUSE HERE FOR JUST A MOMENT TO REMIND ALL OF US WHO SERVE IN THIS BODY ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALSO INTENSELY PERSONAL. AND WHEN IT DOES NOT WORK, OUR PEOPLE SUFFER, THEIR CHILDREN SUFFER, AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS SUFFER. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THOSE WHO SUFFER MOST ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SHORTCHANGED BY THE INADEQUATE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE FOR TOO MANY YEARS. IN RURAL PARTS OF SOUTHERN DELAWARE, COMMUNITIES LIKE ALLEN DALEVILLE STRUDLE FOR -- STRUGGLED FOR YEARS TO FIND ALTERNATIVES TO POLLUTED DRINKING WATER WELLS. ACROSS OUR COUNTRY HUNDREDS, MAYBE THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITIES STRUGGLE WITH ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, INCLUDING MY COLLEAGUES FROM WEST VIRGINIA, SHELLY CAPITO AND JOE MANCHIN. OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE TORN ASUNDER BY TOO MANY PLACES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, BY HIGHWAYS THAT HAVE P DIVIDED AND DISRUPTED NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS OUR NATION. IN MY HOMETOWN OF WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, CONSTRUCTION OF I-95 LITERALLY TORE COMMUNITIES APART CUTTING OFF ACCESS TO NEIGHBORS, PARKS AND WEEKEND OPPORTUNITY. WE CAN BEGIN TO HEAL THOSE WOUNDS IN PLACES LIKE BALTIMORE, PHILADELPHIA AS WELL, HEAL THOSE WOUNDS WITH THE PROJECT WE ENABLE IN THIS LEGISLATION. THE TRUTH BE KNOWN, MR.  PRESIDENT, ALMOST ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE STORIES LIKE THIS TO SHARE. COMMUNITIES BESET BY RAGING WILDFIRES, FUELED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF FARMLAND LOST TO FLOODING, MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE CROPS IN IOWA DESTROYED BY HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS LAST YEAR. KIDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, FOR WANT OF BROADBAND ACCESS. AND FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO DEAL WITH LEGACY POLLUTANTS IN THE LAND AND WATER WHERE THEY LIVE. IN THE NEAR FUTURE, MR. PRESIDENT, I HOPE WE'LL TAKE SOME TIME TO CELEBRATE THE SIGNIFICANT STEPS WE ARE TAKING TO REWRITE THESE STORIES WITH THIS LEGISLATION BEFORE US. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT OR TWO HERE TODAY IF I MAY TO DRILL DOWN ON SOME OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL PROVISIONS REPORTED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF OUR COMMITTEE, THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE, THIS YEAR. LET'S START WITH THE DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE ACT OF IT'S CLEAR THAT THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE NOW, DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS, AREN'T SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REVOLVING LOAN PROGRAMS OF THEIR STATES IN ORDER TO UPGRADE INCREASINGLY INADEQUATE DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES. AS OUR RANKING MEMBER KNOWS, IF COMMUNITIES BORROW MONEY OUT OF THESE REVOLVING FUNDS, WATER FUNDS, ONE FOR DRINKING WATER AND ONE FOR SANITATION, WATER SANITATION, IF COMMUNITIES BORROW MONEY, TAKE MONEY OUT OF THAT, THEY ARE EXPECTED TO PAY IT BACK, PAY THAT MONEY BACK. AND THERE ARE, AS WE KNOW, A LOT OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TOO IMPOVERISHED TO EVER DO THAT. AND WE DECIDED NOT JUST TO BEMOAN THAT BUT TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THIS LEGISLATION, PROVIDE THEM WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE A GRANT TO CLEAN UP THEIR WATERS, DRINKING WATER, AND TO DEAL WITH THEIR WASTE WATER. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO -- TO DO THAT, TO DEAL WITH THESE CHALLENGES, AND WE ARE GOING TO HELP THEM. THIS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION WORKS TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS BY AUTHORIZING MORE THAN $55 BILLION, $55 BILLION FOR PROGRAMS THAT WILL CREATE JOBS AND MAKE UP -- MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES COMFORTABLE BY BUILDING, UPGRADING, MODERNIZING OUR NATION'S AGING DRINKING WATER AND WASTE WATER INFRASYSTEMS. THE MEASURE TAKES THE HISTORIC STEP OF REAUTHORIZING THE CLEAN WATER STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 35 YEARS. 35 YEARS. AND IT DOES SO WHILE INCREASING FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1987. THIS LEGISLATION ALSO REAUTHORIZES THE DRIPPING WATER STATE REVOLVING FUND, A PROGRAM WHOSE AUTHORIZATION EXPIRES AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. YOU WILL RECALL THAT THIS IS THE FUND THAT HELPS TO ENSURE THAT CLEAN WATER FLOWS FROM FAUCETS WHEN WE TURN ON THE SPIGOT. TO HELP RESOLVE A HISTORIC INJUSTICE IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT, MORE THAN 40% OF THIS BILL'S INVESTMENTS ARE TARGETED TO HELP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE BILL APPROPRIATES $15 BILLION IN NEW FUNDING FOR A PLACE -- TO REPLACE LEAD SERVICE LINES AND PARTICULARLY FOR OUR COUNTRY'S RURAL AREAS, INCLUDING NATIVE ALASKAN VILLAGES, TRIBAL COMMUNITIES, LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. OUR BILL INVESTS ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS IN PROGRAMS TO CONNECT HOUSEHOLDS AND DRINKING WATER AND WASTE WATER SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. AND THIS LEGISLATION DOES FAR MORE THAN JUST FIX WHAT'S BROKEN. TO BORROW A PHRASE FROM OUR PRESIDENT, IT TRULY DOES ENABLE US TO BUILD BACK BETTER. BY FORTIFYING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE FACE OF OUR NEW AND WORSENING CLIMATE REALITY. SADLY, MR. PRESIDENT, SADLY OUR FUTURE IS ONE WITH MORE SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS LIKE HURRICANES, LIKE FLOODS, DROUGHTS, AND BITTERLY COLD WEATHER. I WISH IT WEREN'T TRUE, BUT IT IS. IT'S A FUTURE WITH EVERMORE PEOPLE LIVING ON THE FRONT LINES OF SEA LEVEL RISE LIKE LOUISIANA, WHICH ON THE AVERAGE, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THIS, LOUISIANA LOSES A PIECE OF LAND TO THE SEA ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD EVERY 100 MINUTES. EVERY 100 MINUTES. TO THAT END, THE BILL BEFORE US PROVIDES A COMBINED $500 MILLION TO MAKE OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM MORE RESILIENT AND MORE ADAPTABLE IN THE FACE OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. WITHIN THAT HISTORIC INVESTMENT IS A NEW $125 BILLION PROGRAM WHICH WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME PROVIDE GRANTS TO COMMUNITIES SEEKING TO FORTIFY THEIR WASTE WATER SYSTEMS AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE'S IMPACT. THIS IS NOT JUST A BILL TO STAND IN A BILL, A LEGISLATION THAT WOULD DIRECT OUR AGENCIES TO BUILD AND SPEND MORE WISELY. WE KNOW THAT INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION IN THIS BILL BEFORE US COULD HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY, CREATING JOBS AND FOSTERING GROWTH FOR OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY. WE CAN IN SHORT SEIZE THE DAY IN THE FACE OF SO MUCH ADVERSITY. SEIZE THE DAY. CARPE DIEM OR AS WE SAY IN DELAWARE, MADAM, CARPER DIE. IT IS -- CARPER DIEM. THERE IS MUCH WE CAN DO TO INVEST IN OUR NATION'S HIGHWAYS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES. OUR SURFACE TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT INCREASES THE BASELINE FOR FUNDING OUR SURFACE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS BY MORE THAN A THIRD TO $203 BILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  $203 BILLION. ON TOP OF THAT, THE LEGISLATION WILL PROVIDE OVER $60 BILLION FOR NEW FUNDS FOR ROADS, BRIDGES, AND MULTIMODAL PROGRAMS OVER THESE FIVE YEARS. THIS INVESTMENT WILL REPAIR, REBUILD OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES WITH A NEW FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION, RESILIENT EQUITY AND SAFETY FOR ALL USERS, INCLUDING CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS. EVERY DAY, MOTORISTS CROSS BRIDGES IN POOR CONDITIONS IN TOO MANY PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY 170 MILLION TIMES. EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY. 170 MILLION TIMES A DAY. SOME 40% OF THE BRIDGES IN OUR COUNTRY ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR REPLACEMENT, INCLUDING NEARLY 500 BRIDGES IN MASSACHUSETTS, 3,000 IN PENNSYLVANIA, AND GOD KNOWS MORE IN OUR STATE AS WELL. AT THE CURRENT PACE OF INVESTMENT IN BRIDGES, IT COULD TAKE NEARLY 40 YEARS, 40 YEARS TO TACKLE THE CURRENT BACKLOG OF BRIDGES IN POOR CONDITION. THAT'S RIGHT. 40 YEARS. THAT'S WHY TODAY WE CONSIDER LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE A $40 BILLION INVESTMENT TO ADDRESS OUR DAUNTING BRIDGE REPAIR BACKLOG. OUR LEGISLATION ALSO INCLUDES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A SENATE REAUTHORIZATION BILL CLIMATE TIDAL PROVISIONS DEDICATED TO CURBING HARMFUL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHILE ENSURING THE INVESTMENTS WE MAKE ARE MORE RESILIENT. THE CLIMATE CHANGE ENHANCED EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. LIKE IT OR NOT, IT'S COMING OUR WAY. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, THESE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR'S LARGEST SOURCE OF PRIVATE EMISSIONS IN OUR NATION, ALMOST 30%, JUST FROM ITS ONE SOURCE, CARS, TRUCKS, AND VANS. IF WE WANT TO SAVE OUR PLANET, AND WE DO, FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, WE HAVE TO TACKLE THIS MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS WITH A SPECIAL ZEAL. THE BILL WE MARKED UP IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE WAS PASSED BY A 20-0 VOTE, PUT US ON THE RIGHT TRACK. DEDICATING $18 BILLION TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. AND INCLUDING MONEY FOR HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS ON HIGHWAYS AND IN LOCATIONS LIKE SCHOOLS, WORKPLACE, PARKS, AND PUBLIC ACCESSIBLE AREAS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. THE BILL ALSO ADDS ANOTHER $5 BILLION FOR E.V. CHARGING AND HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS TO HELP US TRANSITION TOWARD A ZERO-EMISSION FUTURE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ABOUT AND TALKED ABOUT CHARGING STATIONS, ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS. NOT SO MANY PEOPLE MENTION HYDROGEN. HYDROGEN WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN REDUCING OUR CARBON EMISSIONS. PARTICULARLY WITH MID-SIZED TRUCKS AND LARGER TRUCKS BUT ALSO WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. STAY TUNED. A LOT TO COME O THAT FRONT. THE GREAT THING ABOUT HYDROGEN, CLEAN HYDROGEN ESPECIALLY VEHICLES TO PROPEL HYDROGEN WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE DEVISED, IT CREATES AN EMISSION FROM THESE VEHICLES, BUT IT'S WATER, I'M TOLD IT'S WATER WE CAN ACTUALLY DRINK. WE WILL ALSO DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS BY SUPPORTING CLEAN, HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING. BICYCLING AND WALKING ARE NOT ONLY AFFORDABLE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION BUT HEALTHY ONES AS WELL. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN A NATION WHERE ALL TOO MANY AMERICANS ARE DYING FROM MEDICAL CONDITIONS TIED TO OBESITY. SADLY, FAR TOO MANY AMERICANS LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE ARE NO SAFE BIKE LANES AND CROSSWALKS. TRAGICALLY, IN 2019 ALONE, OVER 7,000 PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS LOST THEIR LIVES IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS. OVER 7,000 PEDESTRIANS. I WOULD WAGER, I WOULD WAGER, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THIS BODY -- I ACTUALLY KNEW ONE OR MORE THAN ONE OF THOSE VICTIMS OR THEIR FAMILIES PERSONALLY. SO I'M GRATEFUL THAT OUR BILL WORKS TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDLESS DEATHS HEAD ON. THE QUESTION IS HOW. BY PROVIDING A 70% INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS THAT DEVELOP SAFE, ACCESSIBLE PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLE PATHWAYS ACROSS OUR NATION AND BY AUTHORIZING ALMOST $17 BILLION IN FUNDING FOR HIGHWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE HERE SOME OF THE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE OUTSIDE OF THE E.P.W. COMMITTEE JURISDICTION AND THE IMPORTANT WORK THOSE COMMITTEES DID TO BRING THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR. FIRST, A NOTE OF APPRECIATION FOR THE PORTION OF THIS LEGISLATION THAT WAS AUTHORED BY THE SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE LED BY SENATORS MARIA CANTWELL AND ROGER WICKER. ONE OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO COMMUTES TO WORK ON THE EAST COAST BY TAKING AMTRAK ALMOST DAILY, I AM ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT THIS BILL INVESTS IN OUR RAILWAY ACROSS OUR NATION. THIS LEGISLATION NOT ONLY PROVIDES $6 BILLION IN GRANTS FOR THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR TO ADDRESS ADAM'S DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS, IT ALSO PROVIDES ANOTHER $16 BILLION FOR THE ADAM NATIONAL NETWORK. AMTRAK'S NATIONAL NETWORK. AND ANOTHER $41 BILLION IN GRANTS TO IMPROVE PASSENGER RAIL PERFORMANCE AND SAFETY. I ALSO WANT TO APPLY -- APPLAUD THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE AND OTHERS BOTH ON AND OFF THE COMMITTEE WHO WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ADVANCE ROBUST FUNDING FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO GET TO WORK AND HOME AGAIN EVERY DAY. TRANSIT AND RAIL ARE BOTH CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE, PROVIDING LOW AND LOW-EMISSION TRAVEL CHOICES. THIS BILL, OUR BILL, REAUTHORIZES AND GROWS OUR TRANSIT PROGRAMS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING MORE THAN $5 BILLION IN GRANTS FOR STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO PURCHASE ELECTRIC AND LOW-EMISSION TRANSIT BUSES. AND OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE SENATE ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE, LED BY SENATORS MANCHIN AND BARRASSO, CRAFTED LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP SUPPORT AND CLEAN UP OUR NATION'S ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. INVESTMENTS MADE IN THIS BILL WILL WORK TO MAKE OUR ELECTRIC GRID MORE RELIABLE, MORE RESILIENT, SUPPORT FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES TO BECOME MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT WHILE HELPING TO CLEAN UP OUR NATION'S OLD AND ABANDONED MINES AND WELLS THAT LEAK TOXIC POLLUTION AND METHANE EMISSIONS. THE BILL BEFORE US THIS WEEK ALSO INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN BATTERY RECYCLING, IN ZERO-EMITTING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING A PROGRAM MUCH LIKE ONE PASSED OUT OF OUR E.P.W. COMMITTEE LAST YEAR THAT SUPPORTS OUR EXISTING NUCLEAR POWER FLEET WHICH COLLECTIVELY PRODUCES -- GET THIS -- HALF OF OUR NATION'S CARBON-FREE ELECTRICITY. WHILE THERE IS MUCH TO CELEBRATE IN THIS PRODUCT OF OUR BIPARTISAN EFFORT, MORE WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. COLLECTIVELY, WE HAVE INCORPORATED BADLY NEEDED CLIMATE PROVISIONS IN SERVICE, TRANSPORTATION, WATER, POWER, AND A NUMBER OF OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS. BUT IN TRUTH, WE HAVE IN THE WORDS OF ROBERT FROST MILES TO GO BEFORE WE SLEEP. MILES TO GO BEFORE WE SLEEP. AND WITH THE WORDS OF ROBERT FROST AS A REMINDER, ALL OF US WHO SERVE HERE TOGETHER UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY RACE WON BEGINS WITH A FIRST STEP AND ENDS WITH A FINAL ONE. WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THIS LEGISLATION, WE WILL BE TAKING NOT ONE BUT A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT STEPS, A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT STEPS. IN THE DAYS AHEAD, WE WILL MOVE A GREAT DEAL CLOSER TO THE FINISH LINE IN A RACE WITH A DANGEROUSLY CHANGING CLIMATE THAT WE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE. THAT'S WHY I WILL BE EXAMINING THE BUDGET RESOLUTION CLOSELY IN THE DAYS AHEAD TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DEVOTING RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PUT -- TO ELIMINATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND TO PUT IT ON THE RUN AS WE ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ADD THAT WE MUST NOT SHY AWAY IN THE DAYS AHEAD FROM WORKING HARD TO AGREE ON HOW TO HONESTLY AND THOUGHTFULLY PAY FOR THE INVESTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE. IN THE WORDS, MY COLLEAGUE FROM WEST VIRGINIA, IN THE WORDS OF A FORMER STATE TREASURER OF A SMALL STATE ON THE EAST COAST WHO NOW SERVES IN THIS BODY, THINGS WORTH HAVING ARE WORTH PAYING FOR. BUT THE KEY MISSION OF THIS STATE IS THAT WE HAVE PUSHED THROUGH -- DAY IS THAT WE HAVE PUSHED THROUGH EARNEST DISAGREEMENTS, VARYING PRIORITIES, MUCH HEADACHE AND HEARTACHE TO ACHIEVE A TRULY SINGULAR SUCCESS IN TAKING ON A NUMBER OF MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES FACING OUR NATION. WE HAVE ELECTED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE OBVIOUS, TO REPAIR AND UPGRADE MUCH OF OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO BETTER POSITION AMERICA TO SUCCEED IN A MORE COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND SURVIVE IN AN EVER MORE DANGEROUS WORLD DUE TO CLIMATE CRISIS. SENATOR CAPITO AND I HAVE SERVED TOGETHER ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OFIERS. SHE SUCCEEDS JOHN BARRASSO WHO FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WAS THE CHAIR AND I WAS THE RANKING MEMBER. I WILL NEVER FORGET -- AND YOU PROBABLY WON'T EITHER, SENATOR -- YOU PROBABLY WON'T -- WE WON'T FORGET THE WORDS OF A FELLOW NAMED ROB WALLACE, ALSO FROM WYOMING, A FRIEND OF SENATOR BARRASSO WHO WAS NOMINATED TO BE I THINK THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR THE INTERIOR TO FOCUS ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NATIONAL PARKS, WILDLIFE REFUGES, FISH AND WILDLIFE. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT HE SAID IN HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING. HE COMMENTED ON THE HISTORY OF THE TRADITION OF OUR COMMITTEE IS ONE WHERE WE ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER OR LIKE EACH OTHER, EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE ON THE ISSUES, WE WORK TO GET THINGS DONE. HE SAID THESE WORDS. HE SAID THE BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS ARE LASTING SOLUTIONS. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS ARE LASTING SOLUTIONS. I THOUGHT AT THE TIME HE REALLY NAILED IT. I HOPE THAT WITH THIS LEGISLATION WE WILL NAIL IT, TOO, BECAUSE A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE COUNTING ON US TO DO JUST THAT. WITH THAT, I'M HAPPY TO YIELD THE FLOOR AGAIN TO -- I'M TEMPTED TO CALL HER MY WING WOMAN. SHE CALLS ME HER WING MAN. WITH MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE AND RANKING MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE

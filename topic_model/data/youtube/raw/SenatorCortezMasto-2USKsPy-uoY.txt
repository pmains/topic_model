joining us now is Senator Catherine Cortez Masto she's a Democrat from Nevada senator thank you so much for joining us hello well happy to be here with you I say you've said you'll vote against the judge Cavanaugh you voted note on this procedural vote today what do you think of the decision on the floor today especially from senators Collins flake your fellow Democrat Joe Manchin walls all voted to allow this motion to proceed well first of all you can see that every senator is struggling all right this is a difficult issue it's a tough one and an important one and I think that's what you saw on the floor today I'm curious like many I'm waiting to hear what Susan Collins has to say at 3:00 I thought Lisa's comments about this being about a bigger than one nominee or one man this is about our institutions and the fairness and who's the right person to sit on the United States Supreme Court the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment you know that that weighs into all of what we have to make their determinations that we have to think about when we are making us too soon yo Lisa Murkowski voting note today the Republican senator from Alaska would you anticipate based on what you saw today the same totals tomorrow 51 in favor 49 opposed you know I don't know I we've seen to go I've seen it go both ways both in the short time that I've been here some will stick with their votes and some may change them we've seen that happen on the Affordable Care Act vote at the end of the day you know I think right now it really is a concern for many of us that we should be looking at this to get the right person you know this is bigger than than one individual this is a lifetime appointment and you know I I have said I'm not supporting judge Cavanaugh not only because I disagree with his judicial philosophy but what I saw from somebody who was already a sitting appellate judge remember he sits on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals the temperament lack of temperament the lack of impartiality that he displayed I thought was just to me a disqualifying factor that's not something that should be sitting up on the highest court was this at all a difficult vote for you today oh I think all of us you know this was a and rightfully so we I take this very seriously this advise and consent particularly when it comes down to a nominee who's gonna sit on the highest court of the land who is gonna have any impact on the very issues we all deal with and care about rec from women's health care to workers rights to discrimination to whether or not the president is subject to the rule of law here in this country I mean there's so much at stake so we should be taking it seriously and but you know part of this is we should have a full vetting we should not fast-track this with some artificial deadline set by the Republican leadership this should be an open process we have access to all of the information not limited like we have seen and then there should be a full background investigation listen I was the Attorney General for Nevada I was a prosecutor ten years I looked at the most recent background investigation conducted by the FBI and it was limited there's no doubt in my mind from what I saw because I still had questions after reviewing it where's the follow-up why weren't these people questions so I know that unfortunately there was not full vetting here and I think that doesn't disservice to this country particularly when it comes to trying to find the right person to sit on the United States Supreme Court what's your message to your fellow Democrat joe Manchin of West Virginia as you know he's in a tough reelection a race right now in a few weeks West Virginians West Virginians are going to have to vote he voted in favor of moving ahead with the procedural vote today he says it's he hasn't announced how we'll vote tomorrow if you had a chance to speak with them sit down privately what would you say to him you know it is a tough decision for all of us and what I have said is is it is tough because you have a credible credible woman come in front of a doctor for coming forward and courageous enough to come forward without any benefit to her she was credible she was poised she answered every question and then you have obviously the nominee Brett Kavanaugh coming forward and we saw his response and how he was belligerent and evasive and that doesn't help as we are trying to really uncover the truth so that we can make a decision and I think that's what this was about and so for purposes of my colleagues yes it's a tough decision but at the end of the day for me it is about the right person that has what I just said those qualities not only to the right temperament can be impartial that really has the ability to be the right person there and keep this in mind there are so many qualified people out there there are many qualified people that we can find that we can work together and find that right person and that's why I think this is bigger than any one nominee and that's why I've said this process was been broken from the beginning and we got to get back to a point where we're working together with the White House to find the right person to sit on the Supreme Court senator Katherine Cortez Masto Democrat of Nevada thanks so much for joining us thank you all

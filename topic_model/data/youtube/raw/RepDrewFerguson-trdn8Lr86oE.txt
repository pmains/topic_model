let's bring in georgia congressman drew ferguson uh welcome congressman um do we is is the vice president correct do we have a secure border uh the border is nowhere near secure um her comments are disingenuous and quite honestly the question i ask is how would she even know she's never she doesn't go down there i have been to the border i've been to the texas border the arizona border and what's happening down there is absolutely horrific it's bad for america it's bad for americans the policies that the administration have put in place on the border do not put america and americans first yeah also we've got migrants being bussed from texas into major cities like new york chicago um without notice 64 migrants were bused to a hampton inn hotel in a chicago suburb here's governor pritzker defending his decision so what what i'm saying here folks so so let me make this clear because it was a little confusing some of these migrants are being sent from governor abbott in texas to some city saying uh if you want to take them you're welcome to have them then the governor is sending them to a suburb of chicago unannounced to them so here's what he said defending it and this has to do uh not with we're picking some suburb but rather this there happens to be a hotel that's available that has the right number of rooms for us to uh send asylum seekers to your response congressman uh that that's a joke uh listen we know what this is about but what what we really should be focusing on is the real damage that's occurring at our border um not just the people that are coming across that are illegal here it's the human trafficking that is just so atrocious but more importantly than that it is the drug trafficking that is being pushed across our uh our our southern border and it is sending record amounts of fentanyl and methamphetamine into our communities every district now is a border district because of this again if you go to the border and you see what the cartels are doing and how they manipulate our border agents and put pressure on them tie them up with these illegal crossings and then smuggle the drugs across the border um they are they are playing the bind administration like a fiddle our men and women in border patrol are putting their lives at risk every single day as well as local law enforcement and the bind administration is making it harder and harder for them to do their jobs and this is having a negative impact on american families across this country yeah and congressman uh of course you mentioned how uh kamala harris our vice president has not even been to the border but you have recently tell us what you saw so i went to i went to eagle pass texas and then went to nagalas arizona and what i saw particularly in arizona was very disturbing uh and in the description that we got about what happens on a daily basis with the cartel sending um sending migrants across in waves that type our agents that then open that then opens up the border for the drug trade it's uh it's very well orchestrated what the cartels are doing they if they were if they were a foreign country uh they would they would already we would have already declared war on them because they have certainly declared war on us and it's terrifying listen we got to take a helicopter tour of the southern border and what we saw were just were just bands of of migrants walking across the border where the blind administration blocked the completion of the wall long sections of wall with open with with an occasional open section that's just an open door for for the migrants to come across these migrants not only are they coming across they are dying on this journey it's truly one of the most inhumane policies that you can imagine that a country has and to hear the vice president talk about the security of the southern border it's laughable but it's wrong and i'll tell you something she should be ashamed of just telling a bold face line to the american people congressman ferguson thank you sir thank you

attorney general barr when it comes to police engagement last august when speaking to the national fraternal order of police you shared your views on police engagement with the public you stated and i quote underscore the need to comply first and if warranted complain later this will make everyone safe the police subject the police suspects and the community at large and those who resist must be prosecuted i repeat zero tolerance for resisting police this will save lives do you stand by that statement yes i think it's very important a zero tolerance attitude is costing lives not saving them especially in communities well i'm not saying i reclaim my time a movement and protests have arisen in response to police brutality here are a few examples of who bears the cost of zero tolerance elijah mcclain was walking home from a convenience store when he was approached by police he had not committed a crime police held him in a choke hold for 15 minutes then injected him with catamine ketamine not under a doctor's supervision but at the direction of non-medically trained and unlicensed police officers are you familiar with that case no do you know how frequently ketamine is used by law enforcement to subdue civilians especially people of color no did you know if police departments have been documented as directing paramedics and emts to eject ketamine during arrests no um have you well then i guess you haven't evaluated the use of force tactics by because since becoming a.g and especially this particular tactic of sedu subduing suspects with ketamine not with respect academy will you commit to directing the department to evaluate the protocols around the use of ketamine chokeholds and other methods used by federal law enforcement officials when making arrests or detaining subjects well absolutely under the president's executive order we are reviewing uh thank you anderson force and working with police departments especially the ketamine that's pretty outrageous george floyd was killed by a police officer via chokehold for eight minutes and 46 seconds a police officer knelt on his neck as he as he begged for his life he was suspected of using a counterfeit twenty dollar bill that's how zero tolerance can amount to a death sentence for black men when used in communities of color with george floyd screaming as we all know he couldn't breathe now consider james holmes who murdered 12 people and injured 70 others in a movie theater in aurora colorado the same town as elijah mclean where he was arrested james wore body armor had a knife semi-automatic weapons and an ar-15 yet he was calmly arrested by the same police department as elijah mclean without a chokehold art injection of katamine dylan roof used a gun to murder nine people and injured another at emmanuel african methodist episcopal church in south carolina when he was arrested no choke holds no injections he was treated so well that officers brought dylan roof burger king after arresting him are you familiar with that case yes i raised those two examples to follow up on what my colleague from texas highlighted earlier that the department is not doing enough to address issues of racism bias and brutality in law enforcement when someone who commits mass murder is calmly arrested and served burger king while a young man walking down the street is placed in a chokehold and injected with ketamine then dies you said that under the executive order the administration is looking at chokeholds what have you uh determined so far well we're uh setting up a system of certification of police departments and part of what our charter is is to come up with criteria that will be used for certification including limitations on use of force specifically including chokeholds so in the george floyd justice and policing act part of it called for a national registry of law enforcement officers as a resource for police chiefs to determine who are the best candidates for jobs as you may or may not be aware tamir rice might be alive today if police if the police chief who hired him had known that that police officer had been fired from another department what is your view of a national registry of law enforcement officers uh the second aspect of the president's executive order is to set up a database like that so that all uh determinations of excessive force around the country go into that database and if police departments aren't reporting that information they wouldn't be certified so we do believe in one national point where you can go in and get determinations of excessive force on uh law enforcement candidates for jobs good thank you and and i do want to uh comment on part of your opening statement when you were saying that after the jim crow period that our justice system was equal and um i don't believe that that i said the laws were made the laws are made equal they are certainly not applied equally we do have systemic problems in our law enforcement system our criminal justice system on every level the fact of the matter is 2.3 million people in the united states are incarcerated we incarcerate 24 percent of the world's prisoners 34 are black while african-americans are just 13 of the of the u.s population so justice is still not equal nor are our laws and i think when we look at how many people are incarcerated or how many people are killed it is not the numbers it is the percentage to the percentage of that group in the u.s population i yield back the time

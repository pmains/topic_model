thank you mr chair before i ask my questions i just want to be very clear that the potential threat posed by uas is one that congress must address before the existing authorities expire we absolutely agree on that i know in california we've seen how rogue uas can disrupt critical functions including wildfire suppression efforts so my questions are not related to the need for reauthorization but making sure that we do so in a responsible way now the first area of questions has already been covered by senator scott and that had to deal with the uh sort of broad exemptions to title 18 that are called for in the administration's proposal i know there was a recognition and a back and forth of you know that's not currently uh the case there's a lot of specific exemptions and it may not be pretty it may not be easy but you're making it work and so there's more than one way to get this done instead of just asking that question over again i will follow up mr wigman with this title 18 for the us code includes prohibitions against for example committing war crimes intimidating voters and engaging in video voyeurism so i understand why the department of justice and dhs might need to be exempt from the wiretap act but why do you need to be exempt from prohibitions against the examples i just uh gave yeah we don't although again to be honest none of those activities would be authorized by by the statute because you can only take under the statutory regime those actions which are necessary to uh detect and then mitigate a credible threat and so it's hard for me to imagine a voyeurism or war crime coming into play there so it's the statue would not give protection against those offenses because of the way it's structured right well it's not it would not exempt you from those offenses it would because it would those would never come into play i hear you but sadly as you've seen you know from administration to administration interpretations and philosophies can shift and so what we do put into statute uh in terms of exemptions does matter and i think it is critical and important a question a different area you know it's whether it's broad exemptions or more specific exemptions is one thing but we're also discussing the proposal to have a reauthorization that's permanent and not one with a sunset provision the proliferation of drone usage as well as the rapid development of drone technology itself so it's technology and how it's applied and used demonstrates why the government needs to have clear authorities in my opinion to engage in uas mitigation activities but as i mentioned the pace of technological development as well as the ever-growing uses for drones including for valuable journalistic and civic engagement purposes seems to suggest that there's considerable value in congress regularly revisiting this area of the law the administration's proposed legislation seeks a permanent c uas authorities rather than including a sunset provision that would require not just congress but the executive branch to come together in a few years to evaluate how well the expanded authorities call for in the statute are working and happy to debate whether it's you know three years five years seven or whatever the time frame makes sense but uh miss vinod let me direct the question to you why shouldn't we all be required to revisit the broad authorities being granted in this bill in a few years uh senator just to be clear what we are seeking this legislation is a lack of a sunset clause for most of the authorities the sltt pilot program we are not requesting indefinite authorities for the sunset clause as it currently stands is really impeding the department's ability to effectively use our authorities insofar as it makes it incredibly difficult for us to engage in multi-year planning multi-year testing and things of that nature we agree that there's a critical need to regularly engage with the congressional branch on how these authorities are being exercised under the preventing emerging threats act of 2018 we are required to report to congress every six months which dhs has done judiciously in addition in this bill for the sltt pilot program two years after the enactment of this bill we are also required to report to congress on just that sltt pilot program yeah so you may disagree but what i'm hearing is an argument for a longer reauthorization not a shorter one but i still believe in in the power in the sunset mechanism uh to to force these conversations that keeps us from you know talking every day every week every month not just every six months not just every two years but uh as i mentioned in in my preface here the uh continuously evolving technology the innovation makes additional things possible additional uh performance and capabilities uh let alone the growing number uh of uses of the technology i think uh more regular required conversation uh from congress to congress and from administration to administration uh would be worthwhile so i know it's been a long morning for all three of you i will leave my comments and questions at that but look forward to working with you as this proceeds thank you mr chair thank you senator

mr. speaker I would like to yield two minutes to the gentleman from Kansas mr. Marshall the Jenna from Kansas is recognized for two minutes thank you for yielding Mr Speaker I rise today on an important important piece of legislation the National Defense Authorization Act this funding is vital to our national security and the readiness of our military as our nation continues to face threats around the globe our soldiers must have the necessary equipment to complete missions and return home safely just two weeks ago four thousand of our troops returned home from South Korea to loved ones at Fort Riley Kansas and in a short number of weeks ahead of us this fall the dagger brigade also from Fort Riley will travel to Europe for a nine-month deployment this location helps ensure readiness for brigade combat teams such as the dagger brigade and gives our troops a much deserved 2.4 percent military pay raise it also allows for over 17,000 more soldiers and allocates 2.3 billion dollars over the administration's requests for maintenance and repair which is so necessary I refuse to send our troops to a gunfight with knives I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation to give our men and women in uniform the tools and support they deserve with that I yield back the gentleman yields back

Mr Speaker I rise today to thank president Trump for his strong support of rural America and for remembering the Forgotten farmer last week the president made us so very proud when he became the first sitting president in 25 years to address the Farm Bureau during his speech the president emphasized the importance of agriculture in America and as a member of the Subcommittee on AG I could not agree more our farmers provide America with food security unlike any other country on earth farmers and ranchers are a small percentage of our population feed and fuel and and clothing our country and the rest of the world but it hasn't been easy for them foreign countries cheat our farmers with unfair trade practices unelected bureaucrats have strangled our farmers with regulation after regulation and even your elected officials have tried to tax our farmers to death and as a result farm income has been on a drastic and steady decline until now so thank you mr. president for not forgetting about the rule rural America and thank you for rolling back job-killing regulations calling out corrupt trade practices and pushing Congress to ease the burden of the death tax my farm friends and Mississippi thank you Mr Speaker I yield back gentleman yields back

big companies in this country of ours is sitting on a pile of cash one of the reasons why they're not spending that money and hiring people is because of uncertainty what are we going to do about the deficits what agreed about energy policy transportation policy we're going to repeal health care we're going to change it there's a huge amount of uncertainty what we need to do is begin to address that uncertainty I think the administration's making some progress I think we're making some fibers I think economy is coming back but until we have better predictability butter certainty for particular businesses large but also small we're not going to see the kind of take off that we need but but it's encouraging a lot of positive signs right now the deficit is doubled in the last ten years the last ten years we're on track to double it again in tonight's a bipartisan burn on a trip we need as we talked about this a little bitter what we need is a culture of thrift where we looking at the replacer culture of spin through we need to look in every nook and cranny the federal government discretionary spending domestic defense the entire and plugged find savings make sure we're spending money wisely do you expect the President to talk about this kind of culture of thrift and major deficit spending I think you might be did you expect that just to get me off his back and it is administration for months I think it's the right thing people think we have a culture of spindrift here we need to replace that with the culture of threat to make sure that we're spending money and whether its investments for education we know there's some of them make a lot of sense of some of them don't Center corgi expect President Obama to propose a corporate tax cut tonight this is a huge issue on Wall Street it's a huge issue for business and most big businesses and small businesses believe it is the key to competitiveness not more spending you expect the corporate tax cut proposal I think he's going to look it's going to talk about the deficit reduction Commission that recommended lower rates and a broader base and I think my hope is that you'll look back into commission's recommendations or near recommendations and in order to bar from their recommendations on the revenue side and on the spending side they call for deficit reduction to for every dollar in revenues new revenues about two dollars in spending cuts

I represent New York one the greatest congressional district in America so I got an itch in my throat we're located on the east end of Long Island and this district is almost completely surrounded by water in my home county of Suffolk we have 65 parks that receive funding from this program for for us we love our parks we love our beaches we care about plans for coastal resiliency we see the impacts of rising sea levels everything that gets discussed behind us or in a committee room with great debate we see its impacts each and every day hitting as close to home as possible for us and really on behalf of my constituents I want to say thank you as well to all of my colleagues and to all of you because as Brian Fitzpatrick pointed out this is over 50% underfunded and as our colleagues in the Senate in the house have pointed out many times through the years and trying to get the reauthorization done this is funded in theory very responsibly to save tax dollars to reinvest money that is brought in elsewhere and put towards the best of use through the l WCF this is a program that is about efficiency this is about our environment our way of life who we are and for the future for our kids for our grandkids for those great parks at home from whatever congressional district you come from it's for them to be able to have what we can tell them stories of great memories of growing up of that great park close to home so to preserve what we cherish to preserve what we love we need to rededicate ourselves to this effort we celebrate a reauthorization but we recommit ourselves to make sure that it is fully funded and we encourage all of our colleagues to get off the sidelines if they're there now and to help us with this effort to join us and riding your coattails towards a big win of fully funding LW CF for the many years to come

obviously expected to be the top conversation joining us right now is kansas senator roger marshall he is a member of the energy small business and agriculture committees senator your committee is right in the middle of all of this with this inflation spike from energy to food what do you want to see come out of this saudi trip well maria what i wish is the president would take care of his own house first kansas will be the third leading capital investment in oil and gas in the next several years but my folks are afraid to invest they're afraid to invest because this president won't give them any certainty and then he's piling on more regulations as well i just hope the president doesn't embarrass us i hope he repairs our relationship with israel frankly i think israel has been felt a little bit shunned by this president whatever he can accomplish with saudi arabia well and good but let's turn to american source for our oil dependence i think it's a really important point that you make and yet we do not see any pivoting here senator as you know the president is uh digging in on his climate change agenda in fact even joe manchin is now shooting down any notion of passing any additional stimulus funding even though i know and have reported in the last several weeks that chuck schumer has been trying to get manchin on board on another build back better version which would include higher taxes so here's joe manchin when we caught up with him last night watch this president biden said the inflation number today is outdated because it doesn't include a small drop in gas prices we've seen recently is he right to blame the data for a bad a historically bad inflation number it's the same people that might have given him information saying it was transitory a year ago and it wasn't transitory no it wasn't transitory senator so why did they tell us for a year that inflation was no big deal and it was transitory as they tried to push through another five trillion dollar spending plan look maria they are addicted to spending and this bill is more inflationary spending look if you're going to borrow another trillion dollars from my grandchildren our grandchildren it's going to be inflationary and beyond that like you point out this is going to kill jobs it's going to kill small businesses they want to add a 3.8 percent tax to pass through entities like llcs and s corps those pass-through entities probably make up over what half of the nation's uh companies and half of the jobs as well so it's inflationary and it kills jobs well i mean we are already seeing the beginning of a wave of job cut certainly in in the tech sector but it's not just inflation on the essentials it's other things as well you wrote a letter yesterday to the administration asking to wave duties on fertilizer tell me about the situation around fertilizer right now right maria well the nitrogen-based fertilizers have quadrupled in price since joe biden took office quadrupled and right now we have tariffs on some foreign countries for fertilizers including morocco and trinidad so we've asked the president just like he took tariffs off solar panels because of an energy crisis to take the tariffs off these fertilizers the price of fertilizers is driving up input costs and it ends up driving up the cost of groceries while groceries were up twelve percent the this this uh month as well so that's right the cost of fertilizers are driving up the cost of those groceries we want the president to stop these tariffs well what about tariffs on chinese goods senator where are you on that because it seems that the china policy is all about giving in to the chinese communist party they didn't want the china initiative they didn't want all those investigations into their intellectual property theft so joe biden canceled the china initiative uh they also don't want the tariffs on and now he's considering it you're right maria look china's even cut off their phosphate exports to everybody in in the world right now china is indeed playing the long game i think president trump and ustr bob lighthizer proved the only way you could handle china was to put high tariffs that you could automatically put back in when they didn't keep up their side of the bargain they continue to steal intellectual property they continue to make the fentanyl we have to continue the tariffs on china it's black and white to me all right senator good to see you thanks very much for weighing in on all of that senator roger marshall this morning in washington thank you sir

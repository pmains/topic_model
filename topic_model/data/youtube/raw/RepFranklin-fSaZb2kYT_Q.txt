the gentleman from florida mr franklin is recognized thank you madam chair and thank you to our witnesses too for what i'm what has definitely been a long and tedious afternoon for you we appreciate your patience uh my first question is for director ray and for the sake of consistency i've asked this question of our witnesses in the other hearings from department of justice the dod and the metropolitan police director ray what um what security agency would you say has the primary responsibility for security the physical security of the capitol my understanding is that's the us capitol police okay that's that's been the consistent answer and this has come up uh multiple times here this afternoon we're now into several hearings regarding this issue we've yet to have anyone from the capitol police it's uh it seems to me that's a waste of time until we can get those folks here in the room uh general piot you had mentioned in your testimony that i think we had 350 guard troops that started the morning here are um that showed up for duty uh initially in the morning doing traffic and crowd control is that correct that was the total they had less than that for for two shifts so that was a total for two shifts but they were out on traffic control points unarmed and on crowd control locations throughout the district okay traffic and crowd control how many were ultimately activated by the end of the day at the end when the day started about 350 cards men were activated by the end of the day that that number increased probably to six to 700 i'd have to get the right number for you sir okay and then that uh the balance of those troops that showed up later in the day what were they doing at the beginning of the day they were most likely in their civilian location we've got the full mobilization order at at 304 by the acting secretary of defense and then we were able to mobilize and recall people so they came in from you know their civilian workplace or forever wherever they were and that's very very fast given the circumstances and what time again was that that they would have been activated safe from their civilian jobs and told the head and i assume they were told to head straight to the armory to pick up their gear congressman yes 304 is when the acting secretary defense gave the full mobilization order for the dc national guard okay and so from the the traffic control and um and crowd control mission early in the day not only did the mission change the command structure the tactics the rules of engagement and there's a complete change in mission set from what they thought they might have been getting earlier in the day to what ultimately happened correct correct congressman they were working for the metropolitan police department and now they were going to move to a federal federal police department of the capitol police which they had to be resworn in but they had to be re-equipped reconfigured for this new mission for civil unrest i know there have been some talk that you might have commented about the optics of how it looked having guard troops there at the capitol you weren't sure you said that but in the heat of discussing contingencies it might have been said but i think i've also heard you say too that you discussed the difference in the mission and really what our guard troops are trained to do versus the special type of training required to conduct that mission in the capitol could you expand on that a little bit for us yes congressman i don't recall saying that word that that day because the optics were clearly a mob storming the capital that was not an important uh uh consideration at that time what what was important was getting the capital secure and to rapidly clear the capital when you had criminals with with perhaps lethal intent is what we were what we were tracking you had innocent civilians mixed uh that's a pretty high level uh task for for very well-trained law enforcement to do to take uh soldiers who are out on traffic control points or posture to do that to put them into that situation uh they simply we just weren't positioned to do that very good um yeah i would just like to make it clear that i think that the guard did a response a remarkable job in responding in the time frame especially given the circumstances you know it's interesting you know we have 45 members of this committee and this has been a notice hearing for a week and it still took us a half hour to get the hearing started so i think in light of everything happening that day it was pretty remarkable and i just want to say in my hat's off to all the folks who did make that response personally i feel as a failure in capital leadership capital police leadership but unfortunately we've yet to have any of them here before us to testify even though there's been ample opportunity and i hope we get that eventually but thank you all for for your time this afternoon i yield back the gentleman yield

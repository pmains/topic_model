thank you chairman and I was elated to hear that our subcommittee the subcommittee on economic and consumer policy was actually holding a hearing on inflation thank you you know today's September the 22nd meaning that uh after nearly nine full months this is only the second hearing that we've had this calendar year so I'm very glad that Democrats are actually holding a hearing on a relevant topic let's not forget that the only other hearing that this subcommittee has had was on pet flea and tick collars this year the United States has experienced the highest inflation in decades and it is deeply troubling to me that Democrats on this committee have seemed to have decided to turn a blind eye to the painful price hikes their policies have inflicted on the American people now Democrats are desperately trying to deflect the blame largely toward capitalism and so-called corporate greed rather than admitting that their runaway spending in big government socialist agenda has caused and continues to fuel the inflation crisis last week the CPI report revealed that during the month of August inflation hit a whopping 8.3 percent exceeding all expectations the average price of gas is still 25 percent higher than last year and groceries have surged almost 14 percent groceries the price of groceries continues to rise hitting the lowest income Americans the hardest eggs are up nearly 40 percent compared to August of 2021 milk is up 17 percent chicken is up 17 and bread is up over 16 percent now Americans are struggling to buy groceries and to afford gas and it simply did not have to be like this Mr Wright um I believe uh you served in the Clinton Administration is that correct that's correct Congressman all right I believe Mr Larry Summers who served as the 71st United States Treasury secretary also served in the Clinton Administration uh is that correct uh yes I I certainly I was there we overlapped same time okay great uh do you think he is a qualified and knowledgeable individual I do he's a friend and I respect him thank you well Harvard Professor Mr Larry Summers was a top economic advisor to both President Clinton and President Obama and I think that's pretty impressive and yet the Biden Administration seems to have refused to heed Economist warnings of growing inflation on February the 4th 2021 Professor Summers who again served in both the Clinton and the Obama administration's warned that President Biden's almost 2 trillion quote stimulus plan known as the American Rescue plan was three times as large as the output shortfall and that quote policymakers need to ensure that they have plans in place to address the possible and quite serious problem of inflation and I want to point out that I voted against this uh disastrous piece of democrat legislation last year yet again on May the 18th of this year Mr Summers reiterated his concern but the concern apparently again fell on deaf ears he said that Democrat policy makers are and I quote taking very substantial risks on the inflation side given that even top Democrat economic advisors economists like Mr Summers warned of this inflation because of the less policies it seems hypocritical that now Democrats are blaming companies for Rising prices uh Dr mabad I would like to ask you a pretty simple question a yes or no will suffice are the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats to blame at all for the crippling inflation burdening hard-working American families the critical Investments the administration and Congress made over the a job full of recovery rather than the job less recovery I didn't ask you about that I asked you about inflation would you please answer the question it's really important to address the fact that working people are the people who keep this economy going okay so you're not going to answer the question you are not going to answer whether or not Democrats in the bind Administration are to blame at all for crippling inflation burdening hard-working families you know I'm here today to talk about corporate profiteering which has been hiking hiking prices okay all right so we're not going to get anywhere here over the weekend President Biden stated in a 60 Minutes interview that inflation had hardly risen quote the inflation rate month to month was just just an inch hardly at all so Mr Goodspeed is inflation just up an inch hardly at all no you can look at the year-over-year figure which is 8.3 percent headline you can look at the core or underlying measures of inflation median inflation to which everyone was pointing a year ago saying this is this is evidence that we don't have an inflation problem in August that Rose at an annualized rate of 9.2 percent so we have a problem with inflation

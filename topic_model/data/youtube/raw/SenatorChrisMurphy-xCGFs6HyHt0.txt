thank you very much mr. chairman you know it looks to us these days as if the United States is the junior partner in this relationship I think of all of the timeline that Senator Kaine just went through the idea that we transferred the Saudis nuclear technology literally days after the dismemberment of a journalist under us protection came to light causes us all to wonder whether this is just one big scam I'm glad we're doing this hearing I want to drill down on part of your testimony mr. Cooper with respect to the purpose of our continued coalition with the Saudis you say in your testimony that quote we have worked with the saudi-led coalition over the course of its operations to reduce the occurrence of civilian casualties but that is not in fact true in fact the opposite is true civilian casualties are dramatically increasing in 2017 airstrikes killed approximately 2,700 civilians inside Yemen in 2018 airstrikes killed approximately 46 hundred civilians inside Yemen and reports are consistent that approximately one third of coalition airstrikes are hitting civilian targets that number has not changed so do you have different numbers or do you agree with this broad assessment that civilian casualties are increasing not decreasing on the tragedy the civilian casualties there is uptick what we've seen from the hootie activity on on civilians I would offer on that's what I asked I asked about the air strikes the air strikes the reports are that almost twice as many civilians were killed by air strikes and the air strikes are by the Coalition in 2018 and 2017 your testimony says you have worked to do civilian correct these the data says they doubled right there is there is ongoing work to not only mitigate but also refine targeting so this is not limited to where targets are conducted by the coalition this is how they actually conduct the work this is also avoiding areas where there would be civilian casualties that work is not abated it's actually been increased we can talk to further detail about that so work is increased but just to get the facts right your your wording and the testimonies careful you say you've worked with them to reduce civilian casualties but would you concede that that civilian casualties from air strikes has increased not decreased I cannot speak to the exact numbers but I can tell you that is what we've done on capabilities to mitigate has increased on mitigating civilian casualty speak to numbers I mean don't you keep you don't if you were working with them to decrease civilian casualties wouldn't you keep the numbers on the interagency we do work with our partners with DoD and others to get them to a capacity where they are more precise in identifying targets more precise and executing their targets and actually in avoidance of a certain look I know you work to that I know that you are trying to work on that but you can't testify before us today as to what the actual civilian casualties are you don't know whether they have increased or decreased the numbers associated with civilian casualties are not limited to what has been attributed to coalition number senator but okay so you do you know or do you not know whether civilian casualties have increased due to coalition airstrikes I would say in a general sense here that there is a Delta and information on what is attributed to a coalition ascribed casualty and what may be ascribed to either a hootie or one of the adversary all right I'll be happy to give you some fairly definitive information that states that they have doubled over time and the fact that you're talking around this is maddening you talked earlier about consequences that would run to a US ally that transfers arms that we have given to them to third parties not authorized to be the recipient of us arms as you know in February of this year there was a very disturbing report that suggested multiple US weapon systems had been transferred to private militias operating inside Yemen reports are that US made Akash armored vehicles were transferred to Abu Abbas which is a militia linked with al-qaeda and UAE and UAE s government in fact confirmed that they have transferred M wrap vehicles to the giants brigade a Salafist militia that is doing work on the UAE s behalf inside Yemen have you come to the conclusion that these transfers were made and if you have what have the consequences been and how can you justify continuing to sell arms to countries that are openly advertising that they are taking the weapons we give them and the vehicles we give them and giving them to others that are not authorized to be in the possession thank you senator the UAE remains a security partner for us in the region not just for their sovereignty but also for our interest in equities however it does not preclude us from an investigation it does not preclude us from following up and it does not preclude us from any imposition or Consequences so specific to the MRAP question that I've been in long enough to be able to directly address that issue with emirati government we are working with our embassy to get more detail and finality on that issue it is an ongoing investigation it has not been completely resolved but we have directly approached the Emirati government at a ministerial level and at a working level specific to the reported imrat transfer my time is up but they have publicly confirmed that they transferred the M wraps there is no investigation they told a CNN reporter that they gave the n wraps to the giants Brigade and so that report coming in February doesn't need a five month long investigation and part of our frustration about this new transfer weapons to the Emiratis is it signals that there are no consequences and so I would hope that this committee would make some further inquiry as to why an investigation is still ongoing when in February the UAE government confirmed that they had taken these M reps and given them to a Salafist militia inside the UAE sorry I went over my time Thank You mr. chairman

and yesterday congressman brad sherman wasted no time in introducing articles of impeachment against a president Trump congressman brad sherman joins me now congressman from california congressman thank you very much i know it's a busy day for you appreciate your time let me first get your reaction sir to the president he reacted to the news of all of this talk about impeachment in a tweet he wrote how do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time done no collusion with russia it was the Dems that colluded had the most successful first two years of any president and is the most popular republican party in history ninety three percent your reaction sir to that i don't know we don't have enough time to go into how many falsehoods there were in just that one tweet but the fact is i introduced articles of impeachment in July of 2017 all I did yesterday was make sure that those articles did not expire it's a long road to impeachment and filing articles of the impeachment is just one of the many steps and I wanted to make sure that we didn't take a step backward yesterday be the the articles that I filed in July of 2017 needed to be put back in the hopper and that's what I did and fair enough I wanted to play for you and you heard I believe Speaker Nancy Pelosi what she had to say about this issue why not sir wait for the investigations to play out before taking any action why the rush as you said to reintroduce those articles of impeachment once again I filed them in July of 2017 yeah but why that was once again why are you doing it once again I didn't I I didn't want them to expire I didn't want to take a step backward they should be pending before the house so that when the Muller investigation and other facts come to light they're ready to be taken up along with what I suppose will be other articles of impeachment we have a multi month process to look at here but having done something in July of 2017 I wasn't going to do it in 2019 especially not with the danger that this president poses to our country do you believe that the only basis to impeach President Trump right now is based on what comes out of the Muller report or is there something beyond that that is an impeachable offense from what you've learned so far that was the reason filed those articles of impeachment in July of 2017 obstruction of justice and even if there's nothing in the Muller report the president is guilty of violating section 1512 B 3 of the federal criminal code when he tried to interfere in the Flynn investigation when he fired call me to obstruct the Russian investigation and it's his obstruction of justice even if it's ineffectual so even if there's nothing in the Muller report and I can see why people at least politically would want to wait for the Muller report and see whether it gives us more reasons to act but what he did in his first six months in the presidency on the record in front of the cameras constitutes a violation of law and it's not doesn't stop being a felony just because you do it in front of the cameras let me get your reaction as well to what congresswoman Rasheeda Talib I said at the MoveOn rally last night congressman Elijah Cummings had to say this a few minutes ago about that I've said that we will we will reclaim civility you cannot accomplish very much of anything unless you have civility and show respect for your colleagues and I think those kind of comments do not take us in the right direction so I would say today are inappropriate so the congresswoman obviously shares your sentiments about impeachment impeachment but there are calls for her this morning to apologize about the language she used and in the manner in which to use them what is your reaction to to her comments well I plan to go back to my office and look at it in context it's obviously not my style I've been pushing the impeachment since July of 2017 want to introduced articles I have never used any words that my nine-year-old daughter shouldn't hear so I think it's important that we are very methodical about this that were calm we have civility and that we base it on the legal analysis such as the one I've published about section 1512 B 3 that's the way we can mobilize the country and it's going to take many months of additional work before we have the country mobilized to move forward and that's the style I would use all right congressman brad sherman sir thank you very much

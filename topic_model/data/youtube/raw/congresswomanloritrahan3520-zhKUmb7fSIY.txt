uh thank you madam chair uh mr calamari i represent a diverse district which is home to one of the most undeserved cities across the entire state of massachusetts uh the city of lawrence is a minority majority city with a poverty rate of 21 on a per capita basis the city suffered greater numbers of covid19 infections than any other city or town in massachusetts this has already stretched the city's limited resources and adversely impacted the hard-working families there so it's almost unthinkable that now the very same families who suffered the most throughout the pandemic are those who are once again disproportionately impacted this time by the baby formula shortage you know for base staters abbott simalac baby formula is the exclusive brand for wic although abbott's recall has impacted states across the country it has fallen hardest on states like massachusetts that have contracted with abbott so may 17th i along with my colleagues from the massachusetts delegation we sent you a letter we haven't received the response yet so i'd like to follow up on some of the questions now i was pleased to hear obviously that abbott entered into a consent degree a decree agreement with the fda committing to fully correct all five of the deficient observations from the january through march 2022 fda inspection and to develop plans to reduce and control the risk of bacterial contamination in its products but it also never should have got to this point uh if you in fact had proper safety protocols in place that were reinforced with a culture of surfacing problems as my colleagues congresswoman rice and trier have pointed out mr calamari abbott has publicly stated that the company could restart the sturgis plant within the two weeks of fda approval your testimony walks through several specific improvements and states that abbott is quote installing nonporous easily cleanable sanitary floors and quote confirming process consistency by validating the dry out test method and verifying the dry out procedures it seems like these are things that should have already been in place well before the recall was necessary so why is abbott only taking these steps now and how can we feel certain that there aren't other systemic problems at the sturgis plant being left unaddressed representative thank you for the question sturgis is a facility that has been inspected annually for a decade and it had many many years of no observations it's a plant that's been feeding families for decades in 2019 and 2021 we did find and identify areas where we needed to improve those observations were identified and we took immediate action specific to 2022 we are prepared and we are working around the clock every all hands on deck to address the issues raised so we can get the facility up the first week of june is our goal and that's what everyone's working towards so some prior observations from fda eastern facility reflect a potentially lacks culture when it comes to maintaining a sanitary product environment you mentioned protocols where employees are encouraged to flag safety lapses prior to the whistleblower how many times have employees registered complaints with safety internally to managers in the company representative representative i appreciate the question i'm going to have to get back to you with the specific numbers how about additional training or controls uh what are you putting in place to ensure that this is not an issue when you reopen the sturgis plant and according to your testimony quote more than double your production so so we will continue to investigate all reports and make sure we have a zero conduct zero tolerance policy for retaliation or misconduct um we have our ethics and compliance office and our hotlines there um as additional resources to make sure employees are heard and that there's an avenue to speak up and hear your voice and have your voice raised if you see something well hopefully those employees that speak up will be uh rewarded the fastest way for you to turn around your culture i think is to uh show folks that you are so committed to servicing problems that you will re reward employees who actually bring those problems to your attention so that you can get working on fixing them finally mr culinary what is avid planning to do with the infant formula held but not recalled at the sturgis plant since february 17th are are you planning to release any of these products and if so how is the company ensuring the safety and quality of these products so representative i think you're assuming you're referring to the product that's on hold um that product that product will remain on hold consistent with uh the consent decree we have made an amendment to the consent decree to release elicare product in alignment with fda okay thank you madam chair i yield back

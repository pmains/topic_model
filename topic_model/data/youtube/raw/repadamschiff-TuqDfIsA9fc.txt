discuss democratic congressman adam schiff of california is the chairman of the house select committee on intelligence uh mr chairman thanks for joining us does the u.s know for sure that russia is responsible for this horrific attack on that hospital that maternity and children's hospital in mary opal um jake i haven't gotten a report yet uh from the intelligence community about it i'm getting briefed generally multiple times a day but i don't have fidelity on that uh of course the russians are increasingly indiscriminate in their bombing uh it is as sadly we anticipated uh the stiff resistance the russians are meeting uh is causing putin to simply double down uh and try to inflict as much pain as possible uh so uh i don't have confirmation but uh it's certainly tragically consistent with what we're seeing of uh how the russians are broadening this conflict and just trying to inflict uh maximum pain uh on the people of ukraine yeah i mean it certainly wouldn't be out of character they've already bombed several hospitals in ukraine and and they did so to devastating effect in syria over the past decade um just moments ago white house press secretary jensachi tweeted quote we should all be on the lookout for russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in ukraine or to create a false flag operation using them unquote do you expect that to happen uh you know this is uh sadly one of the false flag operations that we anticipate the russians may deploy um this is part of their tradecraft uh and you know sadly we've seen similar things in the past so i am deeply concerned about it and of course depending on how the russians go about it uh if they were to use chemical or biological agents as a pretext uh of course um that would be another terrible escalation uh and who knows where that could lead you mentioned yesterday what you're hearing from some of your constituents about ukraine i want to play that sound i also think and this is what i hear from my constituents and i know on a bipartisan basis it's what my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are hearing that is they want us to do more the house is expected to vote this week on a massive spending bill that would include nearly 14 billion dollars in additional assistance free from you for ukraine what else can the administration do to help save ukraine from this murderous thug vladimir putin while also not risking causing world war three well you know that's exactly the line that we have to walk we want to make sure that we don't get in the shooting war ourselves with the russians but i think there's still a lot more that we can do to continue to ratchet up sanctions on russia and make the russian people see the folly of their murderous and despotic uh ruler but also there's further military support we can provide ukraine to help ukraine with its air defense i think that's a particularly high priority for ukraine uh to make sure that they have the ability to take out some of the russian aircraft that are engaging in discriminative bombing uh but also uh to take out uh russian uh tanks and other military vehicles uh and and so we're doing our best to provide that kind of support at the same time avoiding any any red lines well there was this plan floated by poland to have uh their soviet-made planes mig-29s go to ramstein air force base and then the u.s would get the planes to ukraine so they could defend their own skies uh do their own no-fly zone but the pentagon shot that down well as i understand it what the pentagon rejected was flying those planes from from an american base in germany and i understand the concern they have about the the potential escalation uh there should be another way to get those planes to ukraine i would certainly support our doing that um and having ukrainian pilots uh leave ukraine to uh take possession of those aircraft and and fly them into ukraine um i also want to make sure that we get ukraine some of the missiles they need so that they can shoot down russian aircraft from the ground uh that to me is a an urgent priority and i hope that we are and i know we're working with our nato and other allies to try to make that happen it appears that the us and the west have drawn a line and the line is nato countries we're not going to come to the defense uh with our own troops or service members uh in ukraine they're not a member of nato but nato countries uh that's where we draw the line your congressman um congressman mike uh your colleague congressman mike quigley of illinois spoke to cnn earlier today i want to play some of what he said can we stop talking about ukraine uh as not being a member of nato the ukrainian fight and the ukrainian spirit are the very reasons embodied in why we formed nato in the first place we have to protect them we have to protect the skies i know what that means and we don't do things like this rashly but but if we're balancing things what needs to be on the other side of the scale for us to act do you disagree with him look i understand how he feels uh he represents a large ukrainian diaspora i do too uh that i met with recently in los angeles and it's absolutely heartbreaking and our constituents want us to do more at the same time our constituents don't want us going to war with russia and so i think we have to continue to walk that line make sure that we're providing ukraine with all the support we can make sure that we're turning up the pain on russia i'm very proud to see americans in overwhelming numbers support a ban on russian oil and gas even though that's going to mean more pain at the pump but but i don't think we can go to war with russia or should go to war with russia house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff

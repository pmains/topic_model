i really appreciate pastor virgil uh being here today and we're reminded that jesus said we're supposed to love one another the way he loved us we're supposed to pray for our enemies and i love those uh who don't who don't like us that's his his calling and how to treat uh with people that we disagree with or those we have anger with i was out in the old market today talked to dozens of store owners and residents a lot of them were very scared and uh so i support people's constitutional right to protest freedom of speech and we want justice for george floyd in rightful justice and due process but violence and vandalism is unacceptable and we can't do that either so i uh just we want to be a community of peace and civil dialogue and we want a country that has equality under the law by pastor virgil yeah well i'm excited i'm excited to be here with you don thank you uh honored to be here i think we've got to figure out a way to love one another god tells us in scripture genesis 1 27 that we're creating in his image and likeness and as a result we have a responsibility to love god with all our heart soul mind and strength we're going to love our neighbor as ourselves so while we're filled with emotion it's also important that we share a message of hope a message of love and one of peace so i just wanted i want to take a minute to pray for our city if that'd be okay i'll pray with you okay let's do it finally god we just right now come before you and we just lay our city before you uh we ask you to move in a way that makes a difference uh with all that's going on with folks who have emotion stirred up in different ways with regard to what's what's happened to george floyd our prayer lord god is that justice is served our prayer is that peace reigns oh god you're the very prince of peace you're the one that brings us together it's only through our saving knowledge of you that we come to experience the ultimate peace the peace that passes all understanding that we have have a relationship with you so i pray for our city i pray for our country i pray for our nation i pray for our world lord god that we would experience true peace that can only come through jesus christ i thank you for dawn for for all those civil servants who are out there desiring to see you move in ways like you only like only you can we ask all of these things in jesus name amen thank you amen appreciate you absolutely thank you thank you

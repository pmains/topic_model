uh mr chairman i request permission to enter an occult with mr dicks chairman ranking member dix mr chairman today i rise to address the ranking member of the house appropriations committee on defense mr dicks and also the chair in a colloquy on the critical need to improve the recruitment retention and competitive compensation of the mental health professionals who can work with our wounded warriors especially during the iraq and afghanistan military service servicemen and women since 2001 2103 military members have died by suicide and one in five service members currently suffer from post traumatic stress and or major depression we must ensure that an adequate number of mental health professionals are available to treat our soldiers mental health professionals must be retained by providing adequate pay and competitive benefits that are also available in the private sector it is our duty and responsibility to our wounded warriors that we ensure their mental health services are secure and available when and where needed i'm submitting for the record an article from the army times dated april 7 2011 regarding the senate appropriations committee defense subcommittee meeting of april 6th quoting army surgeon general lieutenant general schumacher who stressed severe lack of mental health professionals in the military and his concern about retention especially in the rural areas his quote also states congress has been pressing the military health system to add more psychiatric doctors nurses and social workers for years that has prompted the services to add about 1500 full-time mental health professionals since 2006. a 70 percent increase he further says but demand has continued to outpace the growth active duty troops and their families were referred to off-base civilian mental health care professionals nearly 4 million times 4 million times in 2009 roughly double the number of off-base referrals in 2006 the military data shows the dramatic increase in military suicides during the past several years has added urgency to congressional concerns at the april 6 meeting or hearing all three military surgeons generals told lawmakers about efforts to improve training recruiting and retention of mental health professionals senator mikulski has suggested military training may be uniquely important because some civilian doctors and social workers have trouble understanding the troops problems and mindset i'm also submitting for the record a witness statement of july 14 uh 2011 from the subcommittee of oversight and investigations on veterans affairs where deputy director of veterans affairs and rehabilitation division jacob god expressed the challenges of hiring and retaining quality mental health specialists our service members should not have to wait one more day for the help they deserve as co-chair of the congressional mental health caucus i have met with many key military leaders to learn what the most critical issues are in addressing mental health services for our military men and women i've repeatedly been informed that they have been woefully inadequate numbers of mental health professionals available to care for our men and women congress has a responsibility to see that our soldiers and veterans have the resources for quality care because this quality of care is dependent on the quantity a behavioral health specialist trained in war pts we can we must successfully recruit and retain to work with our men and women who fight to ensure our precious daily freedoms the legislation before you today provides 32.3 billion for the defense health program and military family programs with 125 million of this going towards research of traumatic brain injury and psychological health treatment hopefully to also include hyperbaric treatment research we must insist on accountability that adequately trained behavioral health professionals are on hand when and where needed i'd like to work with ranking member to obtain from department offense a detailed outline on their efforts for each military service army air force navy marines etc to recruit retain and formulate the competitive salaries and benefits that will keep behavioral health specialists serving our men and women who have given so much to protect our freedoms we place them in harm's way it is our duty and obligation to ensure best care is given

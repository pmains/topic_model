so first off the Hippocratic oath first do no harm Obamacare was a fantastic improvement we shouldn't have to defend it but we do but there's over 20 million Americans today that have health insurance that didn't before and best estimates is that's about 20,000 to 40,000 Americans every year who aren't dying that used to so when Roskam and others attacked that plan that's what's at stake defend that the second piece and I'd love your question about the transition because it is the million dollar question here the there are no trade-offs here if you look around the world because if you look at the rest of the OECD countries and say I only want to look at those countries that deliver better overall health outcomes and lower costs you ruled out a lot of them the ones you're left with all have universal health care so there is a moral issue but there's just a don't be an idiot issue here if you want cheaper better health care you go to universal health care the the systems that are are in my view the best to emulate are actually interesting interesting the ones that are easiest to get to the Swiss and German system Switzerland pays about two-thirds of what we do and has about half the unexpected fatality rate from their health care system which means roughly a trillion dollars of savings and their model interestingly enough looks like the Obama care market with a full public option with a full suite of of Obamacare exchanges and essentially a means-tested floor that makes sure that everybody gets the floor and then you can opt up into other and other systems and that model delivers really good outcomes one last thing just doesn't know by the way better than every OSCE country in terms of health outcomes is the state of Minnesota so we can learn a lot internally just about what the differences are between US states as well

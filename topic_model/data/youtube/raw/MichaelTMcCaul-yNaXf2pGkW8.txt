in this country we have freedom of religion and I look at these charges and I mean it's just it's unreal I mean this Abedini your husband's crime was attending peaceful church gatherings for as you put it believing in Jesus Christ is a threat to the national security of the Iranian government I just I just find that astounding and for that belief he is thrown into prison what does that say about our negotiation notion goshi ating partner are they really acting in good faith and Miss Hekmati your brother being put in a 1 meter by one meter cell and beaten and tortured I can't imagine what he is going through and I know you think about it every day of your life and what is his crime corrupting the earth and being an enemy of God cooperating with the United States you know what kind of charges that and now all the while we're doing these negotiations it seems to me miss Abedini as you mentioned now is the time to increase the pressure to release these American hostages now's the time we have the negotiations and I would argue you're absolutely correct we should halt these negotiations until these prisoners are released we should stop the negotiation until they agree to release our American hostages first and foremost but I am afraid that's that's not going to happen I'm concerned also about what are we doing to facilitate the release of your loved ones and we have witnesses come before this committee from the administration that talk about this issue but we get very little information I want to just each one of you tell me what has even illustration done to further the release of your loved one and i'll start with mr. rezian i think i'm fortunate because it's possible that the administration learned some things from some of the previous situations i've been in touch with state department they have spoken with the iranian government they've worked with swiss protecting power as well although the Iranians won't give jason access to another consular access so those kinds of things and they've been in touch with me on numerous occasions who when I have questions I'm able to contact them mr. Abedini I've been in contact with the State Department regularly they share with me that as mrs. Hekmati and mentioned that they're being discussed on the sidelines and the Iranians are not really responding to that and there and if we if a if we continue this talking for the last three two over two and a half years almost three years of talking on the sidelines it's not really working they're not still there not released I've been it's been almost three years for our family in a few weeks will be three years since we've seen side my frustration is I appreciate that they're being discussed on the sidelines but they're still not home whereas where's the action whereas where's the results I don't see any result Iran can continues to shrug it off and not really respond to our discussions on the sidelines and and as I mentioned this is crucial time Iran has to feel some pressure to want to release the Americans they're not going to do it through sideline discussions and and [ __ ] you know just chit-chatting and I hope there's some pressure to me as this is a crucial time to bring these Americans home and end our pain and suffering of our all of our families and even one day it would we would appreciate it American hostages should be the priority not be placed on the sidelines exact mistake mati all right just to chime in with the rest it's pretty much been a lot of our family and forming them of what's been going on in the process in Iran and then being reassured that it's a priority and that it's been raised and obviously they've done some facilitating of engagement with governments that are bilateral have a bilateral relationship with the u.s. and Iran and reaching out to them and they've reassured us that they have these nations whenever there's an opportunity to engage with the Iranians that they reach out and they ask about the cases of the prisoners being held there however again I reiterate this is that prior to us even having this face-to-face engagement these prisoners that were American that have been released have never been held as long as for example Amir and he's going on for years where we're sitting face-to-face so I'm wondering how effective is this raising of it on the sidelines of these negotiations really at this point and I think that we're beyond that see what times experiment mr. Levinson very quickly oh I'm afraid we're in the same boat because right now it has been on the sidelines but if for years we didn't have any kind of engagement so this has been a progress but my father is a retired FBI agent so we've been working very closely with the FBI but they had limited powers and what they can do I just want to note real quick beginning in case someone there are people watching this online and on the FBI's offered a five-million-dollar reward for the safe return of my father so we'd like that to be highlighted as well good point

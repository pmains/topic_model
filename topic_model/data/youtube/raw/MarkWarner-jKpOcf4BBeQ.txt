the Russian assault on our election system has prompted new measures to protect your vote and the midterms if you can get into a voter role you can change it you could add people to it you could delete people to it and you could create chaos on Election Day Oklahoma Republican Senator James Lankford is a key sponsor of the secure Elections Act legislation aimed at providing local election officials with new tools to guard against election hacking we need to be able to step up our game to be able to help protect the systems there's 21 different states the Russians probed in 2016 they didn't get into all of those states but they were probing and looking around to be able to see what they could do officials caution there is no evidence any vote was actually changed but what is known is that foreign entities did poke around into some states voter rolls checked individual voter registrations and also assessed the type of election software that states used and what's more state officials did not even have the security clearance to be told their systems were under attack the new bill changes that it grants one day security clearances to state and local officials creates a new panel of cybersecurity experts to assess vulnerabilities and provides more federal money for states to beef up their election security the bill really does does offer the key steps that Congress should be doing to protect our elections Laurie Norton an election expert at the Brennan Center for Justice is the author of the report securing elections from foreign interference he wishes the new measures were in place right now there's a vulnerability there and when you're talking about the potential for a state actor whether it's Russia or China or North Korea or Iran and the intelligence agencies tell us we've got to worry about all of these guys then there's there's a vulnerability Norden says while congressional proposals are a much-needed step old voting machines need to be replaced a Brennan Center survey are more than 200 election officials in 33 states found they wanna buy new machines by the next presidential election but right now do not have the money that's a concern not only because older machines are more likely to break down they're also more likely to be vulnerable to cyberattack you're talking about systems that haven't gone through the more sophisticated certification process that we have now and that often run on outdated software like Windows 2000 in 2016 we know that Russian actors targeted state election systems last month the Senate Intelligence Committee held hearings on election security officials culture states to only use voting machines that provide paper proof of a vote a so-called paper trail not connecting machines to the Internet and mandating audits of the votes after every election maintaining the integrity of our voting systems and more importantly the public's faith that their votes will be counted in a fair and accurate way is is extraordinarily critical you expect the Russians to try it again I would fully expect the Russians to try it again and langford cautions it's not just Moscow he warns other adversaries even domestic activist groups could try to target your vote they could determine how when it creates some sort of turmoil in the American government or in a certain state now that they've seen the Russians do it once that can be copycatted by a lot of folks and obviously doesn't have to be a foreign actor next time so I think we just have to remain vigilant in the process our election system is important we need to make sure that we secure those

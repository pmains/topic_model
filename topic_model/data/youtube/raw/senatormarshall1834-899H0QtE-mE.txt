well welcome back senate republicans set to unveil their revised infrastructure proposal today they will meet with transportation secretary pete bouditched and commerce secretary gina ramondo on capitol hill the initial price tag was 568 billion dollars for a package that funded hard infrastructure that means roads bridges etc joining me right now is kansas senator and member of the senate small business and agriculture committee's roger marshall senator it's great to have you this morning thanks very much for joining us what is your take on an alternative to president biden's uh big spending and tax plans actually becoming reality well good morning maria i think i would just encourage your listeners to compare and contrast what the president's offering versus what we're offering the president wants to borrow two trillion dollars from your grandchildren he wants to raise your taxes and build electric car chargers what the republicans want to do is repurpose 600 billion dollars of the money that we spent back in january put that into the hands of county commissioners city officers those types of people make the decisions to build typical infrastructure plans like roads and bridges high-speed internet waterways railroads that classical infrastructure i think if you would ask any folks at those local levels how they would use the money with this economy just booming now we can't find people to go back to work though that that's what they would do with the money so we don't want to raise taxes we want to repurpose the dollars that we've already spent look the president has made no secret of the fact that he wants more money thrown at this economy four trillion dollars in additional money for a plan he's calling infrastructure and another plan he's calling a family plan while doing high taxes he wants to raise taxes by three trillion dollars on sunday morning futures on sunday your colleague john barrasso told me he doesn't have the support from the democrats can you walk us through that do you see pushback from within biden's own party that could uh limit his expectation to get this through reconciliation you know i see a a little bit of a shift the past two weeks on the hill i see that the democrats starting to come to the table having those sidebar conversations that are that the senate is known for i think you're seeing some pushback on the southern border from some moderate democrats as well so i think behind the scenes there's some push back otherwise they're going to end up doing this in a totally partisan fashion just like they did before back in january with the 2 trillion dollars he borrowed from our grandchildren so i do think he's getting pushback and that's why these discussions are happening today and i think senator brasso will do a great job sitting down with the secretary and make some progress we hope so when do you expect actual clarity on this when would you expect a a bill to actually start to move oh gosh um you know i think we're still weeks away but i think today this week is a big deal and we'll see what john comes back with from that meeting okay you recently introduced the get americans back to work act this would repeal federal enhanced unemployment benefits which has made it more profitable for many americans to actually stay home stay unemployed rather than returning to the workforce give us your assessment of where we are in in regards to that um these people are not lazy they're practical they're getting 300 they can get that 300 and then have a side gig and not leave their homes so you are seeing a serious impact from all of this money thrown at the economy right maria so in kansas unemployment sitting around 3 percent we have 80 million open jobs across the country the number one impediment to our economy is getting people back to work and and like you said they're not lazy people but they're being paid twenty dollars an hour to not work so most like in kansas people are getting five hundred dollars a week from the state and this three hundred dollars match so that's twenty dollars an hour so if you have two parents uh you know working to a married couple they're making 80 000 a year to stay at home and that just so they're making more to stay at home than to go back to work and i know there's other challenges out there too child care kids back to school those types of things there's other challenges that we need to keep addressing but we can't pay people more to stay at home than to go back to work makes it makes perfect sense senator look i also want to get your take on the origins of the coronavirus you recently wrote an op-ed for foxnews.com on the origins of the coronavirus and what questions the biden administration needs to be asking i spoke with congressman kevin devin nunes about this on sunday morning futures he sent a letter to president biden on over the weekend and he's coming out with his comprehensive report this week here's a bit of devin nunes from sunday watch us but what i believe it is and if the american people go and look at it there's 25 questions that the united states government ought to be answering not just for house republicans on the intelligence committee who are trying to get to the bottom of this but for all of the american people and all of our allies around the globe who are still reeling from this virus i mean every day people are still dying and thank god most americans have had had been vaccinated or have actually contracted the virus and it seems like we're on a downhill slide here in the united states that's why it's so important we need to get the answers to know how to move forward from here so senator how come we don't have the answers and how come president biden has not raised this with xi jinping yet i thought this was the priority it should be there should be bipartisan support to find out did this virus leak from wuhan does it occur in nature or is it made in a lab and then what are the rules surrounding viral gain of function and i think if you look closely at this there's a lot of evidence pointing that this could have been made in a laboratory if you go back to sars and the mers outbreaks both of those 2002 2012 within four months we had the intermediate host for for the sirs for the sars virus as a servant and then beyond that for the mar for the emerge outbreak it was then it only took us nine months here we are 16 months into this and we don't have an intermediate host we don't have any any collection of this virus china has investigated over 80 000 animals and we still don't know where this virus came from it should be a bipartisan effort here and and one of the executive orders from the bite administration in the first couple of weeks was we're not allowed to say china virus what's that about senator it's great to see you we'll keep a spotlight on this for sure thanks very much sir senator roger marshall we'll be right back

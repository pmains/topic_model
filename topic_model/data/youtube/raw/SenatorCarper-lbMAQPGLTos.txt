senator carper thanks fishing welcome thank you for joining us today and for your testimony and for your for your work dr. kavlock given the potential for a fairly rapid spread of this virus we can't afford for patients to delay screening because of concerns of affordability with respect to their insurance deductibles and co-pays recently the news media has documented one short term a health insurance plan in Florida I believe billing a patient more than three thousand dollars for his coronavirus screening and flu test three thousand dollars what are you and your staff doing to ensure that coronavirus screenings and treatment are low-cost and affordable have you asked your health insurers and employers to lower or remove financial barriers to coronavirus screenings well sir that was appreciated and that is why Seema Verma dr. Seema Verma is now a member who's the head of the CMS is part of the task force is to really focus in on that part of the problem one is about the the accessibility of healthcare for people who may have the corona virus and how that is being covered as well as the affordability issues she's been engaging with insurance companies and and it's not surprising that someone may be taking advantage of this but she's not someone to be fooled with and I clearly have confidence that she's going to engage on this fully but we can certainly have her available for a briefing for members if that would be helpful to talk more about what CMS is doing to address that concern accessibility and affordability so I I think that would be well-received thank you there's a bipartisan Commission on bio defense I think dr. Gallo you might have been the founding staff director yes sir that Commission I think it's co-chaired now by Tom Ridge former governor former secretary and Joe Lieberman who was once the chairman this committees may recall the in 2015 that group issued a report I think that that reported and included 33 recommendations to improve our nation's preparedness for intentional or natural occurring biological threats I'm pleased to know that the president has filled one of those recommendations and added by centralizing response efforts at the highest level of government in this case with the vice president many of the recommendations however remain unfulfilled as the founding of a staff director of that Commission could you just speak for a minute or so about the recommendations that still remain to be completed and what stands in our way for completing them well thank you sir I think just broadly that there was a second one that was completed that was a national bio defense strategy which was really the foundational document or effort to really understand what as a whole of government we need to do there was a lot of great work that Congress did with the administration back in 2005 and six and quite frankly that's unfinished business and I think that was the intent of that study panel to basically evaluate what needs to be done so broad strokes in the health care system we have a health care system that it's about 95 percent privatized that's running on very limited margins in terms of profitability limited surge and that surge capacity or lack of surge capacities and be tested to the limit here so that's one area in terms of health health or hospital healthcare system preparedness is a major vulnerability the other one at a critical infrastructure is the public health infrastructure which is really about the people at the state and local level and there are serious issues there in terms of the numbers of people who are willing to get involved in that that business I called the Rodney Dangerfield of of medicine they get no respect because when they do everything right nothing happens and it is a circumstance I think there that really does require a little more nuanced effort to promote and incentivize that the third is a different kind of infrastructure and that is would say the infrastructure for medical countermeasure development we talked a little bit about the domestic production of vaccines and and that's a good thing because if we can expand that that's only making sure we have the right vaccines but we have great jobs for Americans in many parts of the country and merely enhance innovation in healthcare that's the fourth element where we're doing some of that to address maybe some issues that would be related to supply that have to be addressed as things like active pharmaceutical ingredients the precursors for that and where that's manufactured much of its overseas and a great vulnerability as we will learn through this experience so there are there are four quick things in broad strokes that I would suggest that that study panel has done to raise our awareness and focus our efforts to do that and you may have answered I don't know I'm sure that yeah but just take take another minute about talking to us about steps that additional steps that the administration is taking to fill other recommendations you mentioned four that have been fulfilled but the other 30 some that maybe have not been yes sir and I'll put it in broad strokes because we talked about the bio defense strategy the one thing was the executive order on pandemic influenza which really talks about relevant to this issue quite frankly how do we basically manage a potential pandemic a flu and again a lot of that is really about speed speed of action which i think is a fundamental issue in this event the virus is moving faster than sometimes we can even think and act and then the second thing is is really about domestic capacities and supplies things like the strategic national stockpile that have to be maintained over time I'll just point out that one of the findings out of the bio defense strategy was we invest about eight billion dollars in this kind of activity each year it sounds like a lot of money but when you consider that an aircraft carrier cost 17 billion dollars and we have 12 of them as a country that gives you some kind of scale of what we invest in one arm of our national defense that we probably want to invest in our national health security all right thank you as you know pharmaceutical companies that that exist maybe that are founded and operate exclusively in this country oftentimes partner with pharmaceutical companies in other parts of the world in order to try to solve Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease MS what kind of collaborations are being encouraged should be encouraged with respect to developing shortening the development time for the vaccines to address this virus well so there are great some examples subbies a group that's kind of international consortium that involves the Wellcome Trust Gates Foundation US government's evolved several European governments are involved to focus on major disease areas coronavirus is one of them quite frankly as well as Marburg virus a hemorrhagic fever and I think those those kinds of initiatives are valuable because they can if you will consolidate small resources and give bigger opportunities and again tap into the wealth of innovative thinking around the world to address some of these hardest problems and also understand that in many of these cases the underdeveloped world is probably the greatest at risk and so to make it affordable and more accessible so those kind of models are very helpful the global health security agenda is another thing that was created in the Obama administration perpetuated in the Trump administration to address how we can build capacity in countries so they can be better positioned to help themselves that was the the success of the Western Congo outbreak of Ebola were small amounts of money helped built the infrastructure as well as the availability of an effective vaccine obviously eastern duh DRC is a different story but those are some of the examples out you sir okay thank you so much senator Hassan

thank you next we go to mr mckinley uh thank you mr chairman and uh i direct my comments to dr renis uh i'm looking for you again on this someplace on here there we go listen i've missed having you testify before us for the last few years i've always enjoyed your your insight into it uh and listen i gotta say uh doc i i agree with you that not having not including carbon capture in this bill does not make sense it really doesn't but since this bill if i could direct my question to you since this bill begins the transition of the federal fleet uh to electric vehicles by 2025 beginning in 2025 and hybrid hybrid fuels uh could be banned by 2050 uh if by if president biden has his way so let's talk a little bit about the federal fleet uh it's about 650 000 vehicles and according to the journal of power sources and testimony we had a few weeks ago uh from mark mills of the manhattan institute to acquire the critical minerals of lithium cobalt nickel graphite copper we will need manufacturers will need to excavate 250 tons of earth 250 tons of earth to get enough materials just for one battery so uh just imagine what that would be over 650 000 vehicles i did some math on that and and so if we don't have if we don't have available biofuels or hydrogen as an alternative and we have to go to electric vehicles we're talking about uh enough uh dump load dump truck filled with dirt across just for the the federal fleet to go around the world a convoy around the world twice just to get the materials we need to build the batteries for our federal fleet uh so i i i'm just wondering about since the other nations are gonna say uh we're not doing this in our backyard we're getting it out of chile and columbia and other nations all around the world how long are they going to tolerate us taking all their raw materials and tearing up their hillsides how long you do you think they'll continue to say that's okay well i'm mr mckinley and it is it's good to see you again indeed uh the uh the the it's a very important issue this question of critical minerals and metals uh and the whole supply chain uh there is no doubt that we need to uh reevaluate this uh i mentioned in my in my remarks uh that uh we have to look at uh environmentally uh improved mining uh in the united states because the uh uh critical uh mineral minerals uh will probably go up by a factor of 10 to 100 in many cases except that innovation will also come in so on lithium for example we are seeing quick questions one to you and one to o'reilly so let's go to the grid for a minute uh that the boston consulting group said that if 15 of the vehicles are electric vehicles by 2030 that we will have to have a 25 increase in our electric generating capacity so if we once if this mission is ultimately to get to 100 of electric vehicles that means we're going to have to have 165 percent more power generated in america than we currently have today i i just i'm wondering are we going to ever going to be ready for something like that so in difference with the time on it so if i could switch over to o'reilly uh on on this in the last could i just know mr mckinley i don't i don't understand those numbers i i don't i don't agree with them but okay we can discuss later from one engineer to a scientist you might be able to keep up you know we'll see right okay let's go to o'reilly for a minute please uh so i i want to switch the jobs impact i understand the refineries because if if what this purpose of this ultimate legislation uh that the the administration is pushing by 2050 to ban all fossil fuel uh emissions and fossil fuels uh what will happen to the jobs in the refinery-driven economies of texas louisiana oklahoma and elsewhere what what will happen to those what will happen to those jobs if we can't use gasoline or diesel fuel o'reilly okay um well i uh i appreciate your question i can speculate and and i would agree with you because i know that's not your field you're an absolutely it's not my fields i suggest what happens yes if we do this what happens they're gonna evaporate they're they're gonna they're actually gonna evaporate the jobs they're not going to exist in critical states that are so important and that's why that's why i want people to just slow down sometimes and think about the consequences of this i know we're ultimately going to get to there but to do this so quickly as we're doing right now i don't know that we've thought about the consequences with it so thank you very much and and frank i i yield back to my chairman balance of whatever time i've got left right

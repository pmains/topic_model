Mr. Speaker, when President Trump calls
your health care legislation mean and cold-hearted, you know that it's time to
reconsider your approach to the nation's health care system. The president was
referring, of course, to the House-passed Trumpcare legislation, which pulls the
rug from under millions of Americans, raising their costs, gutting their
protections, and, for many, taking away their coverage. And while we do not know
the extent of damage the Senate Republicans' secret health bill would
cause, we do know its consequences would be disastrous. We do know, for instance,
that Senate Republicans plan to gut essential health benefits and destroy
the Medicaid expansion. Trumpcare is fundamentally flawed. Higher costs, less
coverage, fewer protections--that is the gift from the Republican Party to the
American people. The bill would also destroy millions of jobs--nearly 14,000
jobs in my state of New Jersey next year alone. Trumpcare is an ugly bill being
advanced through an ugly process. Senate Republicans can hide the details of their bill, but they cannot hide that simple fact from the American people.

Russia spread false news Russia was trying to help from win the presidency but it provides the additional details that make it even more difficult for Putin to deny it the real question is what sanctions are we going to impose on Russia because of what they've done because indict important who will never visit the United States I mean that's just telling 12 people they can't come to Disneyland we've got to do more than that we have sanctioned Russia for what they've done to other countries it's time to sanction Russia for what they've done to us and more importantly to make it plain what will happen if they interfere in the 2018 election well that's really interesting what you're saying so what should we do what should those sanctions look like the president's getting ready to meet with the Russian president on Monday we're told he was briefed about all of this that's what the deputy AG just said in the last hour the president was briefed earlier this week he knew it in its entirety and entirety what would be happening today as well what does the sanction look like against Russia that's you know appropriate commensurate with meddling in a u.s. presidential election I'm most concerned in preventing future meddling I think and when I say meddling look the Russia has put Nick radio that's aboveboard BBC broadcasts as well that's in one category if they want to editorialize openly that's one thing but if they're going to be tampering with vote tabulation if they're going to be stealing files which of course was the very crime committed in Watergate and it again in 2016 then we have to cut rush off from our banking system we've got to draw a line in the sand if they start using criminal activity to interfere with our vote tabulation or to steal files they we can know what we've got to impose on them the kinds of sanctions that we opposed on Iran it will be a bigger deal because Russia is a bigger economy but those those sanctions brought Iran to the to the negotiating table and that's where I would start the Medellin or 2018 election all right so we got a we got a little taste of that but what do we do about protecting our elections moving forward we clearly have not been doing enough Russia is not the only country that would hope to attempt to probably already has we know cyber warfare is a common weapon now among some people around the world like China what can we do that's more to protect ourselves well three things first protect the vote tabulation system by having an auditable paper trail in every precinct across the country Congress has got a fund that the states after to implement second we need to educate people not to believe everything that's on the internet whether it's it could be put there by a phone let me stop you there that that is pie in the sky you know you are never going to educate every American not to believe I didn't say every great recipes off the internet and my relatives are on the study telling me that's not all that goes in that pie I mean that's almost impossible to do what is there something that the federal government can do I mean you're mentioning vote tap systems audible you know paper trail that sort of thing what else and then finally all of the political organizations need to have good cybersecurity and it's it's it tends to in the in the heat of a campaign you tend to be what are we gonna do to in today's press conference sure and a little bit less on how do we make sure that a variety of nefarious actors are not hacking into our computer system you know you mentioned that political organizations I'm kind of what I'm hearing you say we now have come a distance with this latest round of indictment charges perhaps I want to know your point of view on it are we at a place now where we can put these politics and partisan partisan points of view aside and look at this meddling for what it is a problem for our total democracy no matter which party are in it's a problem for our democracy and for the democracies of other countries that we work closely with around the and the we need European cooperation to sanction Russia if it medals in our election or German Germany's election or Britain's election etc and again I want to say if it's free speech if it's an editorial that's one thing but at the other extreme interfering and vote tabulation systems something like that it's something we cannot forgive in the future all right we have just a real quick White House statement on Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Stein's announcement of indictment today one there is no allegation in this indictment that Americans knew that they were corresponding with Russians I've been talking about that this hour we know that there was no allegation in the indictment that any American citizen committed a crime there was no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count were affected any election result today's charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anybody in the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result this is consistent with what we have been saying all along that from the White House quick response from you congressman Sherman there's no proof that it affected tabulation there's definite proof that it affected how some people voted because the Trump campaign made a very big deal about the Podesta emails the DNC emails it was embarrassing to the Democratic Party in a number of ways cost us some votes and we do know that Donald Trump jr. wanted Russian help would through quote dirt on Hillary he just didn't get it so we know that that meeting was an attempt to get illegal help whether there was ever a meeting that was successful in getting illegal help we'll have to see that's why mother's doing his investigation on the flip side of that a DNC perhaps Democrat paid for anti Trump dossier boy we could go back and forth all day but I got to let you go a congressman Sherman during that everybody does opposition research that's a completely different issue more on President Trump speaking out today ahead of his high-stakes meeting with Russian president

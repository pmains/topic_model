need to recognize myself for five and four freshmen that's unusual being recognized so but at first Bishop to you and in mr. desole they as a as a person who has been watching this I want to tell you personally that for myself many people that I know we are praying for you and your citizenry our hearts go out to you as a fellow believer I know the work that the that the church does and I commend you for that and and for being here and I just wanted to first convey that i've also asked that we put up a map of the country it's it's a bit of a unknown for many in in the Western world exactly where it is and where it lies and I was hoping that mr. diesel LA and and dr. C C or say I believe its see correct see if you could maybe talk a little bit about where those conflicts are and then dr. C I'd like you to expand on that a little bit about what the conflict origination is we're hearing from from the bishop that it he believes that it all roads lead to the mines or those roads of violence lead to the mines I believe was sort of the phrase that he was talking about and we can maybe explore a little bit about the differences on that so if you can maybe point out where part of the world were talking about thank you sir congressman for your prayer for the congolese and for this opportunity so we see to the left to the right there above the big lake tanganyika legacies bujumbura and Bukavu and then just above that which says near on gongo that's the area we're talking about which is Lake Albert so just that section that we're talking about and the Mount Stanley area and that area there sir but the challenge is that the conflict in that area is fed by what is not happening in the rest of the country you know I think it's very dangerous I to talk about the Kiva's in isolation this is not an independent sovereign nation this is a collection of three provinces that are paying the price of lack of leadership in kinshasa to the west to the capital so putting a bandaid on the problem in in bukavu is not going to lead us to peace I'm afraid to say so it's my allow for temporary relief of salt but it's just not sustainable thank you thank you thank you we could very quickly because I do want to hear from the bishop as well and then I actually want to get to my real question so quick so I think it's important to understand mineral the militarized mineral trade is a symptom rather than a cause rather than the disease itself so it is definitely something that fuels some of the conflict it's definitely a problem and I don't want to give the impression that it shouldn't be cleaned up I just don't think 1502 is the way to do it but the real issue underlying conflict in this part of the country is land rights and citizenship rights the question of who gets to be Congolese and who has the right to own land in the area you know the North cavalleria that mr. diesel a was describing so some of the most fertile agricultural land in the world it produces three harvests per year and it is hotly contested because it is so valuable and has been and it's really important to note these conflicts have been going on since before the DRC war started and before there was high demand for Congolese minerals but it is not homogeneous the armed groups are different they're not all fighting over minerals they don't depend on minerals to the same extent it's really so this isn't just the LRA that we may be seeing in the media this is there not even local areas yes this is this is local and and you also have significant mining areas where there is no conflict unlike the casaya in Katanga bishop real quickly if you would maybe respond to that a leg Lisa V parte 2.avi claw population the church lives everywhere where the population lives as well as ammo quantity que la plug on the coast the last ability aid origin economic we have come to realize that the largest the most important part of the instability or the economic reasons Larry valatie ethnic son s tremont Eliza por la pioggia systemic versus the ethnic rivalries are manipulated or used as instruments for this conflict paul s avec du congo la regulation internacional e nacional del exploitation progressive mo p regular problem the Church believes that the International and national regulations if it's done gradually over time will solve these problems is emociona click on hooli member 8 on trendy tabla de Lua the regulation Aunt Edna I mentioned in my testimony that the Congolese government is in the process of passing some of these laws le cerca la stability Congo dip on the pleasure factor it is certain that stability in the Congo depends on many factors male exploitation illegal dairy sussudio Jenna factor measure but the illegal exploitation of resources is a major factor SI possa l'Ã©glise de monde ask allah connaught internacional Ron Foster a regular ratio exterior e anterior por contribute a stabilization that's why the church asked the international community and the national leaders in the Congo to regularize these laws and to implement a latency on ultra community on trademe superficial la instrumental is a poly problem economic the tension the ethnic tensions that exist are manipulated or instruments of this conflict and are fueled by the the minerals in the mind I appreciate that testimony and mr. Lamar I wanted to briefly get to you and I don't know that I really have the time my time has expired but I am concerned I guess to the panel I my concern is whether it's out of the apparel and manufacturing whether it's out of tier 1 automotive suppliers that are in the 2nd District of Michigan that who are dealing with requirements in NAFTA that that for them to go through a Tier one and we see it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to that to that process they're looking at it being millions of dollars if they're having to go down five tiers and there and I think the crux of the question is will this solve the conflict in in the DRC will this solve the issues that we're dealing with in that northeastern corner of a very conflicted world obviously Rwanda in other areas that are in that area of seen violence for so long and I I hope that you understand that that's what the intent of for me personally and I believe the rest of this panel is to look at how we are making sure that the problem is really truly solved and is not a venir I think as mr. D's o Laila had talked about so with that my time has expired appreciate that with with that the mature recognizes mr. Scott 45 minutes thank you as I mentioned in my opening

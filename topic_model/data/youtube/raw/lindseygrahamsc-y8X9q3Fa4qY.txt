and senator lindsey graham says when you hear more from the state department whistleblowers this week it's going to make you mad senator graham joins us nice to see you sir it's going to make you mad all right before we get to the question the state department whistleblowers testifying on wednesday we have information that people from the cia want to come out and testify but they've been told by the cia director brennan specifically they will be polygraphed if they are tied to this do you have any information to corroborate i've heard that same story i know there's some cia agents reaching out they feel frustrated the cia generally got this right and they feel frustrated about what happened that night before and after so we'll see where this goes are these ci agents who are on the ground in benghazi that night or these cia agents people see out here in washington yes my belief that at least one of them was on the ground but time will tell all right now damn's about to break on benghazi you wrote a letter may 6 to the state department i mean march 15 of the state department today you're finally getting one back and it's from the thomas gibbons acting assistant secretary of legislative affairs and he says among other things that that he says the department appreciates your interest in talking to the five state department diplomatic security agents who survived the attack at the same time we have serious concerns about the welfare want to be careful not to interfere with the fbi's investigation of the attack they go on to say should their identities become public they may become targets put in their lives as well as those of their families and the people they protect at increased risk your response sir completely unacceptable the five people who were diplomatic security have never been talked to by the congress it's our job to oversee and provide oversight to to the executive branch and look what's happened thank god for the house jason chavitz and daryl isa pushing this thing so no we want the survivors to come forward and we'll protect their identity we want to know what happened did you have did the arb talk to these people do you know i have no idea all i know is that what we're knowing what we're finding out is that the story told by the state department susan rice the president himself was so completely wrong and false there's a reason why did susan rice and the president push this narrative that it was a spontaneous event caused by hateful video because if the truth had come out seven weeks before an election this was an al qaeda inspired pre-planned attack it would undercut the narrative politically that bin laden's dead were all safer political manipulation is rampant here it is no accident that the story told by the washington folks including the president was beneficial to the president and disconnected from the reality because we can't talk to anybody who actually lived through it now you got a guy coming forward called greg hicks now you're the first one who spoke to greyhounds you spoke to him in march what did he what was he like we talked to you like why hadn't he come one he's a professional diplomat doesn't want to get involved in politics but he's a man of conscience he knows what happened that night he's the last guy to talk to chris stevens he knows it was a terrorist attack from day one and what baffles everybody that lived through this is how washington could tell a story about what they lived through so different than what actually happened on the ground and there is no other uh explanation other than the people in washington telling the story had political motivations because the people on the ground are telling us what they live through is completely different than what the president told the people right great great great hicks who is number two right below the ambassador in in number two why did why did he wait until march to come forward people well the same reason that everybody feels chilled i've been asking for survivors to come forward people who were involved not just survivors and every agency in the government of stonewalling these guys are whistleblowers they came forward out of conscience greg hicks knew that chris stevens was being thrown under the bus chris should have never been there that's the new narrative well they knew he was in benghazi so the people who knew chris stevens who lived through this attack believe that what they went through has been misrepresented all right well there's a there's a note from the state department one of my notes saying that that gregory hicks has an axe to grind against the state department that's why he's doing this now well i think greg hicks is going to tell a story consistent with what we now know to be the truth and the only axe to grind i think anybody has here including me is that you can't let your government lie to you you got four dead americans and the story told by the highest levels of our government about how they died was a bunch of garbage all right well we're actually going to go to this hearing on wednesday i hope so we're going to go to and see and watch it and monitor it as well and there's more coming and i understand that thank you sir nice to see you senator thank you

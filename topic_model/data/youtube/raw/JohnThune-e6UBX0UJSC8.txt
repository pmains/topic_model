Madam president um it's hard to believe that my friend Richard Burr is leaving Congress he's someone I've known since my days in the House of Representatives and we've been friends from the very beginning and so it's difficult to imagine serving in the Senate here without him we came to the senate in the same year as well our wives are very close friends and we've had many wonderful times with the birds in fact I've enjoyed hosting Richard in South Dakota on a number of occasions Richard is an outdoors guy as I am and he fits right in in my home state of South Dakota perhaps except for the fact that he's the only guy not wearing socks although I will say Madam president I have found occasions which have required him to get the socks out of his suitcase during one of our trips to South Dakota to hunt pheasants we landed in Sioux Falls we got off the plane it was seven degrees and I noticed at the next stop he had socks on so there are there are limitations to uh to his uh practice of not wearing socks but anyway one of our favorite pastimes of course in South Dakota is pheasant hunting and I've had Richard out there a number of times during pheasant season he is a great shot I will say he has a favorite place to eat it's Al's Oasis in Chamberlain South Dakota which is known for among many things homemade pies and of course I've discovered when Kimberly and I visited Richard and Brook in North Carolina he's also a great handyman now apparently he thinks his guests should be as well since he put me right to work on a new door that he was installing we hung a door at his house I was the grunt labor he was the architect the designer and just said you know hold this you know that sort of thing so that was my job but I was well paid for my trouble because Richard also in addition to his uh his assets and his attributes as being a handyman is also an excellent cook many of you probably perhaps here don't know that but one of the Privileges that I've enjoyed in visiting Richard is getting to enjoy his cooking and he really can make just about anything breakfast lunch dinner I'm not saying he ought to open a restaurant in his retirement but if he did I would certainly be the first in line at the opening Richard has certainly left his mark on Washington his car a 1974 Volkswagen Thing often parked outside the Russell building with the top down no matter the season and adorned with his colleagues campaign stickers I think everybody knows was a fixture here on Capitol Hill and Richard who as well as being a handyman is a capable mechanic could often be found working under the thing's Hood to keep it running which has become a true labor of love particularly here in the last few years but I would say Madam president in this chamber of course Richard is best known and really known for being an outstanding legislator and I have to say thank you as he did to his outstanding staff I mean there isn't anybody here who works here who knows that the heavy lifting in this place gets done by staff and so we appreciate your many years of service to him and making him such an effective and accomplished legislator and and he mentioned the the capital staff the Capitol Police who are here on a daily basis protecting us just say how much we appreciate everything that you have done but Richard has always been someone who knows how to get things done in in addition to building a great team and staff around him he knows how to build coalitions he knows how to get legislation across the finish line and that's evident in his record of accomplishment here in the Senate he talked a little bit about that but promoting medical research and Innovation it's been a passion of his supporting veterans changing the way student loan interest rates are set to save families money working to ensure that child care settings are safe and high quality establishing able accounts for individuals with disabilities to help better their lives and the list goes on long before covet Richard was working to prepare our nation to respond to the threat of a disaster or a pandemic and since covid he's worked to ensure that our nation's future pandemic response reflects the lessons that we have learned and of course as he mentioned uh his longtime work on the intelligence committees in both the House and Senate is Chairman here of the Senate intelligence committee the number of hours I know he sat in padded rooms in classified settings making sure that our country was prepared working with our intelligence Community as he mentioned to protect Americans from the threats that we Face here at home and around the world Richard's been a strong advocate for his home state of North Carolina particularly for veterans he's worked to bring new VA facilities in North Carolina to ensure that veterans and their families who are exposed to contaminate water at Camp Lejeune receive VA Medical Care I think all of us get into this life and the hope that we can one day leave Congress knowing that we've done something to make life better for our fellow Americans Richard can leave Congress with that assurance and Madam president I'm going to miss him it's a privilege and a blessing when you're able to serve with a friend for so long I'll miss our daily interactions but I know that in Congress or not our friendship will endure and I look forward to seeing all that Richard's going to do in his next chapter in life I want to thank as he said Brooke his sons and daughters-in-law and now grandkids for the many sacrifices that they've made through the years I think we all know that this doesn't work unless you've got a partner and Brooke has been a partner for all these 28 years to Richard and a part of everything that he's been able to accomplish here and so I wish him and his family many more happy hours in the years ahead and congratulate him on his retirement and on a farewell speech that I think we all ought to take to heart Madam president of the floor

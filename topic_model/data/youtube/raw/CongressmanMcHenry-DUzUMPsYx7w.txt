the gentleman from North Carolina mr. McHenry vice chairman of the committee chair Yellen I thank you so much for being here today and you know I support the Federal Reserve's function as an independent policy maker when it comes to our monetary policy I think in federal reserve for the purposes of monetary policy is very important you're also regulator and so and as I've asked you before that's really what I'm interested in what you do in terms of regulation and and so let me just ask do you think it's appropriate for Congress have oversight of the Federal Reserve's rulemaking and regulatory policies of course okay that's good so do you think Congress should have oversight over the pho reserves regulatory discussions with international bodies as well Congress has assigned the various regulatory agencies responsibilities and and I'm asking you about we have and I believe should have discussions with our international colleagues i'll get to that question i certainly understand that because Congress has given you this authority and give you the directive should Congress not also have oversight over that authority in which we've given you Congress of course has oversight over our kinds of you agree both domestically and internationally we should have oversight over those rulemaking activities okay so in accordance with that I sent you a letter from a couple of weeks ago and thank you for the reply I don't actually like the contents of it but thank you for replying in a timely fashion before this hearing and so I asked for your assurance that about your participation in these international agreements for you to pause until the new administration who has a markedly different approach to these standards has actually got their appointees in before you finalize any in the discussions are nationally in Congress you know that nothing is a rule that is effective in the United States until regulatory agencies have gone through a normal rulemaking process and nothing in these international discussions binds the US regulatory agencies including the Fed to carry out agreements in our own rulemakings in the United States I certainly remember in important cases indicated that we don't agree with the outcomes of international discussions and have no intention of putting in place and in other cases we can't even surmise whether or not your representative from the Fed is voted in the affirmative or in the negative on these agreements that we are then as your agency comes back and forth upon us in an international agreement there's not been apparently voted on because we can surmise if you voted yes or no and so there's there's a lot a great deal of opacity with that and what we want is transparency and this and transparency has been severely lacking so my question is very simple when it comes to the Basel for package do you intend to wait to see if the new administration has an opinion on these matters before you would make some agreement on the basil for package these are all ongoing discussions in which US regulators participate and as I said nothing is effective in the United States unless we go through a rulemaking process here okay if its ultimate I'll summarize that it's probably not that you'll probably not wait for the new administration to put regulators in place even if those new regulators are in place and move to counteract exactly what you have achieved with it an international agreement so yesterday before the Senate Banking Committee you seem to endorse the core principles of president Trump's financial regulation executive order and so what steps are you taking to comply with the executive order directive to advance America's interest in international forums specifically it was it relates to international standards like the net stable funding ratio and international insurance regulation in the case of the International Insurance Regulation we have indicated that the capital standard that was proposed as not one that we think is suitable to be put in place in the United States and I think that's a good example of the fact that matters that are discussed and maybe agreed on by others are not effective in the United States unless we've gone through a full rulemaking process with opportunity for comment and response time the gentleman has expired that

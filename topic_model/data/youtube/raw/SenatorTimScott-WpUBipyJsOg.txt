with us right now at south carolina sits on the senate finance committee uh tim scott uh senator great to see you i'm sorry to uh let this be the pain to which we go to you sir but you know you have been warning in fact before many others about government spending and how that was setting in motion some of the inflation we see now as you know the white house said that a lot of it was propelled out of control by the the war etc in ukraine uh but it's clearly inflation now that's ruling the roost and fears that we're not only behind the curve but it's going to get worse it's going to put a crimp on the economy it clearly might already be happening what do you think well neil there's no doubt that if we look at what precipitated the russian invasion was high inflation we saw gas prices up about 67 percent we saw inflation around seven to eight percent we saw a 40-year high in inflation before the russian genocide so the truth is that the president biden's policies economic policies have led to the worst inflationary effects in our economy in 40 years that means that the average person in our country is experiencing an invisible tax that is eroding their spending power that means our seniors who are on fixed income have to find a way to ration either their health care their medicine their energy or food it means that people who are growing up in households like the one i grew up in they're now having to make harder decisions than they've ever had to make that's wrong biden pouring so much money into our economy has caused our economy to explode in a negative way all right now you might not be surprised that the white house has a slightly different view of that uh and it has fingered you know other factors here that today for example a lot of people saying maybe part of this is the federal reserve's fault that it's it's moved to aggressively raise interest rates comes too little too late others say just the opposite that now some of these stark measures it appears to be taking the lift interest rates it's going to slow the economy down and it won't address the underlying inflation we got a hint of that that your labor costs are running at an eight percent clip right now so uh whatever people are making they're paying out and it's like a double whammy do you see anything changing that i i don't know the problem is that this government has acted too slow too often they created the inflation now they want to have credit for solving the problem when in fact the problem may actually exacerbate the situation when your rates start going up your economic activity starts going down and that makes you get a little closer to a recession the truth is that while the inflationary effects cannot be stopped right now the increase in the interest rates will slow it down but i don't think it's going to stop it because it's too little too late the fed does not have enough tools in the tool kit for the economy that we have today especially since as you know neil our unemployment rates are already significantly lower than is normal in this kind of environment our labor force participation rate is not actually increasing that combination is very concerning and so the interest rates will make it harder for people to buy homes but for our seniors on fixed incomes they'll see a bit of a bump in their in their in their resources that they have you know center it's interesting but this does appear to be a worldwide problem in britain of course they just raised rates for the fourth time since just december i think they're in and out of 13 14 year highs on on interest rates of turkeys running a 70 inflation rate argentina 75 percent brazil fifty percent uh europe collectively now in excess of eleven percent are we back in the seventies here well i i tell you what i i think we are i mean literally this feels like the carter eras when you think about the explosive price and gas when you think about what it costs to heat or cool your home if you're in south carolina it is drastic but more importantly when you look at the global effect you you remember the days uh neil when venezuela was at a 900 inflationary effect because of the crushing decisions senator why would you assume that old actually i do remember it verbatim that was only two or three years ago so the so the truth is that we the whole globe responds to the type of economic decisions that we make here at home that's why our global leadership economically matters so much we should be forcing decisions here at home like why not restart our own energy economy creating six figure jobs here at home why not continue the conversation around the keystone xl pipeline why not have the ppe coming back home why not use opportunity zones to attract insourcing back into america let's say reading the tea leaves here that doesn't seem likely under this administration you could argue right now they're really hanging their hats on maybe more spending they've talked about you know college loan forgiveness and all of that i i just wonder is there cure it's far from what your cure would be it doesn't sound like anything will happen legislatively uh if even that's an option here and everything is hanging on the federal reserve does that worry it it does work me because as we know the the the federal reserve can only increase interest rates that's really their they could slow of course the the their their start of the process of unwinding their balance sheet and reducing their balance sheet that will have impact too so they could slow that and increase interest rates but the truth of the matter is our economy needs smart reasonable leadership at the top we're not getting that right now they they have fundamentally misunderstood the american economy pouring two trillion dollars in the first 60 days of the administration then a 1.2 trillion dollar plan and then they talked about trillions of more dollars the buildback broker plan as i like to call it so what we're talking about is democrats who believe that more money from the government is a solution to an already hot economy that is antithetical to reality he also of course president biden said he wants to reduce costs for companies by raising wages in other words he doesn't understand the private sector so we need to make sure that we focus on solutions not things that only exacerbates the situation you know senator well i have you uh we're learning of a spike in copenhagen certainly abroad and in china where they're trying to get us under control they're off their worst levels but they're they're still you know jumping just not as high as they had been uh and in new york city they've raised the covet risk level amid a surge in the new york metropolitan area with an increase in hospitalizations possibly not deaths the only reason why i raise it with you sir is this notion that um maybe we're not out of the coveted woods and this is partly weighing on some of the the selling and adding to the uncertainty what do you think of that well there's no doubt when you look at the supply chain coming from china it's going to have an impact on that supply chain when people can't go to work because they're on a strong coveted lockdown but cova's going to be an is endemic within our community at this point not an epidemic as i see it so what we need to do is continue to make the adjustments that we're seeing around the country the good news is at home in south carolina our unemployment rate is 3.4 percent uh statewide we have 2.9 in greenville and columbia 3.1 in charleston or those numbers may be around those numbers so the good news is we're proving that we can handle the covet challenges in a right to work environment i'd recommend that we export south carolina values and the dignity and work throughout the rest of the country especially places like new york and california so i think we have solutions to the problems that we're seeing around those blue states

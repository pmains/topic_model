is give you a little background on the Commission what our fundamental findings were and then talk about our strategy of labor of Laird cyber deterrence first the Commission it was set up by the 2019 National Defense Act and the mission of the Commission was to establish an overall strategic direction for American policy in cyberspace that's number one and number two to make recommendations for implementing that strategy the Commission had 14 members four from the Congress four from the executive and six from the private sector it was entirely nonpartisan there were really no partisan discussions whatsoever and apart from the four members of Congress I have no idea of the partisan affiliations of any of the other members of the Commission we had 29 in-person meetings we interviewed over 400 people we went through thousands of pages of documents ended up with 81 recommendations 57 of which require legislative action which have been submitted to the various committees and the staffs in the Senate and the house so what are the fundamental findings the the real basis of the Commission rests upon the three issues one is reorganization get the structure right and the chair talked about this at the beginning the second is resilience how do we build cyber defenses to keep ourselves safe from attack and the third is response how do we respond to attacks in such a way as to defend our country now the the fundamental strategy if you will is called layered cyber defense layered cyber deterrence and here are the layers number one is shaped behaviors that is established norms and standards in the international community so that this isn't a unilateral one country kind of effort the second is to deny benefits and that is to strengthen our cyber defense and that's as part of this as reorganization our this is strengthening Sousa and other agencies that will we'll talk about later this morning but to basically be more resilient and that includes plans for the recovery of the economy in the case of a cyberattack the third is the strategy of deterrence we have been attacked over and over over the last 10 or 15 years and our our adversaries have paid very little price we need to establish a clear declaratory policy that if you attack the United States in cyberspace you will be able you will have to pay a cost and that's really the fundamental idea of deterrence and it we've got to be clear about it and we've got to have our adversaries make a calculation that attacking us is going to cost them I want to change their calculus when they're making that decision and that's what the fundamental strategy is that we're going to be presenting to you today thank you very much for holding this hearing look forward to answering your questions

good morning this is justine wentreck with kwoa i'm talking today with republican candidate jim hagenorn for the first congressional district uh what brings you to town today well thanks for the opportunity justine we're in to see some republican leaders and of course this weekend on saturday at 1 30 in adrian we've got the uh the county convention here for nobles county so we're excited to uh you know we're running the race hard and we're excited to be here can you tell us a little bit about what happens at the county convention well the county convention is made up of gop activists and their delegates and alternates and they will decide at that convention who gets elected to the district convention and the state convention it's at the district convention in albert lee on april 5th that my fate as the republican nominee will be uh will be decided well that sounds scary having your fate decided well it's all it's an exciting process and you know i love talking to the to the people the grassroots of the republican party because i truly believe that if we're going to take back our country it's got to start at the grassroots we see what's going on in washington dc the type of leadership that both parties are getting and we need a new course well i know that you we we've talked before and you have some special thoughts about some of the things going on in some of the rural areas well the rural areas of the first district are are critical especially for trying to defeat tim walls who's the most liberal congressman in the history of southern minnesota and agriculture is the backbone of our economy uh farmers interests interest of the ag groups is very critical to the people here in the rural areas and you know look look at the rural communities and everyone here dependent on agriculture from businesses to you know other shopkeepers and so forth and so we not only talk about the issues and and delve into them with the with the various farmers and that groups but we've been out here campaigning extensively in the rural areas so far in this in this campaign as you've been talking to the people in the rural areas what are some of their biggest concerns oh the biggest concerns i hear from farmers over and again are regulations coming out of washington dc mostly regulations out of obama's out-of-control epa and these regulations are hampering farmers ability to do their jobs to get out there and just do their farming they have to ask too much permission now from government they're being restricted their costs are being driven up and consumer costs are going up because of this and you look at regulations across the board and what they're doing to hamper business and farming and drive up people's costs in in just one look at look at energy and the regulations coming out of epa to basically bankrupt the coal industry of this country that's going to make everyone pay higher electricity rates and in turn take less more money out of their disposable income and people are having a hard time getting ahead because of it any thoughts on the propane situation well i think there again we have regulations out of washington and even at the state level hampering the ability of private the private sector from building the pipelines refineries and distribution points necessary to make sure that we efficiently use all the american energy resources that we have we are a hundred percent self-sufficient approach propane in the united states and yet we have these bottlenecks and these distribution these spot shortages it's mostly caused by government standing in the way of the private sector being able to do its job i know you and i have talked before but maybe we should remind you remind the listeners real quick can you tell us a little bit about your background and why you decided to get involved with this well i've been a part of national politics for some time going dating back to when uh i was a supporter of ronald reagan's at the age of 12. but born in blue earth minnesota raised on a grain and livestock farm just outside of truman minnesota my father grandfather great grandfather all minnesota farmers my father was a congressman for some time from 1974 to 1982 in the old second district and i worked for a minnesota congressman named stanglen he was a good good hog farmer from the northwest part of the state when i was in washington working for him we did important things like work for welfare which i think is critically important to reforming our welfare system second amendment rights which we always have to protect to make sure that we have the ultimate protection against even our own government and then things like right to life and broad-based tax reform after that i served a stint as an executive within the united states treasury department and i identified inefficiency within my agency received permission to take a bill to the congress moved it through the congress which cut my own agency we closed government check writing centers eliminated bureaucrat jobs and my ideas save the taxpayers over a billion and a half dollars so that's the type of mentality and and fight that i take to this job and that's why i want to go to congress to help the people why now uh it's critically important that we take back our country at this time if obamacare is allowed to be the fabric of medicine if cap and trade that's coming out of the epa is allowed to be our energy policy if dodd-frank is allowed to be our financial policy in this country and on it goes with all the spending programs if we don't do something in the next few years we're going to lose the united states as the forefathers put it together i tell people this isn't an election about the direction of the country this is an election about the survival of the united states as the forefathers intended and so i think they need someone like myself who can make an immediate impact in the house republican caucus someone with some experience but i've also demonstrated the ability to be in washington maneuver in that system defeat the left support conservative and and make conservative reform and also still be a good minnesotan and a good and a good person again we're talking to jim hagenorn who is one of the candidates for the first congressional district anything else that you wanted to be sure to bring up today well just you know congressman walls has voted for all these big government programs and the people are have gotten to a point where their government is so powerful that they're afraid of the freight of the government and we're not going to be able to for instance repeal and replace obamacare until we reject and replace the people that voted for it in this case congressman walls so there's a very striking contrast between the liberal congressman who's for expanding government and a conservative challenger who has a record of of fighting the government and making the bureaucracy smaller so we're we're just excited to continue to take this contrast to the people and and to get to know the people as best as possible as we do it okay this event that's coming up on saturday is that something that's open to the public well guests and visitors can come by and observe uh it's it's uh you know we're excited about what's going on in the republican party and about the grassroots efforts to take back our country and i'm just looking forward to seeing the delegates and alternates and to try to give them a stem winder of a speech there on saturday all right well thanks for your time today jim we sure appreciate it and we'll uh keep keep up with you as the election gets closer thank you justine

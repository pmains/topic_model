suffering from a major head cold so I may have a little easy on you today then it's good i don't wish it gold on you but i'll take the benefit last december we passed a visa waiver program bill out of my committee marked up it passed overwhelmingly it was designed to keep foreign fighters from exploiting the visa waiver program from certain countries like Iraq Syria Sudan and Iran and in the negotiations and I was in the middle those I was one of the national security chairman involved with the correspondence back and forth between homeland State Department and the White House we carved out two exceptions when I was national security and the other one was law enforcement in the exchange between the Department of Homeland Security they mentioned when we consider humanitarian business purposes cultural journalistic I was in the room with the majority leader those exceptions were rejected DHS came back again and the final email from the White House was it the administration supports this legislation my thanks to all and then finally the White House says I spoke to State Department they did not request any additional edits the administration does not request any changes at this time we're good with the text is drafted reopening the bill requires to look at it again yet the day after it passed you read a letter to the Iranian Foreign Minister stating that parts of this law could be waived to accommodate Iranian business interest in my judgment having played a part in that negotiation it was in direct contradiction with the intent and the clear definition of the statute and the law it seems to me you're putting the interest business interests of Iran over the security interest of the United States and quite frankly either misconstruing or rewriting the very law that we passed overwhelmingly by the Congress I want to give you the opportunity to respond to them no I really appreciate it Congress will call thank you very much and I appreciate the work we've done to try to work through this look we respect obviously the congressional intent we respect the purpose of this we all share that goal we have to protect the country we have to have adequate control over who's coming into the country and we learned obviously in the course of the cavies a situation that there's more that could be done conceivably to be able to analyze and dig into background but the bottom line is this the letter that I wrote to the Iranian Foreign Minister was not an excuse for anything it simply said that they were arguing that we had violated JC poet and I let us say no it does not violate JC Toa the explained and defended the law and it made clear to them that we were going to keep our JC poet commitments now the what we're doing is actually following the letter of the law but you have to I please would like you to understand that our friends our allies French Germans British others are deeply concerned about the impact of this law inadvertent on their citizens they have dual nationals and if one of and one of those dual nationals just travels to Iran all of a sudden and they are in a visa waiver program and they're a very legitimate business person all of a sudden that person's ability figures is might I mean look I wrote the let me let me just fine i'm the author of the bill I understand the intent of the law we had conversations with the White House you try to get this business exemption written into the law that was rejected by the leadership and the Congress and the time to have changed that was prior to the present signing it into law but once you sign the President signed in the law you can't just go back and change either violate or rewrite it I know the law i mounted up out of my committee and you're talking to the author of the bill yeah that was not the intent of Congress to carve out a business exemption and I understand I ever now and not confront the whole new Iranians and all this stuff but that was not the intent of the Congress mr. German we're not we're not carving out a wholesale waiver intent it's a case-by-case basis very carefully and narrowly tailored number one number two the text of the law is clear the Secretary of Homeland Security waived the travel can waive the travel or dual nationality restrictions if that if he deems that it is in the law enforcement or national security interest the country do so now we believe the full and fair implementation of law is in fact in our national security interest we have a very thorough systematic HSS my time I guess it depends on how you define national security interest i will commend that jay johnson call me Ted Libya Somalia and Yemen to this list and i am and i concurred in that and i and i commend that decision i'm sure you're going to construe the law in your interpretation i do think adding those three countries was a positive step just one last question on the designation of Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern do you have are we going to keep that designation or is there any attempt by you to lift that designation we've had no no such determination I haven't contemplated it do you intend to consider additional measures to provide economic relief to Iran to lift any other designations none at this point done that I know okay yeah I appreciate that um chair now recognizes brad Sherman California

so this is police week and I want to thank all of our law enforcement for the job you do every day you put your lives on the line to make us safe and we appreciate it very much you don't get folks off the street that shouldn't be there you respond to we have an accident or any kind of health issue our law enforcement is there they're there within minutes of being called and I just can't thank you enough I also want to thank the families of our law enforcement you make it possible for our policemen and sheriff's troopers to go out every day and they have a loving home to come back to and I know it's a 30 or an Air Force guy it takes a family to make this happen so my thanks to you too [Music] [Music] [Music]

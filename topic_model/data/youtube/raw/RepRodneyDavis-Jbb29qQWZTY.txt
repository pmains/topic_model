madam Speaker I rise today to honor the life of my friend Brian Kelly who passed away on Tuesday January 21st and 1:21 a.m. after a long and courageous battle with brain cancer hi first met Brian when we were congressional staffers together in central Illinois he was infectious to be around with his positive attitude and his perpetual optimism to always help others we bonded over our mutual friends and experiences in his hometown of Vandalia Illinois Brian was the epitome of what a public servant should strive to be putting everyone else above himself even during his fight against this deadly disease after diagnosis when I would see him the smile and accompanying laughs made us sometimes forget the pain that he and his wife Megan were experiencing when none of us were around Brian no more need to fight my friend but knowing that does not make it any easier on your loved ones who lost you too soon my heartfelt prayers go out to his lovely wife Megan and the entire Kelly family and all those who were lucky like me to know such a kind soul

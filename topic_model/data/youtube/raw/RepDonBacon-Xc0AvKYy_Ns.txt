stem is so vitally important in our middle schools and our high schools because our country needs more stem graduates and as part of that we started the congressional app challenge quite a few years ago and our district has been competing each and every year and it's that time again so i want to encourage all of you that are in middle school or high school if you know of a good program that you could develop that may help with homework that may help with tracking athletics tracking what's in your refrigerator we saw that one of our winners had that in a previous year if you have a great idea we ask you to design a software plan or for your tablet or for a phone and compete and we would like to love to see it and we'd love to identify all of those who've done so well with this so if you want more information contact our office or our website and i would love to have you involved thank you you

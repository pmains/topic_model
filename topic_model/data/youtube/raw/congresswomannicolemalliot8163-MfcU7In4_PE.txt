[Music] mike [Music] [Music] i want to thank all these amazing veterans for coming out today and it's sad in many ways that on this cold and frigid day our veterans have to come out just to preserve their health care the potential risk of their hospital closing a staten islands clinic being tied to new jersey another state it's unacceptable and i'm sorry that you all have to be here today but we really do need your help we really do need to make sure that our president that our secretary of veteran affairs hear us and that they understand that under no circumstances can they close our brooklyn va hospital right [Applause] and i would love if one or two veterans actually do want to talk about what the va specifically means to them and why it's so important how it's different than another hospital that they're trying to just tie you to but some of the stats are really clear 26 of our veterans return with some sort of service-related disability and now when you look at those younger veterans post-911 those who served in iraq and afghanistan that number goes to 40 there is going to be a new wave of veterans that are going to be in need of the services that the brooklyn va has provided for decades and we also know it was just a study released uh last month that those veterans that go by emergency have an emergency and are taken by ambulance to the va that they are 20 more likely to survive than those taken to non-va hospitals it's a specialized treatment it's a specialized services that our veterans rely on that they depend on that they need and quite frankly they deserve so just to lay out what is going on here um last week i got a call from the va and they wanted to give us a heads up that this monday tomorrow the secretary of the va will be announcing recommendations as a result of a law that passed in 2018 that required the va to conduct market research now this study was done but the va obviously has control the secretary has control over what the recommendations will be and so they're agreeing with recommendations and they've decided to uh propose that hospitals across the network and there's only a few a handful uh but but two of them are right here in new york city manhattan va hospital and the brooklyn va which all of you use staten island would then even though they'll see a increase in mental health services which is i think a good thing and is needed they would be tied unfortunately to orange new jersey va facility which is obviously unacceptable for so many for so many reasons number one why should we be connected to an entirely different state number two um you know right now you have the benefit of a resident discount to get you to brooklyn where the toll to go to new jersey would be more than three top would be three times as much and that's only if you have a car many veterans can't drive they don't drive they may have disabilities that prevent them from driving and so there's no public transportation either that reasonably connects us with orange new jersey so for those reasons we're saying today that this proposal to close the brooklyn va hospital is dead on arrival and i hope that the president has the same response tomorrow [Applause] now i want to give all my colleagues the benefit of the doubt here because i do believe and it it should still remain the case that supporting our veterans is a bipartisan issue ensuring that our veterans get the care that they deserve should not be something that is politicized and i hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle from across the city of new york will come out and also steadfast be steadfast and strong against this proposal and president biden said it just the other day during our state of the union he said the veterans are our backbone that they're our spine he then he he then went he then even and he talked about burn pits by the way that we need to expand disability benefits and medical coverage for our younger veterans affected by the toxins from burn pits and i'm proud to have just voted last week on legislation that would expand that coverage for our veterans but they need a hospital to go to to receive that specialized treatment and care and that is why this facility is so important then in fort worth texas the president said that fully supporting veterans um fully supporting veterans and caring for them and expanding access to health care is a goal of his administration well that's true and that is the case then this proposal should be dead on arrival when it gets to the president of the united states and we expect no less than that yeah [Applause] i want to uh give my colleague borough president vito casella who also served in congress has also been a a steadfast supporter of our veterans i think he actually brought this clinic to staten island for the veterans when he served thank you very much uh nicole thank you all for coming out today and probably a very very important matter we all know it you know i just as nicole was speaking and see the flag from flying and the pow mia flag i learned a long time ago that if you like your freedom you got to thank a veteran so thank you all the veterans for giving us and my family the freedoms that uh are so sharing we cherish and they're fragile as we see around the world right now how fragile freedom can be so thank you all for your service to our country and to all those who wanted freedom and liberty over the last couple of hundred years the american veteran stood up and stood tall and served and sacrificed so thank you all i know it's cold and i won't keep you all here but as nicole mentioned many years ago and a lot of friendly faces were there with us about 15 18 years ago this same movie was playing out if you recall they wanted to close the brooklyn va i happened to be in congress at the time and we brought the secretary of the va to visit the chairman of the va committee many of you walked me through the hospital halls and we demonstrated then that it's insane to close the brooklyn va it was insane then and it's insane now so we got ahead of it like we're doing today to send the signal that we will do everything possible to keep the brooklyn va open and it should not close its doors so that's number one and around that time we said that the staten island veterans were really shortchanged and they had to go and many were older at the time couldn't get to the brooklyn va wouldn't it be nice and better and right for the veterans of staten island to open up a clinic here and that's what we did the some of you were there that day we had the secretary of the va anthony principe principe was here opening the doors now they're talking about moving and forcing some of you to go to jersey the bottom line is this folks uh we have to stand up and fight nicole is going to be our voice in congress it's really incumbent upon everybody in the city in the state of new york to stand with the veterans of staten island and say we don't want this thing closed that's the message and we need not just our federal legislatures in congress in the senate the administration has to hear our voice loud and clear this is the right thing to do do not turn your back on staten island veterans we won't allow it to happen and we're going to come out swinging and fighting thank you all very much for coming out and just as a matter of facts here 44 000 veterans unique visits unique visits to that va hospital 138 000 veterans across our city and i've been there a few times just in this last year and whenever i was there i met veterans from all over the city of new york it wasn't just brooklyn veterans or staten island veterans we're veterans from all five boroughs who here uses the va hospital in brooklyn raise your hand if you've been there and you received your care there exactly exactly what we're talking about and i want one of those veterans to please uh come and say a few words we have lee covino here who has been really at the forefront on this issue if they ever put a gun back in my hands i'm not sure who the enemy is at this point but uh everything she said is right there's only three hospitals in the whole country in this report coming out that are proposed to be closed two of them here one's up by boston it's outrageous it's outrageous and it's gonna hurt i hope they can't do it and i know but everybody feeling like i do they won't do it but we gotta stay sharp and when those public hearings come up i don't care if you write with a crayon on a piece of paper you need to testify at the public hearings when they're announced thank you thank i had an you uh several years ago one o'clock in the morning well actually it happened two o'clock in the afternoon nine o'clock in the morning in atlantic city i swallowed a pill in the pill pipes all right didn't realize it bottom line is where did i end up with at one o'clock in the morning the va in brooklyn they brought in a gastroenterologist to extract that and the care that i received thereafter was phenomenal just as here we have to get out we have to get all the veterans out and we have to make it clear that this cannot be a partisan thing this is bipartisan we have to get all the iraqi vets all right afghanistan veterans we got to get them out and we got to send letters and we got to be behind these folks because this is our link to getting this thing straightened out and when a representative [Applause] i would like to say first of all i was proud to be in the nurse corps and when i came back from vietnam the one and only place i wanted to work was with the vietnam veterans and all our other veterans at the brooklyn va my proudest time as a nurse was caring for our veterans now i have used my husband have we've used our cboc we come here the staff is phenomenal phenomenal i mean i work with a lot of doctors over the years these people are top notch the brook le va we use that a lot and i don't think people realize when you walk into a va facility there is a camaraderie and a love between all of us that nobody can understand i pray i pray that we can keep these facilities open because we really really need them thank you we have one more veteran um who would like to say something from uh hi everybody my name is steve brown i was just recently diagnosed with the asian orange and uh the va covers all my medicine 100 there's a special medicine called revlimid it cost me 17 000 out of my pocket before i realized i could come to the va they cover that for me my medicine i need laid braces and special shoes the va covered everything 100 i'm so thankful for the va in brooklyn and the clinic over here which i come to thank you i want to thank the veterans who personalize their experiences and share that with all of us because it is so important you know i as a representative vito as the borough president we're out there fighting but it's really your stories that are going to make the difference the fact that you are receiving quality care that you deserve that you need and we have to make sure that all these stories are heard and i would like to actually collect more of them if you didn't speak today you want to share your story with the president with the va secretary please send my office an email we want to collect these stories about how the va changed your

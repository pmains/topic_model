joining us now is congressman michael waltz he's a representative for florida's 6th congressional district congressman always good to see you good morning yeah thanks good to be with you so let's start with the major rulings from the supreme court we're talking rulings on guns faith and of course abortion all drawing strong responses from both sides so your reaction what impact do you think this will have on the upcoming midterm elections well on the roe versus wade decision the court essentially said that courts in the united states should not be making these types of decisions we shouldn't essentially be legislating from the courts the elected legislatures should make that decision there has never been a national federal from congress law on abortion one way or another so therefore it devolves down to the states and obviously a lot of emotion on either side uh and and people need if that's you know top of mind for them uh in this upcoming election as they vote for their state reps and their state senators then that should be carried out in the ballot box and their voice should be heard of the ballot box but the bottom line is that courts shouldn't be making that decision elected legislatures should and congressman you know consumers are faced with the worst inflation we've seen in decades gas prices making the issue worse so what are you most concerned about when you look at our central ford economy well the the cost of transporting goods which is essentially uh you know the gas prices that we're seeing and the oil prices that we're seeing uh is underscoring this drive uh skyward that we're seeing with inflation and my concern is the bite administration isn't doing what it needs to do to arrest inflation in fact i i think sadly it's going to be around for the foreseeable future because the bite administration refuses to unleash american oil and gas which oh by the way from an environmental standpoint is some of the cleanest in the world and certainly cleaner than what we would get from venezuela or russia but instead we're seeing the president go kind of on bended knee to the saudis to beg the saudis to pump more to beg the uae to pump more when we have it right here at home but because of that that flawed policy i think gas prices are going to stay high on the drive for a green energy future i certainly support solar wind and having a balanced energy policy but people need to understand that the chinese communist party controls the basic minerals that go into batteries like lithium cobalt manganese they control the mines all over africa and all over the world and they have the some of the most polluting mining some of the worst human rights abuses uh and i don't want our energy future being controlled uh by the chinese communist party either so at the end of the day the united states has to be energy independent and that's the key to driving inflation down yeah of course the two sides have two very different views on how to get there so you're the ranking member of the house armed services committee in the defense spending bill there was millions in military construction for florida basis how did we pleased with how well that played out i i i am so far we still have to get it uh you know through the senate and on to the president's desk but we have a major project for patrick excuse me patrick's space force base now it's been renamed uh in in brevard county uh we have other things uh in the bill uh for our uh major military bases from eglin in the panhandle to mcdill along the gulf coast near tampa and and around the state florida is a veteran-friendly military-friendly state we have a huge role in our nation's defense and it's i'm really proud to be fighting for those military construction dollars for our bases right here in florida let's finish this you were no on the gun reform bill in congress as many republicans were as well some of those provisions put in are already being done here in florida how do you compare those and what do you see the future for this debate yeah look i mean there were some things in that bill i could have supported uh certainly uh the efforts towards mental health we have a mental health crisis in our veterans community and i think across the country with our young people as well for hardening our schools at the end of the day my issue though was kind of this blank check going out when it comes to red flag laws and i just don't trust states like massachusetts new york california to protect our second amendment rights which are absolutely a constitutional right and every american has the right to defend themselves and defend their families particularly with crime spiking like it is in many of the nation's inner cities so much to talk about congressman we always appreciate your time thanks for joining us here all right thank you

thank you it is amazing how everybody in Michigan knows how to say my name looks like everybody got some training so my name is Steve Canada I'm proud to be running to be our next governor and we'll talk a lot we'll keep this informal so feel free to interrupt me if you need to so I am like you said an immigrant I immigrated to the United States in 1979 and those were the days you couldn't go to Google and say what's the weather in Akron Ohio I they told me it's gonna be cold so I wore a sweater like yours it was minus 10 degrees at JFK and came to Akron got a PhD in chemistry and some a scientist I'm the kind of person that understands things like climate change in renewable energy right and why we must keep Great Lakes clean and pure why we must hold corporations accountable for dumping chemicals that eventually find their way from the water way to the lakes right and I'm kind of scientist governor that would know why we must not have Flint Michigan happened to us again ever again and as a governor I will make sure how many I don't know how many of you know about the Enbridge line fire is like a ticking time bomb under the states it's a 60 plus year old pipeline and if it bursts it will create a lot of problems for the Great Lakes we are stewards of volts 20% supply of course fresh water and we must protect that for the future and our future generation comes as a scientist governor I will do a lot of things and come in with a scientists mindset you know how the scientists think they look at the data right they look at both side he look at all the talk to experts so when I didn't make a decision at my table I would have all stakeholders I would have experts I will have people opposing me and I would have an open mind to listen to listen to and then come up with a good solution of big solution is what we really need is strong leadership we need someone that has a vision to solve our problems because we have tons of problems in Michigan right so we need it we need a problem solver as our next governor and I'll just start out with because you said we should talk about education I'm glad what you guys are doing I'll try to join you if I can on Saturday but you know absolutely I believe no guns in school you have certainly should have no guns in education places we should have no guns in religious places we do not need our teachers to be carrying guns teachers need to teach you know we need to invest money into our schools so we'll have the best technology where we can protect our students and our teachers so they can have a safe learning environment and the solution isn't to give guns to the teachers we need a thorough universal background checks on guns we need to ban assault weapons we don't need those to protect our Second Amendment rights so I would be against her having you know semi-automatic weapons and we need to you know make our schools safer but we have a huge issues in our education and I want to be the education governor and I want to be the education governor and Michigan never had and I'm not just saying there's a lot of politicians that Consultants write them a speech and they memorize it and corne say exactly the same because you know I go and have debates and and forums with other candidates and I can you really give their speech because they say the same thing someone else writes them I speak from my heart so I don't have a you know memorized speech okay I I speak from my heart and my staff here about 200 for people here Conner is here and Jack back there and they tell me that tree you never give the same speech twice right and that's because I speak from my heart and you know I talk what what ish is up and so in education you know I will just start at pre-k we need to really start investing in kids age of what 1 to 4 years children and that is learned so much and we need to have a universal pre-k to prepare the children for grade school I want to invest in k-12 we spend $9,000 per student and we spend $40,000 per prisoner and that math just doesn't work for me now we just we just have to put more money I make sure a couple teachers they were at Office Max buying supplies for their school they're paying money out of their own pocket and these people these teachers they're tears in their eyes the way they were explaining me how they get evaluated there's there's multiple testing so much testing goes on in school that the teachers are forced to just focus on getting the kids ready to good do good in the testing not learn real thing but just focus on testing because the test scores are used to evaluate that the schools and it dary values to evaluate - that the teachers and teachers performance and I want to kind of cut down the whole amount of testing just have one standardized test administer three times a year and that's all really we need we need to put put more money in it we need to the charter schools have created havoc and somebody said I should talk about charter schools and the charter schools have really really you know hurt our public schools and I feel that no charter schools no for-profit charter school should be making money making profits like Betsy DeVos or any corporation that she owns or other so on they shouldn't be profiting from our

texas congressman tony gonzalez who just got a firsthand look at bidenville the third world encampment in del rio texas congressman thanks for being here we make light of it because we know if this is on the other side with former president donald trump it would have a name and they would be all over it what's the reality of what's happening at that location right now you've been there yeah i was just in del rio uh late last week and del rio has become a beacon a magnet if you will for these uh cartel caravans and it's not going to stop it's only the beginning of it and you ask why are these cartel caravans making their way to del rio it is because the biden administration has encouraged them you know by doing away with some of these uh trump policies that worked yeah like the remain in mexico policy it works and we need to reinsta reinstall that uh immediately uh these x these uh uh patriot repatriation flights back to country of origin that slows traffic down we have to do that immediately uh at a larger pace you know when you talk about only eight to ten flights a week that's about a thousand migrants what's happening to the other fourteen 000 this encourages even more traffic to come it's as if there's a bat signal that has gone off in del rio texas everyone come here because the borders wide open i like that the biden bat signal that makes sense to me all the things you're saying makes sense the problem is you and i both know the bite administration's not going to implement them it ain't happening so what is the standard we're hearing that the haitians under the bridge will be deported but others who are attempting to make the trek those that don't get away well they're able to apply for asylum so what what is the state i'm i'm legitimately utterly confused is anyone know what the standard is you know uh back about six months ago myself senator cornyn senator cinema democrat from arizona congressman cuellar republic or democrat from from laredo area we came together we saw this coming a mile away we asked for more ice agents we asked for more immigration judges we asked for for for these resources sadly it's taken the administration this long what i would urge is congress needs to continue to put pressure on the administration this administration will only act unless there's enough political pressure think back to kamala harris the only reason she visited el paso was because president trump came down to the border you know a week before that we have to continue to hold this administration accountable in del rio the people of del rio have had enough of course we can't be a political football it's as if a category 5 hurricane has hit the small town of del rio texas and and the administration has abandoned us yeah they have and they may send a few agents now but it's certainly not a plan it seems most of the resources have been uh directed in the direction of washington d.c congressman thank you so much tony gonzalez appreciate your time thank you thank you also here tonight charlie kirk founder of tourney point usa in

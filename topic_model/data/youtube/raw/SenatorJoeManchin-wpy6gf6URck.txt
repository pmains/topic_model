Today President Joe Biden
signed US Senator Joe Manchin's Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The historic
legislation will address record inflation by paying
down our national debt, lowering health care costs
and increasing American energy production to
provide relief at the pump and bolster energy
security. The historic Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 is gonna go a long way to
lower prescription drug prices and out of pocket
costs. Senator Joe Manchin says
West Virginia's VA medical centers are safe. Manchin
announced Monday that three VA medical centers
in West Virginia would not see a reduction in
patients and emergency room care. Right now it's a good day
for us not to have to worry does our Clarksburg
get changed and transformed, does Beckley,
does our Huntington Woody Williams facility. Are we
going to be changing in Martinsburg and closing
CBOCs? None of that's going to happen. Right in the middle of
Senator Manchin's eulogy, there was a bit of
breaking news. You see, he announced that other
lawmakers and he have worked really hard to see
if they could get Woody Williams' body to lie in
state at the US Capitol. And he said it's going to
happen. Woody Williams was far
more than just a hero. He was the greatest of the
greatest generation and a model for future
generations. From what I know, Woody's greatest
wish was for all of us to continue his mission to
give back to each other and to love our country.

boom with all center plea thank you mr chair uh i want to begin by just echoing some of the comments made a few minutes ago by senator ossoff and just to discuss i feel that some of our colleagues including members of this committee in their efforts to minimize if not outright dismiss the significance and the magnitude of the threats to our democracy that we're discussing here today but in the spirit of the second part of senator alsof's message to make sure we're maximizing the time and the talents of the witnesses before us let me proceed to my questions there's really two areas that i want to get to in this first panel the first is for mr polite yes now in an era where election workers rightfully fear that they're under increased threat from election deniers and others who may wish them harm it's critical that the federal government demonstrate that it stands ready to respond to the election community's concerns and doing that as you've heard from others requires an adequate allocation of resources to the problem i know when i was serving as secretary of state for california one of the things that became a normal practice was making rounds at all the fusion centers in state in the state as big as california there's more than one or two to make sure that it's not just federal agencies and state agencies that are coordinating but across state agencies and across federal agencies my question is specific to u.s attorney's offices in each of the u.s attorney's offices across the country and in each of the fbi field offices is there an assistant u.s attorney and a special agent assigned specifically to the task of either responding to or coordinating a response to concerns raised about election threats yes senator this is not an issue this is not a problem that we can solve exclusively from washington d.c it requires coordination with state and local officials and it certainly requires coordination with each of our u.s attorney's offices in our fbi field field offices what we have in each u.s attorney's office is what is called a district election officer that is a trained specialized prosecutor on these types of election related crimes and then in each of the 56 fbi field offices there is also an election crimes coordinator again a specialized agent focused on these types of offenses that's great to hear and for the public to hear as a follow-up to that question whether it's in each of these offices or in each of the task forces national or local are the individuals involved specifically assigned to this elections threat related work or are they taking this election threat related work in addition to other duties and responsibilities it is it is oftentimes i would say in the overwhelming majority of these cases these u.s attorney's offices have additional these u.s attorneys officials have additional collateral responsibilities within the office their focus is on election related crimes broadly defined so they are members of this election threats task force but any related election related offense that may come forward and be referred to the u.s attorney's office for investigation or prosecution those those u.s attorneys those ausas are oftentimes involved as well okay thank you uh ms sweyman good to see you again you as well uh as you know uh i previously served as california's secretary of state and therefore california's chief elections officer uh and i along with you learned that sissa was a critical partner in helping us achieve a successful election that allowed you know i'm gonna brag a little bit here in california uh more californians participating in 2020 than in any election previously and they did so safely uh when they went to cast their ballot and that's what i really hope that this sort of collaboration between cisa and state and local elections partners is continuing to do i'm sure you benefited when you were washington secretary of state but now you're on the other side of the table and so can you describe from this point of view cis's level of engagement with state and local officials including on the issue of addressing and responding to uh election threats and whether there's any barriers to collaboration that this committee and congress can help address uh thank you senator for the uh for that question and uh by the way washington also had a very high turnout in 2020 um highest record turnout not that we're competitive um cisa really is focusing on trying to first and foremost make election officials at the state and local level aware of the work that department of justice is doing in this space and aware of the services that that are available not only by our agency but but other federal agencies and uh we're doing this by going out to election conferences working with our protective service uh advisors and cyber security advisors located across the country uh you know in in fusion centers often and um and really just trying to get that word out so that that election officials know not only to report immediate threats um because that as the senator earlier uh mentioned that that's part of the problem is reporting all of the uh threats that are out there but also knowing that uh they can work with state and local uh or state and federal uh law enforcement partners to secure their election system and people if there's anything else uh this committee or congress can do to be of assistance please don't hesitate including as senator blumenthal mentioned additional resources okay thank you thank you mr chair thanks

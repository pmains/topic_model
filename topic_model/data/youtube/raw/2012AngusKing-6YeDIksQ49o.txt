you know you I can tell you everything you need to know about public policy in in one story involving main and rototillers okay I'll bet nobody knows where I'm going with this in Maine if you borrow somebody's roto tiller the rule is really simple you give it back to them as in as good a shape or better than you found it with a full tank of gas that's all we need to know about America we don't own America we don't own the planet we have it on loan for our meager lifetimes and our obligation is to hand it on to the next people in as good or better shape than we found it and right now we're not doing that every day that goes by with the debt every day that we don't have a rational energy policy every day that we don't do something about the crazy tax system that we have every day that goes by is going to make it harder to solve the problem a year from now two years from now and if you look at the numbers practically impossible to solve the problem 10 and 15 years from now that's just wrong it's downright unethical

in a yield to my good friend and distinguished colleague mr. Jim Costa from California I think the gentleman for yielding and I joined with my colleagues this afternoon on what is I think a very important issue facing our country today and that is remembering what our common shared values are all about a nation of immigrants past and present mr. speaker I'm deeply disturbed as is my colleague congressman leukorrhea and others that are here by the administration's current policy which we believe tears families apart who are seeking asylum at our borders that's simply not the American Way these are parents and children fleeing to America came in here via legal means seeking refuge for a host of different reasons and what happens to them now children including infants and toddlers are taken from their parents care sent to shelters which we now know are sometimes juvenile detention centers that's not right that's not the American Way the parents are sent to detention facilities as well which may be in the form of federal prisons at America's border this is happening to families families who again are legally seeking asylum I mean we have had a whole history and tradition of allowing families who are seeking legal asylum and what are they flee well we know what they're fleeing domestic violence rape murder gang violence if that's not traumatizing enough now we're talking about separating them and detaining them and we're not even beginning to consider the sort of natural disasters that has afflicted neighbors of ours this is an outrageous policy I think it's morally disgusting and an American we are not a nation in terms of our shared values that tears families apart we never have been the American family is the foundation of our country we are not a nation that systematically uses fear and the threat of detention to scare immigrants from trying to legally enter this country and build a better life for themselves and their families for what they might be fleeing yes no one disputes that we need to secure our borders we must ensure the safety of our nation that is our highest priority we must prevent those who want to do harm to us from entering whether we're talking talking about transnational gangs that are engaged in drug trafficking or in sex trafficking or the the other illegal activities that devastate our communities we all agree on that and I have consistently voted for improved border security funding and policies about ripping these families apart like this is not securing our borders for over a decade I've been calling for comprehensive immigration reform that includes border security that fixes our broken immigration system and so does it in a way that is fair just and works we had such a proposal in 2013 that the Senate passed 16 to 32 sadly we could not bring it up it was a bipartisan measure if we had strong and comprehensive functioning immigration system there'd be no no chance for these disgusting policies to occur as they are now today so let me close I stand here today calling on Congress to move on immigration reform comprehensive immigration reform that is bipartisan let's put an end to these immoral cruel and unamerican policies if we can't do that then let's just try to bring a clean DREAM Act to the floor I guess we'll see what comes next week in terms of what's being proposed I stand here today for families are being ripped apart at the border for immigrants passed and immigrants present for let us never forget a is a nation for over 240 years that has been made up of immigrants from all around the world and for the future and the soul of our country I ask that we come together and fix this broken immigration system I yield back

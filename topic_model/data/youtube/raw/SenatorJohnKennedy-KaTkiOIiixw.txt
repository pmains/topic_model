mr chairman i wasn't going to say anything but i feel the need to respond to the comments my good friend senator klobuchar i think either even a cursory examination of mr chipman's record and even a casual observer of his testimony can see that he is a zealot now there's nothing wrong with being a zealot this is america you can believe what you want um but he's being asked to run an agency whose mission is to even-handedly apply the law and the reason i'm voting against this gentleman is because i believe he will use his position based on his record and his testimony to try to prosecute an agenda that he can't get by the voters through their elected representatives and i wanted to say that for the record

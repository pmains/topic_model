you're watching wbrz news 2 at 4. there are a number of issues in south louisiana keeping lawmakers busy from discussions over a new bridge to high gas prices to insurance rates and congressman garrett graves is joining us today to speak on some of that thank you so much for joining us today you bet great to be here we have been talking so much about a new mississippi river bridge it's needed when realistically can we see this bridge being built do you think well look this thing should have been built uh during governor edwards's time and i mean the previous governor edwards this is something people have been talking about for decades i think that on the trajectory they're on right now uh probably best case scenario for seeing dirt actually turn is within the next five years which is too long it is right you're exactly right you know people started talking about just just re kind of re-energizing this idea of a new bridge seven years ago seven years ago and and right now they aren't even at the point to where they can determine where the bridge needs to go and that's what's most infuriating because i think you could give most kids a crayon in south louisiana and they could figure out where we need to build a new bridge speaking of new bridge gas prices they've been high for a while now they've been dropping a little bit do you think that we'll be seeing some relief this summer um i don't think we're going to see relief necessarily during the summer but i think that there is a path to resolution here and louisiana could potentially play a pivotal role we have some of the the highest reserves of oil and gas in the nation right here and rather than being dependent upon russia or iran or saudi arabia we need to be producing more energy here we do it cleaner we do it safer than most other countries in the world this could be better jobs more jobs better for louisiana's economy and stronger economic ties with germany and some of our other nato allies and and and one of the other lanya benefits here is that when we do that it provides more funds for flood control coastal restoration hurricane protection because those dollars are directly linked to energy production so you could have a lot of wins if we were to have a little bit better energy strategy than we're seeing so far and hurricane season we'll be here before we know it um i've had people calling me about high flood insurance rates talk to me about that we are seeing a new flood insurance methodology that has just popped up out of fema we have seen rates go and some of the areas of south louisiana go from 600 a year up to 8 000 a year it's completely unaffordable and and the real solution here is making investments in flood protection let's not fight over how much you're going to pay in flood insurance let's make people safer that that means that they don't have the same risk which flood insurance rates go way way down it's a much better solution and that's why we've been able to secure billions of dollars for new flood protection investments but they've got to give us time to get those projects implemented and then we can talk about what revised rates should look like and i have to ask about the comey virgin canal project where are we at with this comey diversion canal the project started at somewhere around 200 million we ended up getting 392 million they came back and said they needed another 125 million we have continued to secure dollars for the project the good news is if you go drive up north of here you will see cranes construction heavy equipment going on all over the place the problem is as they continue to delay this project running into utility and other engineering challenges it's important to note every penny they need for the projects in the bank it is well under construction today we're going to start seeing benefits before they finish it but my guess is is they still are probably a year and a half or even longer away they have they have made some mistakes in implementing this project but i'll say it again i'm confident the project's going to get built in terms of digging do you know where they at with that process so they were going to try and dig consecutive and and they ran into problems with land rights and utility relocations and things along those lines they are digging today you can go drive up highway 67 19 you can go drive up north of baton rouge and you will see where they are digging they're working on three consecutive bridge projects right now so there is massive earth moving underway right now but i'll say it again it's been very disappointing but some of the efforts have uh been flawed and there are delays and we're probably looking at a a bit longer than it should for this thing to be finished all right congressman thank you so much for joining us today appreciate it thank you

we rise today after a long night last night a night that I think could produce some fruits today or tomorrow or soon I hope because on behalf of the just over 1 million Montanans and families across this country and I believe a vast majority of the people in this body we need to put this shut down to an end folks whether you're a welder and Bute or a teacher in Billings or a sugar beet farmer and sit near a mill worker in Columbia Falls they've all told me and they will continue to tell me that this body is incredibly dysfunctional that Congress is incredibly dysfunctional and we ought to break that we ought to start working together we ought to start listening to one another we shouldn't be taken off the right side of the earth nor the left side of the earth and work in the middle for policies that work for America the budget may be the most important of those policies that work for America it has been 112 days now since our budget ran out the end of September of this year we have responded to that budget running out by for short-term continuing resolutions we call them just stopgap measures band-aids if you will kick the can down the road it's described by a lot of different methods on funding our budget that has resulted in costing the taxpayers additional dollars incredible inefficiencies and caused by the members of this body not doing their job and leadership not doing their job enough is enough we need to roll up our sleeves we need to work together we need to talk we need to listen to one another and we need to come to a resolution of this problem we can talk about the Children's Health Insurance Program it's an incredibly important program there is no doubt about it but it has been held hostage for the last four months and I can tell you that if it was put on the floor and could have been put on the floor at any time in the last four months it would have passed I believe overwhelmingly by this body why because kids need it families need it we're putting in Montana's case alone to 24,000 kids at risk that's not have critical care the same can be said for our health care centers the same can be said for the opioid crisis the same could be said for security on our northern and southern border the same could be said for our military the uncertainty that we have without a long-term budget that goes to the end of fiscal year is unacceptable we all know it we've been talking about it for months since nothing ever comes to the floor to solve it except for a continuing resolution which is not a solution at all it's abandoned last night I proposed a 72-hour three-day extension so that the shutdown wouldn't happen to him Monday night so that we can work together to negotiate this deal put some pressure on the body to work together to come up with a deal by Monday night seem reasonable enough to me we've been talking about these issues by month for months but the majority leader objected to keeping the government open in pushing ourselves driving ourselves to the negotiating table to get something done look we've I've worked in this body with a number of folks on my side of the aisle and on the other side of the aisle and we've had success I bring this up often because Johnny Isaacson is an incredibly good chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee I happened to be ranking member and Johnny Isakson work well together we don't always agree but from the very beginning we've agreed to put what we disagree off to the side and work on what we agree upon and what is transpired is a record number of votes on tough issues coming out of the Veterans Affairs Committee why because we're working for the veterans and that's what we need to be doing here not working for a political party not posturing ourselves for the next election not putting working families and businesses at risk but working together to make a difference for this country with a long term funding bill that addresses a number of issues they've all been laid on the table from health care to opioids to pensions to our military to border security the list goes on but it's a list we can work with we know what needs to be done we need to quit playing games one of the people that I have incredible respect for in this body that has what I believe uncommon common sense is a senator from Maine senator King and I visit often times off the floor and we talk about our frustrations with this body because it doesn't have to be this way we can get things done if we work together so senator King can you explain to me why why we continue to have a budget that doesn't work for the American people it continues to be a patchwork of month by month or week by week continuing resolutions and what we need to do to fix that

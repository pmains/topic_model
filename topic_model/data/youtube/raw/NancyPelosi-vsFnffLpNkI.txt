mr. speaker today House Republicans are proving that their obsession with tearing down the Affordable Care Act is blurring their vision that it has no boundaries for the 51st vote to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act Republicans are turning their partisanship against the health and security of our nation's seniors the House Republican leadership political cake political games are threatening to derail months of bipartisan bicameral House and Senate progress on a permanent Medicare doc fix threatening our seniors ability to see their doctors and get the health care they need earlier this week the AARP the national committee to preserve Social Security and Medicare the National Council on Aging and other key senior advocacy groups wrote to congressional leadership leadership to make it clear that the Republicans actions would quote inject partisan politics and two bipartisan legislation and they wrote undermines the months of hard work done by committees their staffs and concerned stakeholders the Republicans approach has been rejected not only by the senior advocacy groups but provide providers the doctors ensures and seniors yet they persist with their reckless partisan antics even as time quickly runs down to address a sustainable growth rate the SGR formula before the end of the month twice this week Republicans bought the house from considering a fully paid for measure that includes the reforms of SG are supported by the pratts and republicans in the house and in the Senate and on the committee's why have Republicans chosen to proceed in this manner after months of bipartisan progress why didn't Republican leadership work with Democrats to find acceptable offsets we need to get this done and Republicans know that they're baldly partisan effort is a non-starter if it passed it would spike health insurance premiums by ten to twenty percent according to the Congressional Budget Office it would cause 13 fewer cause 13 fewer Americans to be insured says the Congressional Budget Office what does this mean to families if you have a child in your family between the ages of 18 and 26 they would no longer be able to be on their parents policy it would come if you went being a woman under the Affordable Care Act being a woman is no longer a pre-existing medical condition but the Republican actions here today would reverse that take this back to a time where women paid more for policies simply because they were women it would again reject eliminate the very important provision of the Affordable Care Act about saying you cannot be denied coverage because you have a pre-existing medical condition tens of millions of families probably a hundred million people are affected by not being denied coverage because of a pre-existing medical condition that's how many people it would affect and it would eliminate the requirement of the Affordable Care Act that there be no cat either annual or lifetime limit on the health insurance that you would receive for these and other reasons this is a really bad idea we may only hope that after this 51st Republicans fever will break and they will return to work with Democrats to pass bipartisan bicameral legislation as a permanent doc fix that seniors need before the end of the month we're going out today again with work undone but ten days before we come back twenty-fourth of March the SGR expires at the end of March we shouldn't be wasting time on this foolishness and recklessness we should be finding a solution that's what the Americans we'll send us here to do the Republicans fixation what's destroying the health security of millions of Americans through their efforts to destroy the Affordable Care Act imperil the permanent doc fix and that must stop Congress is wasting time again as I said when these endless wasteful vote time should be spent renewing emergency unemployment insurance raising the minimum wage rebuilding America by investing in education building our infrastructure creating jobs the American people deserve better than this they deserve a Congress that works to strengthen the middle class tackle the opportunity gap create jobs and build an economy that works for everyone I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and I hope that when we return after the recess week yet again another recess week Republicans will ready to get serious and be ready to get back to work for a permanent doc fix so that our seniors will be served

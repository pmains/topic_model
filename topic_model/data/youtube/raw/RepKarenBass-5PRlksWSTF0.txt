and joining us now here in washington democratic congresswoman karen bass of california congresswoman welcome back thank you thanks for having me and happy anniversary thank you uh you just heard the conversation with senator graham and i want to focus in on this point that he emphasized on police reform he and senator scott say they are willing to compromise on lifting immunity but not for the individual police officer lifting immunity so that this is a civil suit we're not talking about criminal implications here you could sue the police department and the argument is look the money isn't with the individual cop it's with the police officer uh and if there's a bad cop the the the department will get rid of them anyway would you be willing to go for that on immunity sue the police department not the officer well let me tell you first of all we're going to have to negotiate that but the intent of this is we have to find a way to hold officers accountable so this type of behavior ends you said well if the officer was bad he'd get fired anyway well actually a lot of the time that's not the case for example derek shavin had multiple complaints against him as a matter of fact after he is convicted there's an investigation or considering an investigation on previous abuses but are you willing to blow up this deal over that issue i don't know if i'm willing to blow up the deal i don't consider that blowing it up but we do have to look at ways now if lindsey graham and tim scott can show us some other way to hold officers accountable because this has been going on for just decades and officers right now are not really held accountable let me give you an example in minneapolis for for instance if chavin had not been convicted even though he was fired do you know that he could go through arbitration and that police chief has no ability not to rehire him so we have got to figure out how to stop this and holding officers accountable is key i want to excuse me i want to turn to another part of our conversation you heard senator graham's answer about systemic racism in this country yes and he says there isn't that and then that continuing to talk about this is running the country down well your response my response is it's some point in our country's history we have got to figure out a way to talk about race where we can talk about it objectively and people don't feel individual guilt you can look back at our history's laws and over time there were many laws that were put in place that were absolutely racist and over time those laws might have changed but the conditions haven't changed you can look at each of our institutions why is there such massive inequality when it comes to education when it comes to health care why does that exist and so we have to figure out a way to talk about it right now to say it doesn't exist does not help anyone i want to finish by taking a look along with you at the police shooting this week of 16 year old makia bryant here's the video hey hey get down get down get down get down now the police video makes it clear take a look right there congresswoman she was wielding a knife and when the police officer shot her she was about to stab that girl right next to the car and yet here is how white house press secretary jensaki responded to the shooting we know that police violence disproportionately impacts black and latino people in communities and that black women and girls like black men and boys experience higher rates of police violence congresswoman wasn't there a knee-jerk reaction in this country you heard it from john saki heard it from a lot of other people police violence when in fact this wasn't police violence this was officer riordan shooting intervening to save the life of the girl who was about to be stabbed well let me just say that oftentimes when this happens absolutely there's an emotional reaction but what jinsaki said i agree with whether it applies to this case or not i think is not the issue you also had adam toledo 13 year old child you know he had a gun he dropped it he raised but don't we need to be able to distinguish between case yes between derek chauvin that was murder and this which looks to me like a a righteous shooting i absolutely need to distinguish but we also need to look at policing overall and one of the things that i hope we really address is maybe the focus needs to be on de-escalation i know police officers are taught to shoot to kill a lot of people raised well why couldn't he shot her in a leg why couldn't he have done all these different things the point is we have got to come up with the way to stop there's so many people being killed in this country congress de-escalation and looking at the root causes of the problem congresswoman thank you thanks for coming in and we'll be following talks that we hope will lead to a compromise on police reform in the next month

i have a question from isaiah please say this is a matter of deep concern to me it's a serious problem in my home state of tennessee december 1st 2018 president xi promised then president trump to halt the export of fentanyl and all of the ingredients used to create fentanyl since that promise was made we've had over 100 000 american lives lost to synthetic opioids directly traceable to ccp produced fentanyl if i think about it america has done a great job in the current administration and administration that preceded it in dealing with the coveted 19 situation but there is no vaccine for the addiction to fentanyl that we're experiencing at the hands of communist china can you tell me what your plan is to address this and to hold president xi his promise made december of 2018. thank you senator for for raising a critically important issue and i just want to express my own um concern for the welfare of of your constituents and this was one of the reasons i raised this point in my opening remarks and as as you uh recounted i think there there was progress made under the previous administration where china agreed to implement controls and schedule fentanyl analogs but sadly what happened is we saw trans national criminal organizations adapt and basically shift to using precursor chemicals from china negating the gains from from the previous effort which was the result of considerable u.s diplomacy in negotiation so i absolutely believe that the chinese government can and must do more to hold its citizens and companies accountable that are supplying these precursors to transnational criminal organizations in mexico and elsewhere i think the united states needs to take a whole of government approach where the state department or embassy in beijing plays a very important role but we also need to work with the department of homeland security dea doj to take on the chinese government's willful ignorance on this issue and to really prioritize saving the lives as as you mentioned the record numbers of american losses due to opioid related uh overdoses is is unacceptable and this is something i would intend to prioritize if confirmed i appreciate your prioritization of that and i would also underscore the fact that our border has become far more porous at mexico and that's where this fentanyl is coming in and being produced in mass quantities i was just back in my home state of tennessee talking with sheriffs with mayors and what they've told me is something i think is probably being experienced across america and that's been a huge uptick in the number of overdoses since the borders collapsed after the 20th of january so this situation has become even even more critical at this point and i very much appreciate your attention to it thank you senator uh for sharing that information and i will certainly uh work to prioritize that in in the work of the international narcotics and law enforcement bureau and i know this remains a significant priority in terms of our counter-narcotics engagement with mexico thank you thank you mr chairman

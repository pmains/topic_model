joining us now the Select Committee Member and chair of the house intelligence Community congressman Adam Schiff of California uh Mr chairman you really put the justice department on blast over its handling of January 6th or there are signs that the Justice Department's investigation is ramping up but it seems like you think it may be too little too late but what more do you want Garland and the doj to be doing that they're not doing apparently well I hope it's not too little too late but it has been very slow in my view incoming we're now more than a year and a half after the events of January 6th and and still there seemed to be at least from what we can gather in the public record uh areas that the justice department hasn't fully investigated the justice department knew for example that Donald Trump was on the phone to the Secretary of State in Georgia demanding that secretary find 11 780 votes that don't exist and have that information for a long time and I don't think that should be left to the Fulton County district attorney alone now it may be that they are pursuing that and it's just been pursuing it very diligently and very quietly but it also may be that they've been very uh tenuous in in uh not feeling the sense of urgency that many of us do about uh about pursuing Justice when it comes to all of the multiple lines of effort to overturn the election this would certainly be in contrast with the members of the January 6 committee including the two Republicans the vice chairless Cheney uh said at the Tribune Festival Texas Tribune Festival where you could deliver those remarks we just played she said she thinks that um the entire committee uh will unanimously uh make a referral or not or decide to make a referral or decide to not make a referral to the justice department and then separately she told me that she thinks it's clear that Donald Trump did break the law do you think ultimately there's going to be a unanimous criminal referral by the committee if we Rec you know we operate with a high degree of consensus and unanimity uh you know it will be certainly I think my recommendation my feeling that we should make referrals uh but we will get to a decision as a committee and we will all abide by that decision and I will join our committee members if they feel differently uh but uh but look I do agree uh as the judge judge Carter in California wrote in multiple opinions there have been several laws broken and uh and it is I think uh apparent that there is evidence that Donald Trump was involved in Breaking several of those laws and I think when Congress does find evidence that people have broken the law uh not it is not always the case that it makes a referral but in circumstances like these I think that's the better part of the argument congresswoman Chaney also said at the Texas Tribune Festival that the committee has obtained 800 000 Secret Service Communications from the period surrounding January 6 uh she suggested that they indicate that not every secret service agent that has testified has told the truth can you tell us what the messages show and do they back up the story uh the Cassidy Hutchinson said that then White House Deputy Chief of Staff hornatto told her that there was a violent confrontation uh between president Trump in a secret service detail in the presidential vehicle I found her enormously credible and courageous as a witness I have yet to see anything that has dissuaded me from that view that she was being candid with what she saw and what she was told by others so I have remained you know very confident of her testimony and what she said uh and uh and and yes I do have questions about the testimony of others uh and whether they show the same Candor in terms of the records that we've obtained we are still going through them because they are very voluminous I will say they're not a substitute for having the text messages that were apparently erased from those devices and we are still investigating how that came about and why that came about and I hope and believe the justice department on that issue is also looking at whether laws were broken and the destruction of that evidence but we do have a mountain of information that we need to go through but I think it's fair to say that it won't be be a complete substitute for some of the most important evidence which would have been on those phones as someone who handles classified information on a regular basis I do want to get your reaction to something Donald Trump said this week take a listen it doesn't have to be a process as I understand it you know there's different people say different things but as I understand there doesn't have to be if you're the president of the United States you could declassify just by saying it's Declassified even by thinking about it is that how it works sir no that's not how it works those comments don't demonstrate much intelligence of any kind if you could simply declassify by thinking about it then frankly if that's his View uh he's even more dangerous than we may have thought because with that view he could simply spout off on anything he read in the presidential Daily Brief or anything he was briefed on by the CIA director to a visiting Russian delegation or any other delegation and simply say well I thought about it and therefore when the words came out of my mouth they were Declassified no people work hard to get that information people put their lives at risk to get that information that information protects American lives and for him to treat it so cavalierly shows both What A continuing danger of the man is but also how very little regard he has for anything but himself take a listen to what former Republican congressman and former adviser to the January 6 committee Denver wriggleman told 60 minutes you get a real aha moment when you see that the White House switchboard had connected to a rioter's phone while it's happening someone in the White House was calling one of the rioters while the riot was going on on January 6th absolutely now CNN's reporting is that the call lasted only nine seconds in nine seconds and was not placed by a White House switchboard it was a landline call from the White House to a cell phone registered to a rider um do you see this call as significant to your investigation uh you know I can't comment on the particulars I can say that you know each of the issues that Mr riggleman raised During the period he was with the committee which ended uh you know quite some time ago we looked into and one of the things I think that has given our committee credibility is we've been very careful about what we say not to overstate matters not to understate matters and and without the advantage of the additional information we've gathered since he left the committee you know it it uh I think poses real risk to be suggesting things so we've looked into all of these issues you know some of the information we have found on various issues will be presenting to the public for the first time in the hearing coming up it will be the usual mix of information in the public domain and new information woven together to tell the story about one key thematic element of Donald Trump's effort to overturn the election so your committee is going to hold its first public Hearing in more than two months coming up how much new information are we going to see Wednesday and what will the focus of the hearing be uh you know we're not disclosing yet what the focus will be you know I can't say that as this may be the last hearing of this nature that is one that is focused on sort of the factual record uh I think it'll be uh potentially more sweeping than some of the other hearings but it too will be you know very thematic it will tell the story about a key element of Donald Trump's plot to overturn the election uh and the public will certainly learn things that hasn't seen before but it will also understand information it already has in a different context by seeing how it relates to other elements of this plot so I think it will be as the others uh hearing worth watching uh and uh and I hope will you know additionally down the road have a hearing to explore our findings and our recommendations going forward to protect the country all right the chairman of the house intelligence committee congressman Adam Schiff Democrat of California thank you so much for your time today sir appreciate it and make sure to tune in Wednesday at

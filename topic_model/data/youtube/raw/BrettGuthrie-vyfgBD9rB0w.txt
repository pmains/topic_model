Guthrie in Kentucky one minute gentleman from Kentucky is recognized Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of Senate 151 the palom Thune traced act so far this year Kentuckians have received 500 million robo calls that's over 100 calls per person this year robo calls are the number one issue I hear about when I'm home scammers have found creative ways to trick people into thinking their calls are legitimate these calls have wreaked havoc for private citizens hospitals small businesses and everyone in between one Kentucky woman told me she gets three to four calls a day and she always answers for fear that there might be a family emergency only to be greeted by a spam call disrupting her work at a factory I was proud to co-sponsor the original House bill the stopping bad robocalls Act and I'm proud to support the pallone fune trace Act which will put an end to these frustrating calls I want to commend my fellow colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and in the Senate for developing this bipartisan bicameral solution to stop bad robo calls I appreciate the opportunity here I recommend all my colleagues support this and I yield back to the ranking member

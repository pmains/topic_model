mr. president over the past several weeks there have been real discussions bipartisan discussions about fixing the problems in the Affordable Care Act about controlling the growth of premiums about being sure that there is some certainty in the market to prevent the collapse of the individual market which by the way will not only affect people who are participating in the Affordable Care Act exchanges but will affect all those in the individual market and we could stop that and the Senate health health committee had four days of hearings and roundtables coffees with other senators to talk about what are the problems what we can we do to solve them and we were making some real progress and then all of a sudden up comes Trump care 4.0 or 5.0 I've lost track another bill to essentially repeal and not replace the Affordable Care Act on July 21st 1861 there wasn't an occurrence at the beginning of the American Civil War it was the First Battle of Bull Run and the Union troops were routed that day and there was a disorganized retreat back toward Washington that's been known historically as the great skedaddle and that's exactly what's happening again today this is the great health care skedaddle because what the Senate Majority is doing is avoiding responsibility you don't want to be discriminated against because of pre-existing conditions well that's not our decision we're passing it on to the governor the governor can make that decision it's not us doing it you don't want to have the bands for the differential between young people and old people change so that elderly people pay twice three times four times five times as much as younger people for health insurance you don't want responsibility for that fine pass this bill and give it to the governors that's what we're talking about here is a cop-out it is the Senate Majority once again trying to jam down the throats of the American people a change they don't want they don't want it everywhere I went in Maine in July and August after our vote back at the end of July people said thank you they said thank you and they said tell Susan Collins thank you for the vote to preserve our healthcare and yet here we are back at it again but I think we need to understand what this bill does essentially it does two things it shifts all the responsibility for the healthcare provision to the most vulnerable Americans entirely to the states with very little in the way of guardrails or protections and it gives them less money in order to provide that kind of health care that's called shift and shaft shift the responsibility on shaft the people who have to try to meet that responsibility I've been a governor what we're talking about here is cutting off the support and then the the dollars that are needed to meet those responsibilities and everybody says well this is all flexibility we're providing flexibility flexibility to make agonizing decisions between providing health care to seniors or to children to people who are disabled or people who are just trying to get on their feet and go to work without the specter of health of a health care disaster hanging over them I suspect we'll have more to say about this next week but it's a travesty and I understand there's going to be a little hearing on Monday I call it a fig leaf hearing there's going to be a hearing we don't know who's going to be there we don't know exactly what what the testimony is going to be it's going to be a hearing so people would say yeah we had a hearing well come on this is not a responsible way to legislate and the people of this country expect more of us and I hope that the at both parties both parties will recognize the folly of what's being proposed here and say no and then let's go back to talking on a bipartisan basis and fix the problems with the American health care system which certainly need to be addressed mister problem mister president I yield the floor

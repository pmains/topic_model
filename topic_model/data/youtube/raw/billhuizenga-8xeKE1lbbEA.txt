mr. high sing it for five minutes thank you Mr Speaker I appreciate the opportunity to address the house and address the nation today as a small business owner I know the importance of fostering and creating an environment that promotes job creation economic security and opportunity and allows especially small businesses to grow I also know that Americans and michiganders and those in the 2nd district in my home state of Michigan across the country are looking for real solutions that will grow jobs now well that's why i support the JOBS Act it will jumpstart our economy and restore opportunities for Americans primary job creators are small businesses startups and the entrepreneurs now I've been around long enough in my first year here mr. speaker to unfortunately see that sometimes you have to repackage ideas and and and put a different colored bow on it for people to accept it because what we're going to be passing has been passed I sit on the Financial Services Committee we've passed the number of these bills and all of these bills I believe and that's part of what Americas job creators plan that the House Republicans have put forward but what we're doing today is we are going to be putting this Jobs Act it's comprised of six bills that have been approved by the committee and then very quickly those six bills are one reopening the American Capital Markets to emerging growth companies act and what that's going to do is it's going to allow temporarily emperor airy relief from some of the onerous sec or Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that are on those small businesses number two the access to capital for job creators Act is going to allow small companies raise capital by again removing some of those regulatory bands that are in there and that that say that a small business can't use advertisements to go try to get and attract investors well in an age of Internet and those kinds of things that that has a huge impact and it also brings along a concept that's been out there called crowdfunding and that's the third bill entrepreneur access to credit act is also going to ease the the requirements that allow things like crowdfunding people being able to go and spread this out on the Facebook and Twitter and internet and to their friends and to pull in those small dollar investors that are going to be able to give them the capital that they need to launch that innovative idea well the fourth is a small company capital formation act and it allows small businesses to go public by elevating the threshold that the companies are exempt from five million 250 million that is going to be able to really truly impact those small entrepreneurs and small business owners who are looking to take their business to the next step the fifth one is the private company flexibility and growth act and that's expected to give small companies more room to grow before having to go public currently there's a regulation that says you can have no more than 500 investors in your in your small company this doubles that this says you can have up to a thousand and we believe that that is also going to be able to allow those small businesses who are in transition who are in that acquisition mode who are in that growth mode to be able to go up there and and be successful and finally number six the capital expansion an act would increase the number of shareholders allowed to invest in a community bank from 500 to 2,000 and why would we include this part while community banks really are the backbone of many of those small investors they're the ones that they go to church with and shop at the grocery store with they know their businesses they may know that it's been a long term relationship with that local community bank and by able to be able to expand the footprint of those community banks we're going to be able to expand their their lending power as well to those small businesses well it's interesting that here we actually have a bipartisan package of bills this isn't just something that's the Republicans ideas in fact in the in the Financial Services Committee we had this as bipartisan votes and really it's truly going to help create a healthier environment for small businesses to hire and expand in fact President Obama's administration released what's called a statement of administration policy yesterday supporting this very act we welcome his support and recognition this bills innovative solutions to ensure that small businesses can access Capital need to expand hire and invest and again that's because you the American people us here in the house of representatives are looking for those real honest solutions well it's far time that we get government out of the way of small businesses as well the engine of our economy we need to focus on the real economy and our priority has to be that focus according to the Kauffman Foundation startup companies created nearly 40 million jobs 40 million jobs since 1980 and the Small Business Administration shows small businesses generate over sixty percent of all the new jobs created here in the in the u.s. sixty percent of all those jobs that we are hoping to have in this country are created by these small businesses in fact even the World Bank has a report it's called doing business and it showed that the United States has fallen to 13th for the quote ease of starting a business and quote so with that Mr Speaker I appreciate this is a key to lasting honest economic recovery and we need America needs these real jobs real solutions and real results right now Thank You chair recognizes gentlelady from California mr.

without objection I rise in opposition hor 1595 but I want to begin before I go into the contents of my argument against this legislation I want to start by commending the bill's sponsor mr. Perlmutter of Colorado for his tireless advocacy his reasonableness in in his approach and his willingness even in the midst of the toughest negotiations around the subject matter to keep his cool to think through the import of the bill and to seek compromise where he could and it is quite a legislative endeavor that he's taken upon for himself but for this institution for his state and for states around the country he has been a fantastic advocate and and I would say that standing in opposition to his bill it's not because of his lack of goodwill it's not for lack of his willingness to engage but for a fundamental disagreements in the approach and we've been able to have real discussions around this that I think would make the American people more proud or more confident in this institution and our body politic more broadly speaking and I also want to thank my friend and colleague on the committee mr. Stivers of Ohio for his work on the issue together they have conducted themselves with wonderful integrity and in respect for their colleagues and their colleagues views and ideas and especially in an issue like this where it can create an enormous amount of controversy 21 states have legalized medicinal marijuana and 10 states have legalized the recreational use of the drug however cannabis remains completely illegal in 19 States federal law defines as a this drug as quote a high potential for abuse no current accepted medical use and treatment in the United States and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision in quote that is current federal law this bill does not change the fact that cannabis remains a prohibited Schedule one substance under the Controlled Substances Act to that end if we seek to give financial institutions certainty we should deal with a listing of cannabis as a Schedule one substance not debating a partial solution for financial institutions to what is a much larger problem and at larger societal issue that we must wrestle with should states be allowed to continue to violate federal law does federal law need to be changed when it comes to the scheduling of cannabis we have an FTA that regulates cigarettes and e-cigarettes which as we know the recent announcement they'll seek a ban on flavored East cigarettes but the FDA has no regulatory authority to regulate cannabis the bill we are considering today is one of the biggest changes to u.s. drug policy in my lifetime yet is done with little debate while our committee has jurisdiction over financial institutions and in the nature of our debate it's usually about the nature of of regulation for the capital markets and for banks we heard little from the Committees of jurisdiction over the Controlled Substances Act or the Criminal Code in fact the Financial Services Committee is the only one who's held a hearing on the issue of cannabis this Congress now I would say that is due to the leadership of mr. Perlmutter in his tireless advocacy for this but we only had one panel of witnesses I've voiced my concerns in our jurisdiction to chairwoman waters and to congressman Perlmutter about my concerns for this in March of this year I wrote chairwoman waters to express my belief that we need to have a better comprehension of the nature of this substance and address the supervisor and regulatory issues that would result from enactment of HR 1595 and I ask unanimous consent that I submit a copy of this letter for the record without objection so order in that letter I list number of questions that have yet to be answered including what steps will federal financial regulars have to take to harmonize standards and protect against illicit activity including institutions obligations with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act any money laundering requirements suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports what are the implications of this bill on non-bank financial firms including investment companies I know there's been additions since we've come we've come to the floor to include insurance companies and I think that's a positive step but these are some of the basic questions that still need to be resolved it's also important that we understand whether this legislation could lead to bad actors like drug cartels they could more easily access our banking system in the United States these concerns have been echoed by several former directors of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and former administrators of the Drug Enforcement Agency in a July letter from this year former law enforcement officials serving from 1981 to 2014 have voiced concerns that the safe Banking Act could be exploited to provide easier more cost-effective ways for nefarious groups to launder money ask unanimous consent to submit this letter for the record distance order mr. speaker drug cartels are a significant problem in cannabis legal states like California Washington and Colorado as reported in a May article by NBC News the cartels have found that it's easier to grow and process marijuana in legal states like Colorado and ship it throughout the United States than it is to bring it from Mexico or Cuba as you may as consent to submit for the record this article is about objection so order thank you mr. speaker and beyond the regulatory issues Congress has yet to examine these potential societal harms and implications for human health in a january article regarding research on the health effects of marijuana worth author Malcolm Gladwell wrote quote before any drug gets permitted to go on the market basic questions have to be answered about its safety and efficacy we don't know we don't know relatively basic questions about marijuana in quote I commend this piece from The New Yorker and ask unanimous consent to submit it for the record out objections soul Thank You mr. Speaker I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado's willingness to work with several of my colleagues on this side of the aisle I want to commend him and the gentleman from Ohio mr. Stivers once again for the commitment to this effort this version of the legislation before us right now is dramatically improved and includes a number of Republican priorities such as language on operation choke point and a solution that will help industrial hemp farmers across the country but most especially in Kentucky yet mr. speaker there are many questions left to be answered we do not fully understand the sweeping implications of this legislation we do not yet know what the resulting regulatory regime will look like nor do we have any assurance it will not expose the current financial system to illicit activity in particular as it's currently drafted HR 1595 offers insufficient safeguards to prevent drug cartels from accessing the banking system what this legislation does is provide a half answer to a much larger problem than just banking we owe it to our constituents in to the public to have a serious debate on the underlying issue and that is the issue of whether or not cannabis should be considered a Schedule one substance under the Controlled Substances Act I know mr. Perlmutter and I share that same sentiment that we should have that larger debate in the meantime Congress is and is working in a bipartisan way to come up with at least a measure of solution but I'm hopeful that we can get the medical research necessary to and the FDA processes necessary for us to have that larger debate as well and I would welcome that debate as I know the American people would as well and with that I'd like to reserve the balance of my time

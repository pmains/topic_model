thank you very much chairman mr. Mulvaney can we talk about the tax cuts tax reform proposal you just said that you assume that the tax reform plan is going to be deficit-neutral so that correct yes center and your presentation to this committee states that it is deficit-neutral correct yeah basically senator we had three choices which is we could assume the tax plan which is still in its very early stages it's not really a plan where so there's no scoring on it yet that's an assumption it is add to the deficit subtract from the deficit or be deficit neutral we take the third out the middle end and in the way that you get to that conclusion is that you recognize that there will be immediate revenue reductions from lower tax rates and calculate that they will be offset by increased revenues from enhanced economic activity offset each other to deficit neutrality with respect sir no that's not the calculation we went through okay what was the calculation that we went through the list of exclusions that are reduced loopholes that are closed deductions that are removed I can't remember what the number that we assign to the ending the the proposal includes two to remove the deduction for state and local taxes which is a huge number we get rid of a wide variety of personal deductions including I think everything except the proposal has some more go to York EFS aramony here is that you are not assuming any growth from tax revenues as a result of increased economic activity in reaching the deficit neutrality that is all going to be we do is dollars in tax dollars out no added growth as the basis for deficit neutrality I don't know if I'm agreeing or disagreeing with you but let me tell you what we did we assumed economic growth certainly part of the as I mentioned in my opening statement the the assumptions that how we got to 3% growth tax policies were part of it and certainly when the when we do go to 3% growth we assume that government revenues go up so we assume that there is growth but we did not use those numbers to say that the tax policy was deficit neutral so the tax policy as you foresee it will be one that is deficit neutral without regard to growth without regard to the increased growth that you assign to the tax policy itself there's a circularity you know where people say we're going to change the tax code and that is going to increase revenues and then we're going to bake those revenues back into the tax code that is not going to be a manner in which you achieve deficit neutrality when you get your tax code proposal together again I think we're agreeing but just just to use my own words is that I'm aware of the accusations of double counting I do not believe that we engaged in that the only way that that becomes true is if in fact the tax reform proposal is deficit neutral on out in regard to growth from the tax proposal exactly so we are agreeing on that point and keep in mind when we have to make these assumptions for the budget in fact we're very early on in the discussion on what a tax policy would look like we have to make certain assumptions and the three options that I mentioned to you were the three options we took I guess we probably could have made the assumption that the tax policy by itself would reduce the deficit we chose not to do that my guess is there some of you who would make the contention that the tax policy by itself should add to the deficit we chose the middle way to say look we don't know enough about the tax fall so we know some of the basic principles of it we're going to lower rates we're going to simplify but we're going to get rid of this whole host of deductions and so some of which are massive and said look the most defensible conservative with a small C way to look at this is to say on its own policies those will be deficit-neutral now whether or not what you'll find it what it passing and when we negotiate with you on a final tax so what it looks like I can't say but we have to make certain assumptions early in the process to do the budget so when we look at your tax proposal when it gets to a level of specificity that we can actually look at we will be looking at growth numbers that are a constant with and without the tax code and the deficit neutrality will be the function of changes within the tax code itself not projections of growth let me look at a different way and again see if we're agreeing by by using different words when we offer next year's budget we won't be able to make those assumptions I hope regarding what the tax policy would look like because we hope that it's either in law or very close to being in law so we won't be forced with that choice of looking at some piece of paper with basic principles and trying to do the math on that but we'll have a specific thing that we might be able to score and make more detailed assumptions regarding because you do recognize that if you count the growth here in the budget and then you count it again in your tax proposal that is a double count and you're saying it's not a double count because you are not going to use it twice in that risk way and I wouldn't want to come now and have to answer questions for my good friend senator Van Hollen if I was actually double counting thank you my time has expired

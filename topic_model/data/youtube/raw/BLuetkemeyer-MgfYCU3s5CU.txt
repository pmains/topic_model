hi this is Congress Luke tomorrow with another edition of the blame bus thanks for joining us again this week this coming week September 17th this constitution day and that's obviously a pretty important day for our country because back in 1787 our actual Constitution that we're governed by today was adopted as you recall the initial constitutional is a very loose document that will so loose and so flimsy at that cut the country couldn't really function so they needed something a little bit stronger with a little more teeth in it to pull all the states together and give the government enough power to be able to do its job which was basically to hold the country together if you remember your history and the Constitution constitutional history you'll remember that the founding fathers are very concerned about consolidating power in one particular group or entity our branch of government so what they did was divide the power and the three different branches legislative executive and judicial and as a result they wanted that power to be equally distributed and whenever one of them gets out of balance obviously then we've got a problem so over the course of the last two hundred-plus years that's always been the the battle between the different branches to see who can exert more power more influence and whatever in over the last 20 years there's been a different urban flow of that situation but it didn't add a our government is still the most looked at form of government in the world since then I think there are a number of different constitutions around the world that have come into play most of them are all longer just some fun facts for you the president Constitution is 4,400 worlds in words and is a shortest one that's ever written by a major country in the world the Constitution the original Constitution is actually on display in the National Archives here in DC it's only been changed 17 times if you recall the Bill of Rights or they considered to be the first set of amendments were all adapt at the same time and since there's one during 17 further amendments to the Constitution Benjamin Franklin was the oldest person at 81 jonathan dayton was younger to 26 in james madison and george washington the military presence assigned the constitutional document now what we do here in our office as we tried to strip to use among all the schools we have pocket constitutions that we our staff takes that when we make school visits this is also available to you free of charge just contact your office and we'd be glad to send you one remember the Declaration of Independence was the promise constitutional is the fulfillment of that promise to our people with that we'll see you next week take care

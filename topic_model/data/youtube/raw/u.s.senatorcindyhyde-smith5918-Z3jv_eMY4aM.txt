again I would like to thank Senator Blackburn for her work on this you know in Mississippi we're very proud of our armed services we're very proud of those that choose to make this a career and that actively seek this path and this mandate has certainly been a problem I've been concerned about the administration's overreach on many things but at least we're finally able to stop some of this and as you've heard in a time when Recruitment and Retention pose such huge challenges to our Armed Forces this was just critical that this bring be brought to light and President Biden's damaging vaccine mandate it needs to be stopped rescinding these mandates will save thousands of service members from being wrongly terminated and allowed them to focus on what they need to be focused on and that's National Security missions what they signed up for and ensuring that our service members are protected and equipped with the tools that they need to defend this country must be our top priority not targeting those who do not want a covid vaccine so I am so grateful for our brave service men and women and everybody on this platform we promise to you that we're going to stand for their freedoms just like they're standing for our freedoms

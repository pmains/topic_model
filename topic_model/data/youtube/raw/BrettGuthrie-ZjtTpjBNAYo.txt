in this important hearing on state responses to the opioid crisis our local communities of suffering on average 130 americans die every day from an opioid overdose and opioids were involved in forty seven thousand six hundred overdose deaths in 2017 which accounted for sixty seven point eight percent of all drug overdose deaths in Kentucky there were 1116 reported opioid involved deaths in 2017 the Energy and Commerce Committee has been steadfast in its efforts to help combat the opioid epidemic with post investigations and legislation whether it was the committee's investigations into the prescription drug and heroin epidemic opioid distributors patient brokering or the major opioid manufacturers we have continued to ask questions and get answers for the American public when it comes to legislation this committee led the way on the passage of the 21st century cures Act the comprehensive addiction Recovery Act the support for patients and communities Act I was proud to work on all three of these comprehensive laws which are designed to combat the opioid crisis through prevention advancing treatment and recovering initiatives protecting communities in bolstering our efforts to fight synthetic drugs like fentanyl this hearing is a critical opportunity for us to check in with the states those that are on the frontlines battling the nation's opioid epidemic to see how the federal money Congress provided has been allocated and spit what successes they are having and combating the epidemic but also what challenges they are still facing and what additional authorities and resources could be helpful the good news is that each state testifying before us today has seen a decrease in their overdose death rates federal assistance is making a difference in addition states are creating and implementing in a way innovative approaches to combating the epidemic examples include expanding efforts to connect people to treatment through EMS in emergency departments expanding and increasing the availability of naloxone and medication assisted treatment increasing non-emergency transportation options to treatment for those in rural areas expanding neonatal abstinence syndrome treatment program for pregnant parenting mothers and efforts to address workforce issues through the initiatives such as a loan repayment program and broadening the curriculum and training in medical schools this hearing is a great platform for the states to share how the federal funding has made a difference in what programs they are working and working not only is it helpful for us in Congress as we continue to conduct oversight and legislate but also to the states as they learn from each other about new ideas or innovative approaches that can be implemented while progress is being made and some of the overdose deaths rates are declining the Director of National Institute of drug abuse dr. Nora Volkow declared this week that this country still has not controlled its addiction problems some states are continuing to see a high number of first responder emergency department encounters due to an overdose in addition states are still facing many challenges including a lack of qualified workforce and infrastructure varying requirements and timelines and different fund different federal funding streams and restrictions on funding including that some funds have been restricted to opioids impeding flexibility to address emerging challenges in addition to the continuing threat of opioid states are starting to see more instances of poly substance abuse and polysubstance overdose deaths with States specifically citing stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine as a growing concern nationally since last year methamphetamine has been detected in more deaths and opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone in 14 of the 35 states that report overdose deaths to the federal government on a monthly basis methamphetamine is involved in more deaths than fentanyl the threats are evolving and the fight is not over we want to continue partnering with state and local entities to combat the opioid epidemic as well as emerging threats which is why it's important to not let our foot off the gas Congress needs to continue supporting the states and this committee needs to continue conducting oversight of these critical issues I want to thank all the witnesses for being here today I look forward to hearing from you about all your successes we have had in combatting our nation's opioid epidemic but also how the threat is changed what challenges remain and what more we in Congress can do with our partners you in this fight and I yield back

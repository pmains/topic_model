this last week had seen some very positive changes around the country states are opening up people are going back to work in a sensible and responsible way and that's going to be critical for this vibrant economy unfortunately California has had some setbacks these setbacks aren't because we have health care concerns but in fact because the governor has decided to micromanage the return of people back to their daily lives whether it's his decision to keep some of our Beach is closed or an unreasonable restriction in areas that have little or no infection and industries that would like to start up again safely I would hope that by the time we meet next week much of this will be reversed in the same vein the Senate is going back to work I applaud them they need to be there working on all the elements both of the existing stimulus and of getting us sensibly back to work unfortunately speaker Pelosi is also playing politics here in California by not allowing the house to go back to work with the Senate on those kinds of reforms this power play is something I object to and I would certainly hope that by this time next week she reverses her decision lastly I'm convinced that this week has taught us something else the problems in the deep state the kind of activity that led to a false investigation of President Trump and to the conviction of general Flynn in fact are now continuing to come out in a way that convinced us that the FBI and Department of Justice deliberately entrapped general Flynn and the evidence will now show that that was done for political purposes these are all areas in which I think the American people deserve Congress doing its job and I look forward to joining them in in January but until then I'm going to continue to work to try to help get my state and my district back to work until next week thank you

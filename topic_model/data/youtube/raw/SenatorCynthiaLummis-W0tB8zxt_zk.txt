well welcome back earlier in the show I spoke with the Brotherhood of railroad single uh signalman President Michael Baldwin on congress's intervening in rail strike negotiations the house yesterday passed a bill to avert a strike and now it moves to the Senate joining me right now is Housing and Urban Development Committee Member Commerce science and transportation Committee Member and environment and Public Works Committee Member Wyoming Senator Cynthia Loomis Senator it's great to see you this morning thanks so much for being here my pleasure Maria do you expect that bill to pass the Senate well it's unclear at this stage I sent out a letter this morning with my colleague Senator Kevin Kramer encouraging our colleagues to pass the bill it's very important to our economy that we avert a rail strike for States like mine that's in massive amounts of raw materials to other states for manufacturing rail is essential to those workers so if we shut down rail service the number of workers and jobs that will be disrupted all over our economy extends well belonged the rail workers itself it will have a ripple effect through our entire economy that we can ill afford during these times of high inflation yes I totally understand the impact of a strike and it certainly would create massive disruption for the economy but I want to get your take on the criticism of Congress getting involved we talked about it here on set earlier and one Union spoke spokesperson declared that imposing this deal denies railroad workers their right to strike while also denying them of the benefits they would likely otherwise obtained if they were not denied their right to strike why deny workers their rights the workers have Union Representatives that have been negotiating with the railroads for years to try to put this deal together there are 12 unions and not eight or nine of them have agreed to this deal so to have some of the holdouts and they are important unions that are holding out turn to Congress to get a better deal than their own Union negotiators were able to put together on their behalf puts Congress in the situation of negotiating a labor deal instead of the unions and management we're ill-prepared to to make those decisions for them we should just have them accept the deal that is on the table well just to be clear four of the 12 unions who rejected it they represent the majority of affected workers and they don't want this deal because they say they're deemed essential workers they were deemed essential workers during covet and they're not getting the sick day that they need they want 15. do you think at the end of the day that seven sick day proposal that Nancy Pelosi put in the house bill will actually make it will that pass the seven six days uh sick days proposal I suspect will not make it you know here's what appears to have happened the union bosses negotiated higher salaries 24 percent higher salaries and left some of the sick days and work-life balance Provisions that workers wanted on The Cutting Room floor when they negotiated this deal so I think the workers beef should be with their own union bosses who cut a deal that they're now unhappy with and not rely on Congress to get them a better deal than their own negotiators put together it's a great Point Senator I want to move on to crypto you've been working so diligently on potential legislation I want to talk about that disgraced FTX CEO Sam bankman freed claims that he did not try to commit fraud he's embarrassed by his mistakes he messed up he said during the New York Times deal book Summit yesterday here's a bit of that watch I also frankly made a mistake that I feel pretty embarrassed to have made um I mean a lot of these are but I substantially underestimated what the scale of market crash could look like and what the speed of it could look like so billions of dollars have gone missing what do you think happened how did this happen well I think that these were well-educated sophisticated fraudsters I think it's obviously fraud so the justice department needs to get involved there's a reason that they offshored most of these companies 135 companies in a sophisticated mass of businesses designed to obfuscate what they were doing and what they were doing was re-hypothecating meaning Landing over and over the same monies and then using customer funds to do their Equity investing and their political contributions this was just pure and simple good old-fashioned fraud and it needs to be handled through the criminal procedures but if it's good old-fashioned fraud why is he doing the the rounds this morning he was on GMA he was at the New York Times Summit why isn't he in handcuffs is it because he donated 40 million dollars to Democrats well I hope that's not it but it does have the appearance of a Kid Glove treatment for someone who had mesmerized the public and isn't that typical of a really really effective fraudster to dupe even fairly sophisticated investors but if you look behind the curtain of FTX they didn't have corporate boards they didn't have good accounting procedures they did they were approving expenditures with Emojis they were living in the Bahamas in a compound where a lot of inappropriate behavior was going on among the workers and absolutely no solid Financial controls for a company that was dealing in billions of dollars with sophisticated in investors and so a lot of people were duped these people are very effective shysters and apparently a very effective shysters will be among us for for many years to come this is one of them I was speaking with Perry and boring earlier from the digital Commerce and she says why is it that the SEC has blocked any opportunity to bring a regulated product to Market a regulated digital product to Market I mean Senator you've introduced a bill with New York Senator Christian gillibrand called the responsible Financial Innovation act it would fully integrate digital assets into our existing Financial system where does that stand and tell us more about it well our bill is crying to be passed the examples we're seeing where FTX and its ripple effect through the digital asset economy is a perfect indication about why our bill is so important our bill would put Commodities in the cftc it would put the SEC in charge of the largest number of digital assets because they look like Securities and we need to get this bill through so we'll be reintroducing it in January and encourage our colleagues that it is the lack of regulation in this space that is allowing things like FTX to exist without regulation it's time for a regulatory framework that yes authorizes in encourages and fosters Innovation but that also provides consumer protection and disclosure well I mean it's it's a little late right I mean how long have you been working on this and why has n't your colleagues brought it to the floor why aren't we seeing this is it because things like FTX and lobbyists were stopping any real legislation in in terms of bringing a regulated digital product to the floor again I go back to this question of he's donating 40 million dollars to lawmakers and they're going easy on him um I am hopeful that the real reason that we haven't done it is because uh too many senators and congressmen don't understand this space and they're not ready to tackle it just in terms of their own Comfort level uh with it but now hopefully now that they've seen how this industry running unchecked is causing a lot of financial distress that it's time to regulate it it's time for members of the Senate and House to get educated informed about this industry and for us to move forward so Senator gillibrant and I will be working starting in January with a full court press to get our legislation passed senator who should be the overseers of digital that's another question in the market is it the SEC is it the cftc there's a lot of hands on deck here who will oversee digital assets both the commodity Futures Trading commission will definitely have Bitcoin because Bitcoin is clearly a commodity it is fully decentralized and then other assets uh will probably be in large part at the SEC so we're going to have to provide them with adequate uh personnel and tools and guidance and statutes and they'll have to make regulations that will allow them to conduct the adequate consumer protections that are necessary with regard to cryptocurrencies that behave like Securities senator it's a great interview we so appreciate you answering the questions that investors have thanks very much for being here and come back soon thank you so much

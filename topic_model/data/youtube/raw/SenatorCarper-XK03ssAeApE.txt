NOTED. MR. CARPER: THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. MR. PRESIDENT, I AM HONORED TODAY -- MR. PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU MIND REPEATING THE MARGE -- MARGIN ON THAT VOTE? THE PRESIDING OFFICER: 54-33. MR. CARPER: WE HOPE THERE WILL BE A SETTLEMENT IN THE DISPUTE WITH BASEBALL. AT THE END OF A GAME, SOMEBODY WINS AND SOMEBODY LOSES. THE TEAM THAT WINS GETS A W. WE JUST HAD A W IN THE NOMINATION OF LEONARD STARK TO SERVE ON THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. NOT JUST FOR DELAWARE, BUT A WIN FOR THOSE PLACES THAT HE WENT TO SCHOOL AND WHERE HE PRACTICED LAW, THIS IS A WIN FOR OUR COUNTRY. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HIS NOMINATION TO SERVE ON THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS. THE PRESIDING OFFICER FROM TIME TO TIME WILL SEE ME ON THE FLOOR AND PASSING OUT WE CALL THEM PROM CARDS TO OUR COLLEAGUES ASKING THEM TO JOIN HIM OR JOIN ME IN COSPONSORING LEGISLATION SUPPORTING AMENDMENTS, SUPPORTING BILLS ON THE FLOOR AND FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO I'VE BEEN PASSING OUT POM CARDS TO OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ASKING THEM TO SUPPORT THE NOMINATION OF LEONARD STARK TO SERVE ON THIS COURT. AS GRATEFUL AS I AM FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND ONE OR TWO INDEPENDENTS WHO VOTED FOR HIM, I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS FOR THE REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE AISLE AND SAW FIT TO SUPPORT HIS NOMINATION. I'M NOT SURE, MR. PRESIDENT, HOW MUCH OUR COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE SENATE KNOW ABOUT THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS. I'D BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT I HAD TO DO SOME HOMEWORK ON IT MYSELF. THIS COURT IS MAYBE BEST KNOWN FOR ITS DECISIONS ON PATENT LAW. THAT'S RIGHT, PATENT LAW. IN FACT, IT'S THE ONLY APPELLATE COURT, I'M TOLD, OTHER THAN THE U.S. SUPREME COURT THAT WILL HEAR AND CONSIDER PATENT CASE APPEALS. BUBUT DESPITE MY NEEDINA LITTLE HOMEWORK ON THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, I DO KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT JUDGE LEONARD STARK. IN FACT, I'VE KNOWN HIM, MR. PRESIDENT, FOR PROBABLY HALF OF HIS LIFE. I'VE ADMIRED HIM FOR EVERY ONE OF THOSE YEARS. HE'S BEEN NOMINATED BY OUR PRESIDENT TO SERVE IN THIS CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS IMPORTANT COURT. I HAD A CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIS NOMINATION, ALONG WITH SENATOR COONS, OF DELAWARE, THROUGH THE JUDICIARY PROCESS AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT JUDGE STARK'S JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN THE COMPLEX ARENA IN PATENT LAW MAKES HIM A PERFECT FIT FOR THIS PARTICULAR JUDGESHIP. MR. PRESIDENT, I KNEW A LOT ABOUT JUDGE STARK FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE, WE'RE FROM DELAWARE. DELAWARE'S A LITTLE STATE. SOME PEOPLE ASK ME, HAVE YOU MET EVERYONE IN TT STATE OF DELAWARE -- MET EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE? PROBABLY NOT EVERYONE, BUT I MET JUDGE STARK AT AT A YOUNG AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HIM. FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS JUDGE STARK SERVED AS A JUDGE ON THE DELAWARE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT. HE CLERKED FOUR JUDGESHIPSING -- JUDGESHIP. PRIOR TO THAT HE HAD AN ACADEMIC CAREER. HE IS A FELLOW GRADUATE OF THE FIGHTING BLUE HENCE AT U.D. DOUBLE MAJORED AS AN UNDERGRADUATE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE WHILE ALSO WORKING TOWARDS HIS MASTER'S DEGREE. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN, JUDGE MARK, THIS IS BEFORE HE WAS A JUDGE, HE DOUBLE MAJORED AS -- IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND WORKED TOWARDS HIS MASTER'S DEGREE. MY SISTER WOULD CALL THAT SHOWING OFF, BUT HE WAS SHOWING OFF AND JUST EXCELLING EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. HE EARNED A FULL SCHOLARSHIP AS A EUGENE MEMORIAL DISTINGUISHED SCHOLAR. SOMETHING THAT JUDGE STARK AND I HAVE IN COMMON FROM OUR TIME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE, WE BOTH MET AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WOULD CHANGE OUR LIVES, DISTINGUISHED, BELOVED PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, JAMES SOLES. DR. SOLES WON AN HONOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE SO MANY TIMES I THINK THEY RETIRED THE HONOR. HE WAS LOVED AND RESPECTED BY SO MANY STUDENTS, PARENTS AND FACULTY MEMBERS. FORTUNATELY FOR LEONARD STARK AND FORTUNATELY FOR ME, JIM SOLES TOOK US BOTH UNDER HIS WINGS AND HELPED GET US ON THE RIGHT PATH AND LEADS JUDGE STARK TO THE SENATE FLOOR FOR CLOTURE ON HIS NOMINATION. JIM SOLES WAS A PERSONAL HERO TO A WHOLE LOT OF US AT DELAWARE. HE HAD A LIFELONG FRIENDSHIP WITH JUDGE STARK AND I, WHICH WE CHERISH TO IT THIS DAY -- TO THIS DAY. I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE AND ENDED UP WORKING ON AN M.B.A., AND INST YEAR AT DELAWARE, I MET A GUY RUNNING FOR A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT, AND IT WAS JIM SOLES. I ENDED UP FROM KNOWING NOBODY TO BEING THE TREASURER OF A -- OF A FELLOW RUNNING FOR THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, A CONGRESSMAN AT THE TIME WAS PETE DUPONT, GOOD MAN, AND I GOT INVOLVED IN THAT -- IN THAT CAMPAIGN AND LATER ON I WOULD MEET JUDGE STARK AND WE BOUNDED RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE OF OUR AFFECTION AND RESPECT FOR -- FOR DR. SOLES. BUT -- I THINK IT'S 12 YEARS AGO -- 12 YEARS AGO JUDGE STARK WAS CONFIRMED, I THINK UNANIMOUSLY, BY THIS BODY TO SERVE ON THE -- DELAWARE'S DISTRICT COURT AND I CALLED HIM TO CONGRATULATE HIM. SURE ENOUGH, GUESS WHO HE WAS HAVING DINNER WITH. HE WAS HAVING DINNER WITH JIM SOLES. JIM GOT TO TELL HIM HOW PROUD HE WAS GETTING A CONFIRMATION TO THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT. BUT SADLY NOT IT TOO LONG AFTER THAT, WE LOST OUR DEAR FRIEND JIM SOLES. WHILE HE WILL NOT HAVE DINNER WITH US TONIGHT, I WILL LET JUDGE STARK KNOW THAT JIM SOLES IS SMILING DOWN ON HIM AND THAT JIM WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PROUD TO SEE HIS NOMINATION ONCE AGAIN ADVANCING ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME TELL YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT JUDGE STARK, IF I COULD. NOT LONG AFTER HIS GRADUATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE, AGAIN, WHERE HE HAD DOUBLE JURORS IN UNDERGRADUATE WHILE PURSUING A MASTER'S DEGREE. HE STUDIED AT OXFORD AND AUTHORED BOOKS ON BRITISH POLITICS. AFTER OXFORD, JUDGE STARK WENT ON TO EARN HIS LAW DEGREE AT YALE LAW SCHOOL WHERE HE SERVED AS SENIOR EDITOR OF THE YALE LAW JOURNAL. AFTER GRADUATING, HE CLERKED FOR JUDGE WALTON AND JUDGE STARK THEN BEGAN HIS CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE AS AN ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY FOR STATE OF DELAWARE FROM 2002 TO 2007 HE HANDLED FEDERAL CASES, CIVIL MATTERS AND OTHERS. BEFORE HIS CURRENT POSITION AS A DISTRICT JUDGE, MR. PRESIDENT, JUDGE STARK SERVED AS MAGISTRATE JUDGE ON THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT OF DELAWARE. IT WAS THIS ROLE THAT PREPARED HIM QUITE WELL TO SERVE AS A DISTRICT COURT JUDGE. IN 2010, PRESIDENT OBAMA NOMINATED JUDGE STARK TO FILL A VACANCY ON THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT AND THE SENATE CONFIRMED JUDGE STARK UNANIMOUSLY -- UNANIMOUSLY. AND IN THE YEARS SINCE THEN, JUDGE STARK SERVED DELAWARE AND OUR NATION WITH INTEGRITY AND WITH DISTINCTION. ONLY FOUR YEARS AFTER SERVING AS A DISTRICT JUDGE, 2014, HE WAS APPOINTED CHIEF JUDGE OF THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT WHICH IS WHAT HE HELD UNTIL JUNE OF THIS YEAR. HE HAS PRESIDED OVER 6,000 CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES, OVER 6,000 CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES, INCLUDING OVER 2,400 PATENT CASES, INCLUDING 63 PATENT TRIALS. PATENT LAW IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AND JUDGE STARK'S EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN THESE MATTERS MAKE HIM UNIQUELY QUALIFIED FOR THIS PARTICULAR JUDGESHIP. IN FACT, THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE RECEIVED A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR JUDGE STARK'S NOMINATION FROM THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT BAR ASSOCIATION THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE BREADTH OF JUDGE STARK'S EXPERIENCE. THE -- THEY SAY, QUOTE, IS UNIQUELY WELL SUITED TO A POSITION ON THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AND THE LETTER WENT ON TO HIGHLIGHT HIS -- AGAIN, QUOTING, HIS INTEGRITY, HIS PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE AND HIS JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT. THERE WAS A LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION WHICH ONCE AGAIN RATED STARK UNANIMOUSLY WELL QUALIFIED. WELL QUALIFIED. AT EVERY STAGE OF HIS LIFE, JUDGE STASH HAS PERFORMED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. THAT IS IMPRESSIVE FOR ANY FIELD, BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS ON THE FEDERAL BENCH THAT'S FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR KIEWRCH AND THE -- CONSTITUTION AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. JUDGE SPARK IS KNOWN AS A CONCENSUS -- THE FACT THAT JUDGE STARK APPROXIMATELY 2,100 WRITTEN OPINIONS, 2,100 WRITTEN OPINIONS, ONLY 2% OF THEM HAVE EVER BEEN REVERSED OR AFFIRMED WITH CRITICISM. ONLY 2%. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON HE WAS APPROVED IN JANUARY BY A STRONG BIPARTISAN MAJORITY IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. HE IS THE HEART -- HE HAS THE HEART OF A SERVANT AND TEMPERAMENT TO BE AN OUTSTANDING JUDGE ON THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT. HIS STUDIES TOOK HIM ACROSS THE POND TO OXFORD AND ENGLAND AND BACK TO YALE. HE HAS A STELLAR RECORD OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. FROM HIS SERVICE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS AN ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE LAST YEAR ON THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT, JUDGE STARK EARNED RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITY IN DELAWARE AND ACROSS OUR NATION. I WANT TO CLOSE WITH THIS. THE PRESIDING OFFICER KNOWS I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SERVE AS THE GOVERNOR OF DELAWARE FOF EIGHT YEARS JUST -- FOR EIGHT YEARS JUST BEFORE I CAME HERE TO SERVE IN THE U.S. SENATE. I NEVER IMAGINED WHEN I WAS RUNNING FOR THE POSITION OF GOVERNOR HOW IMPORTANT THE GOVERNOR'S ROLE IN DELAWARE IN TERMS OF NOMINATING JUDGES. NOMINATING JUDGES TO THE COURT OF CHANCERY AND DELAWARE SUPREME COURT AND FAMILY COURT AND ON AND ON. A LOT OF COURTS. SOME WITH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESPECT AND ROLE. ONE OF MY GREAT REGRETS IS THAT I NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOMINATE JUDGE LEONARD STARK, YOUNG LEONARD STARK. HE DID NOT APPLY. HE WAS NOT -- I KNOW HE'S OLD ENOUGH BUT NOT BY MUCH. BUT I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY PROUD AS A GOVERNOR TO HAVE NOMINATED TO HIM TO SERVE AT ANY ONE OF OUR COURTS IN DELAWARE. DELAWARE IS A LITTLE PLACE. IT HAS ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE, ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES NORTH TO SOUTH, ABOUT 50 MILES FROM EAST TO WEST. AND IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO KNOW EVERYBODY BUT YOU CAN KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO NOT ONLY JUST KNOW LEONARD STARK BUT ALSO TO KNOW HIS FAMILY. AND TO KNOW THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE SUCCEEDED -- I SAY ONE OF THE REASONS I SUCCEEDED, HE PICKED THE RIGHT PARENTS. NOT A LOT OF WEALTH OR FORTUNE OR FAME BUT JUST PEOPLE WITH REALLY GOOD VALUES AND JUST GOOD PEOPLE. I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THEM, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HIM INTO THE WORLD AND RAISING HIM WITH WONDERFUL VALUES. I WANT TO THANK HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN FOR SHARING THEIR HUSBAND AND THEIR DAD WITH THE PEOPLE OF DELAWARE FOR ALL THESE YEARS AND FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO LET US GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO SERVE IN THIS NEW POSITION. FROM HIS SERVICE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AS ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS ON THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT, LEONARD STARK HAS EARNED THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITY IN DELAWARE AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. I AGAIN WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUES TODAY FOR VOTING TO TAKE HIS NOMINATION TO GO FORWARD TO THE NEXT STEP. I THINK WE'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE NEXT WEEK ON THE ACTUAL CONFIRMATION BUT I'M PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME OF TODAY'S VOTE ON CLOTURE. AND WE'VE GOT A STATE SUNG. THEY HAVE A STATE SUNG IN MARYLAND. I WON'T SING IT HERE TODAY, MR. PRESIDENT. THE STATE SUNG OR THE VERY FIRST STATE OF DELAWARE, THE FIRST STATE TO RATIFY THE CONSTITUTION, INCLUDES A LINE TAKE GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS, ANOTHER DIRECT QUOTE. THE SUN IS SHINING OVER OUR BELOVED DELAWARE. AND SO TODAY INDEED THE SUN IS SHINING OVER DELAWARE. WE HAD A NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST IN THE CAPITOL THIS MORNING IN THE AUDITORIUM OF THE VISITORS CENTER WHERE THE SPEAKER WAS BRIAN STEVENSON, FAMED ATTORNEY, DEFENDER, AU AUTHOR, AND HE WAS HERE. HE WAS OUR KEYNOTE SPEAKER FOR THE PRAYER BREAKFAST. THE CHAIR FOR THE -- COCHAIR FOR THE PRAYER BREAKFAST WAS SENATOR CHRISTOPHER COONS OF DELAWARE. WE -- THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SPOKE AT THE PRAYER BREAKFAST TODAY, JOE BIDEN, A DELAWAREAN. AND THE CONGRESSWOMAN HAD A PRIVILEGE TO BE THERE AND PART OF THAT FAMILY. IT'S BEEN A GOOD DAY FOR DELAWARE AND WITH THE VOTE TO MOVE THIS NOMINATION TO THE NEXT STEP. IT'S A GOOD -- ANOTHER GOOD DAY FOR DELAWARE FOR THIS REASON BUT ALSO A VERY GOOD DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY. AND FOR ALL WHO HAVE WORKED HARD TO MAKE THIS DAY POSSIBLE AND THIS POSSIBLE, I WANT TO SAY A

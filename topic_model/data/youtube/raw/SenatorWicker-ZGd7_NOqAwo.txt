welcome back America to you I joined out my united states senator Roger wicker from the great state of Mississippi I'd wanted to talk to about a speech he and we will talk about a speech he gave on the Navy last week because it's near and dear to my heart but I got to begin by asking you senator first welcome good to have you on the program well thank you thanks for having me talk to you again do they do they brief senators after a masker like Sutherland spring do you get a memo from the Secretary of the Senate with the background on what has happened or you just like the rest of us learn it in bits and details and it comes out I'm just like the rest of America you know we are we're getting back for for our session this afternoon from our various states and it may be that there's a pretty thing but you know I don't know any more than you do and then just and frankly you I don't have any more answers than anybody else there are there aren't any I had a Martin Walker unpredictable I'm sure that Mississippi is dotted with some of the 16,000 Southern Baptist churches that are just like this one small communities of under 200 people that gather and there they're not going to have surveillance at the door and there's no way to stop this no you're exactly like this this reminds me very very much of the little Baptist Church that my granny and granddaddy took me to down in Calvin County Mississippi when I was growing up yes maybe 50 people 75 people in a worship service and not totally vulnerable and and typically somebody across the street who we've been like to keep in their arms that was able to run get a gun and engage this guy as he left as he left the church and and chasing them and bringing to this his playful ends but yeah it sounds a lot like the kind of folks that that I see all over my state of Mississippi you know I know it's the senator you have to travel the state and they will be asking you for solutions but sometimes you just gotta say I can I can build more ships I can fix our defense problem we can talk about the Iranian deal we can do that but I cannot stop crazy cuz I mean that's not a government problem the government can't stop crazy it just it's really hard to tell people that well we can look at mental illness and no no no this guy was court martial for a violent act but you know tens of thousands of people are are convicted and go to jail for a while for for an assault and we can't keep him forever so it's just something you struggle with if there were if we could identify some trait that that makes a person likely to do this and we would we'd be a lot smarter than we've ever been in history of the world yeah and I'm telling you there's a brand new book out called world without mine about Facebook and their algorithms there may be an algorithm that would identify potential killers but I don't think a free society would ever employ it because it becomes very close to the surveillance state that we hate senator I've got you you're an expert on the Navy you build a lot of ships in Mississippi don't you well our talented shipbuilders in a number of places around the country including Pascagoula Mississippi build a lot of fine ships yeah they are do you know what you're talking about the reason I said that is that some people come from landlocked states don't know much about shipyards but you've got shipyards you actually know that we are not maintaining them the way that they need to maintain that we're not expanding them we're not build enough ships how critical is the deficiency do you think well let me tell you when I was in the house I was on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee now I'm on the Armed Services Committee and given the the great opportunity to be chairman of the sea Power subcommittee so I've seen this time and again and particularly during eight years of the Obama administration we get these Admirals before us and appointed secretaries and the you know one point there was a 303 ship requirement at one point it's a 313 ship requirement and we asked okay now this is a requirement it's not just a goal not just something that we'd like to see that's behind the sky it is they require to defend our country when are we going to get there and we always get the the the same lip service will serving them resource-constrained and all of that so to me with the with the election of Donald Trump and and a new requirement of 355 ships which means 80 more ships than we have now I just saw that as an opportunity to to actually get everybody's attention and put our our legislation and then money or announce on and so that's the reason for getting together with chairman Bob Wittman over on the house side and actually 9355 shifts the policy of the United States of America now I had the Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer on my MSNBC show last Saturday like he's smart real smart guy he's great cheerleader for the Navy he says they're still committed to 355 ships but he had his acting under secretary go out and say we're not going to get there until mid century that's not acceptable is it senator well let's don't blend the Secretary of the Navy for something that an Obama holdover said my understanding is that that after that speech by Under Secretary Dee he he was called on the carpet of an airship and and basically what I would have wanted asking is have you've been asleep since January 20th when the subcommittee in the Senate has had five hearings onehans and when we have absolutely made it clear that we are ready to go hand in hand with the Navy leadership and actually get us 80 extra ships and an adequate minimum size leave at 355 within just a little over a decade and and so I it's just astounding to me that someone like an undersecretary Dean would would have totally missed all of of the talk and all of the planning all the effort made to turn this this inadequacy of the Navy around Senator wicker I press secretary Spencer for a plan something that it's got the sign-off of the Senate Armed Services the House Armed Services and the president and the Department of Defense and the and the Navy and that everyone signs a plan that says these ships and these categories are going to be recalled from the ghost fleet these ships are gonna get built at these shipyards in these years so that Americans have metrics there isn't another business in the world that runs without metrics like this well I see we are we are seeing that sort of plan I can tell you that we have asked our staff only full Armed Services Committee of the US Senate to get such a plan together and I know that that secretary Spencer is working to get just such a plan together and it can be done when you talk about reactivating ships from the Ready Reserve and what you're calling it those fleet that gets a little harder to do than simply keeping some ships longer I think there's actually there's there's a lot more possibility in getting us to 355 the late 2020s if we can just keep some ships from being retired some ships have really only have about 15 years use and that we can certainly go longer than that and then we do the mark on a program of building more ships and I know you were talking about in that interview I was and I was happy to read it to get to 12 aircraft carriers yep and you know he when you get to an aircraft carrier what goes with it is a carrier battle group which includes the whole configuration of other variety of ships that go along with the carrier as it makes its way around the world I don't know if we're going to be able this year to authorize the Buell acquisition of the carriers what we're going to do some fuel acquisition in the bill and I honestly think we're putting the probably we're putting the final touches on it this week and next and I hope the president united states is signing that defense authorization bill when he gets back from his international trip and frankly this will be a great opportunity for Donald Trump to to talk about the fact that this new legislation puts us far closer than we've gotten in years and years to actually building the requirement that the generals and admirals tell us is a minimum requirement well good luck on that I spent most of my time with Majority Leader McConnell talking about the tax bill on Saturday but I the next order of business to me is the Defense Authorization I can get any rid of the sequester last question well the sequester be dead by this time next year senator wicker I certainly hope so I said we hope so and shame on us if it isn't sequester was never supposed to happen it was supposed to be so severe and and the impact particularly on national security was supposed to be so onerous that we would never do it and instead the hope was that we would slow the growth rate just slow the growth rate of programs like Medicare and Medicaid nobody is ever talking about cutting those programs and very vital and they're important and they're popular but that's what Grant Cassidy would have done just gradually gradually slow the growth rate of some of these programs to free up some money in future years so we can take care of securing our country right now with the minimum may be that our animals in general say is required Roger wicker thank you so much for spending time with me senator come back early and often will follow this especially the appropriation bill gets through and I appreciate your taking the time with me this morning a lot I'd come back

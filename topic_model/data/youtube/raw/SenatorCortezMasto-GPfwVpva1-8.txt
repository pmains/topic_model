[Applause] here let me just say this I my name is Hanson Cortez master I am the first female senator from the state of Nevada and the first Latina ever elected to the United States because the reason why I'm here is because so many hard-working Latinos in Nevada got out and supported me and elected me to be here to be their voices we are here today to send a clear message to this administration that it is not okay to separate parents and their children [Applause] and you've been and it is not who we are as Americans started during this presidential campaign but I have watched as this president has taken it on rhetoric that attacks our immigrant communities and he's brought that hateful rhetoric and actions to the White House he has rescinded daca he has rescinded the TPS that protects our hard-working families he has deported over a thousand thousand immigrants who have been living in this country for decades and now with knit zero-tolerance policy he wants to separate kids from their parents who have come to the border for protection and help [Music] that is not America that is not our values we have been demanding and I have been demanding yet my colleagues have been demanding from this administration even a policy that shows how they're gonna handle and work with and protect these children and reunify them with their parents do you think there's a policy out there what we have seen is their actions and their actions show that they don't care about these families they don't care about these kids they don't care about how they're treated you reunifying them with their parents and they certainly don't care the trauma and the impact they're gonna have long-term on these children and their families and that's what this fight is about as Americans we know that we should always look out for the best interests of our children and our families we know everyone in this country and many more we are not gonna stop fighting to protect these families and keep them together [Music] [Applause] three bells keep our families together [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all those on the other side of the aisle to send a message that this is not okay and we're going to pass this legislation and we're going to send it to this administration to make the changes to protect these families [Applause] [Music]

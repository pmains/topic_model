King who understood better than anyone that worker rights and civil rights are intertwined and deeply connected dignity of work is not code for targeting white men who voted for Trump that's a losing strategy that's a betrayal of our values they give any dignity of work unites all of us it says to everyone we see you we honor your work we respect you we fight for you we are on your side on the other hand Donald Trump uses phony populism to divide the country and to distract from the fact that he has betrayed workers his White House looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives except in the days it looks like a retreat for the gun lobby his Supreme Court puts its thumb on the scales of justice help with favoring corporations over workers favoring Wall Street over consumers favoring drug companies over sick people favoring dark money over voters that's not populism populism is never racist populism was never anti-semitic populism doesn't push some people down to lift the other people up populism doesn't pass tax cuts for the richest 1% populism doesn't try to control women's bodies populism doesn't rip children from their parents arms and put asylum seekers in cages populism is none of that we love this country we've never we must never give up the hallowed ground of patriotism to the extremists whether they're in state houses or in the White House dr. King dr. King taught us human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability rolls in because we push because you push it rolls in is why you're here that's why you that's what you do every day I'll leave you with this story because I depart I I mentioned earlier that Connie and I joined the airport protests against Trump's Muslim ban joining Connie and me were my daughter who is a legal services lawyer Lee an immigration lawyer for Ojai for legal services in Ohio in our then our our oldest granddaughter Jackie who was just three years old it was Jackie's first political three-year-old Jackie's first political rally and she held up her first political sign now she had written she had drawn that side she had written that sign it to most of you if you had seen Jackie sign that she was holding up you would have thought it looked like the scribble the scribbles of a three-year-old but to her grandfather with my grandfather Lee x-ray vision I could see I could see that sign what that sign said was rage against the fascist machine thank you for your activism enjoy the rest of that [Applause]

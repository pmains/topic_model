let me just think in closing associate myself with the ranking members remarks uh in terms of the seriousness of these these charges and indictments and convictions federal law enforcement bribes taken by tsa to improperly screen luggage first of all stealing personal belongings as people go through these screeners all the time and scanners and yet the idea that tsa officials are stealing personal property but beyond that is the national security implications you know the idea that a tsa officer would take a bribe to allow thousands of pieces of luggage to go through improperly screened or to allow drug trafficking organizations to have unfettered access this is precisely what the terrorists are looking for ice providing you know fraudulent documentation you know all these cases that we look at they're trying to get things through airports improper screening improper documentation that's exactly what they're trying to exploit you know and then of course cbp you know taking bribes from drug cartel organizations and given the seriousness of this i do first want to say thank you to cbp for mr winkowski for you showing up at the policy level but i i do want to express my extreme disappointment uh the tsa and ice given these allegations and not just allegations but proven fact did not bring forth the policy level witnesses that we requested so it sends a signal to the congress that either they're not taking it very seriously or these officials are just trying to hide from the american people uh and so i i i'm not very happy with that i i again associate myself with the ranking member with his remarks and with that the committee stands adjourned

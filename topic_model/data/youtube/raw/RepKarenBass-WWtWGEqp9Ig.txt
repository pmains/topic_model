on wednesday the house passed the george floyd justice and policing act an expansive police reform bill which would ban chokeholds and no knock warrants prohibit racial profiling and overhaul qualified immunity for police officers joining me now the lead author of that bill congresswoman karen bass of california congressman congresswoman bass thank you for being on the sunday show um you wrote an op-ed uh in usa today where you you wrote this the house passed the police reform bill 30 years to the day of rodney king's brutal beating you also write when the police officers in the rodney king case were acquitted i felt hopeless and defeated that's how we will continue to feel until we act absolutely i mean you know after rodney king i thought for sure the world would see what black communities brown communities had been talking about for generations and when that verdict came down absolutely it was like well that wasn't enough and since then i mean we have seen hundreds of videos of people either being brutalized or killed and so i think that george floyd's murder was so egregious the hundreds of thousands of people out in every state in the country certainly provided the momentum for us to pass the bill last year and so the provisions in the bill i talked about in the intro um federal ban of chokeholds we get that uh prohibiting no knock warrants uh that's what um killed brianna taylor outlaws racial profiling we all get that here's the one thing i want to ask you about and that is overhauling qualified immunity for officers what is it and why is it important to overhaul it if not just get rid of it completely sure and it's actually two provisions it's qualified immunity and it's also lowering the standard from which you can prosecute an officer but qualified immunity essentially allows an individual to sue the officer and right now the officer has immunity from that if you remember when derek chavin was had his knee on george floyd's neck he had his hand in his pocket he was looking at the camera because i guess he felt he could kill him on camera with complete impunity and so to get rid of that having the officer being liable is something that is important to hold officers accountable because right now there's really no way to hold them accountable which is why we keep seeing the same thing over and over and over again congressman what do you say to republicans who push back on um on your push to get rid of or overhaul qualif uh qualified immunity and say that um one that that is anti-cop and two that that is just going to make it open open season on police officers to quote-unquote frivolous lawsuits well i mean i think it's is similar to any other profession if you behave recklessly if you cause harm then why would it be surprised that you would be held civically liable and in terms of reducing the way you prosecute an officer right now time after time officers are arrested and then charges are dropped or charges are not filed this just happened in rochester new york the officers that put the spit hood over the man and he died and charges were not charges were not filed and so we have to do something to hold officers accountable so the two provisions in the bill that do that is qualified immunity and reducing the standard from which to prosecute from willful to reckless so rather than trying to determine whether the officer was really thinking that that day he was going to kill george floyd then uh he was reckless when he did it and with qualified immunity in order to sue you have to essentially prove that there is another case with the exact same circumstances so with george floyd you have to find another case with an officer that did the exact same thing that would allow you to bring about a suit that's a ridiculous standard and it needs to change and by the way there are plenty of republicans who actually believe qualified immunity should be eliminated all together the koch brothers the the cato institute so it's not unanimous that all republicans believe that qualified immunity should stay in place and congressman last question on this great there are republicans who who support support overhauling getting rid of qualified immunity are any of them in the senate what are your hopes for passage of your bill the george floyd justice and policing act in the senate can it get through the senate what do you tell republicans to get them to vote for it well so first of all you know any time a bill passes the house and goes to the senate you know it's not a surprise if changes are made and i do believe that there is the sentiment there i do believe that we're going to be able to do this senator tim scott has been working with us and and i believe that we will get a bill on president biden's desk all right congresswoman karen bass of california thank you for coming on the show

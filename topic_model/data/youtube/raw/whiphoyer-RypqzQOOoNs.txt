I want to thank all of you for joining this call this is a time of great challenge in our country and great anxiety for individuals and families and small businesses and large businesses and we are all engaged in trying to meet this challenge and follow the guidelines that have been set which will if followed reduce the dangers that we have and the spread of this terrible virus that afflicts not only us but the global community today tonight I wanted to give you the opportunity to ask questions and I have some experts with me from the from Maryland and from the federal government who are going to be handling much of the requests of how do I get money what could my small business do to get a loan and other questions of very great importance in the short term and long term for I know so many of you on this phone call so let me get right to it first of all we have dr. Josh sharp Steen who's with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health a graduate of Harvard Medical School and a former staffer of Henry Waxman one of the health experts that served in the Congress and service chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee which has so much jurisdiction over these issues then we have Michael Harrison he's the policy director of the Maryland Department of Labor Licensing and Regulation they'll be involved obviously and much of what goes on as a result and he also received his master's in public policy from Johns Hopkins University then we have Andrew Fujin Edie who is a graduate of Towson University and is the policy officer at the Maryland Department of Labor and licensing and regulation I think the two folks Michael and Andrew will be able to answer some of the questions you have practical questions about how do I get this that or the other then we have Antonio Doss who's the district director for the Small Business Administration's Washington Metropolitan Area district office small business administration has been handed an extraordinary challenge to get money to small businesses to employers employees to keep small businesses afloat and to make sure that they're available so that when the economy does rebound when we could go back to work whether that's May or June whenever that date is that is safe for us to get back and engage that those businesses will be up and running and ready to go and then Steven Umberger who is the district director for the Small Business Administration Baltimore district office so we have two folks from the Small Business Administration I'm sure we'll have questions for them and so I'm welcome all of them thank them very much for being with us and let me just say a few remarks again governor Hogan I think has done an excellent job of getting our state in the best position it could be he issued a stay at home water on Monday for all of Maryland and I've been staying home just like I'm sure so many of you on this phone this is a new push to fight and stop the spread of the corona virus to ensure Public Health and Safety to the extent that we do not come in contact with one another we can't pass the virus to any other person and that's what is going to lower that curb that you've all been watching on the president's briefings and on the news programs I urge everyone to heed that order and stay home unless you are going to purchase or pick up food going to the pharmacy traveling to an approved essential job or seeking medical care we are in this fight together and everyone shares the responsibility of stopping the spread a corona virus and protecting the most vulnerable in our communities our seniors but when you look at the incidence of positive tests you see that the thirty to forty nine year old crowd is got some of the highest numbers last week as human Congress passed major bipartisan legislation and on the 27th of March in fact essentially we passed both in the Senate and the House unanimously the third phase of our response the coronavirus challenge not only from the health standpoint from the economic standpoint this follow was earlier legislation to support research my other phone rang apologize for that get back to what I was saying the legislation that we passed on the 27th of March was preceded by two pieces of legislation which I call one and two and it also dealt first of all with the immediate medical needs and the testing and vaccine research therapeutic research to try to meet the immediate need the second bill dealt with the economic needs as well and the medical needs and the third bill which was the most far-reaching is trying to give a lot of money a lot of our money but money necessary to stop the scourge not only of the health crisis but also the economic crisis the newest measure the cares Act which was signed into law on March 27th by President Drum aims to help workers and businesses through this crisis it includes and this was very important direct payments to Americans $1,200 per adult and 500 per child so if you're a family of four with a husband and wife that's 2,400 and another thousand it could be as much as $3,400 now in addition six hundred dollars extra each week for those unemployment insurance that's above and beyond what the state gives in an unemployment benefit billions in SBA loans very important to small businesses that want to stay afloat and be be there when we can get back to work one hundred billion dollars for hospitals senator schumer calls this a marshall plan for hospitals but clearly they are under great stress and this money is available to them to meet the needs of the patients and the community they're curbing when 17 billion dollars for veterans care alone it also includes funding to help ensure that the corona virus pandemic does not disrupt our elections in November as you may know we already have an election in Baltimore on April 28th in that election the governor as director will be done through mail so nobody has to go to a polling place to vote the goal is to make sure that while we put major parts of our economy on hold to help workers stay home and stay safe those who are furloughed are laid off can get back to work as soon as the crisis has passed to that end the house continues to stand ready to do whatever is necessary to help while this situation continues together we have to do everything possible to as I said flatten the curve and protect the vulnerable only when public health experts tell us it is safe to do so can we begin to reopen our economy tonight we're joined by the five guests who I just introduced to you who can answer your detailed questions about how we are fighting the corona virus and how the cares that can help people in Maryland's fifth District and the state of Maryland generally get by until our economy comes back fully again dr. Schar Steen mr. Harrison mr. Fulton Eddie mr. Doss mr. Umberger are ready to answer your questions so we'll go right to questions now Thank You congressman Hoyer for those of you just joining us if you'd like to ask congressman Hoyer or any of our guests a question please press star 3 now our first question comes from Rochelle in Bouie Rochelle you're on with congressman Hoyer hi thank you so much for clicking my question I am currently employed in a health care profession and I work for different jobs including two for the same employer that vary between w-2 $10.99 positions but the furloughs from all but one of these positions so I've lost about 80 percent of my income my question is what am I entitled to under the state of Maryland and the cares Act and what is the process to obtain that assistance and what if any documentation is required from our employers okay well let me turn that over to the people at SBA because that will be one of the you don't have a small business of your own so your relief is going to come both through direct payments and unenhanced unemployment insurance and in fact there's a provision that I think they'll talk about which if your employer keeps you on essentially if they're a small business they can get a loan and that entire loan can be waived that in other words they wouldn't have to pay it back if in fact they keep you on the payroll but let me let me look yield to either mr. Dawson mr. burger which one of you wants to take that question well I'll tear up and then I'm going to get in said well let me okay let me start and said yeah we can't see each other sorry this is Antonio das so the point that the congressman making it's making is a critical one what we're really trying to do with our loan program is incentivize the employers to keep people employed and through this Paycheck program that we have that is literally rolling out right now businesses can borrow money and actually get reimbursed for their payroll expense so essentially they almost will have no cost to keep you employed and that's our goal is to make sure everybody continues to stay employed to continue to stay in their job so that we don't lose any of the you know the economics of this and we're making these loans available there there's dollars that are available to help the businesses get exactly what they need to cover not only your payroll but your benefits of your out for you know for health insurance and even sickly even such like that are all covered under this particular program so that's one of the key features that we have right now that we're using to help small businesses and and even nonprofits be able to keep people employed the the program that he talked about in terms of trying to keep people employees go a papal payroll protection provision because what we think is the most advantageous is if a small business can keep their people employed now you may not be going to work because of the stay-at-home order but you would still be on the payroll if you have health insurance through your work presumably they would continue to pay for it out of the loan and then they could have the loan forgiven if they kept their employees on a payroll and that protection is for I think four months stop me if I'm wrong on that was three months in the Senate bill and we expanded it by a month so that would mean that they could keep you on the payroll for four months and at literally very little or no cost to them themselves next question again if you'd like to ask congressman Hoyer or any of our guests a question please press star 3 now our next question is from a bet in Bouie a bet you're on with congressman Hoyer oh and I like to thank you senator foria for all of you all the work you've done and all of the people who are working and to keep us all healthy and safe and said I'd like to find out what is the criteria that will be used or as to come off of self-isolation up doctor you want to speak to that the criteria and I say I want to ask dr. Sharfstein to do that because that is essentially I think going to be when the public health officials advise the governor and the president and all of us when it is safe and when we have in effect flatten that curve but dr. Shar stain you won't speak to that for um so I think part of the question might have been if somebody is personally isolating themselves so isolation is when people are sick if you're sick shouldn't be going to work you should be staying home staying away from other people to the extent possible putting something in front of your face like a mask or scarf if you're near other people and washing your hands quite a lot even if you don't know for sure you have corona virus so it's very important and the question was for how long and the answer to that generally you have to get completely better and then add three days and that whole period should be at least seven days so you've really completely better plus three days before you leave isolation now what if you've been exposed to someone who have the illness so you didn't get it yourself you're not sick but you've been exposed and you're worried and that's called quarantine and you really should be 14 days by yourself 14 days even if you don't feel bad because during those 14 days you could get sick and it really doesn't even matter if you do a test creme because the test could be negative that the virus could still be inside you waiting to come out so you gotta wait the whole 14 days so if you're sick its till you get better plus three days if you're not sick but you were exposed and it's it's really the whole the whole 14 days now the other question comes in Hawaii that you mentioned is well what about the isolation that we're all experiencing and all of the restrictions when do we get to end and boy I wish I knew the right that specific day to tell everyone but basically what's going to happen is if you think about what happened to us as we were living our life with you know the lights on and all of a sudden the lights went off and they had to stay in place it's going to be more of a dimmer switch to turn it back on first we've got to make it through this process of all these people getting sick and making sure we have enough hospital beds you can get through that process by everyone doing their part during their isolation and Quarantine then we'll have a chance to build back up some capacity in the healthcare system to strengthen our ability to respond to individual cases hopefully we'll have some treatments and as that happens we'll turn the dimmer switch and we'll start to get the ability to do more things over time and we're hopeful that that process might even start you know this spring but it's going to depend really on how well we do at this moment as we're facing such a big big challenge right now with the increased number of cases thank you doctor that I was thinking for the second part obviously the doctor Sharfstein spoke to and that is the fact that all of us are being isolated because this particular disease this particular virus is transmitted person-to-person largely by waterborne or when you sneeze or your call for something of that nature and it is easily transmitted from people to people that's why the six feet stay six feet away from from people which is tough to do but is necessary if we're going to flatten that curb and not have the virus continue to in effect be hosted by each of us because we're in close contact and we get it from the other person but hopefully as dr. Sharfstein said because of the the real pain and certainly inconvenience and economic consequences of this isolation strategy it is is very uncomfortable and hopefully we will get to a place where it will be safe to go out and about once again even then even at that point in time in that twilight area we will need to be much more careful than we were and wash our hands say hello to people not necessarily shake their hand or give them a hug so that we can again it's going to take all of us together to beat this thing okay next question Thank You congressman Hoyer again if you'd like to ask a question please press star 3 now our next question comes from Claude in Bouie Claude you're on with congressman Hoyer yeah I wanted to get some information if you've already been furloughed or had your hours cut what is the process to obtain the new benefits in the federal bill for scenarios like that you still go through the Maryland office or is there a separate process for the federal side for those benefits because right now it seems the Maryland office is pretty backed up with everything that's going on well I think in fairness all the officers are backed up and put in the IRS which is going to be sending out the checks that I mentioned which will be there not the unemployment side but everybody's going to be getting a check some hundreds of 70 million plus people the others being children and then we have to identify other people because everybody is going to be eligible for a check under a certain income and criteria $75,000 and under and then it's phased down from the $1,200 per adult to zero at ninety nine thousand dollars and you're not eligible if you are an individual making more than ninety nine thousand dollars for a couple making more than one hundred ninety eight thousand dollars so each and adult can get that now let me let me with that sort of preview let me yield again to Antonio or Steven to answer the specific question of how you going to access that and those dollars by the way that I mentioned they will be sent out without your having to make an application for that and the IRS is going to administer that and in the first inch and sixty million people about by about April 13th to the extent they've found their tax returns in 2018 and or 2019 and have that tax a direct deposit they'll get sixty million dollars excuse me sixty million people will get dollars through that but in terms of application for unemployment benefits let me yield to Antonio and Steven a congressman I'm Tyler if I could yield to Andrew or Michael on this one for the unemployment for piece of this okay yeah I'd be happy to this is Michael Harrison the Maryland Department of Labor Thank You Claude for that question and I think it kind of touches them something that Rochelle asked very first so the cares Act expands eligibility for unemployment to independent contractors sole proprietors people in the gig economy so you will be eligible for state provided benefits as well as the $600 a week payment from the federal government but for a maximum of 1030 the state benefits are on a scale based on your income if you are partially employed or have had your hours and salary reduced you are eligible for partial state benefits but full federal benefits of the $600 $600 is good for four months the state benefits is good for twenty six weeks plus the federal government extended benefits for thirteen weeks on top of the twenty six weeks so if your benefits have expired you may reapply and you will get an additional 13 weeks now I would urge you every one call to search Maryland Department of Labor for our homepage and there's a link for unemployment on that link there's information on how independent contractors can apply there's a text box you can enter your email address to receive updates when the system is ready to take applications for the expanded coverage there's frequently asked questions there's also phone numbers and email addresses you can contact with follow-up questions I'll leave it at that Michael let me ask you a question if I can uh I've had though the watermen here in Southern Maryland talked to me and of course a lot of them are independent some may be sole but independent operators and of course the restaurants and bars are shut down and that's eighty percent of their market and they're going to be eligible under this bill as I understand it and that's what I think we made sure that they were eligible can you comment on that independent yes employers I mean its sole proprietors exactly those independent contractors as Waterman those sole providers they are eligible for both the state benefits under the federal legislation and they expanded $600 a week payments from the federal government now we are waiting for guidance from the US and start issuing payments this is a federal program issue or implemented by the states and so we are waiting on us DOL to tell us what information that we need to collect from independent contractors how to verify wages and some other information we should have that in the next day or two so I think Michael I think that came down late this afternoon the information I have I'm not sure that but I think it came down late this afternoon so you ought to have it by tomorrow so that's great so we're working update okay her systems and take those applications as fast as we can well thank you for that okay co-op thank you and next question our next question is from Mabel in Fort Washington Mabel you're on with congressman Hoyer good afternoon harassment my question is I'm a senior other than Indus in my 70s and I have quarantined myself since March to 15th and I've only had to go out once and that was to get food my question is if I so happen to come down with the virus and I don't have a primary care doctor per se because I am a military dependent and so you when you go you see any doctor that's available I wanted to know if I needed to be tested what would I do or how would I go about that if I feel that I've come down with the symptoms well I'm going to yield to dr. Sharfstein to give an answer to that but let me tell you generally speaking even though you don't have a personal visit I don't know whether when you go to Andrews Air Force Base or Malcolm Gro hospital I don't I don't know where you get your medical treatment but even if they if you have a general practice where you don't have a particular position if you talk to that physician or one of the physicians in their practice and you give them the you know I've got a fever I've been running a fever of 102 hundred three and I've got chills and the flu-like symptoms they will advise you and they will authorize you to get tested but let me dr. Scharff saying let me yield to you I think it's a great question the first thing to do though if you're starting to feel sick to call that clinic call the clinic that you go to just like congressman Hoyer says they may tell you you don't need a test you're on your own it's safer for you just stay where you are and be in contact with them by phone or they may tell you we'd like to do it half but it but they'll talk it over with you if they tell you to do it out they'll give you the instructions on what to do some people who are sick but not that sick don't you know may not need a test if they're isolating themselves at home just like you're doing and let me just say you're doing exact the right thing to protect yourself and to protect others and you might be able even to get somebody to go get groceries and bring them to you that would be even better but you're doing exactly the right thing it's very unlikely you're going to get sick if you're by yourself like that at home and if you do get sick you should call the clinic to talk it over just one last thing I think it's really important if you're doing the right thing and living by yourself like that that you make the extra effort and other people that you know make an extra effort to connect to you by phone by other means like a video chat I think it's important for all of us to try to stay connected one of those most difficult things about the virus is that it forces people to be on their own and you know human beings we like to get up you know we like to talk and interact with each other and we have to fight what the virus is doing in part by being there for each other even if we can't be there physically there's able I think that's great advice I don't know whether you have grandchildren I have I have grandchildren and I have some great grandchildren and I was on the telephone for about half an hour with my granddaughter yesterday and you know you we can keep it the good news is we're live in an area there are era where we have great communication devices and we can keep in touch electronically virtual ways and I think that's good advice for your mental health and also for your safety so people I have my two daughters I have three daughters but two of my daughters have a conference call every day would be to make sure dad's okay so that's doctor sharps teens advice is very good advice okay next question again if you have a question for congressman Hoyer or any of our guests please press star three now our next question is from Melissa Melissa you're on the congressman Hoyer hello thank you for taking my call my first question is I have a daughter who's I'm pregnant and she's due in July and my concern is being around the newborn not knowing whether or not we have the kovat is there any way or any exceptions being made for or that that type of situation where people can get tested before they around the newborn not shortly um well in general and if you have no symptoms in your not take it's pretty low priority for testing given that there are so many sick people who need mainly testing just for their health right now but in general I totally understand why everybody wants to pick up and hug the newborn I'm a pediatrician Anna dad and I can understand how hard that can be um so you know I think it partly depends it's something probably to talk over with your doctor you know for example if you are in a job where you might be exposed like if you work in the healthcare system it might be a better idea you know not to do it for now as hard as that is because you know you might be exposed and it can be very hard even one test isn't enough because what about the next day what about the next day you really have to decide on the other hand if you're sheltering in place you're basically staying at home you've been at home by yourself for 14 days your risk is incredibly low for having this and your doctor may feel perfectly fine with with your picking up the baby but I think the best advice there was talk to your your daughter's doctor and get direct advice but I think doc Sharfstein is correct probably err on the safe side thanks Melissa and good luck to you uh your your your new grandchild coming in in July I understand next question our next question is from Sheila in Prince George's County Sheila you're on with Congressman where I thank you all for putting this conference together for everyone involved in all of you take care now prayers go out to our first responders my question is um concerning a nursing home I want to know I have relatives working in nursing home and of course I have family members that's in the nursing home and my question is the nursing home employees don't have math or gloves and so what is being done to safeguard them they are also on the front line and we don't know if any of them may be a symptomatic and they could give it to a elderly person if in the nursing home so what's being done to make sure all that is taken care of and what's the rules and regulations on that a charge team would keep picking on you know products are seen by the way was the commissioner of health for Baltimore City at one point in his career and also a Deputy Commissioner at the US FDA the Food and Drug Administration so a lot of experienced doctor for um so the issue of nursing homes is very serious because there have been a number of outbreaks in nursing homes and of course so many people who live there are very vulnerable to serious infection so it's very very serious situation there are a number of rules and recommendations for nursing homes you can actually you know download them yourself with the CDC's website but I'll give you some examples one of them is to have to really limit visitors the other is they have to make sure that their employees are not sick and those are two the third is they want to minimize the contact between people so there's no more bingo and there's no you know everyone gets together in the TV room for a party unfortunately then there are other things that nursing homes are doing which light which include assigning staff to particular floors so the staff don't work in more than one floor and also having people eat in their room and away from other people so they're trying to minimize the actual contact with people as much as possible having said all that a concern that you had is a serious concern and it's one of the reasons why we're all so worried about the general lack of protective equipment in the country for people because their if you say to me is it possible but somebody who is perfectly feels perfectly healthy might be caringly infection and pass it on to someone that is the possibility and that's why we're seeing in part so many outbreaks right now so the nursing homes have to try to do everything that they can like I mentioned before and all the other recommendations they also have to be ready to spot one infection if they spot it to immediately respond and figure out where it came from and things like testing really needs to be done to find where it might have come from and make sure that that is not posing a continued risk so we have been able to reduce the risk of infection in nursing homes but we have not been able to eliminate it and part of that has to do with the fact that many nursing homes do not have sufficient protective gear at the moment and revenue in that situation is very important Sheila let me say something about this protection that was dr. Scharff seen just mentioned the personal protection equipment gowns gloves face masks that not only keep the personnel in the nursing home safe but also keep the residents of the nursing home safe and we are doing everything possible and if you saw the press conference this morning we're making every effort to get as many face masks gloves aprons all sorts of gear available ventilators so that we will have the protection for our frontline workers which are the people who work in the doctors the nurses the attendants other personnel in the hospitals and health providers will have the protections for themselves but also will be that protecting the patients as well and we're making every effort to either get existing or have those made in very very large quantities millions of units so that there will be no provider in in the in the country ultimately and certainly in Maryland the governor is working very hard we're working very hard through the federal level to make sure we have the personal protection equipment that people need we're showing so much courage trying to keep their fellow citizens healthy and safe next question oh by the way before we go to the next question I have a website and if you if you got a pencil pretty simple but got a pencil or pen write this down it's my website my congressional website it has a lot of information that we've gotten from relevant agencies health care providers the SBA the IRS other agencies that will be interfacing with the public and I think you'll find it very helpful and you can probably find answers to almost all your questions and that is it for hie are obviously dot house just like a house gov to go to that I think you and we have a specific at the top you'll see coronavirus site and go to that site and then I think you can answer a lot of questions if you don't get them answered on the phone tonight you can get them there okay next question Thank You congressman Hoyer again if you have a question to ask congressman Hoyer or any of our guests please press star 3 now our next question is from Sandy in La Plata sandy you're on with congressman Hoyer okay thank you good evening everyone thank you congressman Hoyer we serve a large homeless population in Southern Maryland and I heard about the personal protection of supplies and I hope that we're not forgetting this population that we're serving these folks are for our frontline as well unfortunately we had to layoff 21 people during this time and I wanted to know if we're able to bring any of those folks back what is the time frame for any funding that be available to help us with payroll for those folks and is there a long wait time do we bring them on and then is there's this application process and a wait time before they we're able to pay them and I'm looking at cash flow standing obviously that's a very practical problem let me lay yield to who wants to take that question because obviously the question says how soon can I get a loan so when I hire people back even though I'm going to be brilliant burst for that loan but I need to get that loan as quickly as possible so I can get them back working um this is Steve Umberger out of Baltimore the district director for SBA and I think I'll take that one the paycheck protector a program and we just had the regulation right before this call posted guidance should be out very very soon this program is delivered through the banks in the state well throughout the country but in our state nearly every commercial lender there's a number of non-bank lenders certified development time just about every financial based institution in the state of Maryland has authority to do this Paycheck protection program loan excuse me so the process will be expedited although it's backed by SBA excuse me and the federal government a hundred percent which gives those lenders very very large incentive to make these deals that process time would be much like a normal commercial loan I can't say exactly how quickly they can get that money out there but it will be expedited and once we get the go-ahead it could be as soon as tomorrow and even before that you can visit your lender that you do business with now to talk about the program sandy I'm going to have somebody in my office contact you we've got your telephone number and get in touch with you so that we can help facilitate getting that done because not only is your work extraordinarily important and I know I know of your work as you know but it's also very important to your employees that we see if we can get them back on their feet okay we'll be in touch with you sandy will call tomorrow next question our next question is from Vanessa and uh from our girl Vanessa you're on your Carson lawyer good evening and thanks for this one and thanks for your leadership I am a small business entrepreneur I provide mental health services and my question is regarding a current small business loan that I have through a bank and the question is are there any provisions being made for deferring any loans that are made with small business small business owners at this time Stephen you want to take that or Antonio sure it's Antonia I can plan to take this one but so Vanessa the question you asked is a great one there's a lot of emphasis right now placed on our new loan programs but there are people like yourself who have already had loans you know maybe for a year or longer and you're still making payments on those you can go to your bank or your lender and let them know that you want to get a deferment on your loan and they'll be able to work with you to do so one of the really really significant things that has happened and I know it was in part because of some of the urging that the Maryland delegation has done all of the federal banking and financial institution regulatory agencies and unasyn sent out a communication to the financial sector the banks and such saying we need your help we need you to be flexible and making sure that anybody who needs relief from a payment can get it and so they've encouraged them to not only make these loan modifications and give you the ability to defer your payments for a period of months but they've also told those bags that they won't downgrade their loans for doing so which is normally what happens if something like that happens when the examiners come around so there's a strong emphasis on doing that for any bank if you're with the SBA or one of our our loans we're doing the same thing to if you've got a chance by chance an existing SBA disaster loan we're saying no payments for throughout the rest of the year likewise our disaster loans can be deferred up to six months I'm seeing our regular SBA loans can be deferred up to six months if you already have payments that you're making with an SBA loan for anybody else that has that situation so there's really a just a tremendous commitment by all parties at the federal state local level and really an unprecedented way to make relief available either through existing maneuvers with respect to something like deferring your payment or through some of the new loan programs that we have and we can certainly answer questions on those too uh Vanessa there's a realization there's a realization Vanessa that people like yourself and other small businesses and individuals are in great distress through no fault of their own the coronavirus is tak worldwide and disrupted people's lives worldwide and what we have done is trying to make sure that that disruption is as minimal as possible and that both the public sector and private sector show great flexibility in trying to make sure that people stay on their feet get on their feet and when this coronavirus threat diminishes or passes that we will be able to put people back to work and to the extent that we can keep mount of payroll right now and keep them keep the business stable right now we will have a greater ability to do just that so I think you'll find the financial institutions will work with you and if you need help give our office a call I'm going to give some numbers a little later on okay next question our next question is from Greg in Bowie Greg you're on with congressman Hoyer hi I'm trying to find out as the senior citizen who receives Social Security is it true that they'll automatically just be sending me for $1,200 that's true that's true now it when it immediately you've been immediate you understand that we have a couple hundred million people we're talking about in the country that's why this bill is so expensive but absolutely essential to keep everybody on their feet and frankly to put money into the economy and obviously there's going to be a lot of pent up demand after people can get out but immediately people need assistance as you saw there was a the unemployment applications this past week we're at six million people so the answer to your question is yes Greg you'll be getting a check I don't know what your income is but assuming your 75,000 and less you're going to be getting a check for twelve hundred bucks and if you have a wife who's also less and so you the two of you make less than 150 thousand you're going to give me getting to $2,400 so the answer is yes now I can't guarantee how quickly it's going to be but it will be as quickly as we can make it happen okay next question our next question is from John in Greenbelt John you're on with congressman white well congressman ladies and gentlemen are you thank you for taking my cool you better service well my question relates to the new policy change that came out with the public wearing mass now we all know our hospitals nurses doctors don't have enough alone and they're not getting them in the timely fashion if anybody's watching the news and sees that how do they expect the public to get all these masks you know they said you don't wear a bandana wear this wear that but you know a lot of people they're not going to do that and you're going to want you know they're going to be bidding to try and get masks is there any solution to that uh there is a solution and I can't tell you exactly how successful it's going to be but I do know that at the federal level as well as the state level the governor's that private sector health and public health sector health organizations are calling around to get fine items that they need gloves masks aprons gowns I guess is the proper term and we're trying to get for instance masks we made a specific provision in there so that the principle producer at that point in time of the most effective mask 3m could ramp up very very substantially we put money in for ramping up production and on the television today General Motors and Ford are both trying to retool so they can produce ventilators very critically important for the most critically ill so the solution is which we are pursuing is to ramp up production very very smartly and uh frankly a friend of mine is making masks she's a seamstress she likes to sew and she's making masks and she's going to give them to nursing homes and others I don't know how many she's going to be able to make but I think people are doing that all over the country but manufacturers are also ramping up very rapidly and hopefully we will have in the foreseeable future now whether that's two weeks or three weeks sufficient supplies so that we will not have shortages that may be optimistic but you know I know that the administration is working and we are working very hard to urge people for instance in st. Mary's County I have a business in st. Mary's County that's making a sanitizer and giving it to public institutions and the county government at no charge that they're donating those but they they had the capacity in their business to make it and they're doing so so the answer is we all have to work together but particularly the manufacturers who are perhaps producing something that if they turned into masks or rubber gloves or gowns that they could get that they could get those done in big numbers very quickly and that's what we need to do and that's what we're urging the administration and the private sector to do I talked to Bill Ford the president of Ford Motor Company about four days ago and he said that they were looking at using their manufacturing capacity to produce ventilators GM is doing the same so let's hope that we get to a place very quickly where we don't have any sort of a medical personnel who don't have the supplies they need to protect themselves and serve this public but others as well anybody want to comment on that dr. Schar scene do you want to yeah I just say that I heard that it is very important to know the difference between the medical grade math and kind of homemade or manufactured masks and the medical grade math both the n95 in the surgical mask really should be for health care workers that's really what people need if they're going to be in gate you know in contact with sick people particularly now other people can wear other kinds of things and it could be a mask could be a scarf it could be a bandana I think that the recommendation is coming out tonight is for people to improvise in public but and you know to the extent going back to the earlier question but there aren't medical grade masks for nursing homes and they'll also need to improvise for that for the time being but our hope is that first so so the fear that people might use medical maps and take them away we've got to just constantly be saying that's not a good thing that for the public and outside it should be non medical grade things and and I think when businesses are making masks out of fabric really quickly those are good for the public to be wearing if they're interested but they're not to the hospital we got to save the real ones for the hospital I agree with that on a percent we really do it now and later thank the nurses and the doctors and the attendants and the administrative personalities hospitals and medical facilities who are obviously very very stressed because of the risk they're under and they see their colleagues getting sick so we need to thank them they are real heroes as well as our police and fire and emergency medical response teams who are showing real courage I frankly I go to the grocery store I've been the grocery store twice in the last 15 days and every day I go in there and I stay away from people but boy I will tell you I think the folks who are working in that grocery store or keeping me fed and and you know some of them wear a mask some are not but in any event we need to thank all these personnel who are really making a difference as we fight this scourge okay next question our next question is from Maurice in Prince George's County Maurice you're on with congressman Hoyer hey don't congressman into the other gentleman defense call now my concern is I'll one is my brother he has an issue where he I was laid off in DC we getting partial of his I of his check he wanted to know under the stimulus program well he get the difference to make up for the 600 you know for thought for the week whatever he whatever he's getting he's going to get an additional six hundred so now let me that's the general answer but let me ask one of the small business folks to address that or Michael it perhaps you want to address it yes sure this is Michael Harrison Department later thank you and thank you Maurice I believe you said wages were earned and BC I'm not sure but first you have to file for unemployment benefits where you worked not where you live and when you file you will be eligible for the $600 a week for four months and when you apply it will be back dated to the date of separation and you'll also be eligible for state benefits for the thirty nine weeks or as long as you are unemployed it's a very generous benefit Maurice and the reason it is we want to have people have money in their pockets that they would not be falling through the slats through no fault of their own we understand and the governor governor Hogan understands the president understands as members of Congress understand that we are asking people to in effect put their lives on hold in some respects and we're trying to give them a some sort of financial help while they're doing that and not only do we want to give individuals help but obviously we want to give businesses help as well and talk to be a large medium and small we're talking about a lot of small businesses now but there's a substantial money in there for large businesses who hire of course a lot of people thousands of people and we want to make sure that those jobs do not go away that companies don't disappear which is possible and so we're giving them financial help to get through this phase so that jobs are available for people when as I say a safer environment prevails and we can get out and about and do our do our work ok next question Thank You congressman Hoyer we actually reached

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in strong support of HR 4329 the native american housing assistance and self-determination act of 2014 which passed on tuesday out of the house of representatives visiting the nine tribes in the district I represent I've seen the significant challenges the tribal communities face in providing decent and affordable housing to their members so I know how important this bill is one issue that I've worked on very closest closely regards the needs of tribal veterans who disproportionately suffer from homelessness last year I met a man in my district who served this nation in uniform but was sleeping in his car we can do better what last year I joined with representative Cole to introduce the housing native heroes Act which would expand new authorities and flexibilities to a program called the HUD Vash program which better addresses tribal veterans homelessness I am thankful to representative Pearce and his colleagues for working to include strong provisions in this bill to tackle homelessness among our tribal veterans I look forward to continuing to work to address the needs of our tribal veterans and I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this bill thank you very much mr. speaker

let's dive right into both these issues with house intelligence committee chairman and january 6 committee member democratic congressman adam schiff congressman thank you for being with us let's start with worries of potential war breaking out with russia the full house will get a classified briefing on ukraine on thursday what's the top question you want answered well i've had a several briefings already this week and obviously we're watching this very closely to figure out what putin's next move is and if there's anything that we can do to raise the deterrence against a russian invasion and i think the bible administration has done everything conceivable rallied our allies around a really tough set of sanctions tougher than we've ever exacted on a country like russia we have worked with the british i think to front some of what we know about their efforts to create a pretext for invasion about their efforts to create a puppet government in ukraine we have made it clear to putin we're going to move nato assets closer to russia not further away if they go through with this so it will defeat his objective uh and i think in every way that we can the administration and now the congress is working to try to deter putin now he still may not be deterred but we're doing everything possible so right now do you think russia will invade and has anything changed your assessment one way or the other in recent days uh you know i've been skeptical from the very beginning about whether anything we could do would stop putin from invading uh if that's his intention and i think it's very possible that is exactly what he intends to do and nothing will stop him but we can raise the costs if it comes to that and obviously working on that too to provide weapons to ukraine defensive weapons where they can make it long and painful if russia tries to occupy further portions of ukraine and so we're doing what we can i i've been skeptical of putin's intentions all along uh i think he feels that his last invasion of ukraine did not have its intended effect it really drove ukraine more into the west and he may feel now he's just got to militarily take over the whole country to prevent it uh from growing closer to the united states of the west in terms of potential leverage putin could have we know russia supplies a lot of energy to parts of europe and the polish prime minister brought up the controversial nordstrom 2 gas pipeline project today saying that it's a threat to peace in europe and he called it a quote gun in the hands of mr putin with which he can blackmail the european union do you agree i do agree that's always been a concern i've had about that pipeline which is the more you allow europe to become dependent on russia uh the more you make that easy the more for example uh he can cut off ukraine uh through which that fuel would otherwise flow um then uh you're strengthening his position geopolitically uh and strategically uh so what should be our allies well look i'm i'm glad to see that uh there's strong sentiment in europe including uh i i would expect in germany that if russia invades that's the end of that pipeline uh it's gone for good um and that's the way it should be uh so i think that is one of the more powerful deterrents that we in europe have but it's got to be crystal clear to the russians that if do invade they can kiss that goodbye and not just temporarily but for good bottom line help our viewers understand why this matters so much here at home if russia takes over ukraine what does that mean for the u.s well what that means for the u.s is that nations can remake their borders like during world war ii by dent of military force and today it may be ukraine and maybe tomorrow russia decides to invade a nato ally and then we have an article 3 requirement to go to their defense but also other nations are watching china is watching with an eye towards the possible invasion of taiwan so this is inherently destabilizing and could lead to a broader conflict but it also undermines democracy and and we as as a champion of democracy around the world we've got obviously our own problems here at home but we obligation uh to live up to that legacy and come to the aid and support of our democratic allies like ukraine so let's talk about the threat to democracy here at home uh specifically your investigation being part of the january 6th committee at the top of the show we mentioned former pence chief of staff mark short just testified with the committee can you broadly tell us what was covered and if he provided you with any new leads you know i can't confirm uh witness testimony it's up to the witnesses if they want to confirm that um but i can't say that we've gotten a tremendous amount of cooperation uh from people uh you know throughout the states uh throughout the former administration uh in all over 400 people that we've been able to interview and tens of thousands of documents so we're getting a lot of cooperation we're filling in a lot of the pieces and you know the puzzle as we fill it in shows multiple multiple lines of effort to overturn the election it wasn't just a violent attack as heinous as that was in january 6th but uh the potential of seizing voting machines of sending fake slates of electors to the archives of trying to get the justice department to discourage states from sending any slate of electors and delay the process so there were multiple lines of effort all of which were investigating and and we're getting a lot of cooperation so given all that cooperation you've received all the information you already have do you need testimony from mike pence himself uh you know i think mike pence uh would have a very relevant testimony for our committee things that he may alone be privy to or alone among those who would be willing to testify any conversations that he had with people in an effort to coerce him to overturn the election to ignore his constitutional duty that pressure campaign on him and other issues that he may be aware of so i think he's a very pertinent witness i think he could have a lot of insights to share with us i hope as our chairman has said that he will decide voluntarily to come in but i'll have to leave it there has he been asked voluntarily to come in i don't know whether the formal request has been made i know our chairman has publicly invited him to satisfy or express his interest in the vice president testifying but i don't know if that has been memorialized in writing at this point what are you waiting for uh well it'll be a decision for the committee when the time is right we are trying to sequence our interviews so that we uh you know before we get to central figures like mike pence we interview all those around that person who may have relevant information so that we can inform the questions we ask of those other witnesses it's a pretty standard investigative practice and one i think we've been using very successfully and you would know it well as a former federal prosecutor yourself let's move to these draft orders to seize voting machines as we've reported one plan would have used the pentagon the other homeland security and the new york times reports that then president trump actually directed rudy giuliani to put out feelers with homeland security about potentially seizing voting machines from some some key swing states can you confirm this do you have information showing a direct line to trump on this um our committee is not confirming uh the public reporting so i can't confirm it at this point but i can say that if the public reporting is accurate um this wasn't just some intangible idea it appears that there were some concrete steps being taken or instructions being given by the former president to potentially operationalize this and you know that really ought to take our breath away the idea of a u.s president who contemplating when they lose an election contemplating seizing the voting machines using the machinery the federal government to see state voting machines and local voting machines uh you know it's third world uh kind of stuff not what you'd expect in the united states of america of an established democracy and so it's pretty startling uh if these public reports are accurate and quickly i do want to get your comments and thoughts on this reporting that we have and been confirmed by the national archives that some of trump's white house documents were ripped up and had to be taped back together by the national archives and these were documents handed over to your committee after you know the judicial process uh said he could not exert executive privilege over these what were these torn up documents uh you know i i unfortunately can't comment on that um there there has been public reporting of the president having a practice of tearing things up um but whether that's the case here i'm not able to confirm but you know we are getting hundreds of records from the archives uh they're coming to us from the archives in whatever form the archives have them and uh and of course we are scrutinizing them carefully and expect to get a lot more over time from the national archives as well and i know that eventually you're going to make some of these findings if not all of them public through public hearings and other presentations how soon until there's that first or next public hearing uh you know i think fairly soon i i i think the chairman has said in the spring we intend to begin those public hearings so that's not too far away we want to sequence them in a way that makes sense for the public watching so that they can see the the whole narrative of these multiple lines of effort to overturn the election uh when they began and where they began and who was involved so we're trying to make sure that we do the investigative work first so that anything we disclose in the public hearings doesn't impede some of the other investigative work that's still ongoing sure i i understand that obviously there is a timeline here though with the midterm elections also around the corner congressman adam schiff really appreciate all of your time thank you very much thank

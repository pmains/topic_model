thank you mr crow you know i've heard from many employers in my district um that not only are they having difficulty finding uh workers but they're having finding the workers for the right positions and right workers for the right job and i think mr diria you also listed that in your testimony as one of the top issues you and your colleagues have been hearing from small businesses as you conducted many roundtable discussions so for the entire panel would you be able to elaborate how we can increase worker skills and transition workers to new skills sure um you're quite right there is a lot of attention paid and rightly so to access to capital but access to to appropriately skilled talent is is just as important for start if you can't turn your idea you can't turn your your dream into a successful business without the staff the employees that have the uh skills that you need and we hear that at virtually every round table that we do we as i said we we have the jobs we need to fill them to survive we can't find enough folks that have the skills that we need that is really an indictment of the u.s education system we're simply not producing enough people that have the skills that 21st century businesses need including new and small businesses um the bull's-eye of that if you will is stem science technology engineering and mathematics there's been a great deal of discussion about how do we address that certainly uh it's a very complex question that has a complex answer uh but certainly uh i'm i i'm of the view and i mean we hear this from startups that that a great underused asset in this country is the nation's community college system there are 1200 community colleges across the country they are typically the first experience of higher education for immigrants for example they're great sources for people to be able to upskill to get stackable credentials to lifelong learning so among the uh the many things that that can be done to fix that problem i think leveraging the community college system is critical also we need a more active conversation between the business community in this country and educators so that uh so that uh businesses can tell educators uh you know hear the skills that we need and if you're willing to um amend your criteria your curriculum to teach those skills we'll hire those people there's not enough communication in our view going on between the business community and the education community thanks for mentioning that that's why i introduced the innovations in informer stem learning act and hopefully that will prepare our next generation of workers for the right jobs so i want to thank you for mentioning that and i do want to pose the next question to all panel small businesses create a majority of the net new jobs but they're facing increasing cost inflation price pressures taxes so i think you will all agree that these pressures keeping they are keeping them from expanding and adding jobs so i would like to ask the panel what price pressures would you like to see eliminated mr dr luck larocque you want to start thank you ranking member kim you know i one factor i'd point to is just the proliferation of regulation and the impact that that can have on startup entrepreneurs in particular at nifty we work with many many graduates of our program who try to launch and sustain actual businesses and more than taxes more than other other policy issues the regulatory burden that they face and and the administrative burden is something that comes up a lot for our learners in particular because these uh many of our alumni are are are really trying to go it on their own as many uh entrepreneurs do if i could just double back in on your previous question i'd like to underscore a couple of the points that mr deary made in response to your question a a real opportunity for our education system is to do much more to expose young learners to the types of jobs and careers that exist that's why the efforts of national philanthropies like american student assistance are so important and why we get a lot of traction at nifty with career and technical education leaders because they understand that you just don't you don't have to be a welder or an electrician or an auto repair technician you can have an auto repair shop you can have an electrician business and so we find homes in those types of schools where educators are making the connection between entrepreneurship the broader economy and personal self-fulfillment in the doing of one's job lastly and briefly i'd also like to underscore the particular opportunity now to help community colleges fully embrace entrepreneurship education in the way that we see four-year public and mostly private higher education doing the gaps that exist between community college entrepreneurship opportunities and what we see in other parts of higher ed sustain some of the inequities that we see in the system

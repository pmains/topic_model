one of the most important midterm election races is going to happen in Louisiana this November you got incumbent senator Mary Landrieu Democrat versus current congressman Bill Cassidy Republican Landrieu's one of the few Democrats to come out in support of the Keystone pipeline she's actually got a bill out today in favor of building that pipeline councilman Cassidy joins us now senator I'm I'm trying to figure out your angle here your line of approach I presume you're going right after Obama in terms of know the Keystone XL are you talking about my election Stuart yes terms of the Keystone issue no your strategy what one issue you've got to go after senator Landrieu on what's your key issue what you talk about is what the people wish to discuss and what they wish to discuss this first the president's health care law which frankly has been a very very problematic for most people back home and then secondly they are concerned that the Senate has become a rubber stamp for President Obama yet Harry Reid favors something that's what happens and Harry Reid favors senator Obama's shimmy President Obama's agenda senator Landrieu supports that folks are very frustrated with that are you running a get directly against a senator harry reid iet you're including him very strongly in your campaign i take it i am running to change the direction of our country it is thought that Louisiana will be the seat that determines which party controls the US Senate if senator Landrieu is re-elected they'll be 50 Republicans 50 Democrats Joe Biden cast the deciding vote it continues to be a rubber stamp for the president if Bill Cassidy wins they'll be 51 Republicans 49 Democrats that people of Louisiana have cast the deciding vote and the country begins to return to the center okay that's what I'm running on I want to ask you about one specific bill it would have authorized the export of liquefied natural gas I know it went through the house I know that it's going to sink in the Senate I want to know why the United States of America cannot export its abundant natural gasps so that we have real leverage over the Russians why what we do it congressman several reasons i assume on the left they assume that if you increase markets for fossil fuel that you're going to somehow contribute to climate change ignoring that as we've increased our use of natural gas the carbon footprint has fallen but it's also an insensitivity to working families you spoke three markets can rescue even this left wing president the driver of middle-class employment over the last six years has been oil and gas there are wells being shuttered because industry does not want the dry gas produced say in North Louisiana which would be open creating jobs at the wellhead all the way downstream if we were to approve that expedited construction of LNG export terminals this is a jobs bill is a national security bill it is an economic prosperity bill but the left wishes to discouragement for all the reasons we just discussed but I i gotta tell you sir I'm astonished the power of the left because it seems so obvious that we should go and get the natural energy resources which are ours under our turf readily available for us to exploit and astonished that a relatively small number of people should stymie the development of such riches which would enrich America I so I can't explain it I really cannot explain it can you and no i cannot stewart but when you say in rich america you actually mean enriching american families my family moved to Baton Rouge in 1958 my dad role in between jobs went down there to serve those who are working in the petrochemical plants my dad who never went to college has a son who's running for the Senate this is the power of those jobs to create a better prosperity the left does not care they want their paradigm imposed upon the rest of us and the consequences to the family be damned and that is too bad Collison thank you very much indeed for taking time out of what I know is a very busy day we appreciate you being with us up come again soon okay

the gentleman from New York is recognized for two minutes I thank the gentleman for yielding Mr Speaker I rise in opposition to this rule for a number of reasons because it doesn't make a proper AUMF AUMF in order because it fails to make an order an amendment I co-sponsored along with representative dent and Smith and several others the bill contains language adopted by the Armed Services Committee at one o'clock in the morning the other day with no warning that would effectively overturn President Obama's executive order protecting LGBT workers for companies with private contracts in other words private contractors using our federal tax dollars in any area not just in a defense area by the way will be allowed to fire someone just because they are gay lesbian bisexual or transgender this is unacceptable it is cruel and that is totally unnecessary no I the distinguished gentleman said that the language contains nothing referring to gay or lesbian people it simply protects religious liberty it says that private contractors in the exercise of their religious liberty may discriminate it disallows the president's executive order and so the effect is that private contractors may discriminate on the basis of algae of sexual identity or gender if that is their religious belief we used to have no one has said in four years in this what they used to know that it's okay to say my religious beliefs says I shouldn't hire a black person or a Jewish person we don't think that's acceptable and we don't call that religious liberty but we now call religious liberty the ability of a private contractor to fire someone who refused to hire them just because they're gay or lesbian that is cruel unacceptable why not allow the house to vote on whether or not to include this type of hateful language in the defense bill why not allow a vote on the den Smith amendment must we let this bigotry and intolerance win the day we ought to defeat this rule and I for one will not vote for the entire bill if this language is included in it we must strip this toxic hateful measure from the NDAA if not through an amendment then in conference we ought to ensure that no federal contractor has the ability to fire someone just because of who they are or who they love and because they profess that there is there religious belief that does so they cannot be allowed to impose their religious beliefs on hiring and firing other people we must continue to fight until tom is inspired have the rights they deserve the most obvious are gentlemen

joining me now a democratic congressman from connecticut jim hines whose district borders newtown representative hines thanks for joining me on this very somber day and i'm curious about the community how's it doing a year later well it's obviously an extraordinarily somber day for those of us well for the country of course but for those of us who are particularly close to newtown as we think about the families reliving what happened though and of course the town of newtown this this year sort of making a plea to be left alone to grieve privately uh and all of us to reflect on the progress that has or has not been made against reducing the amount of gun violence in this country and of course the uh while connecticut new york and a number of other states have you know put forward packages of gun safety measures uh where i work at the federal level uh the united states congress uh failure to really do anything at all it's a you combine all that it's a pretty somber day up here yeah what kind of options do you have left for any federal gun reform well you know i remind um uh people and and of course people close to newtown that uh this is not a uh problem that changes quickly that there's a national conversation to be had so that people come to understand that most americans respect second amendment rights but there are common sensical things that we want to do like make sure that you know everybody who exercises those rights gets a background check to make sure they're not violent criminal or a terrorist we have a very overheated dialogue right now fomented frankly by groups like the nra that make this a lot more of a polarized debate than it needs to be but you know what in the end we prevail it happened in the uh in the 80s it took years for the brady bill to pass which protected a lot of americans and and one of the amazing things is that the newtown families themselves they understand those you know poor people who should be uh most angered at our society's collective failure to act here actually understand that they need to sort of participate in an effort of steady application yeah but you and i both remember what it was like in the immediate wake of the shooting if newtown and the sense of grief and urgency that followed did not force gun control reforms will anything well it will eventually and remember it's not today of course is a particularly somber anniversary here in connecticut um but you know it's every week or every two weeks you know that there's a tucson it was yesterday right in colorado just yesterday in centennial just yesterday i mean it's just this it's a steady drip grip of violence that over time as people like the families of the newtown victims get out there and continue stories my my good friend and colleague senator murphy who every monday on the floor of the senate reads the names of victims of gun violence that week you know great change and positive change in our society very rarely happens overnight and unfortunately this the time that passes now means more innocent people uh dying but it will prevail we will eventually in this country get a much more sensible regime of gun safety measures and frankly better ways of of identifying those who say mental health is a part of the issue they're exactly right you read about adam lanza and his situation you just say to yourself this was a kid who desperately desperately needed help and did not get it so what about reforms for mental health services where does that stand because these two issues really are inextricably intertwined uh they are and i i guess i'd say two things about that you know the affordable care act which is so much in the news the last three months one of the important things that it does of course is promote and require what they call mental health parity meaning if you have an insurance plan the uh mental health services that are available to you for mental illnesses have to be of a quality of the available uh services that are there for you for physical illnesses and i think that's an important step forward and of course you know there's there's something here that we i think it doesn't have anything to do with legislation or with hospitals or with insurance which is how we behave as parents and community leaders you know each and every one of us knows a kid who is alienated who is isolated who maybe doesn't have friends and whatnot and of course some tiny minority of those kids are ever going to do what adam lanza did but it's probably incumbent on us to reach out to do a better job as community leaders as communities as a whole to reach out to those people who are alienated and having trouble and try somehow to welcome them uh into our communities yeah uh representative heinz quickly for uh you guys do you want to ask about the budget that you voted for in favor of this week um critics say this does not address the real causes of the deficit is the real virtue of this buzzer just that avoids a government shutdown and more sequestration and gives us two years well the critics are right let's start with the good news first the good news of course is that you had a strong bipartisan vote you know in excess of 330 republicans and who came together to vote for a budget deal and things don't get more controversial in the united states house of representatives and budgets you had strong bipartisan support a little more trouble in the senate but it's going to get done so here without a deadline without a government shutdown without threat to the debt ceiling we actually for the first time in many years got a two-year budget done and that's a good thing the budget itself uh you know nothing to celebrate uh it does not deal with the fundamental long-term issues uh that we face particularly in our programs like medicare and social security which you know ultimately do need to be in a fair and equitable way put on a more sustainable path than they are um there's a you know and and problems in the tax code there were all kinds of issues that we did not address in this uh in this budget but you know as the saying goes you gotta you gotta crawl before you can walk and this is of course a much better place than we were three months ago well at least january 15th will come and go with the government employees still on the payroll representative jim heims good to talk with you thanks so much thank you as the snow falls here in new york

Mr Speaker I rise today to recognize this Friday as the 10th annual national clinicians hiv/aids testing and awareness day it is a harsh reality that hiv/aids touches every community across this country although we've made great progress in treating the disease it is imperative to continue striving for prevention effective treatments and a cure this particularly is important in my home state of New Jersey in 2013 alone over 2,000 adults and adolescents were diagnosed with HIV making New Jersey the sixth highest in the country of new diagnosis in in ages 13 to 24 diagnosis have increased from 10 to 18 percent and in the african-american community rates are above the national average we must remain vigilant to combat this epidemic that continues to play communities across our nation especially in light of the continued efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and remove insurance protections from millions we must be vocal against all efforts to take away the ability to receive adequate care and do our part to fight HIV a gentleman's time has expired I encourage your loved ones to get tested and I yield back

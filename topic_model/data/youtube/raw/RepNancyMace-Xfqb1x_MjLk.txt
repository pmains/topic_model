let's bring in congresswoman nancy mace republican from the great state of south carolina look i know you think that raising taxes is a bad idea i got it but how do you stop it i mean we've got one tax increase proposal after another and everybody says oh please don't do that but you never tell me if you can stop it i don't think you can well when you hear the the biden administration trying to sell a product that the americans don't want to buy because they are using those fancy buzzwords like tax the rich and letting corporations pay their fair share when we read the fine print and i encourage everyone to do so when this corporate tax hike comes through i guarantee you my bet is that it'll be higher than 35 at the end of the day when you actually read what's going to happen now a couple of things when we did budget reconciliation with the quote-unquote two trillion dollar covet relief plan which it wasn't coveted relief at all we did it through budget reconciliation which should be normally precedent be a process to reduce spending not add to it so what we've got to do is make sure that any revenue bill comes through congress via regular order so that in the senate you have to have 60 votes to actually pass it but my fear is they're going to try to do this through budget reconciliation you'll see every republican fighting against it but we won't have as many democrats obviously on our side this is very partisan but if they get rid of the filibuster you're going to get the tax increases it'll be devastating and what's going to happen well you'll have fewer companies creating fewer jobs at lower wages this is going to hurt hard-working americans and i can't think of a worse idea than in the middle of a pandemic than to raise taxes because we're all going to have to pay that bill oh look believe me concern i agree 100 i'm going to change the subject because we just had a very interesting guest on the program you may have heard him steve hilton i know that you are a full-time working single mom and i know that you're trying to create i think you have created the single parents caucus in congress good for you that's great i don't know whether you heard our last guest but he was saying look we should ban smartphones for youngsters under the age of 16. as someone who's just started the single parent caucus what do you think about that well i can tell you as a single working mom of two children who have seen the devastating effects of being home from school for a for a year now i can tell you screens are a huge problem of course as someone you know i believe that parents you know should and be able to make that decision for themselves and their families some kids take to virtual learning just fine and for others it's having a devastating impact and i see it every single day the struggle is real and i feel that pain you really want kids to get back to in personal learning in the classroom right yes and the science and the cdc and everyone tells us with safety with health and safety precautions in place kids can learn and be safe from covid19 you know you look at the statistics a number of kids who are dropping out of school the number of kids who are failing the number of kids who've threatened to harm themselves nationally this is devastating our communities and we talk about trying to lift people out of poverty you hear that a lot from democrats well keeping them in schools isn't helping and we have open borders in closed schools we have open borders of migrants sitting at the border and now we have an administration who wants to raise taxes on the american people this isn't putting america or its children first how many people have you got in the in the single parent caucus and are they from both sides of the aisle we just announced it yesterday it's a caucus that's never been formed before there are republicans and democrats on both sides who are also single parents that we're inviting to be the executive board members for that caucus i would like it to be a bipartisan brainstorming effort where we can meet and talk about these issues from screen time to getting our kids back in schools to to tax credits for working families what can we do to help families who are really suffering right now congresswoman thank you very much for joining us and the very best of luck with that new caucus we appreciate you thanks very much thank you

good morning welcome back nearly 8 million texans have voted early the most in the country in a state historically known for low turnout so what is driving the lone star state to the polls joining us now with his answer congressman lance gooden congressman what is the answer why is this happening well i think we can all agree that both sides are very enthusiastic about this election republicans are turning out like never before but democrats are as well i hear democratic leaders celebrating these huge turnout numbers in the urban areas but they fail to recognize that in the conservative more rural areas we've got record turnout as well so i think if everything is the same with the exception of high turnout on both sides then texas stays republican and i also think the people seem to overlook something that few people know which is that during early voting in urban areas there's never more than one or two mile distance for someone to drive to an early voting location however you go out into the more rural counties in texas many of which are in my district sometimes it's a 20 or 30 20 or 30 minute drive to vote so people vote on election day more so in these conservative counties i think republicans will win big on election day and early voting now you know obviously we take the polls for what they are they are something that is happening right now they're obviously going to change even in the next couple days they're likely to change but let's take a look at this one and this is the presidential preference in texas right now this is a new york times siena college research institute poll and as you can see it is close is it concerning that at this point texas is this close in the polls i don't think so because every two years there is some close poll and i hear this all the time texas is going blue texas we heard this during the beetho ted cruz race and it was closer than we would have liked there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm but we're just seeing such high turnout numbers in these rural areas that are keeping up with these urban areas i think everything will be awash and texas stays red at the end of the day meantime congressman texas preparing to send in 1 000 troops d.c as well beginning to board up its stores ahead of the election how worried are you about election violence and unrest well i'm worried about post-election virus because i believe president trump's going to win and the far left and all the crazies that were out looting and destroying businesses are going to come back and you can look at new york the new york police department has ordered or suggested rather midtown businesses to start boarding up and bringing in furniture and locking up their belongings that are valuable on election day or by election day and so the governor i think is just in preparation cautious mode but i think it says a lot that dc and new york and some of these areas are encouraging businesses to prepare for violence that tells me that they think the president's likely to win i can tell you republicans and conservatives we don't go out and bang bang up storefronts we don't break glass and we don't protest and go crazy on election night when we lose which tells me the other side and we all know that they know that as well the other side is preparing for the far left and antifa and all these rioters that we had earlier in the year to come back out in full force when donald trump's re-elected president all right representative lance gooden congressman lance gooden thank you for joining us appreciate your time the

joining us now house select committee member and house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff democrat of california author of midnight in washington how we almost lost our democracy and still could congressman schiff what does it say to you that these republican members of congress that we just heard from are basically saying it's okay to ignore a congressional subpoena even if you don't think steve bannon did anything even if you don't think this whole thing should go forward this is a lawful congressional subpoena they are members of congress for them to not even back up congressional power is extraordinary it is extraordinary and it really defies the expectation of the founders that members of the congressional branch would defend their own institution that ambition could be made to check ambition but here they're willing to sacrifice the congress they're willing to sacrifice our system of checks and balances in the service of this unethical former president uh and it is you know it is really quite shocking uh when you listen to steve scalise they're number two the gop number two member of the house uh just a week couldn't admit that the election wasn't stolen no wonder he doesn't want uh the contempt to go forward uh he you know he feels as evidently the republican leadership does it's more important to support the cult of donald trump than it is to defend their own democracy um and and it's this abdication of their oath of office that has our democracy on such fragile ground it's i mean i just i'm just struck by his use of the term witch hunt you know it's just kind of pathetic that he has to kind of even use the language of the former president i guess in the hopes that he'll get an attaboy from the president maybe he'll get a you know the holy grail an actual call or you know a special message from the president the former president saying you know great uh it's it's just kind of pathetic i mean after the full house vote tomorrow it'll almost certainly get referred to the justice department what do you think attorney general garland is going to do i think he will present it to the grand jury as the statute says he has a duty to do so and i think all the signs have been very positive the justice department has made available top former justice department officials without asserting any kind of privilege they have made accessible records from the national archives belonging to the prior administration without any assertion of executive privilege the president himself i think made it very clear that those who violate the law should be prosecuted uh and i in my view this will be an early test of our democracy is it recovering is it is it still true in america that no one is above the law because if that is true you know anderson that if any one of my constituents back in california were to ignore a subpoena and simply failed to appear there would be an arrest warrant for them very very soon thereafter select committee vice chair liz channel said last night a quote based on the committee's investigation it appears that mr bannon has substantial advance knowledge of the plans for january 6 and likely had an important role in formulating those plans end quote i mean aside from what bannon said on his podcast the day before the insurrection which you know i guess you could interpret it as all hell is going to break loose you know people are going to be really upset they're going to you know just be upset uh and ignoring what's in the bob woodward and robert costa book peril about bannon being at the willard hotel on january 5th with other trump allies including giuliani and a war room type meeting does your committee have more information beyond that on bennett you know i can't comment on on what we have that's not a matter of public record um but i think certainly someone that was as close to the president is as close to the president as steve bannon uh who was organizing uh in the willard hotel efforts to persuade lawmakers to decertify the election and overturn the results uh and who made those comments which on their surface seem to predict exactly what happened the fact that he was telling people also i think on that radio show or podcast that if they felt that they had missed out on the american revolution here was an opportunity for them to participate in one if there's an innocent explanation then he should step forward and give it the fact though that he is fighting this uh that the former president is fighting this uh i think speaks to his consciousness of guilt so congressman jim jordan says that he can't recall how many times he spoke with the former president on january 6. he's been kind of all over the map on that one does the committee want to talk to congressman jordan well i'm not in a position to announce uh future witnesses but i can tell you this on a very non-partisan basis i think every member of our committee is determined to go wherever the evidence lies uh to members of congress to the the former white house anywhere we need to fill out the public record and expose all of the events that led to january 6th our whole goal is to write a set of recommendations to protect the country going forward and if jordan has information or anybody else we won't shy away merely because they're members of congress just lastly you said the the big black box and all this is what the president's role was you've also echoed chairman thompson's comments that no one is off the table for a subpoena at what point would you subpoena the former president himself you know i think before you take a step like that you want to gather as much information and evidence as you can because you're going to get one crack at it and so i think we have a lot of work to do before we make the decision about whether we take that step uh and certainly before we would take that step so i still consider us you know frankly although we're moving with incredible speed to be early in the investigation and i would want to know what documents we would present to a key witness what other testimony we would be aware of before we question the key witness so i i don't see that happening until later in the investigation if the chairman would make the decision to go there adam schiff appreciate your time thank

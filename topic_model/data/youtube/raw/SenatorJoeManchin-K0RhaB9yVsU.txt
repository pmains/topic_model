thank you mr chairman and thank you all thank you all for your service i appreciate very much a couple questions i want to ask basically the russian-china relationship has china kind of stand back right now watching what's going on have they not involved are they backfilling russia at all giving russia the security they need or give them the firepower they need for the backup right now either one both of you real quick we're trying to do that okay who's got it okay well i'll jump in the answer you know clear the statement that was made before the olympics demonstrated um a commitment to back russia okay um i think china would have preferred the the russian invasion of ukraine uh to be more successful now they they are seem to be like uh deer in headlights trying to figure out how they save face from backing russia in the way they have done but the more strategic support is clearly going to be on how russia handles these sanctions i think everybody expects china to bail them out in terms of um paying for the energy china china's china is to be expected to backfill russia if need be no doubt they're going to help them economically ma'am if you want to i have another one to go to if you want yeah i mean i think the biggest shift we saw was actually for the first time russian forces were moved off the chinese border to flow into you know and support the ukrainian uh war that's a big big strategic decision for russia to do so i think that symbolizes that this has durability i i think we have to be also very clear that the chinese are not going to fully bail out russia they will strategically decide at very low cost what they can get out of this this is what we've seen in decade-long energy negotiations with with russia so it is not going to be you know russia is the junior partner in this endeavor um and china will protect itself from harm and get its selected interest out of it economically but it is extended so we have to look at them both because they both share the desire of getting the united states out of both europe and the indo-pacific thank you the other thing we've talked about energy and all that and coming from a state that's pretty rich in energy we think we can help an awful lot if they would ask us to i've said today i think that we should ban the amount of product we're buying from russia to set a good example we're buying about 600 000 barrels a day we still have we haven't we haven't ceased that uh and do you think that would send us a good signal as if we could just show that we had to resolve in order to show that that we were going to stop purchasing and asking the rest of the free world to stop purchasing because i guess these products flow in all different directions to different places so i don't know if you think that would be good or is it gonna be harmful to to the your ukrainian cause center i think it's essential we do that and i think we have to address production and and elsewhere still the same as connolly agree yes the other thing i would talk about hypersonic basically hypersonic has been used different ways in china and russia has been developing them for nuclear delivery we've been i think going a direction both not delivering a nuclear but without nuclear two do you think that first of all do you think that russia is is really sincere about thinking about using nuclear weapons in this altercation they have right now the war they declared they don't need a nuclear weapon to take over ukraine but basically to show the rest of the world uh that they uh that they really mean business and when they go after somebody they're gonna faith the wrath of the russian nuclear arsenal senator they are signaling uh that they are willing to go in that direction part of that is to fear and to push off u.s and allies but the development and their military modernization of hypersonics would it be taken very seriously would it be used then would they intend to use it basically on the nato allies that they've been trying to uh dissuade from bringing any other non-nato allies into the room let's say finland and switzerland you know swedes and finland those what do you what do you what's your concerns we have to be prepared for that escalation center really their their actions require us to be prepared um the the russian approach here is obviously trying to deter and keep people out of the conflict in ukraine in the form of support they've succeeded already as i mentioned before in fighter aircraft not going to the ukrainians that's that's a saber rattling that's their purpose you mentioned in your opening remarks mr zucker that you said we must stop that convoy from getting to keef okay there's only certain ways we can stop that convoy can you be a little bit more explicit on how we should be doing it i think sabotaging the roads uh through a title 50 capability um unmanned or manned is the clearest one to my mind i'm sure there are other options i agree with you on the unmanned do we have our do we have capabilities or do our allies have capabilities of unmanned uh i can comment on the title 10 side that there are capabilities and i want to explore beyond that and i think allies as well have have capabilities on the unmanned side you're saying it's time to use them yes senator got you thank you mr chairman

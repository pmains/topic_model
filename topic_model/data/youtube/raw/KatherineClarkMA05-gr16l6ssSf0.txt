i come home and let us here to the estate of mary e smith and i said i don't believe it [Music] all they had to do was call the people here isn't that proof enough or do they have to take your blood [Music] i had paid this from the hospital when i was born 1931. i had my original social security card my marriage certificate they wouldn't believe me and i called my only living brother in marble and he was mad he said what are they doing to you he wanted me to go to the newspaper new york but i up to the katherine clark's office well it didn't take long i'd say a week and then it was all resolved i think it's wonderful that they took the time and bothered to do this for me because nobody else helped me [Music] just catherine clark's office [Music] because i'm still here

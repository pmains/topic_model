more fox news contributor jason chaffetz and house minority whip steve scalise good to see you both congressman scalise i start with you now we we now know inflation is at a high 65 cents on average the increase in gas since joe's been president joe gives putin a waiver for to build a pipeline while simultaneously canceling the keystone xl pipeline and and firing people that have high paying career jobs and now we're energy dependent once again after achieving independence after 75 years how are any of these policies good for the american people yeah this is insanity sean if you look at what he did with keystone on day one just eviscerating thousands of american jobs and by the way offending our friend and neighbor canada canada makes this oil it's gonna go be refined somewhere you would want it to be refined in america where we have better policies but now not only did that he adds insult to injury to all those workers who are now out of a job by saying he's okay with pipelines in russia from russia to germany and so he gave a gift to russia uh you see unemployment through the roof and in so many places everywhere you go they can't find workers because joe biden's paying people not to work and then he gives money to states like michigan who are incredibly mismanaged and gretchen wants to pay people who are working part-time still give them unemployment benefits you wonder why their lines at the pump you wonder why you can't find uh lumber 400 increase in lumber it's gonna cost you thirty thousand dollars more to build a home today than it did just a year ago president trump had this under control we were coming out of this we had an economy ready to take off again we had a controlled border and right now it's out of control the borders out of control domestically we're seeing inflation going through the roof we're paying people not to work and then he's given a gift to our enemies like russia and china wants to give the vi the vaccine away the intellectual property to china what's going on in the white house right now well i i mean we've got to ask some tough questions here jason chavis and that is okay we now know that joe biden lied we're going to get into this in more detail in our next segment he said he'd never had any discussions with hunter about his foreign business dealings uh but he did have dinner while as vice president with hunter and oligarchs and all these people that he was doing business with so he lied but the question is does that now is he compromised hunter getting three and a half million from russia two cyber attacks he says nothing he gives a waiver to putin but not to american workers on a pipeline with china oh we don't want to rock the boat with china in any way well hunter had business there too and my question is does you know where is the investigation into conflicts of interest with joe biden hunter biden and all these countries that are hostile to us because a lot of this goes back to his time as vice president one of the things that has to happen is there needs to be a letter what's called a letter of preservation when i was the chairman of the subcommittee on national security and benghazi happened i sent that to the secretary of state what that does is it widens the net instead of just having to comply with the federal records act it compels that person to preserve all other emails and communications that's ultimately how we found out about hillary's uh server and uh all the things that she did outside the government records act that needs to happen with dr fauci it needs to happen with vice president joe biden in his dealings because he can't just say you know it's one thing for a politician to lie that happens a lot but when you're using the government resources and you are in a government position i don't care how high it is you cannot mislead congress you do have to provide those documents but without the preservation letter in place there are other ways to skirt skirt around it but ultimately i think the truth will come out and i'm working with peter schweitzer in the government accountability institute and i think you're going to see a lot of interesting things come out of that research do you see possible compromise issues with joe biden congressman scully's well these questions about his relationship and hunter biden's relationship with foreign countries was raised look at the new york post they raised the the series serious questions about ukraine and the new york post's entire twitter feed was shut down there they were kicked off on twitter for sending out a story that turned out to be true uh so all of these questions have been raised since before the election and joe biden has never been asked this by the mainstream media because they want to give him pass they really don't care they just hated donald trump and i think that's quite evident that they're looking the other way even with some of these latest scandals that we're seeing how often do they get asked about the crisis at the border or these emails by fouchy all right guys thank you both steve scalise jason chapin

military service is a commitment a mini town is a lifetime commandment well I think it's important that our kids get exposure to the information provided at events like this we know our service academies and then ROTC opportunities you know allow our kids the chance that some of our nation's most prestigious universities but if we don't expose them to it they just never know you have a sense of purpose being at a military academy because your job in the end of the day is to be an officer in the United States Army which is you know one of the greatest jobs I think you could ever have a lot of people have told us in and they would have known about a prep school they would have taken that path or would have advised a young person that they knew to take that it's more of the traditional college experience where you know you're closer to home so yeah with other people who are not sick in a military experience but yet earning your your commission is a lieutenant Normie it's a family business it is a family business the same families have defended this nation generation after generation and their generation just because you don't have folks in the past to observe don't mean that you that you are and make that your family [Music] foreign

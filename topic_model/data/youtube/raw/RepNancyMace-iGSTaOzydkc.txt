[Music] let's welcome back to the show congresswoman nancy mace it's great to see you again so now we've got five investigations including the fbi investigating the illegal irs leak of 15 years worth of tax returns for elon musk mark zuckerberg jeff bezos warren buffett people are feeling like oh this is a great thing you know let's go after the rich guys uh-uh this is about america's tax security where do you come down well i think the timing is very suspect as you alluded to before the commercial break when you have president biden talking about taxing the rich in order to pay for this infrastructure package and that corporations will have to pay their fair share and then all of a sudden uh there are irs tax leaks of the rich coming out right now right on the heels of this uh wildly inappropriately massive infrastructure package that came out of the house infrastructure committee just a few days ago i find the time you suspect the other thing is that there are administrations and agencies federal agencies that have a long history of leaking information and targeting their political enemies and the irs is not immune to this not it wasn't long ago that it was the irs's lowest learner that was going after conservative groups we saw in the fbi a few years ago it was lisa page and peter strzok that said that they needed to stop trump and so this kind of thing it has to stop but it's one of the reasons that we really should be trying to make the irs smaller not larger biden right now is adding tens of thousands of agents to the irs that have no accountability to the american people that their information would be protected yeah the lowest learner thing really stuck out because that was about you know non-conservative non-profits being given a hard time to achieve nonprofit status and it was a sort of a suppression of free speech you know covering the irs for decades and testifying twice before congress about irs and tax reform the sense that i got from congress is that we exist for the government right and the irs workers were telling we're basically saying yeah that's the attitude they felt they don't want to be dragged into politics right and mark cuban is saying that propublica which did the story is not being honest about the story that they were basically showing income taxes as a percentage of their overall overall wealth when wealth is not taxed it's it's not taxed under the u.s constitution only income so the we're talking about paper wealth paper wealth is fleeting just as ask pets.com and the tech bubble right when that blew up i mean if elon musk is going to sell billions of dollars worth of tesla shares that's going to slam retail investors a lot of their holdings are in paper wealth that they have not sold yet right right and we're taxed on income but that's one of the reasons it shouldn't be easy to cheat the tax code if we had a simpler tax code a smaller tax a flatter tax with few deductions and there wouldn't be the ability to cheat the irs i mean that's a this is a conversation should spark a conversation for tax reform it'll never happen in my lifetime probably as much as i would love it to but there are ways that this can be done and be fair and equitable across the board um but we're not seeing that right now right a flat tax that would be great um and it would be more equitable people would feel that way and there if there are fewer deductions that way and then you know everyone's paying their fair share whether that's consumption tax or flat tax either one is better than what we've got right now yeah it's interesting when the soviet union broke up broke up those satellite countries in eastern europe and elsewhere got the flat tax but we got the irs you know the wall street journal's kimberly strassel's is uh what is agreeing with what you're saying it's of a piece of how the country is run it's by bureaucracy that's running the country let's be let's be clear about it um and having studied it since the 80s it's quite a bureaucracy i want to get to this though the justice department inspector general is now probing the trump administration uh subpoenas to apple for information on uh a dozen house congressmen including adam schiff and eric swalwell we've reported on how the obama administration was wrong to go after the associated press the new york times and their phone records how is this different well this well this is wrong they're both wrong right and democrats would have more credibility on this issue they're they're raging on twitter right now but they'd have more credibility on this issue if they didn't abuse their own surveillance powers to go after fox news and the associated press and you're right it was the obama's department of justice that uh went after journalists right i mean that was wrong and this is this is wrong now that was wrong then and then you hear over on the other corner of the side of the world you've got adam schiff going nuts over this and it was adam's ship that went after democrat adam schiff going after republican devin nunes during the russia investigation so they really have very little credibility on this issue but this is wrong buying on people is wrong i think allowing or forcing third parties to give your to hand over your information that's also wrong businesses shouldn't be forced to do that there's a court of law there's a process for this already in place in our judicial system all right congresswoman nancy mace thanks for joining us it's good to see you thank you as always

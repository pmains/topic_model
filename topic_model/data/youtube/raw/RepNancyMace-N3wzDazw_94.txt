the vote on censure was actually more than that it was a it was to strip him of his committees as well uh that's been done only one other time in congress um i follow something called the constitution and the constitution says we're supposed to follow the house rules on these kinds of things that means that the ethics committee and the oe oce must be involved there should be an investigation and if we're going to do this then we should apply the constitution and the house rules equally across the board and and be unequivocal about it and that's that's where i took issue with that if it were a strict censure vote you would have said you would have seen i believe more republicans hop on board

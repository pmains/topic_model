the old saying goes money doesn't grow on trees this is a lesson lost on Democrats whose intent to spend trillions upon trillions of taxpayer dollars to grow government is astounding by any measure in the two years since President Biden has taken office our country's debt has skyrocketed to 31.5 trillion dollars in the last year alone the U.S government paid 475 billion dollars in interest on the nation's existing debt these interest payments will only grow with Rising interest rates the American people deserve to have their hard-earned tax dollars spent responsibly and not on ridiculously high interest payments simply because presidents and Washington followed politicians failed to write balanced budgets I have reintroduced a balanced budget amendment to the U.S Constitution to require the president and Congress to enact annual balanced budgets most Americans understand that our growing deficit and national debt will catch up with us if we don't act to control spending we must learn to live within our means Mississippi is required to balance its budget and Washington should too my balanced budget amendment provides the American people and our nation's Leaders with a responsible framework to save the country from a future of Perpetual and unsustainable red ink now is the time for Congress to adopt a strong framework from which to tackle our nation's long-term physical problems I will do everything I can to have the Senate and House consider this responsible measure as soon as possible

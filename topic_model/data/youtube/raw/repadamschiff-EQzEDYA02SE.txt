capital a member of that panel is congressman adam schiff he of course is the chair of the house intelligence committee and author of a book called midnight in washington which is about largely what happened on january 6 and the path of where we go from here congressman thank you so much for joining us live tonight in washington late at night on what has been a very long day for you take us inside the room today you know in the book you take us inside the room a year ago but what was it like inside the room today well today i think many of us kind of dreaded being back on the house floor to commemorate that anniversary because we knew it would be traumatic and it was in talking to my colleagues i think we all have the same sentiment that it brought back some very powerful memories about being in that chamber hearing uh you know the insurrectionists battering the doors breaking the windows trying to get into the house chamber being told by the police we needed to get our gas masks out we need to get ready to get down on the ground it was it was chaotic and i think two the realization that our democracy is in even more peril today than it was a year ago uh was a difficult realization but i think an accurate one i i know there was a moment today uh where you were a bit taken aback primarily because of the masks it's hard to identify people so we mentioned liz cheney was there on the house floor uh walk us through that moment because as we just reported she was there with her dad well uh you know when i saw liz there i went over to talk with her we serve on this like committee together i have great respect for her courage uh and she said adam this is my father and i looked over i i saw there was an older man standing next to her but i didn't recognize him in his mask and so i'm sorry mr vice president i i didn't recognize you and i told her i told him uh you know that he must be very proud of his daughter because she was showing such exceptional courage uh and that i respected um her and uh and uh appreciated that uh she was willing to speak the truth uh with all the consequences that that entails for her and what what did he say to you and what was that moment like for you as somebody who fought so hard against so many of the bush cheney policies uh you know it was very unusual to be having that conversation and to find as much common ground as we had um i want to be respectful of the the former vice president and allow him to make his own comments but i can't say generally we were both marveling over the fact that a year later people were still pushing that big lie about the election um and the damage it was doing to our democracy did and going back to your original response did you say that our democracy is more threatened today than it it was one year ago yes uh you know i think the capital building is better protected but the threat to our democracy isn't predominantly one of violence against that building it's what's taken place since in the effort to use that that falsehood about the election to strip independent elections officials around the country of their duties give them over to partisan boards and partisan legislatures to allow essentially state legislatures to overturn the results of an election if their party doesn't succeed that's a far greater threat to our democracy i think that what we saw on january 6th we may have another attack on our capital it will fail like the last one but these attacks on the integrity of election process around the country could succeed and people need to realize what a danger that is to our democracy and you're talking about the danger potentially for january 6 2025 the next presidential election and what happens if there are partisan elected officials in certain states that refuse to accept the results of the election and could they try to change the results of the election so what do you do about that right i mean the question is democrats now have a majority in the house but also a majority in the senate you may have to change the rules of the senate get rid of the filibuster for voting rights in order to put in protections to try to stop something like that from happening but it hasn't happened yet we're a year in now uh you know the clock is ticking are you frustrated are you surprised that nothing on voting rights has passed so far and what can be done so that that actually happens i am surprised uh i'm uh dismayed i'm frustrated uh and i'm frightened about what that that means for our democracy um that we were all we are letting a arcane senate rule the procedure prevent us from protecting voting rights the foundation of our democracy i think the lesson that the former president learned and his enablers learned from the failure of the last insurrection is that if they couldn't get a secretary of state in georgia to find 11 780 votes that don't exist as trump was urging brad raffensberger they seem determined to have someone in that position next time who will and this is how democracies come to an end it's how you know people like victor orban the wannabe dictator in hungary are dismantling the institutions of our democracy that's someone who our former president just endorsed uh that's someone who sadly uh many of the intellectual thought leaders in today's trumpet republican party also endorse and so i think we have to open our eyes to the vulnerability of our own democracy it's going to take more than legislation it's going to take a very vigilant public but it's also going to take some leadership from the democratic party is it a failure of leadership that president biden and senate majority leader chuck schumer have not been able to convince senator joe manchin and senator kristen sinema and others to go along with the plan you already passed in the house to actually put these protections in place because what you're talking about is a threat to our entire system that's a five alarm fire what you're describing and why has more not been done from the democrats in charge to you know get the whole party together on this it is a five alarm fire uh and i think the president and senator schumer are doing everything they can to get joe manchin and kirsten sinema the two democratic holdouts to end their objection to changing the filibuster to protect voting rights and i think the responsibility thus far for our failure to pass that legislation has to rest on those who are opposing it which are those two senators but also i think almost every with one exception republican senator who is also opposing the protection of voting rights and we might also ask why are the republicans so unwilling to protect voting rights it's the voting rights of their constituents too uh so this is a i think a major failure of our democracy that at this point could lead to quite disastrous consequences well we do have a statement from former president donald trump as you know he was going to hold a really a news conference today from mar-a-lago he canceled that but he did issue a statement he says this about today the democrats want to own this day of january 6 so they can stoke fears and divide america i say let them have it because america sees through their lies and polarizations so congressman schiff remembering that 74 million people voted for former president trump what do you say to people who still very much support him well you know look i i think yes 74 million people voted for the former president that doesn't mean all of them believe the lie that he is telling about the election that all of them believe that he in fact was the winner when he was the loser uh there are a substantial number unfortunately of members of the republican party who do believe what donald trump is telling them um but we are so far down the rabbit hole with that former president that he's making the argument to people that the insurrection wasn't the attack the violent attack on the capitol uh on january 6 but somehow the election itself somehow the fact that more americans participate in the election than ever before was somehow anti-democratic or un-american you have to live in a pretty bizarro upside down world for that to make any sense that's the world donald trump lives in but it can't be the world that america lives in or it'll be the end of our democracy i'm running out of time but just real quickly can you give us a preview of what's next for the january 6 commission including are we going to be hearing from mike pence or potentially president trump um we intend i think within the next few weeks to begin a series of public hearings to bring the public along with what we are learning and we've learned i think a great deal yes we would like to hear from the vice president the former vice president we think that he could shed probably more light than anyone else on the efforts to coerce him into violating his constitutional duty something that he proved unwilling to do um he had a ceremonial function that day uh he was not empowered to change the result and that's what the former president was urging him to do and i think that he could speak to them very directly uh very powerfully if he's willing and i hope he will be are you planning to subpoena former vice president pence well at this point uh we haven't extended the formal uh voluntary invitation for him to appear i want to get ahead of our committee that would be the first step that we'll take but our chairman has indicated that we do want him to come in congressman adam schiff thank you for sharing your views again his book is called midnight in washington if you want to get an extensive version of his version of what happened on january 6th we really do appreciate you being on with us and look forward to future conversations thank you

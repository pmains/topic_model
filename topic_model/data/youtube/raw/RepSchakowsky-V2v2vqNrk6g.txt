hi it's congresswoman jan schakowski and i'm back with my plans and pans i want to begin with the shortage in baby formula so it really all started with abbott laboratories now abbott is a pretty respected name um but the problem was that abbott in its manufacturing plant there was contamination this is a serious problem we know for sure of two babies that have died and uh and others who were made sick in this avid plant so the recall of the abbott baby formula of course began the rolling problem of the of the shortage so the congress has taken action and we have done along with the president four different things one you know a lot of low-income women who are eligible for the women infant and children program were limited in the amount of baby formula they were able to order so the first thing we did was to increase the amount that women would be able to order through the wic program very important number two the congress or at least the house of representatives voted 28 million dollars to the food and drug administration to facilitate greater production of the infant formula and three the the president invoked the defense production act to make sure that various ingredients and components that make up infant formula will be produced by the federal government so that is the is underway and then the president ordered 75 000 pounds of baby formula from germany that is uh that is coming our way i think another issue that we have to look at as we improve on this problem on this crisis really for so many people is that there is this concentration of only about four companies in the united states of america that make infant formula and often i think this concentration of production power can lead in various industries to the kinds of shortages that that that were experienced so these nearer monopoly kinds of situations don't really serve us very well especially when we get into trouble like we did with uh with abbott so of course we're watching it and tomorrow i'll be participating in an investigative hearing on what where what started it what continued it and what we're doing to solve the problem so this is not this is definitely not over last week we also passed a bill called the consumer fuel price gouting prevention act and what that does is allow the president of the united states to declare a to have an emergency declaration when it comes to fuel shortages and then the federal trade commission would have the authority to say that price gouging is um a crime and to go after the the price gougers now we had a hearing i i had a hearing in my committee and on the oversight committee that showed that the um gas and oil companies actually took advantage by raising the prices during the pandemic and during the situation with the uh with the war in russia they decided rather than to release more um gas at the pump and heating oil that what they would do was to make more in profits that they would do stock buybacks that they would raise their shareholder dividends that they would raise the salaries of their ceos clearly price gouging and we have to prevent that so i have introduced a bill last week the price counting prevention act which deals not just with the big oil and gas companies but also addresses anyone else who is price gouging because we saw that during the pandemic even mask and the personal protective gear and the hand lotion hand sanitizer but also we are seeing it in grocery stores we are seeing it in the pharmaceutical industry we are seeing price gouging when this looks like an opportunity to for for major corporations to decide that they want to raise their their prices again the federal trade commission could step in and get retribution for people who are price gouged by holding these gougers accountable and i look forward to act to do this uh as soon as possible i also wanted to talk to you about this amazing program that has been started or announced anyway in cook county and it is called the coke county promise guaranteed income pilot program guaranteed income what this program does is it's going to identify 3200 families in cook county that make 250 percent of the poverty level or less in income every year and those families um the of the 3 200 families there will that will be chosen by lottery of those that apply will get 500 a month it will be sent to them from cook county now the originally the money is going to come from the money that the federal government sent to the um to the county um but um there's going to be the university of chicago that is going to be continuing to study to see how will that affect families and the surrounding economy in in terms of benefits and this idea of a guaranteed income is an old idea that has never really been put into place guaranteed minimum income and uh and i'm anxious to see how that will work there's no doubt in my mind that the 500 will be able to address families who right now can't meet emergency health problems who you know suddenly find themselves behind on their rent and are going to be able finally to to pay it who are going to be able to put nutritious food on the table and i can only imagine that there's going to be positive results and i want to applaud tony proclinkwell the president of the cook county board and the cook county commission for giving this idea a real start and a real chance i'm very very excited about it the other thing that happened this week is that we passed in the house of representatives the workforce innovation and opportunity act this is really a kind of on steroids job training program to provide opportunities both for workers and to the the relationship with their employers to make sure that there are more career opportunities available not just on the minimum wage kinds of jobs but preparing people for careers so that i think is going to be a very important important bill now another threat on the horizon although doesn't seem nearly as bad as the coronavirus and in all of its iterations but we've heard now of monkey packs have you heard about it um for a long time it was really concentrated to the uh to to the african continent continent but actually now it's going beyond there are actually a couple cases that we found in the united states of america um you know flu-like symptoms feeling pretty lousy it doesn't seem to be the kind of thing that could cause death and it's not as dangerous because there actually already is medication for it's called the small pack smallpox vaccine of uh of years ago that we had also does address and treat um the monkey pox so all of the health agencies are monitoring monkey pox will get warnings i think as they uh emerge i heard from the head of the chicago department of health that they are monitoring it and will certainly um get the uh the word out so there is this other thing that may be spreading around the world um not uh apparently as uh contagious they still haven't determined all the ways that it can be transmitted not as deadly as we saw you know now a million people from the coronavirus and viruses maybe in the united states of america but something that certainly the health professionals and all of us ought to keep an ear to the ground about so the um coronavirus update for for this week shows an increase as you as you i'm sure have heard the um cook county is approaching not there yet the high community level um and so we should definitely make sure that the masks are handy certainly for uh for indoor certainly for indoor when you're there for any length of time some school districts have reenacted mask mask mandates and so we shall see but you will definitely want to be prepared to stay safe and there may be a few of you out there who still have not been vaccinated or boosted be sure that you do so look for the guidelines when it comes to to our children to make sure that they are also vaccinated all of them when possible i also want to wish you a very happy memorial day i know that plants and pans was a bit late this week and actually because i will be going with the aspen institute to a wonderful opportunity to talk about international challenges in geneva switzerland for all of next week that there will be a weak delay in the in the next pans and plans but i do look forward to talking with you again happy memorial day thank you for

joining me right now kentucky senator senate foreign relations and homeland security and governmental affairs committee member rand paul senator always a pleasure to see you let's just get right into the news of the day i know it's new york city not to sound um being in new yorker now not to be focused on the local but this public schools here shutting down clearly these left-wing leaders are giving in to the demands of the unions what say you and should we be concerned about this happening in other parts of the country well there's no science to support it um if you look at all the science and all the objective data i'm going back to school we've created no surgeons there's been no surge in teacher deaths no in teacher illness very very manageable and this is a different disease for kids than it is for the elderly if you don't acknowledge that you're not following someone said you know many on the left who want to lock us down are adamant we should follow the science but they absolutely ignore the science on children children rarely die from this it's about one in a million they're actually not very good transmitters of it as well and closing the schools is foolish and unscientific and will lead to greater harm in the economy because many parents have their kids in school and can't work if their kids are not in school senator i'm sure that government overreach keeps you up at night the way that it keeps me up at night and i'll look to a point to gretchen whitmer in the mid in the state of michigan with the restaurant suing over missing michigan's rule the wall street journal editorial board writes this at the end of their editorial today as supreme court justice samuel alito said last week the longer emergency powers are in use the more they become questionable under law the bars may be closed but too many governors are drunk on power perhaps federal courts can sober them up how concerned are you about this overreach and could the courts intervene and be the solution for all americans who value freedom uh let's hope in this case the court will intervene i've been calling my governor for months dwp drunk with power because he's taken this power without any concept in the legislature of the people it's never ever been taken before and what he's ruling on and the eatings that are coming from the governor and for the governor of michigan they're completely arbitrary they're not based in any kind of science there's really very little objective science to prove that any of this works in fact the danish study on mask shows that objectively guess what the cloth masks don't work their theater if you look at the cloth masks 97 of virus-sized particles go through a cloth mask so we're kidding ourselves and what it's doing is it's detracting from the one thing that could save us and could really help us and that's the vaccine i've been a big proponent of releasing it early i think that uh we've had enough safety and effect of this data what they should do is if they want to continue the trials instead of forty thousand people in trouble why don't we make them four million so at least another three and a half million could be enrolled in the trials if you still want to have a placebo wing but i think you could rapidly expand the trials or allow compassionate use and i see no reason why you can't start uh letting people voluntarily people who want to take it and i think there will be millions who want to take it let them get started and that way we can head towards immunity combining natural immunity and vaccinated immunity to get to where we need to get much quicker but i think waiting another four months to get started is foolish and that also your position also encourages americans to go out there and get it when polls have showed that like the wall street journal poll showed that more than one quarter of people said they wouldn't take it so you want to encourage people to go out and get that vaccine based on the the mismanagement of the the coronavirus the pandemic the shutdowns which we're still seeing say here in new york are you concerned about the distribution though of these vaccines does the federal government have it under control do they know what they're doing because again it ultimately will also fall on the governors and local officials in these states to get it to the people who need it you know i think we'll overcome the distribution problems and that's the technical problem that i really am not equipped to tell you exactly when or where and how we can do it i will tell you that when people report oh my goodness of 400 people don't want to take a vaccine well the other side of the coin is three-fourths of people do and that's a lot of people so what will happen is the people at high risk and the people with the most uh uh interpreting their own personal risk the most will take it the first and there'll be some rules but the elderly those in nursing home those with comorbidities will all get it it'll take a while to get it so what will happen is confidence will build frankly i've already had it so i don't need the vaccine people keep asking politicians will you take it frankly i will let many other people be first in line and in a year or two i might consider taking it when we know a little bit more about how long my immunity is going to last but the good news is there are 11 million people out there who have had it survived and i know not everybody survived and i have friends who have died from this i have a great deal simply i want to survive but the best chance is getting the vaccine forward as long as it's voluntary and i think plenty of people take it and as they survive the vaccine and as they show there aren't significant side effects more will take it and i thank you for reminding me rather than rather than me being the glass one quarter empty it's three quarters full that's always that's always a good reminder we had some hearing on capitol hill this week in the senate with mark zuckerberg and jack dorsey from twitter there so there's a great deal of concern about the power of these online media companies these social media companies the uh of the censorship there but what we've seen and i want to get your reaction to this is because of the pandemic shutdown that is handed an incredible amount of pay it's taken power away from small local businesses and made these gigantic tech companies that much bigger and i point to amazon amazon announced this week that it's launching an online pharmacy how concerned are you about we don't unders we have no idea the true reach of these companies and how much of our personal information they control and our freedom how concerned are you about how large these companies have gotten in the last year because of the way we've decided to fight this pandemic a little bit different when we think about anti-trust first anti-trust case the most famous was standard oil instead of oil had 98 of the market everybody said oh my goodness what was me what are we going to do about it but the price to the concealer for kerosene which was the primary product back that had dropped for 30 years so i care more about prices and more about price mobility and more about what the consumer gets look i hate jeff bezos uh politics but i love ordering crap off from amazon they're knocking on my door by the time i order it they're delivering at my door so they're doing something pretty good and so i don't want to break up companies that are providing good service am i mad when google bans a speech i gave them the senate for yes that's terrible but people should turn off people they don't like you know i've decided no longer to dance on tick tock you know i mean i know i was a big deal dancing on tick tock but i don't do it anymore because i don't like the fact that my personal dance information might go to china but we have the ability of consumers to control and reign in big tech don't use them go from twitter to parlor there's all kinds of ways to uh chastise these people and to show them that you're unhappy with them but i'm not much for government deciding which companies to break up and which company's not all right we're going to have to argue about that another day because i think that big big big brothers are google and amazon but we'll have to leave it at that senator ray paul pleasure sir always

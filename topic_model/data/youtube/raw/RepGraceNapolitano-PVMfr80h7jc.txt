chairman i do rise in support of the general premise i repeat the general premise of this legislation but oppose the legislation as amended and i'd like to mention that only three out of 15 democrats support it so while it is bipartisan minor parts bipartisanship on this particular issue uh hr 2042 does seek to generate additional hydropower at the existing bureau of reclamation facilities as federal properties through developing new process of conduit and in-canal hydropower which we should be developing uh at a greater speed and length we cannot support this bill as amended even though the original bill uh uh did also stated and uh and an attempt was tried to to be able to take this waiver language out on page four lines twelve to fifteen we were unsuccessful so we cannot support it because it does have a nepa waver language that we cannot support we are in support of the general intent h.r 2042 the federal conducts continue to fall on the reclamation lease of power privilege process the lopp lop it requires offering a preference to irrigation districts or water users association with an existing contract those already have a contract which we support and it safeguards current project users by recognizing projects primary authorized purposes and that no financial and or operational costs will be incurred by the existing water and power users the federal power marketing administrations are also and i repeat are not obligated to purchase or market the power produced legislation does go a step too far and includes an unnecessary and unwise blanket exemption from a critical environmental law if my colleagues on the other side had simply followed the advice of the national hydropower association and the conservation group of american rivers we would have a non-controversial bill that would have passed unanimously out of the house we also received a letter from five environmental groups in opposition uh and i asked the chairman to uh grant the request to include him in the record without objection sword thank you mr chairman proponents uh for accepting national environmental policy the nepa act will argue that government regulatory red tape is preventing the development of more hydropower reclamation already has the authority to comply with nipah through categorical exemptions and the system is working categorical exclusions have been issued for hydropower sites under the reclamation slot process at three specific sites in colorado the lemon which was in 1989 the grand valley power plant in 2011 jackson gulch in 1995. nepa compliance for other sites in fact has not been the bureaucratic chaos some wouldn't make it out to be there are three projects in the home state of colorado for my sponsor my colleague the sponsor of this bill in georgia now utah compliance took 15 months from start to finish to receive final permit in 2004. lake carter colorado took six months from to finish nepa in 2010 at ridgeway colorado an llp was just issued last month and after completing a 15-month nepa process on the south canal drop three site in colorado a finding of no significant impact was just issued last month after 15 months nepa process developers and irrigators need clarity and certainty so their project can be developed waving nepa will not provide the clarity and certainty the stop by for development is not nepa it's lack of reclamation process there must be a clear process in place for the development of hydropower at reclamation facilities i urge reclamation to finalize the directives and standards as soon as possible and is my understanding the draft is already out to developers and irrigators for their review and that the final um directives and standards will be completed by the end of this year it is unfortunate that this legislation contains this controversial waiver without the nepa exemption this legislation would have been on suspension and i do oppose the legislation as my colleagues to join me in opposition of this uh very sad portion of waiver of nepa and i reserve the balance

i rise to speak about the horrific mass murder that happened in las vegas last night my heart is obviously with the victims and their families and i want to thank all of our brave first responders who acted so quickly this senseless mass shootings must end we cannot allow this to be the new normal when tragedy after tragedy happens and we do absolutely nothing to address it it's not good enough just to send thoughts and prayers and extend our condolences when people are losing their lives to gun violence every day we still have to learn the details about what happened but we do know this this violence this mass murder is one of the worst massacres we've ever seen in this country it's yet another reminder of congress's failure to protect americans from gun violence it's another disturbing and painful example of how congress is too weak and too cowardly to stand up to the gun industry the news reports are saying that the gun was shooting in rapid fire bursts a military-style weapon specifically designed to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time a weapon of war we have to pass laws that protect american people over this kind of horrific violence it should not be legal for a civilian on american soil to own and use a weapon of war like an assault weapon our military is highly trained to use such weapons it should not be easy for any person to go and buy a suppressor known by many people as a silencer to attach to their guns which makes it harder for the police to do their jobs and catch filing criminals and the people of nevada voted in november to require background checks on all weapons but the politicians in that state are refusing to implement the will of the people the violence in las vegas is only the latest tragedy like this mass shootings get all the news but every single day in my home state gun violence on a much smaller scale is destroying more and more lives we really need to act we must take gun violence as seriously as we take the threat of terrorism wherever it is happening we will get to the facts in the bottom of this and when we do let's honor the lives of those we have lost by doing something about it to do everything we can to make sure this never happens again

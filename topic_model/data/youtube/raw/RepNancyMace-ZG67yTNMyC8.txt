congressman very good to have you you're worried about this oh absolutely and it's no i mean president biden released a six trillion dollar budget yesterday afternoon at two o'clock in the afternoon of a holiday weekend and you wonder why he's doing this we can't continue to spin it's like if he just adds an extra zero here and there it's going to be okay and it's very much it is akin and i liken it to president jimmy carter's presidency if all this as we suspect will trigger inflation and we're already seeing higher prices but this kind of spending will ensure that everybody is paying more for their houses their rent their groceries you name it prices will go up all right now these price upticks were happening before a lot of the spending to be fair congresswoman so is that all the president's fault or is he just you know adding salt to the price wound here i think it's definitely going to get worse our spending problem as you know neil is is didn't happen yesterday this has been in the making for decades and republicans and democrats have contributed to it over the years but in the middle of the pandemic seeing the kind of spending we just had a 1.9 trillion dollar copit relief package if you pile this on top of it if you pile the incentives that the federal government is giving out for people to stay home rather than go back to work it is absolutely throwing gasoline on the fire

mr. president over the weekend Indiana lost a giant in Richard G lugar senator lugar spent 36 years as a member of this body and I rise today to celebrate his life which made the world a better safer place to live I had the pleasure in the early 2000s to work on senator lugar staff and I had a front-row seat to history watching us a true statesman at work he stood by me as I took my oath right here in this chamber I'll never forget his support of me you know so many other throughout the years senator Lugar's reserved and quiet demeanor or sometimes might have led people to believe he was something less than competitive in truth he was one of the most competitive people I've ever encountered senator lugar was a runner and his office competed every year in the Capitol challenge the competitive race between legislative staffs and senator lugar had a member of his staff actually tracked everyone's time and their improvement or lack thereof from year to year I think that spreadsheet still exists somewhere today when I was in the process of going through the hiring process to be a legislative assistant in the Senators office I went through the normal series of questions my academic background my professional experience is my policy knowledge my interest in working in the office but at the very end of the interview the senator asked me a pointed question he first day he led into the question indicating that he saw listed some hobbies on my resume and one of those hobbies was running and so he asked me pointedly how fast can you run three miles I quickly told him I I thought I could break 18 minutes a half hour later I get a phone call that said I was hired looking back I'm not so sure it was because of my policy chops I learned a lot working for this man I finally remember his penchant for ice cream and the stacks and stacks of books in his office and I believe you read everyone senator lugar wood from time to time invite staff members or interns to run with him on the mall there was only one rule never ever run in front of the senator he was after all a leader a rhodes scholar a navy veteran mayor of Indianapolis where he spurred economic growth that is still spoken of today by consolidating the city and county governments into Unigov as a United States Senator he led on food security energy independence in free trade and at a time when nuclear proliferation was regarded as civilizations greatest threat senator lugar helped save the world the nunn-lugar act for which he is most well known has led to the securing and destruction of thousands of weapons of mass destruction in delivery devices Dick Lugar was a very shrewd politician until his last days his instincts were very good I know this from personal experience in fact last year he and I did a forum together at Indiana University president up on on the panel were a former World Food Prize winner the leader of an international NGO senator lugar and myself in and after formal presentations were done and some questions were asked by the moderator it was questions were opened up to the audience and some particularly difficult questions were tendered initially and and whenever one of these questions was asked senator lugar would put on that trademark smile of his and everyone back home knows what I'm talking about and he just looked over at me and let the junior senator from Indiana field that question and after about three or four times I decided it was his turn so I I tried to use his method right back at him he simply smiled back at me until I couldn't stand the silence anymore I was the first to break the man still had the gift the entire audience laughed he is not to be underestimated he was not to be underestimated as a boss and the impact he could have on a young idealistic staffer looking for role models and in public life he's not to be underestimated as a mentor a mentor who understood that the most important thing a leader can do is is to simply set a good example comport yourself in a way that others might want to model not to be underestimated as a human being Richard Lugar had a heart he ran for office not to be somebody but to do things important things to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of in the end of billions of people around the world Dick Lugar was the gold standard he leaves a legacy as an example our of wisdom civility and bipartisanship always staying true to his temperament he was a quiet man a dignified statesman he thought before he spoke he emphasized substance over personality in short he set the bar for public leaders and he said it hi I'd go further and say he set the bar high for leaders more generally we should all look to Dick Lugar we should all learn from his example I'm not sure we'll ever see another Richard Lugar I sure pray we do may God watch over him in his family during this difficult time mr. president I yield back

mr. chairman my amendment would restore the full state and local tax deduction or salt and stop the double tax put in place on homeowners families communities across our country with the egregious cap in the GOP tax dam after deliberately targeting the Northeast for their first tax bill like jaws Republicans are back to take another bite out of my constituents wallets the sequel tax can we consider today further polls the northeast by making permanent the limits to the state and local tax deductions well Republicans are looking out for their friends while corporations of businesses still get to deduct their full salt large families will see a significant tax increase with this joke in New Jersey the average salt deduction claimed in 2016 was more than a ten thousand limit in 20 out of 21 counties in my district the average was over eighteen thousand and in some counties more than twenty four thousand that means that the average taxpaying household in my district now has to pay income tax on an additional fourteen thousand dollars worth of income without any increase in wages to speak of if they're a middle-class family being taxed at 24 percent that's an extra three thousand four hundred dollars they have to come up with at tax time that's a tax on the tax they already pay on their property and state sales tax that's a big hit for regular families I don't think anybody could disagree with me on that but this egregious double tax and not just the problem in the Northeast in fact towns in Minnesota will be hit harder than towns in my own district of New Jersey cities like Minnetonka famous city ways I weigh zapped odd the average salt did I have water mr. chairman we've always been hoping for that mister yeah the average salt reduction in 2016 was just under $60,000 more than half of the households in these areas claimed the salt adduction hey 50,000 additional income being taxed on these households that amounts there were 12,000 tax bill for those families if they're taxed at the 24% bracket if they're at 32% it jumps to $16,000 tax bill attacks on attacks in Oak Brook in Westmont Illinois 60% of the families used a deduction in 2016 the average value there was over 30 thousand five hundred dollars given how hard taxpayers will be hit there it's surprising to see members from Illinois and Minnesota vote for a bill that directly harms their constituents this bill manages to give away six hundred and fifty seven billion dollars and still takes from homeowners in those communities it is mind-boggling a member would want to hammer his constituents like that some members like to talk about how great tax cuts are like some miracle drug that cures all ills they usually leave out the details like telling their constituents that the new cap on state local deductions means to be taxed at a higher income level than they were before forget about tax cuts constituents in these districts will be lucky to break even or more likely face a tax increase many property tax bills are issued and are due October the 1st I asked my colleagues how will your constituents feel when they find out they can no longer deduct their property taxes or state taxes on their federal returns this bill doubles down on the double tax this is a literally rubbing salt in the wound salt of our middle-class neighbors and with that I yield back

for this time Madam President the senator from Virginia first of all Madam President I want to thank my colleague from West Virginia senator capital for her comments I know we're gonna shortly hear from senator from Pennsylvania we heard the senator from Ohio and I want this is sometimes hard for me to say as a former governor of Virginia to a former governor of West Virginia but I want particularly those who are following this issue that no one in this body has fought harder longer more passionately more consistently than Joe Manchin for miners it was only through his repeated efforts and this is a miss a man with a dog with a bone on this one that will not let it go he's at times stiff from the spine the folks on this side of the aisle when they wanted to say well maybe no we ought to move to something else he's come back and back and back and back again and so I'm honored to stand with him one more time and let me again it is it is was some challenge that someone from the Commonwealth of Virginia has to say there's many nice things about somebody from the from West Virginia but the folks in the gallery ought to know there's been no one that's been a better advocate for minors than the senator from West Virginia I don't think there is a member of the Senate I know at least on this side the aisle that is not heard at least a half-dozen times about the promises that Harry Truman made to the miners in 1946 and how it is our obligation to keep that word and keep that promise and what the senator from West Virginia has indicated why this is timely again we've got the challenges around the pension funds we've got other challenge but we've got right we got crisis right now we talked about Westmoreland the Westmoreland bankruptcy 1200 miners 500 of those live in Virginia if we can't get a solution on this deal right now on the American miners Act and a lot of those miners and their families are gonna go without relief because their day of reckoning is already upon us so I want to echo what Sen from West Virginia said to urge the majority leader and for that matter of the minority leader if there's a way if we do the rational sensible thing and not shut down the government on Friday we ought to take advantage of making sure the American miners Act is part of that provision I can think nothing better as we go into the work period then you try to give miners some some certainty let me just mention one other item that the American miners Act has and that is the strengthen the Black Lung disability trust fund this is also an issue that if we don't get resolved the amount of contributions that go in to that trust fund drop in half and I don't think many folks realize and I think this is particularly the case and in West Virginia and Southwest Virginia black lung is still a real enormous medical challenge matter of fact we've now seen growth in large populations in my state and I know in West Virginia as well of advance black lung cases called complicated black lung that has an even more devastating effect so if this trust fund is cut in half based upon legislation that took place at the end of calendar year 2018 the ability for the trust fund to meet the needs these miners and their families who are still hard hit by a debilitating disease we're not going to be able to give them again the high-quality care they deserve it is way past time to fix this problem let's take that step we've got one of these large pieces of legislation hopefully that will the president won't decide to to veto it that will get through and wouldn't it be wouldn't it be that's past senator from West Virginia this before I cede to the senator from Pennsylvania but sometimes with these giant bills that strange things pop out at the end of the day you kind of wonder how they got in wouldn't it be great if on this mini giant bill that one of the things that popped out might be the promise relief for our miners in terms of the health care and their pension something that I believe we as a country Oh to the miners back yes to the President Truman's promises back in 1946 so I stand with all of my colleagues on this issue particularly want to thank again my friend the senator from West Virginia for his great leadership and and his willingness to stand tall time and time again here let's see if we can get it done this time with that Madam President I yield back to the senator from West Virginia

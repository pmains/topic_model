PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY. FAIR AND BALANCED NOW, A DEMOCRAT WHO WAS ALSO IN ON THAT PHONE CAL THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF VIRGINIA, DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE. SENATOR, GOOD TO HAVE YOU. >> NEIL, VERY GLAD TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. THANKS. NEIL: SENATOR, APPARENTLY PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, HE BROUGHT UP THE WHOLE NO-FLY ZONE THING. OBVIOUSLY, HE'S MAYBE GIVEN UP ON THAT, FRUSTRATED BY THAT, BUT HE WAS ASKING FOR MORE LETHAL AID. DID HE SPELL OUT TO YOU WHAT LETHAL AID WOULD BE? >> NEIL, HE DIDN'T, BUT I THINK WE KNOW WHAT HE NEEDS. YOU KNOW, WE'VE DONE $3 BILLION WORTH OF DEFENSIVE MILITARY AID TO UKRAINE SINCE 2014, A BILLION IN THE LAST YEAR. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE CONGRESS LIKELY IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS PROBABLY DO ANOTHER $5-8 BILLION OF MILITARY AID. IN THE LAST YEAR IT'S REALLY SWITCHED HEAVILY TOWARDS ANTI-TANK AND ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENSE CAPACITY. BUT WE'RE GOING TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THAT, AND I THINK THERE IS STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THAT TOGETHER WITH THE SANCTIONS, U.S. TROOPS AND THE NATO ALLY COUNTRIES, YOU'LL SEE MUCH MORE DEFENSIVE AID FLOWING TO UKRAINE VERY SOON. NEIL: SENATOR, MUCH HAS BEEN MADE BACK AND FORTH OF HOW FAR WE GO WITH SANCTIONS. THERE'S BEEN A WIT OF A RIFT IN YOUR -- BIT OF A RIFT IN YOUR PARTY ABOUT, FOR EXAMPLE, RUSSIAN OIL. THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT SEEM, AT LEAST AT THIS POINT, TO CUT IT ALL OFF. NANCY PELOSI'S OPEN TO IT. WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS? >> I THINK WE SHOULD, THE U.S. SHOULD SHUT DOWN IMPORTS OF RUSSIAN ENERGY. WE SHOULD DO THAT. WE CAN DO ITNINILATERALLY, AND WE OUG T TO DO IT RIGHT AWAY. THERE'S ALSO DISCUIONION ABOUT THE SANCTIONS AGAINST R RUSSIAN ENERGY PROJECTS, COMPANIES. WE NEED TO -- ON THE SANCTIONS SIDE WE'RE SO MUCH STRONGER WHEN WE ACT IN TANDEM WITH OUR ALLIES. THE CURRENT SANCTIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT. SO RATHER THAN DO ADDITIONAL UNILATERAL SANCTIONS ON ENERGY, NEED TO WORK WITH OUR ALLIES ON THAT. BUT I THINK WE SHOULD SHUT DOWN RUSSIAN OIL IMPORTS ASAP. NEIL: WHY DON'T YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT HASN'T DONE THAT? >> I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW, BUT I THINWIWITH THE GROWING, YOU KNOW, VOICES IN CONGRESS ABOUT IT, I THINK IT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN. I SUSPECT THE PRESIDENT IS WORRIED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL INFLATIONARY EFFECT OF THE PRICE OF GAS AT THE PUMP I WE SHUT OFF RUSSIAN IMPORTS WHICH ARE 4-5%F WHATE WE IMPORT IN THE UNITED STATES. NEIL: RIGHT. >> WE DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THOSE IMPORTS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS BUT, LOOK, I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO TO HELP DEPRIVE RUSSIA OF RESOURCES. NEIL: SENATOR, WHEN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY WAS TALKING TO YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES, DID HE MENTION, AGAIN, ANY PUSH FOR, YOU KNOW, PEACE TALKS, ADDITIONAL PEACE TALKS? I KNOW A THIRD ONE IS PLANNEDDED NEXT WEEK. AND WHAT MIGHT BE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT UKRAINE COULD OFFER TO STOP THIS? AND, OF COURSE, VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS SAID THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S THERE RIGHT NOW, SO PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY WOULD PRESUMABLY HAVE TO STEP DOWN. DID HE TALK ABOUT THAT? AND DID HE TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT OFFER TO COUNTER THIS? >> NEIL, HE DIDN'T. AND, BUT I DON'T -- LOOK, PUTIN'S STATEMENT THAT THE LEGITIMATELY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE HAS TO STEP DOWN, THAT'S RIDICULOUS, YOU KNOW? IF HE CAN TAKE A FLYING LEAP IF THAT'S WHOO HE'S -- WHAT HE'S INTERESTED IN. ZELENSKYY SHOULDN'T DO THAT. THIS IS A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT THAT WAS ELECTED BY THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE, AND HE WAS ELECTED AFTER UKRAINE HAD SEEN WHAT RUSSIAN COME NANCE -- DOMINANCE OF THE DONBAS HAS DONE. WHAT VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS DONE WITH THESE BREAKAWAY PUPPET STATES IS CONVINCE EVERY SINGLE UKRAINIAN RUSSIAN SPEAKERS WITH FAMILY IN RUSSIA, HE'S CONVINCED EVERY SINGLE UKRAINIAN WE DON'T WANT THAT. PUTIN HAS TURNED ALL UKRAINIANS TOWARD THE WEST IN HIS REQUEST THAT ZELENSKYY OR THE GOVERNMENT STEP DOWN. THAT'S A NON-STARTER. SO WE DIDN'T REALLY TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT PEACE DISCUSSIONS. I THINK THE WAY PEACE IS GOING TO HAPPEN ISRESSURE ON PUTIN INTERNALLY FROM THESE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS WITH THE OLIGARCHS AND OTHERS AROUND HIM. AND WITH EVERYDAY RUSSIAN CITIZENS, YOU KNOW, RUNNING ON BANKS AND ATMs TO GET THEIR NIES OUT, I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE THAT INTERNAL POLITICAL SQUEEZE FOR PUTIN TO CHANGE. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DONE JUST AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. NEIL: YOU KNOW, SENATOR, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON? RUSSIA'S NOW, YOU KNOW, PUSHED OUT THE BBC, VOICE OF AMERICA, RADIO-FREE EUROPE. THEIR ACCESS TO OUTSIDE SOURCES, WHICH WAS ALWAYS LIMITED, ESPECIALLY SO NOW, BUT YOU RAISED A VERY GOOD POINT ABOUT HOW THEY DON'T NECESSARILY NEED ACCESS TO SOCIAL MEDIA TO KNOW THEY'RE WAITING ON LONG LINES TO GET THEIR MONEY OUT OF BANKS AND A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH MONEY THEY CAN GET OUT OF BANKS. IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING, SIR, THAT THE HOPE OF ZELENSKYY IS ON RUSSIAN FRUSTRATION BUILDING IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO ENOUGH, ENOUGH TO SLOW PUTIN DOWN OR MAYBE INVITE, YOU KNOW, AN OVERTHROW? >> NEIL, THAT WAS MY SENSE, BOTH MY OWN INTUITION BUT ALSO IN TALKING WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY THIS MORNING, HE WAS VERY COMPLIMENTARY OF THE FORCE OF THESE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IN RUSSIA. YOU'RE RIGHT. PUTIN CONTROLS ALL THE MEDIA. THE LAST INDEPENDENT MEDIA IN RUSSIA HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN AS WELL AS ALL THE FOREIGN MEDIA THAT'S TRIED TO GIVE SOME INDEPENDENT VOICE. THEY'VE ALL BEEN SHUT DOWN. HOWEVER, THE RUBLE IS DEVALUING VERY FAST. THE RUSSIAN STOCK MARKET IS CLOSED. THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED TO CENSURE RUSSIA. PUTIN IS BEING HELD UP AS A WAR CRIMINAL BEFORE THE ICC. THIS INFORMATION DOES GET OUT, AND RUSSIANS ARE GOING TO BANKS AND ATM IFs TO TRY TO TAKE OUT MONEY. THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF A TOUGH, TOUGH POLITICAL REALITY FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN, AND WE ALSO HAVE SOME SUGGESTION THAT THE OLIGARCHS AROUND HIM WHO ARE HAVING ASSETS AND GRANTS AND CONDOMINIUMS SEIZED, THEY REALIZE THIS IS A MASSIVE BLR. SO MY BELIEF IS WE KEEP UP THE SANCTIONS AND UP THEM FURTHER. WE BAN IMPORTS OF RUSSIAN OIL, WE KEEP FLOWING MILITARY AID IN GREATER QUANTITY AND GREATER LETHALITY TO THE UKRAINIAN DEFENSE FORCE. BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE BITE OF THESE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THAT IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO CHANGE PUTIN'S CALCULUS. IT MAY NOT HAPPEN FAST ENOUGH FOR US, BUT I DO BELIEVE THEY WILL CHANGE HIS CALCULUS. NEIL: SENATOR, YOUS MENTIONED KEEPING THE SANCTIONS UP AND GOING, AND I'M WONDERING HOW LONG THEY WOULD BE INFECT. LET'S SAY THIS DOES GET RESOLVED, HOPEFULLY PEACEFULLY, AND THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES IF VLADIMIR PUTIN IS STILL IN POWER IN RUSSIA, WOULD YOU KEEP THOSE SANCTIONS ON? IN OTHER WORDS, WOULD SANCTIONS AND ECONOMIC PUNISHMENT, SENATOR, BE CONTINGENT ON HIM LEAVING? >> NEIL, YOU'VE ASKED A REALLY GOOD QUESTION, AND I'LL TELL YOU, THIS HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH U.S. SANCTIONS POLICY GENERALLY, IS THAT WE KIND OF HAVE TRIGGERS ABOUT WHEN TO PUT THEM ON, BUT WE DON'T NOSILY THINK -- NECESSARILY THINK THROUGH IN ADVANCE WHEN THEY SHOULD BE RELIEVED. AND I OFTEN THINK THEY HAVE A BETTER DETERRENT VALUE IF YOU COMMUNICATE UP FRONT IF YOU DO X, Y AND Z, THEN THESE SANCTIONS WILL BE LIFTED. NOW, WHAT WE HAVE WITH US IS WE HAVE A MENU OF SANCTIONS, BUT WE DON'T HAVE -- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL OR NOTHING. SO WE COULD POTENTIALLY SEE THOSE, YOU KNOW, THE LIFTING OF SOME OF THE SANCTIONS ON THE ENERGY SECTOR. YOU KNOW, WE COULD KEEP SOME ON THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. THE PRESIDENT, TOGETHER WITH OUR ALLIES, HAS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY HERE WHICH SANCTIONS TO KEEP ON OR KEEP OFF. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, IF THE ECONOMIC BITE ENDS UP CHANGING PUTIN'S CALCULUS, THE DISCUSSION THAT A WE HAVE ABOUT WHICH SANCTIONS MIGHT COME OFF, WHEN AND IN WHICH ORDER, THAT COULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PEACE NEGOTIATION AND DISCUSSION. NEIL: YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE, LINDSEY GRAHAM, HAS SAID MAYBE SOMEONE SHOULD KILL VLADIMIR PUTIN AND THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY. HE DIALED THAT BACK A LITTLE BIT. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT? >> WELL, IT'S CLASSIC LINDSEY. [LAUGHTER] I MEAN, I KNOW LINDSEY GRAHAM AND YOU DO TOO, THAT'S THE JUST THE KIND OF THING HE WOULD SAY. I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT HELPFUL BECAUSE IF YOU START TALKING ABOUT ASSASSINATION OF ANOTHER NATION'S LEADER, WELL, THEN PEOPLE AROUND WORLD SAY IS, OKAY, THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE AVEN OF FOREIGN POLICY, SO WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT AN ASSASSINATION OF ZELENSKYY OR AN ASSASSINATION OF BIDEN. IF YOU OPEN THAT DOOR, YOU CAN'T ASSUME THAT IT'S JUST BEING OPENED TO THE LEADER OF ONE COUNTRY THAT WE DON'T LIKE TODAY. IT SUDDENLY BECOMES, OKAY, WELL, AMERICAN LEADERS THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE TOOL. THAT'S A PANDORA'S BOX THAT SHOULD STAY CLOSED. NEIL: FINALLY, SENATOR, AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE, I WASN'T IN ON THIS MEETING, YOU WERE. WE'RE LEARNING THAT PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY HAS TOLD YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAD STARTED SANCTIONS MONTHS AGO, THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WAR. NOW, IT'S VERY EASY TO PLAY MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK HERE, BUT DO YOU THINK YOURSELF, SENATOR, THAT HAD SANCTIONS, MUCH MORE FORCEFUL ONES, BEEN IN PLACE MUCH EARLIER, NONE OF THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING? >> WELL, IT IS A GOOD QUESTION, NEIL. AND I KNOW IT'S -- THESE SANCTIONS REALLY WORK WHEN THEY WORK IN TANDEM. IF IT'S JUST THE U.S., THEY WEREN'T SO STRONG. BUT HERE WAS SOMETHING THAT I NOTICED GOING BACK INTO EARLY NOVEMBER IF WHEN I WAS MEETING WITH MY E.U. COUNTERPARTS AT SECURITY CONFERENCES OR WHEN THEY WERE IN D.C., THEY VIEWED PUTIN'S INTENTIONS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE UNITED STATES DID. WE WERE SEEING THE SAME FACTS ON THE GROUND, MOVEMENT OF TROOPS, ETC., ETC. BUT W THE U.S. WAS SAYING, HEY, LOOK, PUTIN'S GOING TO INVADE UKRAINE, EVEN ZELENSKYY AND SOME OF THE OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS WERE SAYING, HEY, DON'T PANIC, WE THINK IT'S AN EXERCISE, WE THINK IT'S A SHOW OF FORCE: SO THERE HAS NEVER BEEN DURING MY TIME IN THE SENATE A WIDER GULF BETWEEN THE U.S. AND OUR ALLIES ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN THAN THERE WAS WITH RESPECT TO THIS QUESTION OF WHAT PUTIN'S INTENTIONS WERE. AND AS LONG AS OUR ALLIES DIDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS GOING TO INVADE, IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THEM ONBOARD. SO JUST TO USE ONE EXAMPLE, WE REALLY WANTED THE NORD STREAM PIPELINE TO BE CANCELED. THAT WAS VERY, VERY TOUGH FOR GERMANY TO DO. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAS ABLE TO GET THE GERMANS TO COMMIT. WE WON'T CAP SELL IT, BUT IF RUSSIA INVADES, OKAY, WE'LL CANCEL IT. THAT TOOK A LOT OF WORK AT THE FRONT END TO GET THEM TO MAKE THAT PRIVATE COMMITMENT, BUT THEY CARRIED THROUGH ON IT AS SOON AS THE INVASION HAPPENED. SO, YOU'RE RIGHT, HAD WE ALL SEEN THE INTEL THE SAME WAY AND HAD EVERYBODY REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION THE U.S. DID THAT A THERE WAS GOING TO BE AN INVASION, YES, EARLIER SANCTIONS MIGHT HAVE WORKED BETTER, BUT WE WEREN'T ON THE SAME PAGE UNTIL THE INVASION HAPPENED. NEIL: SENATOR TIM KAINE, THANK YOU VE

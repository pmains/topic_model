well i think first and foremost we need to get a lot more transparency in the system to so people understand the costs um throughout that system that that's first and foremost secondly we need to uh ensure that we have more uh private sector and jobs and opportunities people who are doing the research for these my opponent vote for a bill that would destroy 58 000 jobs in the pharmaceutical sector in in new jersey alone you vote against before you vote for a bill that wouldn't allow for independent uh contractors to exist in the state of new jersey so i think there are there are things you can do on a predictable way while keeping um things like pre-existing conditions uh but i think the larger issue that we need to be focusing on is one of the things we've seen recently is that the health care system has a whole slew of cracks in it so when you're looking at things like nursing homes that were designed in the um by the 1950s and it was were singular uh without double rooms in nature we need to figure out how we do the medicare reimbursement rate and then and grow and find that solution as well okay thank you congressman yeah he's referred to this several times so i want to address it hr3 um he says it's going to cost jobs in new jersey let's talk about what it actually does he doesn't want to mention that what it actually does is it would allow medicare to negotiate with our pharmaceutical companies for the price of pharmaceutical drugs look we have wonderful pharmaceutical companies in our district they employ a lot of my constituents but we've got a problem in terms of the high cost of health care and the high constantly rising cost of pharmaceutical drugs the va negotiates with pharmaceutical companies this is the market this is capitalism we're supposed to set prices through negotiation more than 85 percent of the american people support this now i get it senator kaine takes money directly from pharmaceutical companies for his campaign that's why i don't take corporate contributions so that i can actually take an independent position on issues like this that affect the lives of my constituents

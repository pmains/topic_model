thank you madam chair um as you could probably guess from my opening comments madam secretary i see the climate as a discreet scientific issue i think it's a mistake to approach it with too much emotion passion is good but not when it interferes with your judgment i've got a couple of of 30 000 foot questions feet questions how much money in public and private dollars does the department think it would make it would take to make the world carbon neutral i don't have a number for that but probably a lot yeah hundreds of trillions of dollars you think it would be a lot for sure how much money uh in public and private doctors dollars does the department think it would take to make the united states carbon neutral again it would be a lot hundreds of trillions i don't know about hundreds of trillions but it would be a lot of money for it be on the trillions yes mid-trillions i don't know i understand here's my question to make the united states carbon neutral based on the administration's plans i think would be fair to say is going to cause displacement major displacement now i don't use that in a in a in a pejorative sense i think it's just an accurate description uh it's going to change our economy dramatically many people are going to gain many people are going to lose that's what i mean by displacement if we today spent these to be fair tens of trillions of dollars that i think many members of the administration would like to spend and make the united states of american carbon neutral and nobody else has our our aggressive adopts our aggressive approach and they only make modest gains in co2 emissions how much is going to lower the world temperature and how much is of it how much how much are we going to reduce carbon emissions um i want to say that the administration has a really firm commitment to communities to be able to take advantage of the economic opportunity i know madame secretary for interruption but we both both know now i'm i really want to try to probe your money we both know this is going to cause major displacement let's don't kid each other you're not going to turn coal miners into coaters overnight and you're not going to turn fossil fuel workers in into solar experts overnight and and they're not as many solar jobs as their oil and gas so i don't want to get off into that and i'm not trying to be critical of the administration but these are important questions uh if if we if we become carbon neutral and we don't get cooperation from china and india what have we done what have we accomplished the goal is to get cooperation from china i know but what if they don't what if we go spend these tens of trillions of dollars and president xi jinping the people of china are wonderful people by the way uh president xi on eyes like he breathes we know that the communist party they're gangsters what what if they what i mean they've probably built a coal power coal-powered power plant while you and i've been talking what have we achieved the administration has a strategy to make sure that all of our all of the people who have signed on to this paris agreement meet the goals that they have articulated and that means working with allies and that means uh uh i i i i get it i get it there but but but i'm asking a very practical question my son who i love dearly has a strategy to have his dad buy him a 911 targa porch is not gonna happen and i'm raising a very legitimate question i think if we spend these trillions of dollars and we go through all this displacement and we don't get cooperation from china and india what what what is the pain worth the gain and how do we know i would say um we have a strategy to get those countries on board and if we don't pursue this strategy what then then you have climate disasters that are upon us california is now could be on fire again this summer and if we don't take action then where are where is where are we with respect to the other disasters so we have to approach our allies and do our i get it i get it yeah if i if you can indulge me madam chair if we spend all the money that the obama administration wants to spend let's take in its current infrastructure bill to reduce co2 emissions what percentage of the increase in carbon emissions worldwide not the united states um is going to be reduced well the all of these countries have signed on all of them have not i'm talking about i know when you're trusting but i believe in metrics yeah but if you spend a lot of taxpayer dollars you ought to know first of all what you expect to get and realistically assess whether you're going to get it i don't want to go to let me ask you one last question uh how come your budget doesn't request any funding for the yucca mountain licensing the president's the administration doesn't support yucca mountain as a solution for uh nuclear waste okay thank you madam chair madam chair put that up right quick from um madam secretary does does the administration support if you know the strategic petroleum reserve yes okay um we've we we've got a lot of vacancies at the uh the strategic petroleum reserve and if you look at the website i know i know this isn't your you just got there but the website says this this page was last updated on december 15 2017. wow could you take a look at that for me they certainly will my understanding is that um that that uh they're they're understaffed there um i i've watched you madam secretary for years on on television before you became secretary you're you're very intelligent and even though i don't don't uh always agree with you you you you make very cogent arguments does your proposed budget include money for geoengineering no how come well i it's not been a solution that we i'm not i don't think it does no no it does not i think we want to address them and mitigate uh as best we can adapt where we can but we don't have geo-engineering as part of our budget but but if there's a i mean geoengineering my understanding of it it's it's global cooling there are things we can do to cool the earth that have based on science and cloud whitening for example um uh that's just one i mean what it would just seem to me and there's a whole science out there there's a lot of private dollars and r d being spent on geoengineering and if there's a way to re to to cool the earth um without without let's say destroying the fossil fuel industry why wouldn't we want to pursue that if the if the objective is to reduce temperatures we are interested in all kinds of technologies to be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce our warming but i will say and i wanted to say this to you when you uh had the first engagement with me that this administration is interested in carbon capture use and sequestration is interested in hydrogen is interested in direct air capture is interested in controlling the or managing the emissions off of fossil fuels so i just want you to understand that we are there with you on that yes and and i and i i i know uh you're being truthful and accurate uh but but there are a lot of members of the administration i think that that don't see the climate as a discrete scientific problem they see it as a religion and they they see it as a vehicle through which they can remake american society and i think they're approaching the issue with more zeal than wisdom i believe in metrics i believe in the in the prudent allocation of scarce resources you know what i'm talking about governors have to balance their budgets um and i i believe in metrics and if we're going to spend i don't know how many squillion dollars the president lately wants to spend on that we don't have even five percent of um to on the environment and i i believe in the environment we all do we all want clean air and bright water but but at some point you have to at you have to judge the expenditure of taxpayer dollars with metrics and what i worry about is that we're going to turn the american economy upside down we're going to turn a lot of american lives upside down we're going to make them a bunch of promises just like we made them with made them promises with globalization don't worry your life will be better and think about that when you're in the unemployment line that's what we told a lot of americans they were going to do this without a big picture in terms of where we're going to end up toward that end let me ask you this question if you know and maybe the under secretary knows if you don't because i know you can't know everything tell me five concrete steps that india is taking today to reduce its co2 emissions well i know i mean india is looking at wind looking at solar looking at hydrogen looking at carbon capture and is trying to replace its coal with natural gas i know they're looking at all that stuff president chi says they're looking at it too as he continually builds oh no they i mean they are deployed excuse me friend i don't mean to interrupt you but they are deploying those methods including distributed strategies uh like we were discussing where they don't have to have the grid but but some kind of distributed microgrid how much money did did did did modi spend last year in india i don't know to reduce co2 i don't know sir i don't know the answer to that okay it was under a billion wasn't it i don't know the answer okay what you do is what you believe everything else is just conversation and and that's what worries me about this whole approach of course president xi and and and and mr modi are going to say the right things but you have to judge people by what they do and i asked our epa administrator a few week few months ago maybe weeks ago time kind of runs together i said if we pass the president's infrastructure bill only five percent of which is true traditional infrastructure the rest is the green new deal and other things how much is it going to reduce co2 emissions in the world and he couldn't answer that question so we're going to spend you know how many trillions of dollars and we don't know what the end game is that's my problem we um we spent i believe 90 billion dollars last year cleaning up after these extreme weather events so if we don't take action it will be far more expensive as these events escalate i would also say that there is a 23 trillion dollar global market for the products that reduce co2 emissions 23 trillion right and the question is are we going to take advantage of that can we create economic opportunity for for the people who work in fos the fossil fuel industry to be able to create energy 2.0 by managing the emissions and look you you you you make very good points but here's my point president i'm gonna say it again president biden what's the latest cost of his infrastructure bill two and a half trillion one point three i think is what you're negotiating um it's let's call it two two trillion to be fair um president biden says spend two trillion dollars a big chunk of that is the green new deal and my question is very simple if we spend this money to reduce co2 emissions how much is going to be reduced worldwide doesn't matter in the united states it matters worldwide and we all have an answer to that the entire world has signed on to the agreement in the entire world's not spending two trillion dollars the entire world is spending more than that our world is not most of this is lip service you and i both know it that's not what we're seeing i agree that we have to verify and that we have to make sure that people are living up to their commitments and that's what these agreements are all about but i understand your skepticism because you have to verify yes ma'am and what i've verified is that we're being asked to spend two trillion dollars and the world's biggest emitter of co2 is china the third biggest is india and their attitude seems to be go get them we'll hold your coat while you do that meanwhile president xi keeps building power plants fueled by coal and he's been known to to reside on the scarce side of being honest i'm went way over i'm in big trouble i'm sorry

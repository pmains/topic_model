be at a barbecue or a park or whatever might be celebrating the birth of our country the ideals of who we are as a nation and all that we aspire to be the highland park parade is a very very important centerpiece of our community prior to covet families would gather putting their chairs out sometimes the day or even two days before planning exactly where they would sit to have the best view knowing that their kids or maybe grandkids their classmates members of their church or synagogue their service organization were going to be marching in the parade and they'd want to be able to look and wave say hello this year was different though this year was the first parade since 2019 because in 2020 in 2021 the parade was cancelled due to covet there was a special excitement there was a special feeling in anticipation in anticipation of the parade this year finally we were back together as a community highland park is a special community a city of roughly 30 000 people but with a small town feel neighbors look after each other people know each other the restaurants in the community are frequent frequented by the locals everyone has their favorite and it's like you're seeing old friends every time you go in this year the parade was going to be special 10 o'clock time the parade starts every year the excitement swells groups start walking along the path up st john street up the hill to central where everyone takes a left turn they walk across the train tracks proceed past first street then second all the way through the downtown to green bay and then down the hill towards the post office reaching sunset turning into sunset park at the end of the parade the parade started on time at ten o'clock the first groups walked up the hill and made that left turn people were cheering celebrating smiling the first groups made the left turn crossed first crossed second second group pass third fourth at 10 14. everything changed what initially started or sounded like firecrackers and sure why not it's the fourth of july people quickly realized was a different sound altogether those who were right there at the corner of 2nd and central looked and saw that people were falling people were bleeding at 10 14 a.m on july 4th 2022 the independence day parade was shattered when a monster with a high-powered military-style assault weapon having climbed a roof dressed as a woman to hide himself as he would leave leaned over the edge and fired 83 shots in a minute 83 shots striking the parade goers below killing seven wounding dozens and changing a community forever i rise today to

jackie never lacked a smile or a hug for anybody in fact she was there for everybody she survived by her husband her daughter and an entire community devastated the loss of such a caring person eduardo avaldo is survived by his wife maria four daughters 12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren actually i think he has 13 grandchildren he was born in mexico and was loved as a jovial bowling champion i talked to his kids about his love for bowling eduardo happily attended the parade with his children and grandchildren later that day after the shooting his daughters were pleading with the entire community on social media to join them in prayer as eduardo fought valiantly to survive the family began to pray for strength the community prayed with them eduardo was incredibly affectionate with everyone in his family but especially especially his grandchildren he loved seeing spending time on these special occasions and would take a photo with his grandson every year on that monday that fateful monday his daughter couldn't take a photo and now she believes that god did not want her to have a reminder of that day arena and kevin mccarthy met while working together they married about five years ago and moved to highland park in 2018. the couple had a two-year-old son named aiden who marina and her husband kevin were obsessed with on july 4th they joined together they went to the parade they were right at the corner when the gunshots started kevin and arena did what all parents do they covered aiden's body to protect him and in defending their son they sacrificed themselves aidan was found wandering the area covered in blood after the gunfire the ring family took aiden to their home he played with their two-year-old daughter after they cleaned him up and watched tv with the ring grandfather eventually aiden was reunited with his grandfather of course because aidan now was an orphan his parents had been murdered when aiden's grandfather picked him up aiden had a single question her mommy and daddy coming soon arena was 35 years old kevin was 37. they were deprived of the most precious thing being parents to their child being able to raise him to celebrate his birthdays his adulthood weddings and maybe children of his own community is united behind aidan community struggles to fathom how is this possible aidan will now grow up having only the memory of his parents not the hugs and not the love that he deserves aidan's not the only innocent child whose life has been changed many many have been injured and wounded among them most grievously as cooper roberts a vibrant beautiful eight-year-old boy who as we speak as i speak is fighting for his life in the hospital cooper was at the parade with his family his twin brother his parents his mother was also shot his brother was wounded when his mother learned after her surgery that cooper's spinal cord had been severed she demanded to be immediately released from the hospital so she could be by his side as every mother would do cooper's injuries besides the severed spinal cord continue he's had a torn esophagus infections and a collapsed lung already cooper has had seven surgeries and kept sedated because of the pain during a brief moment of consciousness cooper asked to see his twin brother and his dog the family continues to keep the community updated and i and our entire community are praying for cooper's recovery cooper's life and the lives of many others have been saved because of the work of emergency medics police firefighters nurses and doctors who have gone to extraordinary links to meet the needs of our community i'd like to take some time to reflect and celebrate some of those heroes i mentioned the parade had just started many groups had gone by one of the groups that had just crossed over 2nd street were the firefighters on the truck celebrating because in highland park i mentioned we are like everywhere around the country a small town where it's home for so many people the the fire truck it wasn't just the firefighters on the truck it was their families their wives and their kids because they're all part of our community as the shots rang out firefighters realized what was going on concern for their kids they they rushed the truck ahead to keep their kids safe but those firefighters without hesitation of a second turned around and ran back to the corner into the fire to make sure that everyone was safe the highland park fire department transported 24 patients and administered cpr to many more highland park fire chief joe schrog recalls one man on his own tied 15 tourniquets that day one man 15 tourniquets it's more than just the firefighters i'll come back to the police in a second these are trained professionals they behaved the way they were trained and they were extraordinary but there are also many people who may have been medically trained but not for a situation like this they responded as true american heroes do bobby shapiro is a tech salesman in fact he has no medical training but suddenly in the flash of a moment he became a first responder and began doing whatever he could to help he found an elderly man with a gunshot gunshot wound to his thigh and abdomen bobby and another bystander gave the man chest compressions they applied pressure to his wounds as dr wendy rush an anesthesiologist at the parade helped another the man to breathe after 30 minutes bobby boarded an ambulance with the elderly man and stayed by his side all the way to the hospital the man bobby stood by with steven strauss one of the seven victims that day bobby wasn't alone though commander jerry cameron also attended to stephen strauss he made sure police commanders jerry cameron and he made sure that stephen strauss wouldn't be alone because as i said highland park is a community that many of us call home and we treat each other as if they're family david baum dr david baum a fixture of highland park who's been there so long i shouldn't say so long but dr baum delivered my two sons my wife and our two sons nearly 30 years ago our oldest son and less than two years later our younger son i've seen dr baum under pressure i've seen dr baum perform with care and compassion dr baum after the shooting after sheltering initially behind a bench with david selleck rushed to treat bodies he could only describe as having wartime injuries he didn't know where the shooter was he didn't know the shooting had finished in fact he didn't know that the shooter wouldn't be caught for eight hours but he knew he had to help and that's what he did lake county sheriff john eidelberg was waiting to start the parade i walk in many parades with john i know him as a wonderful person my group was in the same location and as soon as the firing started the people who were waiting all immediately cleared out of the area not john eidelberg john eidelberg as he stepped under the parade route saw a group of people running towards him the wrong direction shouting shots fired shots fired instinctively as the marine and long-time long-time law enforcement officer that he is he ran the other direction towards the gunshots unarmed sheriff eidelberg remembers seeing a lot of blood on the sidewalks and street when they arrived at the corner of central and second he immediately with the assistance of another officer ordered all available resources to the scene as he watched victims being attended he noticed a woman on her stomach with blood coming from her back sheriff eidelberg immediately began to apply pressure to a wound with gauze that was provided by an emergency worker as he applied the pressure the sheriff comforted the woman i'm here for you he said i'm not going anywhere he told her he stayed with that woman for 30 minutes as they waited for an ambulance while her husband coordinated the care of her daughter they had brought along these are the stories of my community of my friends i mentioned the police and fire departments i mentioned that the police or the fire department transported 24 patients and administered cpr applied tourniquets the police who were also a part of the parade were there in a blink of an eye without hesitation relying on their training and instinct they immediately responded to the needs of our community an incredible story is highland park officer ginger strokes ginger stokes officer stokes had been with the police department since 1997 working the juvenile investigation unit the patrol division the crisis intervention team during the attack officer stokes had in her car in addition to her vest she wears every day that would not stop a rifle round she grabbed her rifle rated vest a second vest as she saw the injured she saw one in particular an injured woman she took off that rifle rated rest vest and put it over the woman then despite not having that protective vest she ran back into the line of fire officer stokes astounding heroism commander jerry cameron's astounding heroism in fact the heroism of all the first responders police and fire in highland park is nothing short of amazing and there are no words i or a community community can fully express to convey the appreciation and gratitude we have for them without the immense work taken on by first responders that day i fear that the tragedy could have been far far worse first responders and the civilians who went to help i thank and praise all of these people i'm grateful for them and i pray for their well-being i ask you to keep them in your prayers as well our community is in pain as we think about the loss we've experienced the members of our community who are gone our first responders share that grief with us and the pace of their work doesn't slow down in fact for an entire week the blocks around the shooting were cordoned off as a crime scene police were searching the area collecting evidence other police officers were making sure that it stayed secure protecting the area if you looked at the police cars or the names on the police cars it didn't say highland park said glencoe deerfield niles morton grove prospect heights so many more because first responders from the entire area around highland park came to help us it wasn't just in the days after keeping the area safe and secure it was at the immediate time of the event first responders from around our community as well as the state police and federal agencies fbi atf all descended immediately onto highland park i had the chance later in the day to see the command center where they were focused with incredible professionalism incredible focus and amazingly swift action they identified the shooter located the shooter and apprehended him if not for all these people their work their diligence their professionalism their excellence i don't know that the shooter would be captured today following the shooting the community has united in an extraordinary way others have come to help this is my community these were my neighbors all of the people at the parade who experienced this shooting who will be forever affected by this shooting are the people i live with and i see every day i know their grief their struggle their anger and that's one of the reasons why i'm so grateful for all of the people from areas around who have come to support us one example is at the high school they set up a response center to provide counseling services for anybody who might need it 800 i believe it's 800 counselors have come already to the high school to talk to residents anyone who stops by already in just a matter of 10 days more than 3 000 people have received comfort and counsel trying to get through a very difficult time there's other stories after the shooting as the police gathered and first responders a food truck started serving meals to the responders for free soon customers made donations to cover the cost of those meals a generous family called the owners of the food truck and said they would pay for every meal provided to first responders on friday highland park is strong highland park will get through this time in no small part because of the care love and compassion expressed by our friends and neighbors we'll lean on each other we'll lift each other up we couldn't do it without the love that came into our community but as rabbi wendy geffen said at the funeral funeral for jackie sondheim we shouldn't have to be here we shouldn't have to be here no one should be able to get a weapon of war a gun designed for one purpose to kill human beings with extreme efficiency ultimate devastation to kill others as quickly and rapidly as possible i hope that no one ever has to come back to this podium and share stories of a mass shooting in their community like i have today like what we saw in uvalde or in buffalo that's why i've called for a ban ban on assault weapons but gun violence is a scourge in our country that takes many forms every day 111 people die from gun violence whether from shootings in the street gang violence domestic violence two-thirds of the deaths by gun violence in this country are suicides there are far too many accidental shootings of guns left carelessly on a coffee table or some other accident that would be so easy to avoid i hope my colleagues will work to try to reduce the gun violence we have in this country unlike anything in any other country in the world but today today i stand to honor the memories and lives of of the loved ones we lost people who truly were the center of the universe for their families and pillars of strength in their community to honor people like bobby shapiro sheriff eidelberg officer stokes commander cameron and moving to hear the stories of so many others i want to express my sincerest thanks to all those who played a role in saving lives on july 4th but also thanks to the many people who have spoken up and shared their stories people at the vigils in churches and synagogues in highland park at sunset park on wednesday night people who gathered together in a moment of silence as we did here in this very body at the same time at city hall in highland park the people who came to washington with march 4th a group that on wednesday rallied for changes in our gun laws to make a difference in lives and fight to make sure no other community experiences what we have in highland park in uvalde buffalo el paso las vegas pittsburgh orlando denver the list just goes on and on we can't wait any longer to take meaningful action on this violence our grandkids can't afford to wait our kids shouldn't be made to wait our entire country deserves better madam speaker i close by saying this the last 11 days have been incredibly painful for my community highland park will recover we've experienced something that no other community should ever experience and too many communities suffer from each and every day it breaks my heart to realize that in all likelihood i will not be the last member of congress giving this speech it's possible it's possible that in fact this may not be the last time i have to give a speech like this enough is enough i hope the members of this body will find the courage to take action and save lives let's start by getting the assault weapons ban in place these military weapons of war designed to kill and devastate off our streets and let's always honor the memory of those who should be with us here today but were murdered in the primes of their lives may their memories and the memories of all lost to gun violence forever be a blessing i yield back

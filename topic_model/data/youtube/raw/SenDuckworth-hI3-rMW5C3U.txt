do you trust that they are not manipulating intelligence do you feel like you can take at face value what they are saying the intelligence is telling them unfortunately I don't trust a lot of that's coming out of this White House which is why I am asking for a briefing listen Congress is the only branch and has a ability to declare war we deserve to get this information and we really is very troubling to me that they say that what this information exists we're pulling out our us personnel from our embassies our allies are not so you telling me that we're not sharing this important information with our allies and we're leaving them in the lurch this this item in the New York Times reporting that was in part about that that partial embassy closer closure caught my eye I wanted to get your reaction to it one American officials speaking on the condition of anonymity so the new intelligence of an increased Iranian threat was quote small stuff and did not merit the military planning being driven by mr. Bolton the official also said the ultimate goal of the year-long economic sanctions Kampai the campaign by the Trump administration was to draw Iran into an armed conflict with the United States is that a legitimate objective of u.s. foreign policy well I don't think it's a legitimate its objective at all but do I think that that is the objective of mr. Bolton yes but that just strikes me as manifestly wrong I mean it just should not be the case that any US administration is trying to draw anyone into armed conflict I agree that should not be the case and in fact only Congress has the ability to declare war let merest at and frankly if such intelligence in from exist then they need to brief the members of Congress listen I've got a top secret clearance I'm happy to go and listen to the intelligence estimates I know that the president is not very keen on listening to intelligence briefings but I am I take my job very seriously so come on give me this briefing and in a bipartisan way that members here in the Senate have called for such a briefing and yet we still have not received one you know it's someone who probably knows better than anyone is serving United States Congress at this point or as well as anyone in the United States Congress what the realities of war look like do you what do you think the odds are of some kind of military escalation right now do you trust the president to be judicious and and even-tempered in this well of course I don't think that the president will be has ever been described as even-tempered I also don't trust mr. bolter I think he's driving the train on this I don't think mr. Trump is and it's that because that's our commander in chief I think mr. Bolton is the one who is driving this escalation and it frankly it is terrifying and deeply concerning to me that someone who's not elected by the American people is making these key decisions and pushing us towards a greater and greater escalation and again if this truly exists and share the information with the Senate with the Senate let it me see those estimates and if they truly exist and there's a real threat then why are you not sharing them with our allies or in the region final question you talked about Congress being obviously the branch that declares war we have seen Congress flexes muscle on this question with regards to Yemen in which in bipartisan majorities in both houses passed a War Powers Resolution just to direct the u.s. withdrawal from any involvement in that conflict do you think there would be similar votes to stop US military conflict with Iran among your colleagues particularly Republicans especially if they don't I do think that there could be a similar vote especially if they do not share any credible estimates with us any credible intelligence reports that show that there's an increased threat if they can't produce anything then yes I think there could potentially be such a vote all right senator tammy duckworth of illinois thank you for your time thanks for having me on Chris

joining me now wyoming senator cynthia lumas senator lumus you were fabulous on our panel at america first today thank you very much for that i just want to ask you you probably saw the announcement uh biden is going to take another 20 million out of the strategic petroleum reserve i think that will rob about half 50 percent now of those reserves for national security what you think about that i think that's a worthless crazy strategy what we need to do is produce more liquid natural gas here in the united states so we can ship it to europe so we can wean them of that dirty russian natural gas we need to be able to ship our liquid natural gas to india so we can help them clean up their air and if we're serious about addressing global climate change that's where we need to put our bang for our bucks we need to get rid of regulations esg regulations and regulations at the epa that are stifling our ability to prove produce oil and gas here we can produce it so much cleaner than anyone else can we can have the jobs we can have the revenue we can increase our economy we can become energy independent and we can still help global climate change be addressed by americans i mean if china and india buy our lng instead of doing coal we would do more than the whole paris treaty i mean we would actually reduce world emissions i've only got 30 seconds left but what you think no that's absolutely true we can address global emissions by sending our clean natural gas to india they'll accept it they'll burn it right now they're burning not only coal but manure they're burning manure there are 700 million people in india who don't even have a light bulb this is the way that we can address global climate change china's on its own it's going to have dirty air because that's their policy but we can help india thank you very much we'll do another one soon thank you

thank you madam Speaker madam Speaker over 60 years ago united states president sent advisors to a nation in asia he did so because a regime that was perceived as friendly to us interest but which was in fact deeply corrupt and rotten was threatened he promised that those advisors would not engage in combat that they were there to protect american military equipment years later with 60,000 dead americans and billions and billions of dollars expended the helicopter off from Saigon and the Vietnamese regime fell today another US president is sending advisors to a nation in Asia in Asia and contemplating airstrikes in a threeway civil war in Iraq this president is doing it purportedly to preserve a nation which was the creation as secretary Albright says of British and French diplomats lying to each other almost a hundred years ago it is a nation which while we have paid gravely in blood and treasure to preserve may not have the support of its own people as usual politics are intruding the architects of the Iraq war under george w bush see the possibility of redemption for their mistakes and so unbelievably they are accusing this president of losing iraq let's be very clear iraq cannot be lost or won a brutal dictator or the united states military can sit on top of conflicts between Sunni and Shiite and sex and tribes that have roiled that society for centuries but remove that dictator or remove the US military and those conflicts will re-emerge at the end of the day it is Iraqis and Iraqis alone who have to decide whether their nation will be preserved whether there will be multiple countries reflecting multiple face or whether there will be one pluralistic nation whether they will live in the 21st century the seventh century a Caliphate what kind of nation they will have is up for them to determine there is an argument of course that Isis the terrorists who have made such astounding gains in regions of Iraq are bad and brutal people this is true I sit on the Intelligence Committee and see every day the outrages that they perpetrate they've made mistakes one their brutality will ultimately be their undoing with their own people and second they are now occupying territory this means that they have addresses just as there are terrorists in Nigeria in Somalia in Libya in Lebanon in Syria in Iraq in Iran in Egypt in Morocco the list goes on there are terrorists in the Sunni areas of Iraq but the answer cannot be that the United States military will be there to prevent them from doing what they would wish to do our interests let's be clear about what our interests are it must first and foremost be up to the citizens of those nations that I've just listed to determine what sort of society they will live in we cannot do it for them and when we try it does not end well and we must say to these nations that if you work to craft an inclusive society respecting your minorities respecting the rights of the individual and of women in particular if you abide by international norms we will be at your side we did this 240 years ago when we know a little something about how one might do it and if not we will not be at your side number two our interest is to say to them that if in the birthing pains of your new societies you nurture or support or in any way assist those terrorists that would target us or that would target our ally Israel or would target other civilized nations we will find them we will fix them and we will take them off the battlefield as we are doing around the world today those are our national interests those goals are worth our time our treasure and our balint coaching a team in a threeway civil war is not colleagues let us not expend one more dollar for one more life on military activity that is not in the clear service of our essential national interests

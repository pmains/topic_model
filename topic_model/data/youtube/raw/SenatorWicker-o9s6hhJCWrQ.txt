you so much Mr chairman I am delighted to be here today uh to say a word or two about the importance that TVA continues to have for our region and for my state of Mississippi and to congratulate all three nominees I'm sure Mr White and Mr Rich are absolutely outstanding but to give as ringing of in of an endorsement as I possibly can for Bill renick of Ashland Mississippi a word or two about the history of TVA in 1930 Mississippi had electric power in 85 percent of its larger municipalities but only 1.5 percent of rural farms and homes and um coming along in 1933 TBA was a game changer the goal was simple to improve living and economic conditions in seven southeastern states and TVA has done that and continues to that to do that in new and different ways um I grew up in the small town of Pontotoc Mississippi um and I'll I'll help your transcribers spell that later on Mr chairman but I now make my home um in my wife's native town of Tupelo and we've lived there for some decades Tupelo is proudly known as the first TVA City uh was the first to purchase electric power from the Tennessee Valley Authority and the TVA lights came on in Tupelo in 1934. today TBA utilities are located in 36 of our 82 counties and served more than 359 000 households TVA has made significant contributions to our economic developments between 2017 and 2021 TVA created or retained over 26 000 jobs in Mississippi and invested 3.6 billion dollars in our economy so they are far far more than a provider of electric power they are a job Creator uh for places like Cooper Tire Cooper Tire and Steel Dynamics and Milwaukee Tools in North Mississippi which leads me to um my enthusiastic endorsement of uh Bill renick to serve on the TVA board um I served with Bill renick in the state senate back in alt 88 and and forward um he is um he's a great job creator um he he has worked for uh Three Rivers Planning and Development district from which he is now retired and we have a wonderful um group of Planning and Development districts but I I can tell you none finer than three rivers Planning and Development District he was a Workforce division director there Mr chairman he currently chairs the commission on the future of North Mississippi and let me say a word about bipartisanship and and I think the the ranking member um Mr inhof will will agree with this um uh Senator Markey is a dear personal friend of mine our our wives are uh are cordial we try to agree on things when we can let me tell you about bipartisanship Bill renick was elected as alderman mayor County supervisor and state senator as a North Mississippi Democrat back in the day he went right straight from that Mr chairman to being the campaign manager for a Statewide candidate for governor on the Republican ticket he went right from there to being the chief staff person in the Mississippi State senate for a republican lieutenant governor of the state of Mississippi and it wasn't very many years after that that a certain Democratic governor of Mississippi was looking around for talent and a new um a new chief of staff for his Democratic Administration and he chose bill renick so having managed a campaign Statewide as a republican having been a chief of staff as a Republican and a chief of staff as a Democrat we need more bipartisanship like Bill renick can deliver and also we need the job creation and work training expertise that bill renick will uh bring to this office Mr chairman have I made it clear the enthusiasm I have and the and the great Fortune we have in this nation and in the TVA region for the fact that the president has nominated Mr Bill rennick and I yield

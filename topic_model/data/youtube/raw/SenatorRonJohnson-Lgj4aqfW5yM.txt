senators Lankford and Johnson are praying nothing like that will happen to them they're hoping to quietly eliminate Columbus Day and then move on to the next item on the riders lists of demands will they be able to do that what all depends on whether or not you let them know that you noticed they're trying to cancel Columbus Day if you don't say anything about it there is no telling what Johnson & Langford might do next just the other day for example the New York Times ran a piece suggesting that we knocked down George Washington statutes and purged our country's founder from our collective memory today the paper announced that we should consider closing Mount Rushmore because of course racism senators Johnson Lankford have not yet endorsed those ideas at this rate it may not be long before they do so the question is what other acts of revolution and cultural desecration can we expect from our suddenly woke Republican senator friends that's a good question we're gonna ask mark Stein in just a minute what do you think they will do if you don't say anything which other holidays will they be canceled obviously July 4th will be first on the list as any one of the New York Times can tell you America is inherently racist and has always been there for celebrating Independence is no less racist and then of course Presidents Day officially Presidents Day is Washington's birthday and as you just heard he is evil to evil to have a statue so how can he have a holiday it doesn't make sense and by the way every single president has been a man sexism anyone don't tell Langford and Johnson how about Thanksgiving no way we can stick that holiday on our calendar not only was it established by Abraham Lincoln a man so filthy his statue is being removed from Boston but not a single one of the pilgrims wasn't from England Veterans Day and Memorial Day will until 70 years ago the Armed Forces were segregated some of the people who fought and died in America's wars were racist so you can't honor them come on off the calendar you'd think that New Year's Day would be safe nothing controversial about New Year's Day Oh dig into the history ladies and gentlemen the Romans were the first civilization to start the year on January 1st and guess what the Romans owned slaves and why stop by the way at official holidays why are any holidays acceptable Mother's Day and Father's Day both perpetuate the gender binary Halloween is just a festival of cultural appropriation it must go valentine's day offensive for obvious reasons love is bourgeois what else will they do if we don't stop them to answer that question we're joined by our old friend Mark Steyn good to see mark are you concerned they're gonna get rid of more stuff good see you to target yeah this is why I should preface everything I say by you said there a couple of days ago that the Republicans are the only alternative to the complete Biden aoc takeover so we got to drag this sorry worthless Bunch across the finish line in November but I must say I didn't think it really possible to despise Republican senators any more than I do but these two guys surrendering Columbus you know with conservatives like this who needs Marxist Leninist violent anarchist and Tifa types on the street when you meet lunatics halfway it makes you a lunatic - I actually would like to replace Groundhog Day with Republican senator day when the senator emerges from the Senate and accidentally sees his backbone but then goes back inside for the next six years and never gives it another thought these these guys don't understand that unless you're willing to surrender everything you better surrender nothing because they're only going to come back for more the paradox here and there are so many vote but by the way I should say I know both these senators and they're both smart and they both routinely make conservative noises but contrast what they did today with what Joe Biden who is a left where it's the extent he has any views at all and certainly a puppet of radicals but I think Biden has not called for getting rid of Columbus and yet two Republican senators have their Walker than the Democratic nominee how does that work well I think that's exactly the problem here people are pining for an alternative to what they see on the streets in France president Mac Hong whom I regard as a ridiculous dinky dweeby metrosexual globalists nothing has nevertheless come out and said no you're not taking a one statue we're not changing a single street name you can go to hell it's a old part of our history that guy has actually got more backbone than that then the Republican Party some bigshot Ayatollah in Iran I forget it's not the Supreme Ayatollah but it's like the deputy assistant under supreme Ayatollah of Iran he said today this is fantastic 40 years ago it was just the Iranian saying death to America now you switch on the TV and in Atlanta and Minneapolis and Portland and Seattle there are thousands of Americans in effect saying death to America he gets it these people are at war with the American idea so the Republican response is to propose a holiday two weeks before July the 4th that would in effect become the rival and would be touted as the rival to July the 4th so every Juneteenth that's when you'd have all the celebrities they'd be having the big parades and July the 4th would wither and die if this is conservatism if this is the Republican Party then for God's sake just get out of the way will will drag you across the finish line in November but at least let us call you the worthless contemptible nothing slug dead husk party as we do so sorry I'm ok no I think you have every right to them and I think all of us feel imperiled right now threatened because we are and the people we voted for and send money to in order to protect us have joined the other side I just have to ask you about the question of gene teenth so I think most people familiar with American history would say emancipation is one of the great moments in the end tire 240 years of America why are the people who say they support Juneteenth against the person who made emancipation possible Abraham Lincoln they're tearing down a statue as they're demanding a Juneteenth holiday that doesn't make any sense at all because it's about inflicting damage on the existing American order so if you mean emancipation in the form of the Lincoln statue that was taken down in Boston they're happy to see it go emancipation doesn't mean anything to them the Juneteenth holiday is going to be the anti July the 4th holiday and actually as far as Republicans are concerned I think Republican senators should have their own Emancipation Day for the Wednesday after the Tuesday night election when they are emancipated from their entire campaign platform and don't have to pretend they're tough on immigration tough on crime tough on giant China and can just go back to being worthless jelly spying nothing's for the next six years Emancipation Day four Republican senators first Wednesday in November I'd like to see them emancipated from control of their donors that might help Mark Steyn thank you for that perspective great to see you tonight thanks a lot Tucker so as

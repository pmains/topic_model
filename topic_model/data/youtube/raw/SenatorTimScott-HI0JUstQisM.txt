all right after slamming Florida re-strengthened hurricane Ian is heading towards the Carolinas the category one storm could pack 85 miles in our winds and cause major flooding and joining us now is South Carolina Senator Senator Tim Scott good morning to you senator thank you Ainsley good morning to you as well hope everybody is doing well there and they're safe yeah we're worried about y'all because uh Adam klotz our meteorologist is saying it's probably going to hit Charleston around lunchtime and in addition to that it coincides with high tide what do you want to tell the folks of South Carolina stay home stay indoors right now we are literally just beginning this hurricane the truth is that with high tide culminating right at the time where the storm is hitting that is the time to stay indoors if you go out you put more First Responders in danger if you do not have to leave your home right now don't do it the good news is we have been preparing for this for several days now the governor has been cooperating and collaborating with the federal officials I got a call yesterday from secretary by orcas from Homeland Security the governor spoke with Rick Scott Marco Rubio as well just so that we're all on the same page learning from each other thank God for a coordinated effort and being a little battle hardened in South Carolina as we faced hurricane after Hurricane uh this one we should take it very seriously so one thing was pretty clear is Florida knows exactly what they needed they need more high water vehicles I don't know if it's right for you to give any of that to Florida because you might need them too what do you need from the federal government if this thing hits you as hard as it did Florida you know we just see that we have open lines of communication as absolutely essential number one number two we want to make sure that we don't ask for anything that diverts attention from Florida unless we need it we stand by and this is the most important day for us in this hurricane getting through today we'll be able to assess what the needs are from from for us here in South Carolina and then what we don't need we will be sending our assets to Florida as well we hope and pray for the people in Florida as well as our family and friends here in South Carolina it's an important perspective for sure but as you as this is barreling towards South Carolina how Senator do you make the determination about what neighborhoods or what areas say and hunker down and which ones evacuate considering a storm surge that could be seven feet already in low-lying areas is that a neighborhood by neighbor has that information already been disseminated how are those decisions made yeah that's a great question Pete one of the things that happens is the South County Emergency division has been working with the governor's office for the last several days to determine where the most high potential flooding is at four to seven feet it's a lot of water in the Low Country there's no doubt about that and so you think about those communities especially the peninsula flooding happens if it's a light sprinkle so something like what we're having today will be a serious issue we've already seen businesses closing uh they're trying their best to be prepared the truth is that the peninsula is where you start seeing the the likelihood of people getting out of the getting out of Harm's Way Mount Pleasant seems to be pretty safe Georgetown because of the the storm has shifted a little bit more East so we're seeing more impact in Georgetown higher winds as well so the mandatory evacuation was not issued because it was not necessary according to the governor's a collaboration with the South clay Emergency Management division so when you look at Downtown Charleston uh it it can flood very easily as you know even in just a rainstorm did most of the people evacuate downtown we were showing some images earlier of MUSC the hospital there that's huge and the lights that look like we're on did they evacuate that what about The Citadel are schools closed there well the schools are certainly closed for any in-classroom activities but most people that I've talked to and I've been on the phone a lot that stayed in place downtown Charleston I think there is this you get used to hurricanes so you start taking it for granted it's one of the reasons why I've been saying constantly if you can get out of Harm's Way get out of Harm's Way we're now entering into the time where the best thing to do for yourself and for the Emergency responders is to stay where you are if you're in low-lying areas you should have already left if you have not consider it but the truth is staying in place right now is probably the best thing you can do for yourself as well as the emergency responders that have to come rescue people who wait too late to move Senator Tim Scott thank you very much stay safe thanks for the Insight thank you sir thanks Brian y'all take care you got it all right everyone press date too

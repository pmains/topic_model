hi I'm Eric Burleson with another Capitol report and today in the capital I'm pleased to let you know that we have a rally that's gathering in the Capitol Rotunda here on the first floor for Second Amendment rights citizens from all over the state of Missouri are gathering here to express their views on how we should protect their rights to keep and to bear arms and I should I wanted to let you know in this Capitol report what we're doing is legislators to ensure that right and to and to help ensure it and more we have a House bill called 17 Hospital 1787 that's sponsored by representative kenny jones and the bill does several things it extends castle doctrine to property owners of property and not just in their home we have many times including the bill sponsor himself where gun violence occurred on their property and not necessarily inside of their home and it so this would protect those citizens that wanted to fend themselves in those instances and that they could use deadly force in order to defend their their lives and the lives of their family and their property in those instances this bill also does some changes to the concealing carry law the currently conceal and carry is only available for those who are 23 years of age and older this bill would lower that age restriction to the age of 21 it also would allow for employees that were attorneys that working what county courthouses across the state to be able to express their to be able to express their ride to be able to carry a concealed weapon to poor safety into the county courthouses and for their own protection it also ensures the rights of employees that work here in the Capitol building to be able to carry concealed weapons as well currently legislators are able to carry concealed but not employees this is a good build that I support I filed legislation this year that Pro that I believe is good Second Amendment legislation from my own story that I had back home and that phil was is here it's house bill 1291 and hopefully we can get this bill moved this year or perhaps next year house bill 1291 extends the time period for the conceal and carry endorsement it's my belief that the conceal and carry endorsement is too expensive it costs most most people most citizens over two hundred dollars just in order to get a conceal and carry permit it costs a hundred dollars to go through training and another hundred dollars to actually pay for the permit at the sheriff's office that's a very expensive be just in order to express your rights and and so I would like for that conceal and carry endorsement period time to be extended and so if you support my view on this please let me know let me know your thoughts and opinions on this and other bills on my website and Eric Burleson com or on my facebook page thank you

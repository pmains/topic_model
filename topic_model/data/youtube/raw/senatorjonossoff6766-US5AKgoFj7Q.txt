MADE IN 2019. >> DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? >> YES, SIR. >> THIS IS A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POLICY? >> YES, SIR. WE MADE IT STRONGER SINCE THEN. >> OKAY, THANK YOU. SENATOR OSSOFF, YOU'RE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. >> THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. AND ADMINISTRATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I WANT TO BEGIN BY ADDRESSING STAFF CAPACITY CONCERNS AND DELAYS THAT ARE, IN PARTICULAR, AFFECTING HARTSFIELD-JACKSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN ATLANTA. AS COUNTRY RETURNS TO AIR TRAVEL AFTER THE WORST PERIODS THAT'S FAR OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AIRLINE PASSENGERS HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED BY CANCELLATIONS AND LONG LINES AT AIRPORTS IN GEORGIA IN ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OVER THE PAST YEAR, MANY AIRPORTS HAVE FACED DELAYS DUE TO A STAFFING CAPACITY ISSUES THAT HE IS A SECURITY CHECKPOINTS. HOW IS TSA PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING WORKFORCE SHORTAGES THROUGH EXPANDED RECRUITMENT AND EMPLOYEE RETENTION EFFORTS? >> SIR, THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. AND THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE TEAM AT 80 L, VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. WE ARE SEEING RAPID RECOVERY OF TRAVEL TO THE POINT OF 90% WHERE WE ARE OVERALL PRETEND AMOK. THREE YEARS AGO, WHERE ABOUT 90% OF THOSE LEVELS. OUR STAFF IS NOT WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE BUT, IN GENERAL, ACROSS OUR SYSTEM EVERY SINGLE DAY OF 430 PORTS IN THE COUNTRY. WE ARE MEETING OUR WAY TIME STANDARDS. AND THOSE STANDARDS ARE FOR A NON PROJECT PASSENGER TO GET THROUGH SCREENING WITHIN 30 MINUTES AND FOR A PRE-CHECK PASSENGER WITHIN TEN. AND WE CONSISTENTLY, ACROSS THE SYSTEM, MEET THOSE STANDARDS. WITH THEIR EXCEPTION, WHEN YOU CONSIDER 430 AIRPORTS AND ROUGHLY 2400 SCREENING LANES, I'LL HAVE A REPORT MAYBE THREE OR FOUR REPORTS A DAY WHERE WE MIGHT'VE EXCEEDED THOSE STANDARDS. HAVING SAID, THAT WE DO NEED MORE STAFF THAN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND WE EXPECT THE RECOVERY TO CONTINUE INTO THE FALL AND INTO THE DECEMBER HOLIDAYS. DOING GREAT WORK IN PROVIDING INCENTIVES. THE FIRST, YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THE GREAT PLAINS WE HAVE. WE PROVIDED MORE INCENTIVES TO KEEP CURRENT EMPLOYEES IN TSA. SECONDLY, WE JUST A DOZEN ATLANTA, WE DID FOCUS RECRUITING EVENTS. WE DID SIX OR 700 PEOPLE THAT SHOULD OF THE RECRUITING EVENTS IN ATLANTA. WHEN WE DO THERE IS, WE DO ALL THE STEPS IN OUR CURRENT PROCESS ALL AT ONE TIME. YOU DO YOUR COMPUTER BASED TESTING, YOU DO YOUR MEDICAL PROCESS. YOU FELT YOUR SECURITY FORMS. THIS GREATLY STREAMLINES OUR BELEAGUERING PEOPLE ON BOARD. THE OTHER THING THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SIR AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS. WE HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THE PRESIDENTS BUDGET FOR 2023 TO PROVIDE EQUITY FOR TSA. AS YOU MAY KNOW, OUR FRONTLINE SCREENING WORKFORCE RECEIVES 30% LESS PLAY THAN IF THEY WORK THERE ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. -- WE'RE ABOUT 30% OFF. THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT PEOPLE AND TO RETAIN FOLKS. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO PROVIDE RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SUCH AS YOURSELF MIGHT HAVE AND HOPEFULLY IF IT'S APPROVED, APPROPRIATE TO IMPLEMENT. >> THANK YOU ADMINISTRATION, WILL YOU COMMIT TO MARKING WITH MY OFFICE AND MY LEADERSHIP

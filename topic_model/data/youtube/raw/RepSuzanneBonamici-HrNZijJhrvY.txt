it technology and automation have become entrenched in nearly every aspect of our society and culture the intentions behind the use of technology may be Noble but our efforts to both assess and address the effects on our workplace have been inadequate in recent years employers have harnessed new digital tools like recruiting and hiring algorithms computer analyzed video interviews and real-time tracking of their workers to cut the cost of hiring and managing workers this is our third hearing in our future of work series and today we'll examine how the technologies that employers use for hiring and management may intentionally or not facilitate discrimination and undermine workers civil rights we will discuss how Congress federal agencies and the business community can strengthen workplace protections to make sure workers are not left vulnerable to discriminatory practices and to prevent discriminatory hiring firing and monitoring practices we will investigate whether new technologies are designed to account for implicit and explicit bias and are used to transparent lis proponents of new technologies assert that digital tools eliminate bias and discrimination by attempting to remove humans from the process but technology is not developed or used in a vacuum a growing body of evidence suggests that left unchecked digital tools can absorb and replicate systemic biases that are ingrained in the environment in which they are designed for example hiring algorithms often rely on correlations to make predictions about the capabilities of job candidates yet these tools can mistake correlation for causation and subsequently perpetrate harmful disparities in 2017 an algorithm built by Amazon to hire engineers was scrapped after it was found to favor men over women by penalizing graduates of women's colleges because men hold the majority of engineering positions the algorithm had presumed that being male was a key characteristic of successful engineers when in reality being male does not cause one to be a successful engineer new technologies that surveil and monitor workers can also exacerbate bias workplace these tools may force workers to share their location activities and even private biometric information sometimes without workers knowledge or consent the technologies also allow employers to access private information that could be used to discriminate against workers for instance through a certain workplace wellness programs an employer could learn of a disability a health condition or genetic condition that is otherwise protected by anti-discrimination law too often employers and technology vendors are not transparent about the design and use of digital tools posing challenges for workers seeking redress for workplace discrimination simply put without transparent and responsible design digital tools can further perpetuate and even exacerbate long-held biases that have led to workplace disparities particularly for women of colors color individuals women individuals disabilities women and older workers moreover digital tools that are opaque in their design and operation cannot be held accountable as traditional employment relationships shift direct dramatically in our modern economy workers anti-discrimination protections are also in jeopardy as this committee has established new technologies have fundamentally restructured the workplace through the rise of gig and platform work these platforms have provided workers with new opportunities but many employers have also used new technologies to deny workers basic protections for example app based companies frequently misclassified their employees as independent contractors depriving them of protections and benefits such as minimum wage and overtime pay worker miss classification is not unique to app based companies some app based companies directly hire their employees as we learn from a business leader in our first future of work hearing workers misclassified as independent contractors are also excluded from the majority of federal workplace anti-discrimination laws including protection under title seven of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act these gaps leave workers classified as independent contractors whether misclassified or not with few options to discrimination we have the responsibility on this committee to work with federal agencies in the business community to strengthen workplace protections in the face of changing technology and there should include the right to be free from workplace discrimination and the right to be hired based on qualifications rather than age identity or zip code we must compel employers and technology vendors to be transparent and accountable for new workplace technologies we must invest in our key defenses against employment discrimination and empower the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to address emerging forms of digital discrimination and we must identify and close the gaps in our nation's laws that leave workers vulnerable to miss classification discrimination and harassment on the job I request request unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from the Leadership Conference on civil and human rights and up turn and a recent report on hiring algorithms equity and bias from up turn into the record

thank you chairman casey and thank you to the witnesses for being with us today this is such an important topic and i'm so thankful that uh chairman casey has decided to make this one of our priorities for this day uh without any question you think about the fact that we have 46 million americans today over the age of 65 living in the u.s and just a few years from now by the year 2050 that number will go from 46 million to around 90 million americans that is astounding growth that we should anticipate by 2030 one in five americans is projected to be 65 years or older nearly 90 percent of our seniors want to stay in their own homes as they age to this to do this seniors often turn to the support of their family members and when i say that i'm going to talk about how 44 million americans provide every year around 37 billion hours be as in boy billion hours of assistance to family members that to me is astounding and it's a number for for us to digest but it's really hard to understand how important staying in your own home is and the cost maybe not just financial costs but the human cost of providing that care at 40 for 37 billion hours a year family caregivers provide over 75 percent of caregiving here in the united states that is a significant investment into our loved ones and it's an important investment one that we should take a look at and find ways to make that support better the buildback better proposal relies almost exclusively on on funding long-term care through medicaid that path of course is going to be quite challenging for so many families the qualifications for medicaid is significantly a hard threshold to cross over which allow which requires you to eliminate most of your resources so that means that we need to look for other solutions a better path forward would invest significant funding in a push for a self-directed care approach this would give caregivers and recipients the means to make informed decisions about the services they need while providing resources to do so last june i released a report expanding opportunities for older americans self-directed home and community-based services so we looked for solutions in the report so that we could understand and appreciate what actually would help would be beneficial for families providing those 37 billion hours on an annual basis and some of the solutions that we talked about was encouraging state state medicaid programs to establish self-directed care options in addition to that growing the long-term care insurance market this is a critical piece the earlier you purchase this insurance coverage the cheaper it is and the longer it will last for most american families empowering the nation's volunteer army of 53 million family caregivers through sustainable funding that will improve conditions for caregivers while enhancing service quality i've been around amazing caregivers all of my life frankly my mother is a nurse's assistant she's in her 49th year of full-time employment providing care she loves what she does so much so that it is in fact her mission and so understanding and appreciating firsthand the struggles the challenges and the rewards of caregiving is undeniable uh in the household that i grew up in and frankly as i see my mother on the weekends when i'm back in town she talks about how important it is for us to address this issue it's one of the reasons why chairman casey i'm so thankful that we are having the hearing that we are today

as the lone Republican representative for the sunshine state I can't believe I'm doing the standing Mr chairman this is a first [Laughter] as so many of you guys know Florida's home to 300 specialty crops and one of the things that is particularly concerning is the fact that we don't have a seasonal or perishable provision as part of the usmca agreement I'm hopeful that we can Rectify that in the upcoming farm bill and I know we've had a lot of discussion today very productive about the regulatory I'll call it regime because to me that's really what it is I'm going to go down the line give you each a crack at your favorite regulation minus wotus because I think everybody wants to take wotus out but uh while I'm while y'all are thinking about that I do want to highlight that um as as one of the token Millennials in not just this committee but in Congress uh as someone who grew up in agriculture it is very concerning the fact that we do not have um that next Generation really primed and ready to go because it was such a high barrier to entry so I do want to highlight the fact that I think there's opportunity for us to work on streamlining some of these projects and and programs and with that I'll start with you Mr Duvall your favorite regulation that you'd like to see taken off the books and why the regulation around uh around guest worker programs and what we had to go through to get the labor that we need to get our farms uh operated and stay sustainable things like adverse wage effect housing transportation that whole gamut and the list goes on and on and on it's almost like you're making the case for a new guest worker program to be housed under USDA you took the words right out of my mouth uh the hodgepodge of truck weight regulations around the country you cannot drive a truck across the United States without stopping and getting new permits and revising the number of axles on your truck as you move across would you say 88 000 pounds would be the truck weight that would be acceptable for interstate commerce why don't we do what Canada does and has for years and Oregon and Washington and many states 105 500 with an extra axle the truck breaks faster slower faster and straighter all right under our current law perfect thank you well NEPA seems like the easy one but I'm going to go with the Florida one and say phosphogypsum reuse okay and if you don't know what phosphogypsum is or that we have to stack it as the only country in the world somebody else can ask that question next excellent thank you I would say regulations around energy and the use of renewable fuels and um [Music] maintaining a kind of all the above energy policy okay I would say I would say the gypso rules and Contracting I hear so much about consolidation our industry is uh the top four if I took half of our industry added 15 more companies to that we still wouldn't hit that margin and I hear about concentration and I think about it and maybe the only way it'll resonate with some people is this way if you want a job in high tech you go out to Silicon Valley you want to be a movie star you go to Los Angeles you want to get the chicken business you can do it in over 30 states in America so please join us never heard that one before but that's absolutely well I'll stay on this theme but actually flip it around and say that the existing regulations right now in the Packers and stockards act are what need to change they limit individual farmers and Growers abilities to challenge deceptive practices to challenge retaliation and for competitive injury and harm within this Consolidated Market individuals have to prove harm to the entire industry nobody who wants to seek remedy should have to go through that therefore we need to change that so first suffice it to say that the regulatory regime is killing agriculture as a whole and it needs to change dramatically correct let the record reflect that every single one of the witnesses is shaking their head yes I feel back

senator brian hughes thank you so much for being with us today thanks for having me so this is gonna be a great conversation about election integrity and what's really going on with everything with the texas election reforms and what on earth the democrats are doing in washington dc as they as they plan their escape with their hardship and i think we should all maybe have a moment of silence and prayer for them as they go through their hardships and i'm not sure that they've even received the care packages that they've requested do you know if they have i think they did spur an increase in care packages sent to u.s military overseas so that's been yeah that's gonna be good yeah i mean the democrats are basically in afghanistan right now there's really not that much difference between them and you know our soldiers fighting on the front lines um it is it has kind of been fascinating to watch them and their self-aggrandizement and you know this this sort of heroic so this heroic sense that they're that they're that they're contributing to the defense of democracy um and we're gonna debunk a lot of that because it's important that people know what they're even against and we're going to try to honestly assess what their talking points have been uh why they're against these these reform bills which you know frankly i look at them and i would describe them as kind of boring i mean right they're a little bit boring for all the hype you would think these were just crazy items and in fact you read them and they're simple common sense reforms that virtually everyone ought to be in favor of it it's disappointing after the way they hype it up you're right so i want to give you give you all a little background on the senator um senator bryan who's now serving your second term in the texas senate representing the 16 counties of senate district 1 in northeast texas before being elected to the senate in 2016 represented district five in the texas house of representatives for 14 years and uh you're a great person to have on this you're an author of one of the bills but also a legal background you've got you earned your law degree from baylor university and obtained a prestigious clerkship from u.s district judge william steger so um well well versed on this and um you guys have already passed these things in the senate yes as far as i understand it and uh all right so let's get into what's what let's actually start from the beginning why is it even important to be talking about this uh why why is it devoted why is it important to devote the time energy into the into the legislation of election reform in texas their right to vote is so precious so fundamental and i don't have to tell you about the cost of it and people like you who put on the uniform and and and suffered for it and so it's a precious blood-bought right it's too important not for us to secure and in texas today we have ballot harvesters paid political operatives who are stealing votes who are coercing voters misleading voters claiming to assist them and in fact misleading them overcoming their will we also have folks voting illegally and of course that cancels out a legitimate vote so it's too important for us not to secure there's a pending case in my district up in east texas i've got a county commissioner out on bail for mail ballot fraud anybody who tells you there's no voter fraud in texas is telling you a very big line yeah and the the thing about that and texas does have some of the better election systems uh when you can when you compare it to other states too i mean it's it's there's ways to cheat in texas but it's not that easy but even then we still have plenty of cases where there's actually and people are indicted for it and charged with it i mean there's this isn't this isn't just made up on your right pending cases in east texas in the oregon valley in suburban texas currently the ag is prosecuting 43 defendants with over 500 individual counts of voter fraud and again most of these cases are not individual voters trying to cheat it's vote harvesters it's folks trying to mislead them trying to steal their votes this is about protecting the right to vote and interestingly enough with all the debate about this the victims in these cases most often are the elderly the folks who don't speak english so well first time voters most of the victims in these cases are people of color and they're the ones who raise the complaints that's what we're trying to respond to right there's people showing up they're claiming they're they're filling things out you don't know how to trust you they're you know you got to take the uncertainty out of it i think i think that's our best argument when we talk about election integrity yes yes every vote needs to count and even a few votes because because what's the talking point that they always retort with it's always well there's a minimum amount of voter fraud well you can't have a minimum voter fraud they used to say there's no evidence of voter fraud and then when we show them evidence they said there's no evidence to widespread voter fraud right our question has been how much fraud is okay right it's not acceptable i i won my first election i win it i got second place by 155 votes so is that too much we have a member of congress that won by six votes is that is that the minimum threshold i mean there really can't be one because we're we're a very evenly split country on the left and the right and you have to know who won um and i think our best argument is like is like look because the democrats will always say why don't you want it to be easier to vote i'm like well i don't want it to be easier to cheat and it can only be so easy in the end voting is a competition it's a game it's a game that we play against each other okay and it's a competition so you have to have rules of a game why don't we make the end zones bigger on a football field it'd be easier to throw a touchdown to somebody if the end zone was just bigger well okay well how much bigger and like how much easier do you make it eventually you have to put some kind of limit on it and it's so strange to me that they don't understand this like it's a it's a standardized competition you have to have limits to the game at some point reasonable limits and we're very well within those reasonable limits but i think democrats sometimes they're like well which should be as easy as like yelling out your drive-through order you know and is this who i'm voting for and don't ask me who i am i mean like how easy do you think it should really be it's it's a little bit ridiculous you're absolutely right and you mentioned before how texas compares to other states we are in much better shape i've met with state legislators from various states and we're way ahead you're right we're in good shape in texas but there's still problems and as you say easy to vote hard to achieve both are important like with drive-through voting which you know we're going to talk about was the experiment within harris county you saw what the elections chief said before after early voting before election day started the elections chief in harris county said we're going to stop this drive-through voting because we're concerned the votes may not count so easy to vote is great until your votes don't count so you're so ready it doesn't make any sense or you can't audit them i mean like there's other considerations here there's logistical nightmare and drive-through voting that takes that takes all that about that extra election officials extra logistical infrastructure uh same with 24-hour voting like how much more manpower is actually needed for that and is it really worth it does everybody really need to be voting at 2 30 a.m exactly it's just a very such a strange argument and it makes us question their intentions all right this next question is for me what are the major changes being contemplated at a federal level this is an important question because um all the texas democrats in washington right now are saying they're there to fight for hr1 they need the federal government to take over texas elections that's fundamentally what hr one does um and okay why don't we think it's unconstitutional why why don't we like it well there's a few things that people should know about hr1 um first of all it's really good for my campaign okay and if it's good for my campaign i should that should raise the red flag for you um this bill actually matches uh small dollar donations to mike to my campaign and all federal campaigns at a six to one rate so if i get like a 200 donation i then get 1200 from the federal government which is you that's that's all of you're the federal government by the way that's your taxpayer money um so if you like that uh most people don't though i democrats or republicans generally don't like that when they hear it but that that's what that does i mean under the guise that it takes money it somehow is getting like corporate money and corrupt money out of elections but it's just again it's just for for somebody like a campaign like mine that would be enormously beneficial so it's it's it is extremely beneficial for incumbents especially people should know that it doesn't take any corruption out of the elections it just it just it just keeps incumbents and power um also overrules election practices that have been tailored for thousands of localities across the country including requiring same-day registration without any integrity measures so again the logistical nightmare of trying to do that in states that aren't used to it it also undermines voter id at the polls and prohibits it in absentee voting mandates that states allow ballot harvesting and permanently locks in nationwide no excuse mail-in ballot voting while lengthening post-election uncertainty i want to translate that last point that's a big one so no excuse mail-in ballots means the county will just take its list of registered voters and send everybody a ballot and in states that do this we don't do this democrats tried to do this in harris county um in the last election the the new the bills in the texas house prohibit that practice the reason we should prohibit the reason everybody should just get a ballot well maybe i'll let you answer that i think i think you've got the same answer i do but we know the safest most secure way to vote is in a polling place there are protections in place there's certainty there's poll watchers there everything we need is there we make it easy to do that of course mail ballots are the most greatest potential for fraud it's interesting ten years ago when we were debating in-person voter id in texas our democratic friends who didn't want voter id said at that time there's no problem with in-person voter fraud the real problem is those mail ballots there's all kinds of fraud over there and they're on record of democratic elected officials democratic federal judges they all said oh there's all kinds of fraud with those mail ballots even the experts the democrats paid to testify against voter id said oh there's a lot of fraud with those mail ballots we see how that works my goodness it's so easy to cheat to have your ballot stolen to have someone mislead you on how to do the paperwork to do the paperwork for you against your will so those mail ballots are most of the most opportunities for fraud that's been proven even the brennan center which now regrets saying it because they're against all kinds of security but they used to say male ballots are the least secure method of voting that that's an interesting point back when they were fighting against voter ice right and they they've recently reversed course on that because 80 percent of americans are in favor of voter rights that's right um you know and the other thing is it just reduces it reduces confidence in the elections to such an enormous extent because time and time again in states that do this naturally your rent your your voter registration's not going to be perfect it's impossible it's an impossibility you cannot make that perfect because people move they don't necessarily report their change of address i mean there's a lot of factors and so you're gonna get ballots that aren't yours to your house and once you see that once you see a ballot come to your house that you could fill out it's got somebody else's name on it you could send it in and that the only thing you can conclude at that point is that somebody else might be doing this and somebody might be cheating even if it's just one two three four ten i mean it's it just it reduces that confidence okay next question all right let's get to the meat of the bill here um about the changes in the bill that will help voters and improve election integrity so i'll let you just take that wherever you want we'll go through a bunch of lists here no thank you so we talk about easy to vote hard to cheat easy to vote under current law and taxes on election day if you're in line when the polls close you must be allowed to vote that protection does not apply to early voting and that's when most of us vote so senate bill 1 extends that same protection to early voting for the first time ever in texas also under current law texas if your work schedule does not allow you to get off work to vote your employer must let you off to vote but it's only on election day most of us vote early senate bill 1 for the first time extends that protection to early voting as well yeah but that's somehow that's must be suppressing people i can't i can't figure out what's minister about it but for some reason as you said before when we get complaints about the bill their generalizations when we talk about the details of the bill for some reason it never ends up in the story on tv or in the paper or from our democratic friends we expanded earlier we've expanded early voting all across the state and how about this many mail ballots are thrown out because of technicalities you just mentioned that earlier for the first time ever in senate bill 1 texans will have a process to cure those ballots you're an eligible voter there's a problem with your ballot you'll have a chance to fix that so your vote gets counted so many ways making it easier to vote that that's an important point i want to harp on that one for a second a stat that people need to know in 2020 the democrat presidential primaries about half a million ballots mail-in ballots are thrown out so why are why is why is a mail-in ballot thrown out this is why mail-in ballots are such a bad idea generally and need to be minimized to people who absolutely only can vote that that's right and in and so 500 000 thrown out so there's only two reasons a mailing ballot might get thrown out one they were trying to commit fraud and the election official caught it and threw it out or two they just screwed up their signature it's a real person trying to vote and the election official threw it out because they screwed up their signature it's it's a terrible process so in either case it's either total fraud or or real ballots being thrown out people trying to vote and they get their ballots thrown out these are neither of these options is good so go vote in person is is really the is really the conclusion there and and but and also you need a curing process okay so this bill allows texans to do that that's good we've never had that before in texas it makes sense and we talked about drive through voting 24 hour voting again the ideal way to vote which we want to make easier as easy as we can is in-person voting what about folks who are disabled we can't make it into the polling place well of course we have curbside voting for those folks in texas that's not going to change that's always going to be there but for able-bodied voters we are asking them to park their car and go in and vote in the polling place that's not too much to ask again drive-through voting was such a disaster when it was experimented with happened to be here in harris county and then 24-hour voting we can't find anyone else in the country who is suggested much less tried 24-hour voting it was tried here and the testimony we heard from here and from other counties was other county said we didn't try because we couldn't find election workers couldn't find poll watchers and again we're extending early voting hours extending weekend early voting hours and requiring your employer to let you off work to go vote not getting to vote at 2 30 in the morning is a pretty good trade-off for all those extra protections we're giving people to make it easier to vote yeah it's just it just seems to be like the spin on the other side is let's imagine some random thing i want to do with respect to voting i want to drive through it before i am why can't why are you trying to suppress me this is when i want to vote 4 am on a monday night you're like and on that point one of the real problems with drive through voting you mentioned it before think about that secret ballot you may bring a family member with you to go to vote but when you go in that polling booth you go by yourself because that's a sacred right that precious secret battle that's between you and the lord your spouse your co-worker your boss your union official nobody knows how you voted but of course with drive-through voting people jammed into the car passing the machine around there's no secret ballot it's just a terrible idea yeah it's a logistical nightmare you can just imagine all the issues going on with that or what else is in i know it also makes um before in texas counties had different early voting times as well so this just this just makes it consistent exactly right current texas law only our larger counties are required to have 12 hours of early voting in that second week we're expanding that to 55 more counties so more counties will require more hours of early voting already in texas we have more early voting hours than new york than new jersey the state of delaware the president's own state has no early voting they did just pass a bill to add it but they still won't have as many days as texas has and we also crack down on those ballad harvesters and you're familiar with this if you talk to the attorney general's office the primary concerns they see the cases they investigate number one is ballot harvesting stealing those male ballots and then illegal assistance someone claiming to help the voter but in fact they're coercing and misleading and overcoming their will i'll read you some sworn testimony from a voter in the rio grande valley about what happened to her and then finally illegal voting so the bill addresses all those things to make sure those legitimate votes count that's really what the bill is about yeah it let's go over the um i mean what what are their best arguments let's try and steel man their arguments the best we can it's hard i mean we've asked them when they did their capitol hill uh speeches we had some people interview them and ask them like honestly what's the most egregious thing in these bills and they came up with these non-answers i mean it's uh it's actually a hilarious video that we put out i've seen some of it so they talk a lot about poll watchers that's about all they can find to complain about and push so they're that's their big that's anyone it is and they're misstating what the bill says so current law as you know poll watchers are the eyes and ears of the public and they keep calling them partisan poll watchers well poll watchers are there from the democratic party the republican party from every campaign that's exactly what they are they're partisan poll exactly both sides have it exactly that's the entire point they watch us we watch them right right exactly right and so under current law a poll watcher in texas is allowed to absorb any activity in the polling place other than the voter casting her ballot and it's a crime for an election official to prevent the coal watcher from doing that that's current law but the law is kind of vague on how close the poll watchers get to be it says they can be close enough to conveniently observe what does that mean you saw those cases where poll watchers were kept behind glass or way over in the corner a hundred feet away from where the action was not in texas not in texas okay but but we want to prevent that from happening exactly right so this bill says the poll watchers are allowed to be close enough to observe and hear the activity that's all it says it doesn't they still can't obstruct they're not allowed to how do the democrats spend that what are they trying to say is happening there they're saying that we are giving poll watchers the right to roam through the polling place intimidate voters uh and really they say that poll watchers are there to intimidate voters i wish you could have seen some of the sweet little blue-haired poll watchers that came to testify in front of our committee i'm sure they're not all like that but they were friendly people they're volunteers they're there to do a job they didn't seem very intimidating to me yeah and what evidence do they have that poll watchers would all of a sudden turn into some rabid intimidation machines no evidence but they complain about that and then they say generally well you're making it harder to vote when we ask them how they say well 24-hour voting that's right you can't vote at 2 30 in the morning but you can vote more during the day on the weekends you have to get off work to vote honestly when we get talking about details they kind of change the subject and talk about other states or about history they don't want to talk about this building yeah that's true they talk about they talk about the past most often um clarifies the ban on unmanned drop boxes also because that's a big push they think there should just be boxes kind of spread throughout the counties that you can just go drop a mail and ballot what's wrong with doing that exactly so in texas we've never had that so that mail ballot you drop it in the mail or you the voter can deliver the mail to deliver the ballot to the election office that battle is pretty important it needs to be put in the hands of an election worker to know it's going to be counted our election code doesn't provide for drop boxes some counties did that in texas without authorization we're making it clear we don't want unmanned drop boxes with ballots who who knows what's happening to those ballots is it getting stuff it's not good for anybody that points up another issue we've had in the election code in texas we have good laws but we had a few rogue election officials just making up the rules 24-hour voting drive through voting drop boxes those are not in the election code but they were not forbidden so we had a couple of rogue election officials make up the rules for themselves yeah it's about a chain of custody issue i mean there was a lot of these things um that's what people have to understand again you're setting up a competition and it's a really important competition it's a competition that people care about quite a bit it's not like texans versus cowboys i mean people care about that too like a lot maybe more than they should but but when they really care about who wins an election i mean you know in our country's been thrown through a lot of turmoil because people did not feel confidence in it and it's easy to not feel confidence in an election when you can see all of these issues now it doesn't mean you can prove it right and that's always the counter argument we'll prove that there was something wrong at that moment well you can't and that's actually the point because if you can't audit something if you if you if you can't just look back and say look this was actually done correctly then it drives this enormous distrust in the elections and and texas is just getting ahead of that again i don't think i think we've had enormous problems in texas but but we do need to get ahead of it i thank you guys congressman you're exactly right and i should have mentioned another bill that we passed separately in the regular session for the first time we'll have a paper backup for electronic voting so many people are for that it's been a long fight to get into texas and also understandability it makes sense did you say so we can do an audit we can do a recount there's really no satisfaction when you cast your electronic ballot and it just disappears yeah either side a little crazy no i i agree yeah and also importantly we'll have live stream video feed from central county whenever those ballots are there 24 hours so once the ballots are brought in when they're counted as long as they're sitting there live stream video feed for anyone to look at and again all you notice all these provisions protect everyone left right rural urban they're there for everyone that makes a lot of sense you know america actually set up um very secure and simple elections uh in 2005 in iraq and uh you know how we did it is that we iraqis have an id and we'd made them show up in person and we gave them an ink stain on their hand to show that they voted so you know who voted they have an id and you show up in person now didn't solve iraq's problems but it wasn't because they didn't trust the outcome of the election it was because well they hate each other and you know there's sectarian violence and all of that but it starts with an election right it starts with just some kind of confidence that your vote counts not just that it counts but that it's not cancelled out by somebody who who did it um who committed fraud and and it's what's worth knowing obviously there's an incentive for fraud you know there's there's this strange belief on the other side's arguments that that everybody would just be angels if there's there's no reason to think that there'd be widespread fraud well of course there's reason we're talking about power we're we're talking about who gets power and if there's opportunity for it and also not that much risk in doing so you will get somebody who commits fraud it might not be this sort of systemic conspiracy like like too many on our side have probably probably tried to portray but it certainly is organic and and what i see democrats try to do again it's not these like widespread conspiracies but what it is is create the environment that makes that makes it susceptible to voter fraud makes it susceptible to those individuals who are like i'll take the risk you know we're to those groups especially activist groups they're like i'll take the risk or i'll go i'll go get my people out there and fill in all those people's ballots you know yeah i know they can't even you know they don't even know who's voting that day but hey let's get him to fill something out um is that is that the right thing to do no i don't think it is congressman you're exactly right and as you say there's not much of a downside to it and men are not angels were sinners and so uh we're prone to those things let me let me share this with you this is this is from testament this touched me from a trial in inaugural county this is a little voter named cavazos and she i'm going to read your her testimony if you don't mind because it talks about what you just said and ms cavazos was voting for the first time not familiar with the machines and so she was told by a campaign worker talk to marcellus she'll help you out so marcella is there waiting at the polling place ms cavazos comes up and marcelo marcela tells the election workers i'm here to help her so if you're helping a voter you get to go in and you get to go in the polling place with them in this place and so the voter says this and i go to the polling place and marcella goes up i go to the polls and marcelo comes up behind me i had the intention of well she was going to assist me how to do those things because i didn't understand that machine so she started punching in the machine i don't even remember the language in the poll she was telling me you're going to press here you're going to press over there so i saw that she put it in favor of the team that she was on and then the voter concludes so then i had the idea that she was giving me like a tour of how to do those things and that she was gonna leave so by the time i told her okay let me let me let me vote on my own she said no you already voted voters like that are the ones we're trying to protect and and paid political workers like that yes you say there's an incentive to do it and there's really no downside because it's hard to catch them yeah but yeah and that's heartbreaking um and unfortunately happens a lot i mean again because there's an incentive to do it men are not angels this is uh this is kind of a key tenets of the philosophy of our family men are not angels but we strive towards a higher good and we create a system of incentives and structures by which we have the most optimal outcomes i mean that's all this is it's not rocket science um what do you think about the the charges of voter suppression how have you know a lot of these bills that are being passed like they haven't been tried before have they really affected voter turnout i'm glad you asked that because we heard these same charges back about 10 years ago with voter id and we were told this is racist it's voter suppression you're going to suppress the vote but what happened after voter id was put in place turnout went up across the state every sector every demographic because people had confidence their vote was going to count it's so frustrating we hear these charges and these fundraising emails go out from washington and the national media backs them up and they scare voters and voters are told we're making it harder for you to vote now when voters look at what's in the bill they're kind of disappointed like you said that's it that's all you got kind of boring it's boring it is it's simple common sense reforms that help every voter no matter how they vote no matter where they vote and it's terribly frustrating because they can't point us to anything in this bill that suppresses the dog i gotta hide my energy drink because it's a coffee with crenshaw i'm not drinking coffee today sorry i usually i go through this whole spiel about how i make coffee but um i actually after my surgery uh for some reason coffee i can't it tastes really bad to me now it's actually heartbreaking yeah cause i i love coffee but i can't drink it anymore it's i'm done with coffee so we're gonna have to rename it uh rename this these things um yeah i got some statistics here actually so voter participation soared 66 percent increase in 2020. and look i mean what i tweeted this out at the beginning of this controversy no nobody's gonna voters will not notice any of these bills you won't notice anything because most voters just vote normally that's right um the only people who will notice this stuff are the people who try to fill out other people's ballots it's exact because we'll make it a little bit harder for them to do that make them sign something that says they're good you know make a sworn affidavit something like this statement i think so already if you assist to vote at the polling place you have to write your name now we're going to get your name and address and we're going to get you to promise that you didn't compel this voter to let you help them and that you didn't try to overcome their vote it's pretty common sense stuff yeah yeah and it also it also doesn't prevent that aid from happening no of course not of course we worked with the disability community because in the initial drastic bill they had some concerns so we changed the language to take care of those rough edges we want to make it easy for everyone to vote and hard to cheat and they're they're they're not mutually exclusive we can do both it should be about like a physical disability right i mean that's real that's really what we're trying to overcome um you know because you can imagine those kind of scenarios but it's not just for somebody who like wants some help or like doesn't know who's on the ballot that and i think democrats often say like they'll they'll they'll want to be like well i mean they don't really know what's going on well they don't know what's going on why are they voting exactly like it's i mean i'm just going to say it and the law of texas is clear on that you know if you're if you're disabled and can't come into the polling place we'll bring the voting machine to you for curb side voting that's still a secret ballot for you to have assistance inside the polling place texas law says that means that you can't read the ballot or you can't see because we have equipment how to help folks exactly that's the only reason that's right that makes sense all right we kind of went over this with the question is voting fraud happen with any regularity um you already mentioned this but i've got some exact stats here texas a g's office has convicted 140 people for election fraud since 2005. there's 43 open election fraud cases pending more than half of the convictions involved mail-in ballot fraud that's right um and like we said like nothing is acceptable it's also worth noting there was a bipartisan because it post the the post florida debacle into what 2000 um so florida redid its whole lecture reform and there was a in the 2005 there was like a federal election council something like that was a bipartisan event um jimmy or jimmy carter was the the democrat in charge of it and they were very explicit in that report that a lot of there's a lot of fraud in mail-in balance that's right for obvious reasons this is intuitive that's right we don't need to do a scientific study on this it's just it's obvious why there might be fraud with that because of the the lack of chain of custody um a couple other examples here uh 2017 investigation of dallas city council election found 700 fraudulent mail-in ballots signed by the same witness using a fake name so yeah so like there's that's one case but that's 700 ballots it's it's important to note that it's not you know because somebody might look at that number earlier 140 people convicted for election fraud since 2005 it doesn't seem like that much but a couple things it's extremely hard to prove that that's that's one of the big problems it's extremely hard to prosecute it uh second of all each one of those cases could be for lots and lots of balance um some recent cases medina county four people including an election justice of the peace were charged with 150 counts of election fraud including ballot harvesting from greg county and county commissioner and several others were charged with 134 felony accounts of voter fraud for encouraging ineligible individuals to vote in harris county there are recent instances where campaign workers engaged in ballot harvesting in elderly care facilities you know it's a vulnerable population it's easy for them to persuade them so they target them yes um and like i said before half a million mail-in ballots are rejected in the democrat presidential primary of 2020. that's probably my favorite talking point on this because it just really shows again there's only two options either election officials caught fraud or they denied real ballots in either case that's not a good situation so why don't we just not do that and it's not clear how to make that better i mean texas has made it a little bit better by requiring that id same with georgia because george has gone through the same nonsense that texas has and um well even the mlb pulled out of atlanta oh yeah yeah exactly it went to a state which had less opportunities to vote than georgia does yeah that was really smooth yeah right if your point about mail balance you're right i should have mentioned senate bill one now for the first time we'll have voter id for mail ballots and so you'll write when you send your application for battle by mail you're write your driver license number your state id if you don't have one of those you'll write the last four of your social if you don't have that to sign an affidavit that's exactly the requirements to register to vote so every registered voter is going to be able to comply with that so the ballot comes to you you know you fill out the mail ballot put it in that security envelope and on the outside of the envelope under the flap you write the number send it back and those numbers match and we know that it was you and not someone who stole a battle out of your mailbox or who had it forwarded to the wrong address as you were describing how many times have you heard from voters who showed up to vote and they said oh you've already voted you voted by mail no i didn't it's for those situations you're exactly right okay next question uh you've kind of answered all this but we will add at whatever you think we haven't talked about already but will any of the proposed changes for elections in the state of texas disenfranchise any voters um especially along race lines because that's usually the accusation is it does it disenfranchise minority voters now as you know the voter rolls are colorblind you register to vote you don't say anything about your race your national origin and that's how it should be and so this allegation that this bill would disenfranchise voters or make it harder for voters of color to vote that's false and it's reckless it is simply not true in fact in fact let's talk about those ballot harvesters those folks who are cheating claiming to assist voters you mentioned that case in greg county texas now the dem the defendant happens to be an african-american democrat you know who the complainant in the case was an african-american democrat this case in the rio grande valley it was hispanics who were complaining so many times the victims of male ballot fraud of illegal assistance are people of color and those people are crying out and we're trying to respond to them but since their narrative doesn't match the dnc and cnn we're supposed to ignore them and so they accuse us of being against people of color when this bill protects voters of color more than anybody else yeah democrats would say well they need they need more help my question is why do they need more why are they so why are they so below your level that you need to help them fill out their belt i think that's an odd that's something that i think democrats should have to answer it gets to this bigotry of low expectations argument and uh like why can't i'm sorry why can't minorities get ids and if they and if that really is a systemic problem we should definitely get them ids because you need an idea to live in this society we do and congressman you know in response to voter id last time that was a concern we originally set a driver license to vote and then they said some folks don't have one you're right state id well that costs 20 bucks that's like a poll tax you're right so we provide a free state id to vote we're removing every possible obstacle and you're right suggesting that some voters need more help you heard what the vice president said about rural voters that should have offended a lot of us yeah that's voters voters will get it right if we'll stop the ballot harvesters and the folks who are trying to cheat and trying to mislead the voters it's also important to just add some stats in here um because again like like you said earlier what they what they tend to do is is go back to historical discrimination which of course did happen um but that doesn't tell us a story about what's happening now that's right and in the 2012 presidential election blacks voted at a higher rate than whites nationally 66 percent versus 64 percent um and that's been pretty inconsistent well 2012 was a bit of an outlier but but the point is there's nothing hindering here that's right um see if there's any it's about the same too so 70 percent of blacks are registered to vote 72 percent of whites are registered texas is ranked 10th in black voter turn now so there's just the point is there's just no evidence here um of of what kind of suppression practices might be might be taking place there's just um we've made so much progress and as you say tenth in the nation and turn out for african-american voters i mean come on and part of that was because in texas it's easy to vote there's plenty of opportunities to early vote we're making even more opportunities those those claims are just false and reckless they make people feel bad too i mean because look there's there's a lot of people that are susceptible to these arguments and they're it it's a crappy thing to feel that way like wow there's there's an entire political party that wants to suppress my vote because they trust their politicians that they vote for them but they trust them they shouldn't but they do and it's not a good thing what does that do that's that's like a different way of creating um uncertainty in our elections and removing confidence from our elections when you know people have to feel like they have to fight for the right to vote you already have the right to vote it's very easy like don't let anybody tell you otherwise this is complete nonsense that's right um this question is about drive-through voting but i think we hit that ad nauseum already um kind of hit this one too does texas allow enough days of early voting and our voting hours fair i don't know if you have anything to add to that no thanks you covered it well we already have more than new york more than new jersey uh more than delaware delaware has none but they're going to add some they'll still have less than we have because we had so many memes comparing texas and delaware exactly yeah exactly the delaware's like oh no i caught us um number 10 is about voter right we kind of hit all of these already uh why do we need voter id at all i think we've i think we've hit that one pretty uh pretty well maybe i'll add a couple more details here um supreme court has found that voter id requirements are perfectly constitutional and not overly burdensome keep in mind all the texas democrats had to show some form of id to get to to escape to dc right that's on their e plan it's escape innovation and uh military jargon and uh and again pray for our our fellow politicians in dc they really need your prayers um over 81 of texas support voter id that's about the same at the national level you know this is this is this has wide this has wide support a study from the national bureau of economic research found voter id has no negative impact on voting for any group based on race sex age or socio-economic status and again in most of those statistical cases it's uh voter turnout goes up after after voter id is passed because people have ids as it turns out this isn't and people who don't have ids they've got a lot of problems and they probably need other forms of help yes um and so it's uh it's just so insulting to an entire race of people to sell to say that they can't get ideas just because of their skin color there's just no reason to think that and it it's it's it's a racist thing to think to be honest it is um so we've already went over this one too we've already hit a lot of these um because we were just kind of talking about it but this one is why do we have partisan poll watchers and how do these volunteers help reduce fraud you do anything to add to that we kind of went over that we did pretty well yeah they're the asmrs of the public it's important um why is ballot harvesting such an important issue to address i'm thinking i'm not sure we have anything to add to that we've talked about a lot um i'll say on ballot harvesting congressman i bet you and i have democratic colleagues who will admit off the record that ballot harvesting is a problem these battle harvesters will come to the canada and say hey you want my help here i'll help you for this amount or if you don't hire me i'll go to your opponent yeah again republican endeavors of course there was a republican election republican winner that was yeah it was north carolina north carolina's right yeah right yeah because of uh they were doing illegal ballot harvesting so this isn't partisan it's just it's just a bad election practice exactly right um i'll read some statistics so people understand some background as well because it is not as widespread in texas but in 27 states a voter can designate someone to return their ballot and in 13 states the law is silent on whether a single person can return multiple ballots 2018 the registrar in orange county california reported that his county had people dropping off maybe 100 or 200 ballots so when somebody's doing it because at first it seems like well why can't i tell my my sister to go drop off my ballot that seems reasonable but well then but you got to put safeguards around that because it's if if you just say someone else can turn it in it quickly turns into somebody going around collecting ballots maybe they filled them out you know i mean there's the activists can really take advantage of this they can't and this bill in texas is one of the more one of the strongest ones we've seen because you're right it's one relatives are of course glad to help you with that but here's what this bill in texas will say on on mail ballot harvesting it says that a paid campaign worker cannot have an in-person interaction with a voter involving a mail ballot or application for battle by mail telephone is great knocking doors for campaigning is great help non people are not paid by the campaign can help the ballot fill out their voter but if you're after ballot but if you're paid by a campaign you cannot have an in-person interaction with a voter involving a mail ballot where you can remove all doubt about whether campaigns are messing with these people trying to fill that mail balance in their battle applications yeah it's going to make it clean well that's good and and that's that's a very minimal amount of safeguards let's be honest that's paid campaign doesn't say anything about volunteers this was just paid campaign yeah um here's another stat out of 33 million mail-in ballots that were cast in the 2016 president-elect presidential election 400 000 of them didn't count they were thrown out disqualified for reasons ranging from invalid signatures to being too late so again it's just a bad practice whether whether you're a democrat or republican um what are the changes proposed to drive through in 24 hours okay we already went through that sorry guys we pretty much got all your questions so we're doing pretty well how much time we got left where are we at okay all right so we're about wrapping up anyway um let's see here this last question how do we deal with the proliferation of propaganda and outside efforts to influence election outcomes through fake news to me this seems like the biggest threat against election integrity there's a good argument to be made there um you know when people say the election was stolen the best argument for that would be by by a corrupt media that sort of that sort of applied and painted to you as opposed to a kraken um but but look it it is a problem i'm not sure it's ever not going to be a problem in a democracy where you allow free speech so you know i i think too many on our side want us to do something about that i'm like i don't know what i can do about people lying to you you've gotta you've gotta help yourself through that um and you've gotta you've gotta figure out the right arguments and convince your neighbors of it that it's messy but that is the essence of a democracy in a free society um you know we we purposely try not to choose what the truth is and and how to impose that on people um but but you can't fight it through better free speech that's why we do events like this put the information out the answer to bad speech is more speech not in for silence you're of course you're exactly right the supreme court got that one right and that it is hard it's messy free speech is tough i don't have to tell you that but it's worth it because the good news is we have an exchange of ideas and we're going to get to the truth of course when we have a handful of oligarchs in san francisco that are controlling free speech that's another discussion but with free speech we have nothing to fear from free speech i'm with you yeah i agree and it's not a satisfying answer to a lot of people who want you to crack down somehow but you really can't i mean the best we can do i think is crack down against a censorship florida's experimenting with that kind of stuff right now it's of course got got bogged down in the courts because it's actually a pretty complicated issue it is it's not black and white um we're looking at legislation at the federal level for section 230 and things like that we got censorship we passed senate bill 5 in texas which we believe addresses section 230 and gives texas a way to get back online we recognize they have to moderate uh content pornography excessive violence but viewpoint discrimination that's the problem and right now they can get away with it the florida bill was good senator bill 5 we believe is better i don't want to monopolize the conversation but i'd love you to take a look at it it takes a fresh approach it acknowledges section 230 and allows texas to get back online it holds them accountable for censorship we've got some law professors helping with it and several states are looking at this bill as a model of how to hold them accountable so we're not giving up on that and i think that's what consumers are concerned about they just want to be treated fairly right i think they understand that you know in the end a content moderator can take something down that's right but what we want is that it's applied consistently you can't take president trump down but not the ayatollah like it's i think i think that's what really drives people crazy you're so right and part of this bill says they've got to tell us what the rules are just so you know because nobody knows you get taken down you don't know why you can't get in touch with anybody no appeal process so frustrating we're going to fix that in texas yeah and you're a customer i mean this is this is consumer protection that's right in the end because like your data is going to them they're making money off of you they sell advertisements to you in a in a way you are a customer guess it's a free service but but you are a customer right i think we need to see it that way and many conservatives have bought the idea that since these are private companies we can have no role in what they do but of course they're common carriers right your telephone company can't cut you off because your politics your cable tv can't deny your service because your religion these folks will come and carry especially what they do based on their market share based on their practices justice thomas has said as much he's road mapped before us so someone the other day told me that's a leftist concept that we can affect these companies well justice clarence thomas i'm going to i'm with him on this one uh their commentaries we can step in and protect consumers it's definitely tricky but it is i think there's i think there's a way to thread the needle i do too um they said we've got some legislation at the federal level that again protects section 230 but also clarifies it um and and talks about how you cannot censor based on political viewpoints you got it you got to make that explicit that's right um you know there's there's a lot of other ideas floating around too but um it it's unfortunately not as easy as just all will just abolish section 230 it would probably make things a lot worse before it got better um that's what people don't realize as far as the mainstream media it is what it is like i tell our side like you can complain about it all you want it is what it is um you know their ratings aren't that high yeah they do have some influence um but that but that's the nature of debate um unfortunately and fewer people are getting their news from those sources because of that reason so the right the proliferation of different my goodness what you're doing here this is something they get control it's wonderful right right social media is our best weapon um and it's why democrats tend to want to tamp down on social media a lot more you know people if if you just sort of casually glance at congress you think there's bipartisan outrage at big tech but there's but it's not true i mean there is outrage but it's for completely different reasons the democrats are mad at big tech because they don't censor enough right because because legally they can't infringe on the first amendment so they want big tech to do it for them and they and they want people they want them to censor and you know and and manage misinformation and things like you know which is just a it's a that's inherently a subjective term to label what is misinformation it's just information you disagree with or you have a different take on so that's why you go right on op-ed that's right you know because because there's a debate that must occur there and it's messy it's messy that's that's a free society it's messy it's it's not it's not always what you want um but it but it's but it's the most optimal outcome it's the best he got and uh and we we toy with that idea at our own peril amen amen to that brian thanks so much for uh being on matt thanks for having me all right thanks everybody for showing up that was great senator thank you so much for uh lending us your expertise and helping us through a lot of those details that was great so kind of includes thank you so this is really fun special for us thanks a lot

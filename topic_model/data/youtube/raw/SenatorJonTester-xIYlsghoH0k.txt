mr. president senator from Montana I want to thank the senator from Louisiana for allowing me to say a few words and I want to thank you mr. president for doing the same mr. president hopefully the day works out better than the last hundred and thirty one days half and that hopefully today that a bipartisan group of senators will be able to put forth a budget agreement that will be long-term and I want to thank them because as part of that although it isn't done yet so we don't want to get the cart too far ahead of the horse but a part of that is funding for a community health centers in this agreement funding for community health centers has been a top priority for me and it became that because of my visits to the health care the community health centers around the state from Bullock in Havre to Riverstone and Billings to Southwest Montana community health center in Butte to partnership health care in Helena and in Missoula and the list goes on and on these health care facilities provide incredibly affordable and efficient health care to people across Montana so I am incredibly pleased to work with the leadership in his body and get a deep deal for health care community health care centers across this country including Montana 17 community health centers now I will tell you that two years as a good start but there happens to be 19 bipartisan co-sponsors on a bill called the China Act which would reauthorize community health care funding for five years that's where we really need to be I'm not complaining about the two years I think it's important we keep these folks going in two years is certainly better than where we are now but really we don't look with much vision in this body and it's really not visionary to say that we're going to give five year funding mechanism to mark unity health centers but that's what we need to do today we need to give the Community Health Center's the long-term predictability that they deserve in Montana these centers of the backbone of much of our health care delivery systems they provide affordable access affordable access to care keeping our communities and Families healthy now let me give you a little example of how important these are community health centers and community health centers alone provide over ten percent of the people to state of Montana their health care that's where they go to get it eighty-five percent of those folks or low-income these are folks that probably wouldn't be able to get health care without a community health center there 20,000 of them were children in Montana were a big state big geographically with not a lot of folks so oftentimes folks half the tribe will travel a long ways under the best of conditions to see a doctor if we didn't do this funding mechanism that we hope happens today or tomorrow we would see these folks to be traveling a hundreds of more miles to see a doctor because oftentimes this is the only health care facility close to them so although the news that we've heard today so far seems to be positive it does on our budget it doesn't change the fact that Congress should have acted on this 131 days ago a solution should have been passed when our fiscal year ended in the end of September it speaks to the dysfunction of this body our basic job here is to put forth a funding mechanism known as a budget that will provide basic health care there will fund things like community health centers and CHIP not use them as political pawns fund them give people certainty give our military certainty give our security folks certainty and not continue governing from crisis to crisis with continuing resolution to continuing resolution I have seen firsthand the destruction of these short-term budgets have had four health clinics our veterans are small businesses I just had a group of school board folks in my office yesterday that talked about impact aid these are schools that serve our military and Native Americans and said how these CRS were limiting the possibilities for payments for impact aid schools we've heard from our military leaders about how the short-term CR is wasting taxpayer dollars and hurting our military readiness at a time when men and women from this great country are stationed around the world we need to give them certainty they need to know that we're doing our job as they do their job and incredibly difficult conditions so for 131 days too many Americans have been living with uncertainty as a direct result of dysfunction in Congress this Agreement there's a step in the right direction and I am very pleased to see progress on a budget because 131 days is too long and so let's get this fixed and over the coming weeks I would be more than happy to sit down with Republicans Democrats independents who are willing to roll up their sleeves in work to give this country small businesses working families the predictability through a longer term budget so that they can move forward and be all that they hope to be in the greatest country in the world with that mr. president I yield the floor

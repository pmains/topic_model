Thank You chairman Lowenthal and i appreciate your patience I want to continue on with Jason George should the twin metals project be permitted do you anticipate more Operating Engineers going through your registered apprenticeship program and working on projects in and around our RN range towns I definitely do there'll be tremendous amount of opportunity just just to build the mine alone as millions of work hours for sure be adding people to our apprenticeship roles from the local area and then you know once the mind is in operation there's all kinds of projects that happen within that mine including building roads within the mine and outside the mine and and all kinds of activity ancillary jobs that come with that yeah and then in your written testimony you highlighted that hundreds of your members older living to the existence of the mining industry in northern Minnesota and almost 70 percent of locals in the region support the opportunity for precious metals mining can you give us just a rough estimate how many Operating Engineers are employed in mining operations in Minnesota hundreds and they all live right where the mines are what's the average salary average salary I listed is actually from our average work hours per year but they arrange is for anywhere from sixty thousand is average but there's plenty of my members that make close to a hundred thousand dollars a year working as a result of the mining activity up there which is far above the average income for Minnesota's eighth District

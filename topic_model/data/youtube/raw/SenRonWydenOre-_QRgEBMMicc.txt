Thank You mr. chair mr. Miller on this privacy issue I want to be clear on it because this is triggered enormous concern are you saying that the agency has not obtained electronic communications without a warrant I say yes or no answer I'm sorry gonna have to repeat that one there might as the agency obtained electronic communications without a warrant yes I'm not to my knowledge okay now your lawyers say that you can and mr. chairman I'd ask unanimous consent to put into the record a memo outline outlining why the IRS lawyers have taken the view that Americans email Facebook messages and Twitter communications which are older than 180 days can be obtained by the IRS without a warrant now you indicated objection Thank You mr. chairman you indicated mr. Miller to Senator Grassley that you would go back and look at this when will we actually get a public statement that the agency will not seek to obtain electronic communications with without a warrant when would we get that actual public statement so so I think the point I had was they were raising of Facebook and Twitter you have that statement from me today earlier today senator why we're not doing it what I've said is in the criminal context we use search warrants and we are not going to the the ISPs in the civil context for content email with or without warrant because we can't get a warrant in that in that context in any event i will say that there are certain public information out there on facebook on twitter and this is why i sort of want to be more nuanced in the discussion there are certain public information that we might look at in terms of a collection action in terms of an examination that's a different sort of situation I'll be glad to come back and sort of work that through for you but that is public information not private information the public has recently learned mr. Miller that the IRS legal counsel believes that Americans enjoy no general privacy to their on line communications that are older than 180 days that's why people are so trouble so you've said and it's certainly helpful to hear that today that this has not been done in the past I think it is very important that the agency clarify its policy with respect to the privacy rights of Americans and do it promptly and we intend to do that when will you do that I would hope to have that done but I don't have it I don't have a date but it's it can you commit today to have this done within 30 days the agency will clarify i use my best effort center it's not this is i think we can do that yes ok ms olson what's your reaction to this question about the IRS's position with respect to the privacy of tax you know information i mean you know we're always trying to find ways to boost tax compliance and here we have and i put it in the record the general counsel of the IRS saying that americans enjoy no general privacy to their online communications that are older than 180 days that's not something was made up by some whistleblower that was from the IRS you know general you know counsel and my my sense is the two issues are going to be related taxpayer compliance and the privacy of Americans you know tax information section 6103 of the internal revenue code was written by the Congress to ensure the taxpayers tax information is private what's your sense about memos like this and all the one that you know I just you know quoted from undermining the expectation that Americans have in section 6103 well regrettably that memo was not shared with me prior to it being made public nor was it circulated for my comments my experience with memos such as that is when they are actually circulated in people within the IRS such as my office and my have an opportunity to raise concerns about it that you get a much better quality work product and it might have looked different had the voice of the taxpayer had an opportunity you know to comment on that I think that it is vitally important to people's willingness to comply with the laws that they feel like they are being treated fairly by the tax administration just as the tax administration is asking them to behave properly with their tax filing obligations and not having a full and robust discussion internally is one sure way of coming out with guidance such as that that then needs to be said we're not going to follow that I just have to say that you know chief counsel often you know issues memos and answer to very narrow questions and when you have a more discreet or discussion you're able to put place that in context and get a better product my time is up mr. Chairman I would just note that as a general rule having worked with missiles and over the years the public is better protected when ms Olson is consulting and I think that we have learned that again and I hope mr. Miller that that that that lesson is one of the takeaways of this like you said it actually thing return

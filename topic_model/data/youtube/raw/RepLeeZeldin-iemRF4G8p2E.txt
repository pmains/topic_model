all my colleagues who were coming to the House floor tonight encouraging the President of the United States now to certify the release of this memo to the American public the American public is a lot smaller than a whole lot of other people give them credit for present them with the facts the truth and they could form their own independent judgment as to what transpired how's the first thought that came to my mind when I went to the basement the week before last the basement of the house Capitol to read this classified memo of the house Intel committee that this memo should be immediately released to the American public so that they have all of the facts in addition to releasing the memo I believe it's important to be releasing relevant material sourced in the memo now tonight the house Intel committee voted to publicly release this memo to the American public and at the same time the House Democrats came to the committee calling for the desertification and public release of their memo now let me add a little bit more context on this memo that the House Democrats came to the floor asking to be released they did not allow the voting members of the house in telomere tonight before voting to declassify and publicly release it let me repeat that the House Democrats led by ranking member Adam Schiff went to the house Intel committee did tonight calling for the public release of their memo asking for their colleagues to declassify the memo and publicly release it immediately without giving them the opportunity to read it first I can speak for myself I I haven't read the memo that the House Democrats offered up tonight I haven't been granted any access to read it I'm not aware of any other of my colleagues who have been able to read it I can't even confirm it exists now after the committee meets it's fascinating to watch the minority members of the House in telling straight to the cameras from the hearing room to the cameras to give their narrative at no point did they mention whatsoever when they were saying that they were outraged that the majority members of that committee didn't vote to publicly release at no point did they mention that they never gave him the opportunity to read it first now what you don't see at the same time are the majority members of the House in telling off to all of those same cameras to give their side of the narrative the members of that house Intel committee what we're asking for is for the American public to get the facts so they could form the judgment for themselves of this FISA abuse I to applaud the leadership of mr. Nunez and the house Intel committee for their work to restore faith with the American people as a former former army intelligence officer and jag officer myself I understand the importance of giving our intelligence agencies the critical tools they need to protect our homeland assist our troops on the front lines and surveil our enemies however it's critical that we strike a balance between national security and civil liberty to prevent any gross violation of individual liberties under the guise of national security Congress has the responsibility of ensuring an appropriate balance is struck and when it is not the release of information we feel is in the national interest and of public importance must get out and today Congress took an important step in making this possible Americans deserve the truth to pull the wool over the eyes of the American public insults their intelligence and to bases the freedoms and liberties on which our nation was founded government transparency and accountability should be neither partisan or divisive I would urge my colleagues on either side of the aisle including those who have made of especially those who would have voted against it's released to evaluate to reflect upon their position and come together united in favor of my belief of our belief that the american public is a lot smarter than many others give them credit for give them the facts we have faith that they will be able to form their own independent conclusions now it's up to you mr. president I would encourage you to release the memo I would also encourage you to release relevant material source in it Americans have the right to know and if we as their elected representatives fail to stand up for them who will the only way forward is to give the American public more information not less

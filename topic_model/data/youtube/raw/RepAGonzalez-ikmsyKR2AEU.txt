hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update busy week as as usual in DC a lot of action on the floor with respect to my legislative initiatives which was nice so we'll start with the the end child exploitation Act I introduced that bill bipartisan bicameral which is always a great way to start off so if you start bipartisan bicameral you have a chance if you start partisan you probably don't and so what what this bill would do is it would extend the amount of time that technology companies can hold on to child exploitation images before they get deleted the reason why that's important is because there is so much bad content on the Internet today there are so many children being exploited online that law enforcement doesn't have time to get to all those so right now the companies hold those images for 90 days and after the 90th day they just delete them and so there are people trafficking these images that never get investigated never get caught never get discovered and so what my bill would do is it would increase that time from 90 to 180 days just so that you give law enforcement more time to get to all the images we had a roundtable with law enforcement and some technology providers this week and that was their number one issue they said look we just do not have enough time to get through all the content there's so much bad content on the web which is horrifying and so so this bill very simply would just extend that time period give law enforcement more opportunities to go after the criminals who are some of the most disgusting human beings alive and so just really excited that that we have bipartisan bicameral support for that so we'll keep you updated there secondly we voted on the NDAA this week which is the National Defense Authorization Act we vote on that every single year to authorize the different defense programs a while back if you remember we passed sassed a-- out of the house that was my bill i'm sassed as a part of the NDAA so SAS de which is my bill will ultimately become the law of the land when the senate votes on the NDAA last week that'll be the first bill of mine that becomes law we've had three passed the house now the last first one that will become law which is really exciting and what's asta does is it protects our research institutions at the university level but also our national research centers from foreign espionage and foreign influence so right now what's happening is Chinese nationals are studying at our universities they're studying at our research centers on federal taxpayer dollars the Chinese government then comes in plucks them out of the u.s. brings them back to China pays them a whole bunch of money and transfers all the research so they're literally just going into our research institutions and stealing it directly from us I think that's crazy I think most people think that's crazy we research and we do great work in this country and that's how we always stay at the cutting edge and we shouldn't allow anybody to take it from us and so this bill would would fight back on that and again this will become law we passed it out of the house a couple months back it's in the NDAA so that's great and then finally on the House floor we voted on my deep fake bill and that passed unanimously so the deep fake bill now if remember we talked about Forrest Gump so if you remember Forrest Gump in that movie Forrest Gump was placed in different things that he wasn't and he was placed in Vietnam he was placed in conversations with JFK different presidents what have you those are deep fakes they look real if you didn't know any better you'd think they were real and intelligence has been clear that again China Russia Iran are going to be using these deep fake technologies to basically just sow discord in the country just to confuse us make us think things are happening that aren't happening around the world domestically whatever it is and what my bill would do is it would instruct our research enterprises the National Science Foundation and NIST to learn about how to identify defects and develop standards and so again that was that's bipartisan passed unanimously every single member in the House voted for it and and so that was exciting so we'll keep working on that but otherwise we're continuing to put bills forward trying to get things not only through the house but but signed into law as I said first one will happen next week when when the Senate votes on on the NDAA which is really exciting so as always thank you for allowing me to be a representative and I hope everybody has a great weekend [Music]

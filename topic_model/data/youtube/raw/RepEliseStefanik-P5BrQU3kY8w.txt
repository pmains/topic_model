Thank You mr. chairman as all of our panelists noted a movement of troops and materials is vital to our national security and I have some concerns at a base that I represent Fort Drum which is an army installation in New York's 21st district we have inadequate rare rail lines and that infrastructure is critical to supporting the necessary throughput of troops and materials and it's important for training this is also important when it comes to European infrastructure we're plans call for the movement of entired armored brigades via rail how is this lack of capacity being mitigated and synchronized when it comes to our operations plans mr. mr. acting secretary Gillis I'll go to you thank you I appreciate the question so the the Army has identified for power projection platforms including Fort Drum Fort Bliss Fort Bragg and Joint Base lewis-mcchord that have significant rail shortfalls that impact mission readiness we're currently evaluating our power projection capacity in coordination with applicable operation plans through a recently established power projection working group thus on growing review will enable an updated optimal investment strategy to modernize the Army's power projection platforms once we've completed and validated the results of that effort will certainly work to schedule a briefing for you and other committee members as required but power projection platform infrastructure requirements are nested and the Army's overall insulation readiness framework and we understand for us as well as you those are a high priority item thank you for that this is an extremely high priority and particularly because Fort Drum is home to the 10th Mountain Division the most deployed unit in the US Army since 9/11 it's a priority for our base it's a priority for the Army and I want to work to make sure that we can make that investment when it comes to our infrastructure and power projection my next question is for assistant secretary Niemeyer another unique asset that we have at Fort Drum is renewable energy facility we have a biomass facility it means the installation is a hundred percent energy secure and a hundred percent renewable I'd like to hear your comments about that model and the strength of that model and potentially taking that model and learning from it at other installations across the country yes ma'am first of all what you've done it for drum is I think eventually where we want to get to with the rest of the Department of Defense we want to be able to ensure our own power supply that we could potentially if we need to come off the grid and continue to power our critical missions so what you've done there is amazing and it's it does serve the model of what both the Army Department fence is looking at we we do have some concerns moving forward on on tying ourselves to a particular fuel source as you know we are running some challenges there with the biomass compared to the cost of natural gas I think we're gonna build off that and look we're ok where do we build some flexibility in there so we're not beholden to just one type of fuel to a fuel generation source I mean we'll be looking to use that model around the country we definitely are shifting our goals for in the past we were we were really focusing on just renewable generation sources we're now it's open up the open up the gates whatever and we feel is most effective to provide us that energy security that for drum has and we're going to use any energy source so it's it was a it was a great great project and we definitely are learning from it on how to make it even better if you move around the rest of the country and just to delve a little bit deeper as you're making that cost-benefit analysis if your prioritization is making these installations energy secure I understand some of the cost concerns regarding the biomass facility at Fort Drum but it is the model for having long-term certainty and long-term security to make sure that these installations can have access to power when you know they're potentially off the grid so how do you make that cost-benefit analysis how do you go about that that's a that's a fantastic question and I'm not sure I have the definite answer for you when I first got into this position that's one of the things we ask yourself what's the cost of energy security what are we willing to pay 10% more 15% more where does that get us to 90 percent reliability in 95 percent we are still wrestling with that we're still working out in a case by case I understand your position perfectly that we do have a 99 per ton point and reliability what's that worth and above what we would be paying for a market rate right and from my perspective that is worth a lot and the reason why it's worth a lot is because we're looking at that as a model for other basis so I I just want to reiterate why this is an effective model at Fort Drum and why it is worth the investment and with that I have no further questions Thanks

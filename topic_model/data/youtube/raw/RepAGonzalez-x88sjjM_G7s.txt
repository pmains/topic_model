hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update it was a busy week here in DC as everybody I'm sure remembers but I want to start with one thing so we have somebody in our office who is dedicated solely to getting federal grant dollars back into the 16th district and our first grant came through this week so this was a five million dollar grant to the Wayne County Airport and I'm really excited about it this was the first one we started working on so you can see these take a while federal government no surprise right but this is this is great so this is more money back into the community we're gonna keep working on these grants I think it's important there's dollars out there you just got to go find them and so that's that's what we're trying to do so I was happy to see that go through secondly I had a bill passed the Science Space and Technology Committee hopefully it'll get to the floor soon this is a deep fake bill I've talked about this before so deep fakes think Forrest Gump so if you remember Forrest Gump was pictured shaking hands with presidents and all these different things obviously that didn't happen that technology at the time was really expensive so only Hollywood studios could do it now it's it's much cheaper and pretty much anybody can do it and so what I want to do is make sure that our federal agencies and foundations are looking into the technology itself so we can identify it you can see where that could be problematic if you put two people in a room who are never together to you know pretend as if they agreed to something or talked about something so we're gonna study deep fakes that passed unanimously that was great bipartisan it's very happy about that and then finally obviously the the story of the week is is the impeachment inquiry look I I think unfortunately we are at the beginning of what is going to be a long painful divisive process for this country and I've read all the documents that have been released so far I don't see anything that drives me towards thinking that these are impeachable offenses and so you know I personally thought it was irresponsible for Speaker Pelosi to rush to an impeachment inquiry before we had even seen the documents but here we are and so you know going forward what am I going to focus on one I'll read anything that comes I'm more comes out I'm going to read it that's my responsibility that's that's what you send me to do but secondly I'm gonna work I'm gonna work on the legislation that I think is important for Northeast Ohio so that's us MCA I'm going to keep beating the drum on that the JOBS Act I'm going to keep beating the drum on that we picked up more co-sponsors this week the deep fake bill anything that I think is going to be good for Northeast Ohio I'm gonna work on my fear is that the house will be consumed by the impeachment inquiry and we won't get as much done we already don't get a whole lot done now I think it's gonna grind to a halt unfortunately but my commitment to you is to do everything I can to make sure that does not happen all while continuing to read and update myself as more comes out but again I think we're at the beginning unfortunately so I know it's gonna be frustrating for everybody and I just ask everybody to do the same just understand where we are in the process very very beginning very beginning and so unfortunately this will be with us for a while but with that again I want to thank you for for sending me and open everybody has a great weekend

thank you mr speaker 100 000 people in south sudan are at risk of starvation turmoil in the country could push another 5.5 million people into right life-threatening hunger by summer this hunger crisis in sudan is man-made the result of a civil war that has decimated the agriculture and destroyed the economy and it will take humanitarian action to fix it i am proud to be a co-sponsor of house resolution 187 introduced by congresswoman karen bass this resolution aids the people of south sudan by increasing emergency assistance to address the famine and it calls on the government of south sudan to allow unrestricted humanitarian access to displace displaced and starving populations i urge my colleagues to pass this resolution is essential that the south sudanese government and opposition forces cease their inhumane blocking of humanitarian workers and permit the delivery of assistance to south sudanese millions of lives are at stake and as my late father donald payne the member in this seat prior to me fought for this nation to exist over a decade of work here in the congress to now see what is going on he was able to get the situation in the darfur labeled the genocide i hope the next generation of pains does not have to do the same thing in the south sudan with that i yield back

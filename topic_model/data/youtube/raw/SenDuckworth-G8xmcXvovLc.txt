Thank You mr. chairman gentlemen thank you so much for your time today and your testimony and your willingness to answer extensive questions general heighten in your testimony you discussed the effectiveness of our legacy nuclear command control and communications systems and the need to pursue updates to meet evolving needs can you discuss the implications for building a new system in light of the rapid rapidly changing technologies like AI quantum computing and machine learning and also could you elaborate to the extent that you're able to in an open setting are we building an adaptable architecture with the workarounds necessary to it you know to adapt to future tech and modernization so centered over the last six months I've dug into that very deeply much much deeper than I've I would ever expect a combatant commander to have to do that that that's because on the 3rd of October the Secretary of Defense put me in charge of the nuclear command control enterprise and I'm responsible for operations requirements and system engineering of that Enterprise now and so I I felt the need to go out and look at how we're doing today and I understand that pretty well but then I have to define now how we're going to do it in the future in this in this very challenging cyber threat environment that we're walking into so I have some ideas I formed those ideas as I've gone through it basically the the broad-based structure of that idea is to develop a number of pathways for a message to get through that is so nearly infinite that nobody can ever figure out exactly where it is or deny the ability for that message to get through that's the way to do things in the future and I think will have the means to do that I'd have to talk about it much more classified level to get to into the details so I've gone out to industry I've gone out to the federally funded research and development corporations and I've asked them to come in with ideas just last week they deliver those ideas to me we're going to now evaluate those ideas and come up with a broad-based set of mission needs that we need to explore and then I'll work back with industry to figure out how to do that and then the services the the army the Navy in this case will actually build them have you I'm thought about also going out to some of our national laboratories I know they have fallen to a do-e but you know in Illinois we have both Fermilab and Argonne with quantum computing capabilities currently pretty high up on this vector McCallum computing capabilities but without major investments we're gonna fall behind in that you bet and I have gone to the National Labs I went to the National Labs the federally funded research development corporations the University of fill'd resource or research corporations all those elements looking for best ideas and I I did that individually because I found when I brought everybody together in the room the answer ended up looking like it used to and when I kept everybody separately everybody had very very innovative answers so now we're gonna have to figure out how to capture this innovation and move forward effectively but I have reached out to the do lis labs as well as the new arcs near 440 C's thank you I also want to delve a little deeper with both of you into something general Shaughnessy mentioned in his written testimony general when discussing a potential cumulative effects of Chinese and Russian advanced technology such as hypersonics and cyber efforts and you've mentioned him here you said and I quote collectively these advanced technologies could be capable of creating strategic effects with non nuclear weapons potentially affecting national decision makings and limiting lists pawns options in both peacetime and crisis now we're very focused and we've had a quite a discussion today on nuclear strategic deterrent at the moment which to be clear I don't have a problem with I in fact do think we need to modernize our nuclear arsenal but my concern in question for you both is around our own non-nuclear strategic deterrence would you increase investments on our end whether it's hypersonics cyber conventional prompt Global Strike weapons other new technologies ever to reach your level providing a credible deterrent against Chinese and Russian nuclear activities as we suggest they may be attempting with us and how do we balance that with the real need to continue our investments into nuclear realm one thanks for for the opportunity to respond that question because I think it's really it's it's right in line with that with the NDS and as the NDS has articulated the changing security environment one of the things that's really fundamentally changed is the strategic deterrence as it applies to the conventional aspect and so as we look at that as general Haight mentioned that the cost in position in other words we have to be able to impose a cost if we're going to be able to deter but there's also especially on the conventional side there's you have to be able to actually deny them their objectives and so it's a combination of both of those together imposing costs denying their objectives and then be able to credibly communicate that them so they understand that from a deterrence standpoint that is there's absolutely not even worth going down that path and so in order to do that though it's going to take an investment in just areas that you mentioned we have to have our own hypersonic capability and we also have to ability to defend against those those advanced threats and we're able to reach those capabilities if we make these investments if we make those investments as a key part of your statement yes ma'am and and I agree with general Shaughnessy there I think one of the most important things you said though is that you recognize that the strategic deterrence in the 21st century is wholly different than it was in the 20th century it's not just about nuclear weapons it's it's multipolar now it's it's not just the Soviet Union it's Russia China North Korea you have to worry about all the domains you have to worry about nuclear space cyber and conventional and you have to figure out how to integrate all those together we've at strathcom we formed an academic alliance with 35 different universities to try to get them to start thinking about what is really needed in order to do this not just in the technology side but a policy in the strategy side as well thank you general

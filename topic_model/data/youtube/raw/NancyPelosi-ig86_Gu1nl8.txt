announced by the Supreme Court is a victory for America's families it was a victory for America's families when we passed the Affordable Care Act and the President signed it into law since then tens of millions of people in our country are already benefiting from the legislation as you know as the president said so eloquently children can no longer be night coverage due to pre-existing condition young people children and students and young people and stay on their parents policy until they're 26 years old seniors are paying less for prescription drug and have access to free wellness and preventive is it when the bill comes into effect being women will no longer be a pre-existing medical conditions victory for women it's about wellness into that prevention it's about the health of America not just the health care at the it's pretty exciting earlier this morning I met with our caucus after the decision was announced it was as as you know no surprise to us we knew that we thought that we were on solid grounds in terms of interstate commerce solid grounds in terms of the Constitution just a question of what the vote would do and with that confidence we happily embraced the decision that came down now we can move forward to the full implementation of the law and when that happens for the American people the best is yet to come I want to say words out senator Kennedy I spoke to Vicki Kennedy this morning and to patrick trinity before coming here thanking them for the important role that he played a lifetime of commitment in making healthcare a right not a privilege in our country we called it the great unfinished business of our country of our society I knew that when he left us who would go to heaven and hell pass the bill and now I knew is busily at work until this decision came down inspiring one way or another and now he can rest in peace his dream for America's families has become a reality

the president is in meltdown mode as it relates to the situation at the border my guess is that cooler heads will prevail the prevail upon the president not to do it this is one of if not the biggest crisis this country has faced in a decade we're now treating this like a massive cat5 hurricane disaster well Fox News Alert for you the southern border at the breaking point with Customs and Border Protection estimating that they arrested 100,000 illegal immigrants in March alone so why does Congress seem unwilling to act joining me now is congressman Michael Clouse thank you so much for joining us very early this morning we appreciate it sure it's good to be here you're talking about though specifically let's talk about the district that you represent I was listening to a recent interview you did a podcast where you talked about these two highways that come through your district there that go to Houston they bring in drugs you call it the fatal funnel describe for people a little bit more about that law enforcement for years have called us the fatal funnel basically drugs human smugglers they come up through the two highways and had their head toward Houston and then whether it's human trafficking or whether it's drug go out through the nation and of course that corridors those corridors are littered with you talk to ranchers talk to a rancher just a couple weeks ago and he said you know I find dead bodies all in mine Lee and all the time and so this is a serious situation in South Texas we've known for years it's been a serious situation and it's only escalated recently and it's it's good that it's getting the attention that needs but we definitely need to see serious action at the border and what would that serious action be you heard Kirsten Nielson just talking they're saying that you know she would compare this to the response needed following a hurricane or a natural disaster yes on top of that I would say that the cartels that are controlling the southern side of the border should be treated like any other hostile actors on at our border they are not kind they do not have the best of intentions in mind for our nation for our people for the migrants who they're bringing to our border you know the customers of Border Patrol release just a about a week ago a video of them dropping a couple of young girls into razor wire so that our Border Patrol agents would leave their post attend to them for care and then funnel drugs and people through the border and this is the kind of callous regard for human life that they have so when you talk about dealing with those individuals and treating them as hostile actors to that do you mean we need additional military at the border we need infrastructure we need immigration judges we need whatever it takes our Customs and Border Patrol or overwhelm they do not have the resources they do not have the manpower I would be for more military at the border if that's if that's what it took to to stem the tide of what these cartels are doing you know we're heading into another election cycle so of course a lot of the Democratic presidential candidates they have their proposals coming forward we now know at least one of them the first one so far has been released in terms of this this is from who leon castro we can bring up some of the elements in his immigration plan it would change illegal border crossing from a criminal violation to a civil one it would end wasteful border wall construction whatever he means by that pathway to citizenship for dreamers undocumented immigrants and TPS and it would increase the number of refugees allowed into the u.s. so he's talking about increasing the number of refugees when you're telling us first hand we already have an uncontrollable amount of people crossing the border right now we do and they're claiming asylum but the truth is is ninety percent of them are coming for economic reasons which is is understandable but the thing is is the way we heal the world isn't through immigration we cannot you know I've been to India I've seen people who talked with people who are persecuted I've been around the world the people who live in abject poverty we cannot emigrate half the world's population into our country to solve the problem what we can do is the founders gave us a good prescription for this to be that city on a hill you know if these nations live by the principles that this nation was founded upon the they would see the same sort of prosperity but then on that point I have to ask you about what the president is also talking about in terms of cutting off all funding all aid to several of these countries that are that all of these people are fleeing would that rack doesn't seem to have worked so far it's one of the tools in the bag for long for many years we've continued to give countries aid that again don't have our best intentions in mind and so if they're not going to help us out why are we providing them aid you know whether it's Iran or whether it's these countries who are not helping us in this particular situation which is a very very serious situation yesterday we had some people from our district in the border on a completely separate issue but the the conversation just went toward they have clients who's a daughter and and husband were taken by cartels and held for ransom we have landowners along the border who are continually told to stay off their own property because the cartels are using it with many of those individuals and it is terrifying that's what happening in United States of America and it's time for Congress to act all right congressman Kyle thank you so much we appreciate you joining us this morning thank you thank you

i yield the light to you sir all right thank you thank you all for being here this afternoon it is really a privilege for me to be able to take part in this and representing the folks across the way in congress we do have a handful of us i think we have six nato leaders currently serving and hopefully we'll get a few more in this next election cycle you know i look back over some really neat experiences i've had my life and i can honestly say nothing has ever come close to the years i spent in carrier aviation i loved it i loved every single bit of it and and i do miss i honestly miss uh the smell of jp i've got a picture that hangs in my office of a dusk recovery and i can smell the jp i can feel the wind blowing on my face and when i think there's a stressful day on the hill i'll just take a look at the picture and think there's people out there dealing with real stress but you know i always wanted to be a naval aviator i actually i knew since i was five years old and i know that exactly because in 1969 when the astronauts returned from the moon there was a ticker tape parade in houston texas and the blue angels flew f4 phantoms and i knew right then that's exactly what i wanted to do but fast forward all those years later i graduated from navy in 86 i tried to preserve my eyes while while i was there so i didn't study too hard to sort of keep my pilot belly i made the top half of the class possible but top gun came out the week that i got my wings and that was the most exciting time you know 1986 orders in the hand of pensacola the first thing we did when we got there of course we were issued our leather flight jackets and our ray bans and uh and we went from there so i loved it but when i look back over those years they're really three key things that i'll look back at that really stand out to me first of all just i love the fact that there was a spirit of competition around everything we did in naval aviation whether it was trying to compete for the top hook in your rad class or fighting uh to get the line awards for the top you know the top 10 awards or the greedy board god no one wanted to look at a bolter or a no grade up on the line period for the whole time so everything was measured and done we were always competing next would be the teamwork there's just i remember being said one time i guess we had one of our battlegroup commanders said they're in the soviet era we could have given a carrier battle route to the soviets back in those days and they could have taken a decade and still not figure out how to use it but the precision teamwork that was required to pull that off and then well now we're talking about night m-con recoveries things we don't do anymore throwing flags and our flares in the wake and finding our way back aboard without talking to anyone just really great stuff to make that happen i actually have done on the civilian side a few presentations about the flight deck when you think of the coordination of the greats the orbeez the purple shirts the the shooters the handlers everything that goes into making that happen and doing it well it's it's there's nothing else like this it's an incredible symphony and corporate america likes to learn from that i think finally the lesson of just there's nothing like the us aircraft carrier as a tool of diplomacy obviously we talk about you know what the president's always want to know where the carriers but it's also a matter of the value of showing the u.s flag around the world a lot of what we do in the navy isn't seen by folks because it's over the horizon but when we park the carrier out there uh in some port that i always had a lot of pride after liberty and going back out to the ship to look out there and just see this big behemoth out there on the horizon those countries love to see that they also love us to spend their money in port but to train with them there's really nothing else quite like it we refer to the carriers four and a half acres of sovereign u.s territory that's true another airwing commander of mine joe capalbo if anybody remembers a condo he used to like to say when you put when you pull up with the big fat gray winnebago and park it in somebody's front yard they're going to sit up and take notice and pay attention so the carrier is i think very special i'm excited to see what the next century uh holds for and i'm just proud as this can be to be a tailbreaker thank you all for allowing me to be a part of today

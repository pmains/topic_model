THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS, MR. GONZALEZ, FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR. GONZALEZ: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE TO HIGHLIGHT OCTOBER AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW AND IT'S VERY EASY TO FORGET WE HAVE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THAT ARE LIVING IN A VERY ABUSIVE ENVIRONMENT. MANY PEOPLE WALK AROUND WITH SCARCE THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE BUT ALSO MANY OF US WALK AROUND WITH SCARCE THAT NOBODY CAN SEE. AND IN PARTICULAR, I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE WOMEN THAT ARE IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS 5 YEARS OLD, I RECALL WHEN MY MOTHER WOKE ME UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO SNEAK US OUT OF OUR VERY ABUSIVE HOME AND REMEMBER SPENDING TIME IN A BATTERED WOMEN'S SHELTER. THAT MOMENT WILL NEVER LEAVE ME. LOOKING BACK AT IT NOW, MY MOTHER WAS THE BRAVEST WOMAN I KNEW THEN AND THE BRAVEST WOMAN I KNOW NOW. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT CONSTANTLY UNDER ABUSE. CAN YOU LEAVE, WHETHER THAT'S TODAY, WHETHER THAT'S TOMORROW, WHETHER THAT'S DECADES FROM NOW. TODAY I'M VERY PROUD OF LAST YEAR. MY MOTHER -- YEARS AGO, SHE LEFT THAT ABUSIVE ENVIRONMENT. JUST LAST YEAR, SHE WAS ABLE TO GET HER BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT EL PASO, UTEP. AMAZING TO GO BACK AND GET HER EDUCATION. TODAY SHE LIVES WITH ME. SHE -- WITH HER AND MY WIFE, ANGEL, HELP RAISE OUR CHILDREN. AND TODAY SHE'S IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SHE IS LOVED. I SAY THAT TO GO, THIS MONTH, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH, WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT. IF YOU'RE IN A VIOLENT SITUATION, YOU, TOO, CAN GET OUT. YOU, TOO, CAN CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF YOUR LIFE. AND YOUR CHILDREN CAN AND YOUR CHILDREN CAN GO OFF AND BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE LIVE IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY. WHETHER IT'S TODAY, TOMORROW, OR

michael mccall joins us again here on capitol tonight republican from austin and chairman once again of the homeland security committee uh good to have you here thank you paul we'll talk about your selection to continue uh to serve as chairman but let's get your reaction to the president's speech on immigration and his executive actions uh what were your initial thoughts well i think what struck me very odd was that he said congress says i don't have the authority to do this he said over 20 times in his presidency that he does not have the legal authority to do this and that that's not how democracy works and now and now he's doing it um and uh in our view it's an abuse of authority uh whether it's unconstitutional i think the courts are going to decide that issue but we um this is going uh american people particularly after the last election circumventing the congress uh you know however you feel on the issue and it's a very uh heated emotional issue this is not the right way to do it there's a right way and the wrong way and i think he chose the wrong way to do it during his speech you know he indicated that republicans and democrats alike and previous administrations have used their executive authority and uh you know reading stories i guess during the reagan administration for a certain amount of nicaraguan citizens same thing even eisenhower with cubans and why is the circumstance different now well i think it's very different number one that president reagan and and bush and eisenhower in that case worked with the congress and in fact were reacting and responding to congressional action uh in this case he is taking unilateral action uh really in defiance of the congress and in circumvention of the congress that's a very uh big distinction prosecutorial discretion i was a federal prosecutor typically used on a case-by-case basis or in the humanitarian um in a way but i think to apply in a huge swath of discretion to five million people to give them amnesty uh we believe that that's going beyond discretion and now is an abuse abuse of authority he did uh mention three points and the first one was more resources for the border and i know border security is a key for you and legislation that you have out there what what do you think is involved in that do you know what the president is talking about when he's saying more resources for the border well i was briefed by the secretary of homeland security yesterday before the speech on the points and and frankly that's that's one point we can agree on i i think the border security approach i think we have to get the security piece done and we have to do it first and i'll tell you why because every time we talk about amnesty and immigration reform what do we see at the border is a huge uh wave of illegal immigrants trying to cross in we saw six after amnesty was granted without the enforcement and then we start when daca was passed by the president or by executive action we saw the sixty thousand children then crossing uh over the rio grande valley sector in our state uh so methodically and the intelligently you have to get the security piece done at the border as the first step and then the immigration reform debate over how to to fix a broken immigration system i think we all agree on that that comes sequentially and i think he's putting the car before the horse here and i think we're gonna see unfortunately as the governor talked about is a wave of illegals now uh responding that hey if i get in i can stay too he when he was talking about this again kind of anticipating the concern that republicans have on this said now we're not going to take anybody who's recently come or anybody in the future it's who we're dealing with now in the here and now could you look at this whether you agree with executive uh authority or not to uh as a stop gap measure as the border security uh function takes place as well because i don't know is is there a timeline like how quickly can you secure the border while you have all these millions of undocumented people here well i think you're going to see when we have a more friendly senate coming in uh we can govern now in the congress we can pass legislation out of the congress which we haven't been able to do i think you're going to see us come up with our own agenda and perhaps there is some you know hopefully there's some room to work with the president uh on some of the stuff but but to do it the way he did it unilaterally is again is not the right way uh to do this and i think it just welcomes a new wave of illegal immigrants i talked to a high-level state department official yesterday and she told me that uh they are very concerned now that just as with daca the traffickers messaged uh that if you come you can stay they're going to exploit even though the president says you have to be here for five years like you mentioned the traffickers don't get into the uh the weeds on that one as amnesty is coming the president's allowing for it and come on in so we're going to see it i think a wave of central americans now uh we have the same phenomenon the same problem and again i think the security piece and then we talk about we debate reform uh and that should be the sequence of events you are going to continue to serve congratulations as chairman of the homeland security committee what's uh what's next for the committee uh i know obviously the immigration discussion is here uh what else are you anticipating almost immediately well i am uh like it or not from my front and center uh in this debate i have an oversight hearing with the secretary the first week we get back after thanksgiving um uh the border security bill you're going to see a very strong bill i know a lot of statewides ran on that issue it is a federal issue that needs to be dealt with at the federal level and i think for the first time i'm very excited that working with my counterpart in the senate we've talked about this to sort of uh hotline a bill where i can get it passed through the house and the senate will pass what we'll put on the president's desk that's going to be i think the top line priority for me cyber security uh continues to be an issue as the threats uh coming out of russia and china and iran are getting worse not better and then finally foreign fighters i'm investigating uh the travel that foreign fighters have isis um out of iraq and syria through turkey to western europe and then into the united states and then the final piece would be the radicalization piece within the united states so those are real threats to the homeland that we'll be very focused on and i hope to have an impact in the next conference it was a great honor to once again be asked by my colleagues to serve in this capacity well congressman we always appreciate you stopping by happy thanksgiving to you and your family and best of luck washington thanks so much paul appreciate it and we're back with more capital tonight after this you

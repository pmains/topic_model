we have a lot to discuss with representative karen bass who joins us now and congresswoman thank you so much for joining us today so much to go over and what a couple of days it has been first of all i heard your terrifying accounts of what you went through yesterday are you okay today well thank you so much for asking yes i am in my office at the capitol in washington dc and i am fine all is quiet here okay you seem calm and rested it's great to see you and we want to start with something that you tweeted out earlier today the fbi said it was seeking to identify people who instigated violence at the capitol you tweeted a photo of president trump and said quote found one do you think this idea of impeachment or the cabinet invoking the 25th amendment to remove him from office is realistic with less than two weeks to go left in his term well let me just tell you that i believe that he should be removed from office today i believe he is a clear and present danger to the people of the united states now having said that i would love to see the 25th amendment invoked and vice president pence met his obligation to the country yesterday by certifying the election i would love to see him take it a step further but the question that you asked is it realistic i happen to think that members of the cabinet are as corrupt as he is and so i don't know whether or not they would they would move i doubt it uh for example um elaine chao who resigned today how about instead of resigning you stay there and step up and invoke the 25th amendment in terms of impeachment i would love to see him impeached and i would also love to see him impeach because then he would never be able to run for office again an absolute nightmare in our country would be if he spent the next three years campaigning for president but do i think the same senators who refused to certify the election yesterday will vote for impeachment i don't think that that's very very realistic yeah that sounds uh that sounds about right well there are serious questions about uh this response from capitol police yesterday why the rioters weren't stopped and why there wasn't a bigger police presence to begin with what do you think happened here you know i do not know but i do believe there should be a full investigation i'm very glad to see that the head of the capitol police has resigned it was just shocking and outrageous you can't come into the capitol with a purse without it being screened how do you have flag poles they were armed some had molotov cocktails there were people that had guns you know that there were pipe bombs i don't know if they were real or fake uh so it was just absolutely obscene what took place and then there are 2 000 members of the capitol police force and from what i understand but this is without an investigation only 500 were on duty the president has told us for months he was going to do exactly what he did yesterday so i just think it is completely uninexcusable yeah there was ample warning and to take this a step further president-elect biden today said that he saw a clear failure of equal justice saying black lives matter protesters for instance would have been treated very differently so what are your thoughts on that well first of all it was an incredible breath of fresh air to hear the president-elect acknowledge what was so obvious part of my anger yesterday was the idea that if that had been a protest over police brutality with a large number of african-americans i believe blood would have been flowing down the halls of the capital i do not doubt that you know a few years ago african-american mother had a psychotic break she started driving erratically and she drove into one of the barricades they shot her they killed her her baby was in the back it was in the back seat so you know how did they get into the building when this building is so secure i had told my family they didn't need to be concerned about me at all because i was in the safest place in the country actually the opposite was what was true right we remember that incident when that woman was killed well uh congresswoman karen bass for all you do for this country and all the others who the work that you guys do you deserve to be protected i'm sorry you went through this but it's great to see that you were safe and thanks for joining us today thank you for having me on

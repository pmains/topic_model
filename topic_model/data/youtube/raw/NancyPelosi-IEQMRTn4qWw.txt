are pleased to convene this this a policy hearing this afternoon a conversation on race and justice in America on a thank you all for being here today it's a privilege to welcome you thank the members of our distinguished panel who we will introduce in a moment thank you so much for joining us today 50 years now since dr. Martin Luther King's famous addressed at the Lincoln Memorial and in fact we have seen progress towards racial justice since then but as dr. King once said one of the sure signs of maturity is the ability to rise to the point of self-criticism and as recent events have made clear yet again we still have a lot of self-reflection and Chris and criticism to do several statistics which I think are important that we need to consider and that's unemployment today is an unacceptable seven point six percent overall for african-americans it is close to double that thirteen point seven percent one in six Americans now lives under the poverty line the highest it's been since 1993 that includes twenty-eight percent of african-americans and forty percent of african-american children the disparities persist not just in our economy but also sadly in our justice system for example while african-americans make up about fifteen percent of the nation's drug users they are thirty-seven percent of those arrested fifty-nine percent of those convicted and seventy-four percent of those sentenced to prison for a drug offense that is not right I hope today we can talk honestly about these continuing and unjust disparities in America how we can better work to resolve them only if we deal with these problems in a forthright manner work together listen to each other in a spirit of self-reflection with humility and with love we can continue to work towards our goal of a more equal and a more just nation that is why we were here today I thank you and is now my pleasure to yield to my colleague Rob Andrews I thank my colleague mr. Laura welcome ladies and gentlemen in the painful aftermath the verdict in Florida we've heard a lot about stand your ground laws we're here today because we have a Stand Your brown law it's called the 14th amendment the United States Constitution and it says that neither equal protection or due process should be denied to any American at any time but when the one place that minority you seem to be most welcome is an unemployment line rather than a graduation line we are here to stand our ground when we have seen a decision from the United States Supreme Court that may undermine the underpinnings of affirmative action and roll back decades of progress we believe it is time to stand our ground most of all when we see the Voting Rights Act vandalized by the United States Supreme Court opening the door to nefarious exclusionary practices across this country we know it is time to stand our ground we have assembled a wonderful panel of witnesses to lead us through this discussion we hope that it is the first in many steps that bends the arc toward the just result that we so much want a leader of our caucus in our country who has spent her life time bending history toward the the Ark of Justice is the leader of the House Democratic caucus and a chair of this committee represented Pelosi from California thank you very much chairman Rob Andrews congressman chairwoman rosa DeLauro to both of you for bringing us together this morning we are here because the congressional black caucus which is called the conscience of the Congress and has challenged the conscience of the Congress and congresswoman Marcia fudge who is the chair of the committee has been a great leader in helping to expand civil rights in our community and protecting voting rights for all to expand the reach of opportunity for every American regardless of race to realize the ideal of equality which is our heritage and our hope she and others of the Congressional Black Caucus have that as their mantra their North Star and thank you Connor with more fudge for your leadership I am pleased to I'm going to yield to mr. Clyburn our the assistant leader and thank him for his leadership which goes back decades and the civil rights movement but today to enhance and enrich our conversation we are privileged to welcome three experts on the status of race religion race relations in America Maya Wiley founder and president of center for social inclusion Morris Dees founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center Eugene Robinson feel at surprise winner from the Washington Post they will be introduced more fully but i want to thank them because coming here equipped with the knowledge and expertise that they have members of Congress can be better informed as we continue a conversation of race and justice in america now i'm going to before I yield to mr. Clyburn I'll say how honored I am that all of our colleagues are here our vice chair of the House Democratic I mean the chair of the House Democratic Oliver mr. Becerra and our ranking member once in future chair of the Judiciary Committee mr. Conyers with that I want to thank mr. Clyburn for his extraordinary leadership on this issue over decades and has to get the microphone to him thank you very much madam leader let me thank the coaches of the steering and Policy Committee thank you so much for convenient us here today chair a lady fudge other distinguished colleagues and I want to welcome the panelist who are here in a couple of days we're going to pause here i think in Statuary Hall to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their great march on washington for some strange reason we did not have a celebration of what i consider to be the publication of one of the most timeless documents ever written and that's mod Luther King Junior's letter from birmingham city jail he wrote that letter A a few months before that great march and I read that letter several times and I'm often reminded of a portion of that letter which i think is very apropos here today you may recall that letter was written in response to a letter he received from eight clergymen one of whom was from our native state Jane of South Carolina Haddon Evan harden they asked him to leave Birmingham because they thought that he was a disruptive force and they thought his time end was result was wrong and though his cause was right King in responding to them said said in his letter that he was coming to conclusion that the people of ill will in our society make a much better use of time than the people of good will and he concluded that thought by saying that we are going to be made to repent in this generation not just for the vitriolic words and deeds of bad people but for the appalling silence of good people we're here today hopefully to break a silence that is permeated this country for a long time on this whole question of race and justice mr. Dees the fact of the matter is as Rowena Tobias a matriarch down in Charleston told me when I was still a young man getting started in this business she said to me and she thought that South Carolina's progress was hindered in large measure because we would sit down to solve every problem that existed in our society save one and that was race she said to me she thought that every time the question of race surface people would stop talking and she asked me please don't stop talking because we are not going to solve this problem until we learn to talk about it and that's what we're here today I would hope that events the recent days as well as this here today will jumpstart a very important dialogue on this whole question a trace I do believe we can have some honest discussions we can get beyond it with that let me yield to our distinguished chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Marcia fudge thank you very much and thank you madam leader chairs of Syrian policy as well as mr. Clyburn and all who are here I am extremely pleased we are having a hearing on a topic that has for too long been a thorn in the side of this nation as we celebrate as you talked about the 50th anniversary of the march on washington for jobs and freedom many of the principles dr. King and the multicultural coalition of people who joined him are being challenged today over the past few months the foundation on which this country was built has been shaken we've seen a key provision of the Voting Rights Act overturned we've seen programs that work to close the gaps in educational economic and health opportunities come under attack we've had a nation of people dealing with the consequences of losing their opportunity in the forms of overt institutional and structural and justice but few people are willing to discuss these issues in a productive and constructive way we must get serious about acknowledging the impact of racial profiling violence and inequitable treatment under the law is having on our communities and a particular concern to me having on our young people we must be vocal and honest about the impact of attacks on our civil constitutional and economic rights the rights of thousands of people of all races fought and died to protect the emotion and the energy so many people especially our young people had around the Trayvon Martin tragedy the attack on voting rights the attack on feeding hungry people in this country the attack on access to education health care and almost every other issue that matters to our lives must be channeled into the right place therefore it is vital that we start and continue the conversation we will have today and in the communities we all represent I do believe it is our responsibility as elected leaders to convene those who will challenge the status quo and to provide certain factions in our society a broader platform from which they can express their concerns I again thank leader Pelosi the co-chairs and I thank all of our speakers for joining us today to provide their insight on the current state of race and justice in America and how we as a nation work toward moving in the right direction like to really say a thank you to the panel and move to our introductions and we are really very very excited about your presence here and and the work that you've done and I gives me a great great pleasure and an honor really of introducing a man who has devoted a long career to fighting poverty racism discrimination injustice in America Morris Dees the co-founder and chief trial attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center the son of an Alabama farmer Morris witnessed firsthand the painful consequences of prejudice and racial injustice in our country in 1971 after a decade of success in law and business he sold a successful book publishing firm to start a civil rights law practice that would provide a voice for the disenfranchised and helped to make the advances of the civil rights movement real on the ground at the direct result of the early cases that the SPLC took recreational facilities were desegregated the Alabama Legislature was reapportioned and state troopers integrated and the state prison system was reformed in the decades since splc has fought to dismantle institutional racism where it exists reformed the juvenile justice system shatter barriers to equality for women children and the disabled and protect low-wage immigrant workers from abuse Morris Dees has been called one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America and has received many many honors in some more SD suspend a long and a storied career working at the critical Institute intersection of race and justice in American life and fighting to make a positive difference on the ground we thank you so much mr. Dees for being here today and for lending us your insights your experience and your expertise mr. andrew i'm going to introduce mr. Robinson he's a Pulitzer prize-winning writer reporter regular on meet the press and hard ball in the Rachel Maddow Show 25-year in various roles rather at the Washington Post and while reporting abroad mr. Robinson has witnessed firsthand the revolution taking place online in the 24 7 news cycle seeing how the news media is influencing American culture as one of the most prominent african-american intellectuals on the cultural scene and the author of disintegration the splintering of black America in 2010 he also shares with audiences his understanding of race relations in the United States and explains why many popular conceptions are now obsolete his views are never obsolete and we're very thankful he's with us today like to recognize Marcia fudge thank you very much and I have a pleasure of introducing Maya wiley miss Wiley is a leading author on the topic of racial equity most relevant to today's hearing in 2012 she authored an article titled talk about race right the why and how of persuasive race talk for the Joint Center for political and economic studies in their 2012 focus magazine Maya holds a JD from columbia university school of law and a bachelor's degree in psychology from Dartmouth College please join me in welcoming my friend Miss Wiley ok and with that we will begin the testimony from the witnesses and we'll start with you mr. Dees followed by Miss Wiley and followed by mr. Robinson morris dees I want to thank the committee for inviting me here and I come as a representative from the 43 lawyers in 200 other hard-working dedicated workers at the Southern Poverty Law Center I watched the Trayvon Martin case like most of you did being a lawyer I was especially interested in the strategy of all the parties the jury didn't quite look like the people sitting before me here had it might have been a different results but you know racial profiling is a secret hiding in public and America is becoming increasingly armed and dangerous and those two things make for a recipe for disaster juror number 37 be I think that your number said race was not involved she said it was profiling of a potential criminal essentially is what she said well profiling is a PC word politically correct word that somebody in parts press generations would have just said simply race but race is a major issue and it doesn't matter to me whether people say well the murder rate is dropping drastically and you can come up with all the statistics whether it's one a 100 individuals who lose their life because of racial profiling that's one too many the Trayvon Martin case is to me many ways like the song with you've heard the 35th and this is a 36 verse down in Jena Louisiana I think many of you remember a group of african-american students at a school that had about fifteen percent black students one to sit under stand under an oak tree where the white students gathered during recess and the principal said sure but the next day three nooses were found hanging from the tree and Not long afterwards several African American six in fact got in some fights with the whites and they were extremely overcharged charged with assault with intent to murder and Jesse Jackson said it was a defining moment this incident when 20,000 people brought by Al Sharpton there to demonstrate Jesse said it was kind of like Selma a defining moment and there were hearings at this at this Congress building House Judiciary Committee had hearings little has changed fortunate to say the Southern Poverty Law Center represented and provided counsel for these six people involved in this case and all of them but one got out with serving no time in that one served a small amount of time you know I think we talked about the Supreme Court recently in its decision striking down section for the Voting Rights Act well our Supreme Court has led the way on racial profiling because they're unwilling to say that the emperor has no clothes on let me just read you quickly a case this us bein cool rule in 1987 McCleskey vs basically the state of georgia in this death row inmate in Georgia said Lake wait a minute african-americans seem to get the death penalty more than whites etc and those who kill whites tend to have the horses punishment and a guy named baldus famous sociologist put together an enormous study which showed that was really true but here's what the Supreme Court had said in upholding this poor man's death penalties after chimeric his death penalty they said this the study indicates that the death penalty in Georgia was imposed more often on black defendants and killers of white victims then on white defendants and killers of black victims but this it failed to establish that any of the decision-makers in defendant's case acted with discriminatory purpose and violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the study at the most indicated a discrepancy that appeared to correlate with race not a constitution if accan risk of racial bias affecting Georgia's capital punishment system correlated with race I don't know how you've stated any clearer than that what this study was supposed to show one and the Columbia Law Review article of in 2008 a noted writer wrote that that race should should not be considered to have to be a motive just look at its historical history and i think that's that's what we're really talking about here today there were so many talking heads that that you get tired of watching them after the Trayvon Martin verdict came in and Zimmerman and it was like was it racial was it not dadadada da but on and on and on but let me tell you it clearly race was involved in this situation and I'm not sure from a legal standpoint what this jury could do with Florida's law and the way the judge with jury was charged but the jury of public opinion in America I think was flabbergasted at the results but unfortunately about over half of Africa white people thought that the jury verdict was accurate and in over half of the African Americans thought it was an inadequate verdict and surprisingly a lot of black people agreed with the guilty verdict on around thirty something percent which is surprising to me too you know before I throw out a couple of ideas and I'm really looking forward to the questions answers from you more than anything I grew up on a small cotton farm where race was critical it was the only issue it was Jim Crow african-americans had no rights in any particular area I certainly integrate the Alabama state troopers with other lawyers at the center when three different inches of african-american I represented was beaten up and pistol-whipped in Georgia before he shot two state troopers who were doing it and I did the same thing in Alabama in two other cases and then I finally represented a young man a MP in the military who came back to be a state trooper and wanted to integrate George Wallace's 685 white trooper force and finally that integrated the Alabama state troopers I hope your questions deal somewhat with the solutions of this and I can throw out some answers of my time is running out here but at the Law Center we see the solutions to these issues involving race injustice is not simple they involve men things and some of those things we're working on education is the major one we filed lawsuits in Jackson mobile Birmingham Jefferson Parish and several in Florida trying to stop the expulsion of african-american students particular males the status offenses and we also indicated a have a program dealing with positive behavioral things that schools can use and we have we certainly can provide those with the committee Trayvon Martin was himself not in school at the time he had been he had been dismissed from school because of some status offense and maybe had he been in school he wouldn't have been in the line of fire but I do hope that that at some point and I'll just kind of lay this out I hope that Congress should pass an act and the name of Trayvon Martin to address issues of racial profiling the akwid can with condition the state receipts of federal funds for highway construction and drug and addiction other programs on the establishment programs to root out racial profiling by the police I don't think that's all Congress should do but I think that would be a good start thank you thank you Miss Wiley thank you distinguished members of Congress for your leadership I feel lifted by your leadership and saddened that we have to sit here today but it's such an important conversation and I wanted to actually start with a story my cousin who I revere is a huge fan of congresswoman pledges so as soon as I knew I was going to be testifying I texted or and let her know and I told her what I would be testifying about because I knew my stock and my family would increase dramatically and so I immediately got back from her a story that I hadn't heard that was in fact in the news from Lexington Kentucky where she used to live a 23 year old college student jumped out of his car to have a fight with two other young men who were also in a car a fight happened and the 23 year old college student was shot and killed and the shooter was not prosecuted for the shooting now that might sound fairly straightforward in the way I just told it which was much of the way the News reported it but the way my cousin told me was very different because her two stepdaughters went to high school with a young man who was killed the young man who was killed was black and he hopped out of his car because the two men in the car who he got out the car to shoot I mean to fight with I had actually hurled a racial epithet at him and it turns out that the two one of the two white men in the car hurled the racial epithet because he was in fact dating the white ex-girlfriend of one of the young men in the car so when you hear the story that way it becomes a slightly different story and let me tell you one other aspect to it my cousin's black her two stepdaughters are white so it both shows us the incredible strides we've made in this country because one my cousin has two beautiful stepdaughters who are white with whom she is extremely close and to that these two young white women were friends with this young african-american man because they went to high school together and their understanding of the dynamic between the men who shot him and this young man is very very different as a result now that is what i would call overt racism right that's just straight up old style throughout a racial epithet no protection for someone who was certainly any of us who receives a racial epithet or another kind of epithet they're fighting words but what's deadly force when can you actually kill someone because one man is going after 22 others right not 12 but I want to move on to race because one of the things that we need to distinguish today is race versus racism now let me say up front racism is on the increase in the United States and that's a very sad and unfortunate fact yes oh press did a study with a leading psychologist in 2012 that found that the increase in negative attitudes towards blacks as negative has increased from forty-eight percent when President Obama was elected to office 251 percent in 2012 that is an increase in overt stereotyping negative stereotyping of black people unfortunately we don't have measures for Latinos for Native Americans I would suspect that we would actually see similar patterns particularly when we think about the conversations we've had around immigration nonetheless the point here is that that same study went deeper and looked at something that I would say is race that we need to distinguish and that is implicit bias we have two decades of social science that actually show us that our laws and policies have not kept pace with our understanding of the human brain so here is your brain on race your brain on race is that fifty six percent of Americans actually have in that same AP study 56% have negative attitudes towards black people that they do not know they have necessarily right now that's something that's very different so when we hear a juror in the George Zimmerman case say this isn't about race there's something that's actually not surprising in the cognitive science about that because quite frankly most people in this country do not believe that racism is okay and when they hear racist statements they think that's wrong and something should be done about it and are completely unconscious as to the ways in which our images are constant images of young black men being arrested or are constant images of Latinos being handcuffed at the border or are constant images of a drunken Native American or are constant images of Muslims is terrorists right even our images of women people was based on sexual orientation we carry many many kinds of biases as a result of what we see and actually how we structure society so this is very important because the difference between racism is you're wrong and you know you're wrong the difference with race is that people believe the right things and don't recognize that their brain is acting like computer software it spits out an answer that you respond to in a nanosecond without you seeing all the circuitry and all the algorithms that are leading to that action right and our laws do not reflect that now there's tons of evidence and I have a lot of it in my written testimony so I won't go through it all but let me just say that after two decades of studies here's what we know if you are a black child in a school you are likely to have a teacher who has a lower expectation of your academic performance and that has an impact on your academic performance if you have are a pediatrician with implicit bias you are less likely to prescribe pain medication to your patient when they report pain and if you are a police officer actually a college student in a trial test you are more likely to shoot a black person holding up a wallet or a cell phone than a white person holding up a wallet or a cell phone and none of these things are because you intend that impact and let me share one other thing that's so important about this a lot of conversations that we had after the and we heard during before during and after the trial of George Zimmerman was he's Latino stop talking about race how can he be racist because he's Latino well once again what we fail to understand that the science recognizes is we all have implicit bias actually in the implicit associations test which is one of the premier tests that have been run for decades more than 2 million people have taken this test tons of evidence one of the things that shows us is that in fact forty-two percent of black respondents have a preference for whites and negative black attitudes so it isn't something that is reserved only to a particular race even so we can't even understand though if someone black thinks it's not about race or if someone black thinks that stereotype is true that does not make it true so I want to end with what does this mean because as I've said there are several reasons why we have implicit bias and one is that we have made so much progress on the conscious front meaning we have said as a society and we deeply share and believe that it is wrong to judge someone by their appearance or their religion or their sexual orientation hopefully most of us including the Pope now it is wrong to make that judgment they should be judged on their actions right and yet we're constantly making judgments that do not reflect an actual judgement of action and that's when mr. Dees talks about juries and why it's so important for them to be reflective it's because we have seen from from a decade of studies in Florida that even one black juror on a jury has decreased the conviction rates of black defendants and increased the conviction rates of white defendants so that we don't see racial disparities injury Vic verax at least in the two counties that that in Florida where this was tested so what that tells us is a few things diversity matters and our policies that support diversity whether it's affirmatively furthering our fair housing rules as HUD is currently doing whether it's finding ways to ensure that we're all living together going to school together in non-competitive community activity that actually has a huge impact as far as the social science on actually changing how some of these implicit biases work the more we live together work together the more we are able to bypass some of this circuitry and create new neural pathways and that should be true for all of us right I mean it also there's another point he and I know this Congress has been fighting about a lot of these issues we don't understand why we see the poverty and exclusion that we see in black communities are Latino communities or Native American communities if we understood them we would no longer necessarily make the connection that the people must be bad I'll give one example I could give many more but just one from some of the research that's out there two-thirds of all low and moderate skilled jobs in our hundred largest metropolitan areas are more than 90 minutes from public transit and blacks and Latinos are six times more likely to be without a car and transportation costs are more expensive than almost all our household costs put together which means when we look at a community of high poverty we don't see that we fail to make the investments that would create the opportunity for those community members to get to the jobs they could get and when we talk about the Affordable Care Act otherwise known as Obamacare 21 of the states that are opting out hold almost sixty percent of the African Americans this country who are uninsured and would benefit from Medicaid expansion and so when we wonder why child hood obesity rates are high and when we wonder why people wait and go to the emergency room rather than passing a judgment I hope that we can have a conversation about how we invest in each other thank you thank you excellent mr. Robinson thank you so much leader Pelosi congresswoman DeLauro chairwoman fudge I can't name all of the distinguished members of Congress of here and my friends and heroes or I'll take up all my time but thank you so much for the privilege of addressing you today it's a great honor this is a new experience for me a new vantage point sitting at the table in what is often the hot seat thanks to you I come here today as always as a journalist but I come here also as an african-american father of two sons and as a native South Carolinian who grew up during civil rights movement and the tumultuous final throes of Jim Crow I come here today as a journalist and author having dedicated much of my professional life to trying to further our difficult national conversation on race and by the way this I believe is the way we are fated to have that conversation something happens an event the commands our attention shocks our collective conscience that touches a nerve and so we talk and we argue when we shout we write our columns and can mean our hearings and eventually we turn to other things and the conversation dies out and it seems as if we've gotten nowhere and some sometimes that's true but sometimes we do make progress though we might not recognize that progress for some time it's an uncomfortable process but this is how the conversation works and we all know what events sparked this round of the conversation the slaying of Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of his killer George Zimmerman I'd like to read just a few of the words that I wrote following the verdict because i think they are relevant to the question of race and justice in america justice failed Trayvon Martin the night he was killed we should be appalled and outraged but but perhaps not surprised that it failed him again with a verdict setting his killer free George Zimmerman was acquitted because the society considers young black men to be dangerous interchangeable expendable guilty until proven innocent the acquittal was set in motion on februari 26 2012 before Martin's body was even cold when Sanford Florida police arrived on the scene they encountered a grown man who acknowledged kill killing an unarmed 17 year old boy they did not arrest the man or test him for drug or alcohol use they conducted a less than energetic search for forensic evidence they hardly bothered to look for witnesses even after six weeks had elapsed evidence was found to justify arresting Zimmerman and put him on trial but the chance of definitively and independently establishing what happened that night was probably lost the only complete narrative with Zimmerman's trayvon martin at the time of his death was three weeks past his 17th birthday but black boys in this country are not allowed to be children they are assumed to be men even at a tender age and to be full of menace I don't know if the jury which included no african-americans consciously or unconsciously bought into this racist way of thinking but it hardly matters because police and prosecutors initially did the assumption was that Zimmerman had the right to self-defense but Martin young male black did not the assumption was examined my fear for his life in a hand-to-hand struggle but Martin young male black would not if anyone wonders why african-americans feel so passionately passionately about this case it's because we know that our 17-year old sons are boys not men it's because we know their adolescent bravado is just that an imitation of manhood not the real thing we know how frightened our sons would be if they were walking home alone on a rainy night and realized they were being followed we know how torn they would be between a child's fear and a child's immature idea of manly behavior we know how they would struggle to decide which was the right course of action flight or fight and we know that a skinny boy armed only with a bag of candy no matter how big and bad he tries to seem does not pose a mortal threat to a healthy adult man who outweighs him by 50 pounds and has had martial arts training albeit in vain we know that the boy may well have threatened the man's pride but hardly his life the conversation we need to have is about how black men are denied the right to be boys as an example whites and blacks are equally likely likely to smoke weed but blacks are four times more likely to be jailed on marijuana charges there is no rational reason for the disparity I think it's because of racism what do you think those words were written from the heart but the facts that back them up are there for any dispassionate observer to examine justice is not colorblind because our society is not colorblind and laws that have no intrinsic racial content can become instruments of discrimination in this regard I'm especially concerned about the stand-your-ground laws and we should recall that the laudable purpose of these laws initially in many cases was to protect women from violently abusive spouses by by essentially establishing that they had no obligation to retreat but the practical effectively as we saw in the Trayvon Martin case can be warped by race George Zimmerman did not claim stand your ground at his trial but he didn't have to because he was already accorded the benefit of the doubt given by stand your ground at the time of the incident that benefit of the doubt was given to him and there was no taking it back and so the decision about who gets to stand his ground and who doesn't is literally a matter of life and death I'm also deeply concerned about the glaring racial disparity and arrests and incarceration for minor drug offenses my time is running out but I'll just one other figure african-americans represent twenty-six percent of juvenile arrests now that's already out of proportion with the african african american share of the population but twenty six percent of juvenile arrests from there it jumps to fifty eight percent of youth admitted to state prisons and so even black youth are twice as likely as they should be to be arrested in the first place and then twice as likely again to go to prison for the for the same offenses so we'll get into more facts and figures in in question and answer I'm sure I just close with my sincere thanks to all of you for convening this hearing and for continuing the quest for racial justice whose Ark sadly is longer than any of us had hoped thank you may I just ask our colleagues to express appreciation to the very excellent testimony I want to just acknowledge our members who are here we're very honored with the presence of Representative John Lewis congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson congresswoman barbara Lee congresswoman Karen bass was here she may be coming back congressman gk butterfield congress our chair as i mentioned earlier Xavier Becerra congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee the chairs we know the CBC congresswoman Marcia fudge freshman member congresswoman Robin Kelly congresswoman Joyce Bailey another member of the freshman class congressman ted deutsch congressman keith Ellison congresswoman Donna Christensen our Chairman has been acknowledged Congressman John Conyers and congressman Henry quite Henry Cuellar when we get to our comments Oh congressman Greg meet back here our overflow when we get to our comments i want to remind our colleagues that i took one minute and that may be all we can each have to put our ideas on the table to get the proper time for my wrist but i want to acknowledge that we have been joined by our distinguished House Democratic whip and champion on civil rights of Steny Hoyer standing thank you so much and thank you for convening this March to thank you for your leadership and thank the Congressional Black Caucus there aren't enough white people at this rostrum racism is not simply about african-americans it is as Miss wiley pointed out about the very psychology of our country Morris you deal with that on a regular basis racism is present in every of our communities and as you point out dr. Wiley present in all of our minds and and we need to be conscious of that and confront it that's why I think this conversation is is so important I want to thank of course Gene Robinson who many of us who live in this area and of course all of you who are visiting have the opportunity to read on a regular basis he had so much to to the dialogue and has this conversation this conversation is not new and my speculation is it will never end I don't know why that's the case but if you read the Bible thousands of years have gone by and we are still having race about differences about not the content of character but the color of skin or the religion or the the Irish all look alike they have a different religion and they tend to hate the other person that they're getting their they're moving but Shia and Sunni maybe you can just named so many examples but here in America race of course is the most visible most evident difference between us gender as well obviously but I want to thank all three of you Martha I want to thank you for your extraordinary work through the decades you've been a real hero I've visitors center I contribute and I want to thank you for what you have done for such a long period of time as well to raise this issue because we need to be conscious of it we need to confront it we need to deal with it and we need to deal with the expectations of one another to overcome any of the connections that say somehow because somebody's different they're not as good thank you Thank You mr. Hoyer of what we're going to do is to start the questioning and I'm going to ask to start off the questioning is congressman vecera congressman Conyers and I want to just repeat the leaders admonition about one minute each and then we will recognize people as they came to the to the hearing congressman pecera I'm sure thank you very much and to everyone who has attended this hearing not just our witnesses but those who have attended we say thank you very much for your presence here today as well with a minute there's not a whole lot you could ask but I will certainly say this the day that we can invite three white witnesses to have this conversation is a day that we will have made the progress that I think all of us want to see but I would ask you this if you could give us a brief answer what would you want to hear our brothers and sisters in the white community say that could help us make some progress because most of us believe that it'd be very difficult to legislate attitude while we can do things to protect individuals rights and freedoms attitude is something different and I think you've been talking about how to many people carry not just a gun but attitude to an incident and what could we ask what could we expect of some of those who continue to carry the attitude to say or do to try to change the circumstance that we face today I'm going to ask chairman Conyers to ask a quick question same time so that we then can have you thank you very much I was wondering here what you see as the connection or relationship between racial justice and the electorate you see we spend a lot of time getting people to be educated and motivated and participating in the electoral process and it seems to me that these two should be connected in some way and I'd like your idea on it thank you well thank you for those questions they're very important I I will really speak i think more to congressman Batiatus question cuz i want to say two things one it absolutely is possible to legislate attitudes it's because by legislating opportunity you change how the attitudes are developed so I think this chamber actually a current Congress notwithstanding to the different issue but the fact that what laws we pass matter dramatically in terms of how we understand each other whether we live together whether we go to school together what our schools look like what our job opportunities are you all make those decisions every day and they do impact attitudes so I want to thank you for your leadership in leading the charge on those things I mean I think the second thing though is what would I want to hear I one thing I just want to share because I so appreciate what you said congressman Hoyer after I had the incredible privilege of doing a lot of television after the verdict but as a result I had such an outpouring from emails tweets people saying I am white and I want you to know I'm now thinking about race differently I 11 doctor emailed me and said I actually realize now that I listened more to you because you're light-skinned then I listen to someone who is black who is dark-skinned I think that's an amazing thing right the recognition itself actually starts to open up the opportunity on attitudes so I have actually seen the one tragedy if there's this is a tragedy and a travesty but but one of the opportunities that is produced is for this discussion the discussion matters the fact that we've had this forum matters the more people we can get this information out to the more we will have more white people saying what I have heard from so many white Americans and so appreciate which is this isn't okay and thank you because I'm thinking differently about what's going on I would I would just say that's a that makes me feel good that you've got those messages because I got a few of those but frankly my email baskets a little different because I heard from a disturbing number of people who wrote and said you know why don't you write about the real Trayvon Martin and then sent that photograph of the rapper the game which is not the photograph of Trayvon Martin you know a 30 year old man with tattoos all over women and and you know looks like maybe if Trayvon Martin if he were you know twice his age and tattooed but he's not it's not clearly not the same person yet it's people who wanted to believe that wanted to believe that the 17 year old kid was this actually this dangerous looking 30 year old man and so I hope the people who brought you talk to the people who wrote me yeah I wish they would I just on congressman Conyers question about the political you know politics and and and racial justice I I've always believed with no empirical empirical data because I'm a journalist not a social scientist that the rise in in a sort of vicious kind of racism or tone of racism that I've been perceiving and I think others have perceived is is not unrelated to the economic uncertainty that so many Americans experience to the hollowing out of the middle class to the two you know what what has happened to the American Dream as we understood it and I think that situation creates anxieties that that tend to sometimes get expressed in racial animus in animus toward anyone who's different or anyone who seems to be a threat and let's be honest the inauguration of the first black president the first african-american president I think just brought this whole thing to a head for a lot of people and and in in some ways at least for some individuals increased this the same anxiety and that's that's all tied up in politics I can't really untie the knot but but it's there especially since if you were to look for a commonality of economic interests for example I think you see a lot there between some people who and the people they want to dislike I think the changing demographics of our country is at play here in several respects in 20-25 years so now we might not be meeting in this room talking about this subject because America will be majority of people today who minorities and that will change voting will change everything we're in a crew a kind of a crunch period I sue the Aryan Nations the white Aryan resistance the clan all these groups and I used to read their evidence that their material they print it I see their material and I used it against him in court to show they were likely to encourage of violent acts they did today I don't have to go to their hate groups I can just turn on some of the television and they've been some of their language is mainstreamed well we what I found out dealing with these hate groups it was the young people committing these hate crimes and the leaders promoted them and so we started a program about 25 years ago called teaching tolerance and acceptance today we have 80,000 schools who use our material and it goes to some in and we have some five hundred thousand teachers getting our magazine it's a major program we spend millions of dollars you're giving this material away to schools and if that's not it's not a simple one-step solution I think I want to put her finger on all the things that have to happen it's what we need a Democratic House and Senate working together to make happen in this country at the Law Center we concentrate on a lot of issues but one is education I told you the story about the Jena six well one of our lawyers adopted one of those young men from Jenna Louisiana and took him to New York and went to school in kinetic he had no chance in Jenna but he went to New York he went to a school in Connecticut and this she graduates from Hofstra University and he's working he's working at Southern Poverty Law Center this summer as an intern and to me he was a lost person a lost soul he would have been who knows what in Jenna Louisiana we can't pick up all the people from Jenna and Houma Louisiana and and Congressman Lewis I wish you'd have said if I meant I want to congratulate him he was one of the founding board members of southern part of lost element people know didn't know me from Adams house cat and Julian Bond came along with John and stood by us and God had started but he and I from the same county he's from Pike County I'm from naked or they're in Montgomery County and we both saw these things happen but look at him the opportunities he got to get out and make a name for himself and that education is is so critical it is so critical and is we in a at a period of time that I'm positive there's going to be some changes we've got so many issues to deal with mass incarceration we got a whole caste system predominantly black males in prisons we just got a judgment against the New Orleans New Orleans Parish Prison and the judge said it was the worst prison in the world he couldn't think of one a third world country any worse triple population drugs being used we have a video of a guy shooting up drugs and holding a handgun in the jail so all these issues come together they're the results of slavery Jim Crow the lack of interest in all these other things and it's not just in the South this happens New York City has a search policy that was more violence created in Boston trying to integrate the schools and it was in Birmingham Alabama so it's a nationwide issue of race in our country it's good we addressing it now and I hope that we don't have another Trayvon Martin happen any time soon thank you to keep the dialogue going and keeping with our one-minute ammunition we're going to go to three of our colleagues asked them do their one minute then turn to the panel again starting with congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee congressman butterfield and congresswoman barbara Lee first of all very quickly let me thank the leadership and out chairwoman Marcia fudge I think this is historic I just simply want to say we want to be understood black women black men black children want to be understood and we also want to be unrestrained when we talk about race we have media pounding us in the conservative radio so I know we want solutions and here's my question sometimes they criticize Congress or any legislator and saying you can't be a social engineer we are social engineer and Medicare and Medicaid we prioritize that poor people need health care what would be the response if we came together as a Congress and wrote an omnibus bill and I recognize black girls others need relief but an omnibus bill dealing with African American men and boys on the issues of Education on the issues of incarceration on the issues of health care and we literally debated it and had it legislate what with what would be the response would we be condemned if you will of here they go again an omnibus initiative passing legislation signed by the president congressman Butterfield let me thank the leader and and congresswoman fudge and the Congressional Black Caucus for bringing us together this afternoon for this very important conversation as most of my colleagues know in my other life I served as a trial judge down in North Carolina for 15 long years during those 15 years are probably presided over 2,000 more than 2,000 felony jury trials I probably sentenced ten to fifteen thousand offenders over the years and many of them if not most of them were african-american in charging defendants police have a tendency to overcharge and Mars you know that so the police have a strong tendency to overcharge individuals who have been accused of committing crimes and when these cases go to court typically there is a plea bargain and most of the charges are dismissed a one or two charges the defendant pleads to he goes to prison for a short period of time gets out and then tries to find a job the prospective employer then looks at the record not just the convictions but looks at the charges for which the defendant has been charged and then denies employment to the individual believing that this individual has been convicted of burglary and breaking and entering when perhaps the defendant only pleaded guilty to trespassing and that is a huge problem in in minority communities across the country and is there a congressional response I know there's a state response but states are unwilling to deal with this do you see a congressional response to expunging criminal records thank you judge and congressman of our believe thank you very much we also thank our leader and our chair of the Congressional Black Caucus for this really very important and timely hearing and also to all of our witnesses thank you so much for your powerful testimony to dr. wily it's so good to see you dr. Wiley my son went to school together and so we're so proud of you and thank you for staying the course thank you for staying the course you know as a mother and as a grandmother I just have to say black parents and Eugene you talked about this a little bit you know no matter how well you prepare our young especially black boys for life it will never be enough african americans live their lives full of anxiety and stress constantly as a result of this and this is not healthy when you look secondly at poverty rates in the african-american community twenty-eight percent yet of course statistically there more white people living in poverty than african-american the percentage of the higher unemployment thirteen point seven percent net worth fifty six hundred dollars in the african-american community public sector job cuts we lost six hundred thirty six thousand jobs since 2012 dismantling the Voting Rights Act affirmative action three strikes mandatory minimums suspensions and it's Paulson's the code the education court is so big any young black boy can get kicked out for looking the wrong way if the school system believes that this is a behavioral issue so let me just ask you if we go back and look at how we address many of these issues because this very comprehensive and complex institutional racism is very deep and it's very broad but going back to congresswoman a Jackson's question how do you think as members of Congress in addition to our conversations that we must have in fact faith and politics institute i want to mention is conducting congressional conversations on race around the country now but we have to act and so how do we do this without being accused and some of us don't really care if they accused us of playing the race card but race is a factor and if we don't talk about race in every policy and everything we do given our votes and given the policy decisions we make how do we really frame this in a way that we can move forward because only in doing so will our country become stronger we have to address race until our panelists will respond oh it should just to come in if you say the word race you are accused of playing the race card so you are automatic you are so accused you know it just happens and and you know if there's such a touchy pneus a knee-jerk reaction there so what would happen to an omnibus bill addressing the condition of black men and boys in this country which I happen to believe is it is a huge piece of unfinished business from the civil rights movement that is now getting worse rather than better and that could be addressed specifically but in this climate I don't see it happen do you see it see that happening it doesn't mean that we that that perhaps Congress shouldn't try but but I I think certainly the legislative vogue and also that just this my sense of what tends to be more possible these days are are more comprehensive kinds of pieces of legislation based on more on economics or on some other social indicators that seems I think easier just to sell frankly the big questions where to get the money and because what I have seen that works programs that i have seen work attack problems from all angles because you've got education you've got transportation you've got you've got to have employment prospects the psychology there's health there's all sorts of things that that that can be addressed and that's very expensive to do I did notice that US corporations have won hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in profits parked overseas and that there were and I heard tell there was some talk about finding you know some way to repay create some of that money and far be it from me just as a journalist but if someone were to maybe think of some sort of partial amnesty say that you know and in in exchange for a certain kind of investment of some of that money maybe that would be a source of funding IRA preciate the questions they're very important and I think there is so obviously it's a question of will is very different from the question of should we I think it's actually critically important that Congress even if even if it's a slugfest and it's a slugfest that is not one in a cycle Congress should slug because the only way we make progress is by I think the bully pulpit of our elected officials being willing to call the questions because even when the legislation doesn't get passed initially it starts a conversation and if you look I mean we work at the Center for social inclusion in Mississippi in Louisiana and Alabama in Michigan in California in Washington State and what I will tell you from sea to shining sea is there is more will out there than is being tapped in part because we need the leadership to tap it and so the more that Congress takes the leadership to say we don't care if we can't necessarily get it done in this like well we have to start trying and I would say what are we trying on then you know I think that's part of the question so let me say one thing is I think actually we do need a set and we need a couple of things we need data collection and transparency right right now one of the biggest ideological fights that's happening is whether and to what extent race matters and i will tell you running a research shop we don't have enough data we can see the anecdotal impacts and very little accountability because we can't quantify it and if you're by the way this is true no matter your racial group and it's extremely important for Native American populations for Latino populations it's important for all of us and I think that's the other point if we start thinking about how targeting of resources and by the way i would say targeting of resources in a way that recognizes race is not to be exclusive of people who are white so i would not say that taking race into account means Apalachee should not get additional resources i think Appalachia is deeply excluded and we shouldn't pit ourselves again whether it's Detroit or Kentucky right that we say we should target resources to where we find the greatest disinvestment and the greatest need and what we will then do which we do not currently I can tell you with broadband spending out of stimulus that essentially what happens is communities of color get bypassed in race neutral policy that has no intention of being unfair because it's not structured in a way to be fair so I would say we have to take these issues on Congress should fight it will help the rest of us particularly folks who are fighting down on the ground to increase and improve the conversations and just one thing I would add because to mr. Robinson's I think important point I've gotten the hate emails to and their shocking I mean in their flat out old-school race just one guy even calls himself whitey and his tweet tag is white power so it's ugly but but I think the point is a lot of that's organized a lot of that hate is organized hate and so it while it is frontal it I do not believe for a second it's the majority because I talked to way too many people so i actually think there's a lot of opportunity to push forward and to push forward aggressively and we should link across race to do it to say we should pay attention to race and need collectively for move on mr. Dees could you address judge Butterfield's passion about the expungement in the sentencing it's about expunging expunging criminal think clearly when a person goes to prison and serves their time nobody just then discharge it still on the record it clearly should be expunged that person should be allowed to vote to Spade just like the rest of us in society that that's as clear as clear gets and it could be done in federal elections and if it's done in federal elections will happen to have it will happen in state election which denies a lot of things in ex-felon is a very difficult i'm trying to help a person now in that situation i mean let me make come in on your idea about global solutions here the civil rights movement in many ways some might say is over in backpack when we looked at the understand with you shaking your head but i'm gonna bring it clear here when you look at the back of the bus in montgomery when it was black it was clear what the problem was Alabama state troopers is all white we solve those problems now buses come south by the hundreds bringing people to see the sights they bring them to Montgomery Birmingham Memphis all these places to Selma bridge to see these sites and and I always tell them to look into the waters of the Civil Rights Memorial Center that model in bill for us and you've been there look at this look at what you see you see your face you see a reflection and the burden is on you the civil rights the march for justice continues it's important to reframe this issue though in a way that it doesn't hark back to people thinking well we've been and done that I don't think anybody thought that a hate crime bill would be named after Matthew Shepard NJ bird at the time he was killed a gay man killed beaten up I don't think that it's going to be beyond expectation to hear a bill named for Trayvon Martin whether it's an anti profiling act or whatever it might be give forgive us for five or six years and this thing will build in such a way that it'll happen there are a lot of that a lot of there are no simple solution to this but I remember when they and I when I was in the back of my daddy's pickup truck and coming from the cotton field to get a cold drink at the store we got a bottle of whatever after we drink it I threw it at the first stop sign i could see along Highway see if I could hit it if I roll the window down now and we're going to put the throttle piece of trash out on the highway my grandson will grab my hand and break it off even no way I'm going to do that how do we saw that we cleaned up America you remember that the Indian is stood by the road and a pop can roll up against his foot somebody threw out the winning that tear came down his eyes we spent millions cleaning up the byways of America patrasche I think if we had a race to the top like we do with education and focused on this whole issue of inclusiveness making American inclusive community then we can clean up the byways of racism along these way too just like we did it's not simple it's like dripping water on a rock and it's frustrating but in this and things like Trayvon Martin you know it is a fun assault on the justice system in so many ways I don't mean a positive one you guys got a big job in your hands and you women on this committee and I appreciate being here today we have open at the Poverty Law Center to help you in any way you we can thank you i'm going to just add to the rules of the game here i'm going to go with four members at a time we've got lots of questions and we also have the time constraints so of Eddie Bernice Johnson Eleanor Holmes Norton representative Ellison and a representative Donna Christensen so thank you very much let me guess leadership as well as to you who have come I have known of mr. D's for years and communicated from the great state of Texas and this Robert I see you all the time and and want to thank you for speaking out and doing what you do there's so many questions in my mind that I really don't know where to start I was sitting here thinking that when you come to a place like this there's so much on your plate that you have to decide how you can concentrate on something to get something done my major concentration has been on looking at research innovation in education and as I look over the picture it is very clear that that is one of the outlets for the future but it's getting more difficult in a sense to get there because we have the burden of student loans if students can struggle through a bachelor's degree they can't go to graduate school because the loan is too big to go on and yet we're saying that a bachelor's degree today is like a high school education yesterday we need more physicians we're going to have the Affordable Health Care Act we need more professors we need more role models for young people coming along and you come to a place like this and think you can find the answer but it's very very difficult you you know what you like to do but without the cry of the public it's very difficult to achieve I can appreciate the voices there I can appreciate the fact that we struggle here but what the public sees is not really the struggle in certain out the results the message that is going out the last five years too young black men is don't try it it's only going to be one don't try it as long as that is the attitude then what do we say to young black men what I have one son who has three sons and two of my grandsons are out of college and one is starting college and they look at me sometimes and say granny why do you work so hard because they really don't see much results of all that I talked about and all that I try to do so I think that one of the things we have to do is continue to involve the public to engage more people in understanding what it means now because it seems to me that the powers to be learned what it means to vote so they don't want us to vote and so we get all of the negative coming from that no matter what positive we reached for there's a stumbling block put there and so when we talk about the civil rights movement i think it's just beginning it seems to me that we've made strides but we've made strides to the point when somebody else notice we were making them and now we got to stop them and so I'm asking what do we do about the the organized designed racism is there anything we can do you know you can go to certain networks and it's all you hear Eddie I love you to death thank you for we gotta get you we got the question in ok Eleanor I want to thank our leadership for for this extraordinary opportunity to openly discuss this question and for all the insights and they were insights that you provided let me just say in a few minutes president had his own conversation after Trayvon Martin killing and he rather much disparage it from official forms saying that in the real sense people had to do it with where they are frankly I think at least in the african-american community here more you here let's talk about it while I do something about it so I'm not sure a talk is where people are today they talked when we went for the civil rights laws we got the civil rights law there was some progress now we're seeing something in a different order that does not lend itself to wars and and people are are wondering whether or not we can be effective in producing anything practical and I'm not so sure about race-based legislation only because I practice constitutional lawyer but because i think they are you know some rights laws weren't race-based you know a white person can bring a civil rights case it didn't have to be in order to get it passed so why worked at up in order to have to all do that ah i see problems with boys period i think there are ways to get at what's happening the black boys have you read the literature about how parents are worried about their white boys i think you could you could in fact pass legislation affecting males and what has happened to them and this society one has to think deeply about these questions so that we can do something effective about it let me just the parades to circumstances when crack cocaine was raised raised we did something about it and it was race it was race-based yeah it applied to everybody but its effects were so so clearly we're so clearly on blacks on Hispanics people of color that there has been some movement on let me just suggest with all of the energy in the air about Trayvon Martin it has got to be there a child shot down by a man who went unpunished I don't see how if at the end this time next year there's not been a an effective movement no matter what where it gets to do something about these standing your ground laws I'm not sure there's any legacy for Trayvon Martin I don't know what the Civil what the the Justice Department can do but I know this Trayvon Martin has a brother a good-looking young black man who is a perfect role model for black men out there I know that his parents are still in florida I know that the jury instructions mr. Robinson he may have waived you know he may have wave stand your ground the jury instructions had stand your ground because they had to have stand your ground because that is the law I don't know why we shouldn't start with with Florida to get rid of these Stand Your Ground laws which are a clear and present danger to every black man who's walking in the streets today it is a it is it is a practical undertaking just as crack cocaine was a practical undecayed taking and because we would not let it go we had some effect if we keep talking about race and do not do something about it even black people and I don't want to hear it Thank You Eleanor have keith Ellison and Donna Christensen my question my question first of all thank you all so much but my question is is this how do we reach out to people who have racially resistant attitudes I mean just to just as much elaboration I mean everybody around this table loves to work out in a bipartisan way and we all try to we do we really do and yet it just seems like this there's so much resistance built up and for every good argument you make is just dismissed or even laughed at sometimes how do we talk to folks who are who are just racially resistant Thank You paneling leadership I just to say 2 dr.wily you'll be glad to know that the CBC has been on legislation that targets programs and funding to hard-hit communities for a couple of years and we're not giving up and my first question I think you've answered about how do we change implicit racism and I think some of the responses have also responded to that but I'm just concerned how do we get to that workplace and and the schools when our education system is where it is in so many of our communities I want to read a quote from an article by Professor vanilla Randall the quote is really attributed to a professor Mary Douglas and heavy respond when individuals disagree on elementary justice their most insoluble conflict is between institutions the more severe the conflict the more useful to understand the institutions that are doing most of the thinking exhortation will not help passing laws against discrimination will not help only changing institutions can help we should address them not individuals and address them continuously not only in crises and I think our opportunity is really to change those institutions so those are my questions thank you and I want to say a couple quick things one I used to live in South Africa I spent two years they're doing criminal justice reform and one of the things that's clear is numerical diversity does not create justice so I think it is important to know that just because we have a changing demographic I agree that it's creating a lot of insecurities particularly given the economic situation that alone will not produce a more just society what we have to act into it the other thing I want to just say quickly on we talked about the importance of expungement one quick point is that there's a study that shows that black people with no criminal record and a bachelor's degree actually get fewer jobs than white people with criminal degrees I'm with the with a criminal record that's not to say that why people with criminal from record do not need expungement because they do but I just want to note that this isn't all about this is this is part of the implicit bias the other thing I just want to notice is the Sentencing Project has actually demonstrated in a recent report that the increase in incarceration weights are actually women so I think it actually is critically important to understand and black women and latinas in particular so it is important to understand how we are all positioned black men are gendered as women are but in different ways but to just to speak to the the questions how do we talk we have to start with our shared needs we all need to see a doctor when we're sick it feels the same to lose your home to foreclosure it right we're starting with an emotional connection about how because we are all living at a time as scarcity people who are white in this country are not okay and I think it's really important that we acknowledge that and that we say we need to fix that and when we do what we have seen is that it opens people up to a willingness to say oh you seem like a reasonable person you're acknowledging my pain you recognize it's about all of us to then say yeah and let's talk about how we're also some of our boats have a few more holes in them right we don't so when we fix the problems we have we have to look at how they need to be fixed across our differences and it should help us all right so I just want to share that because I think that's not the way we are currently talking and I am NOT suggesting that given the current state of redistricting which is really the reality I think that Congress is facing right now is that we have congressional districts that do not reflect the country and that's part of the problem and it's a structural one but the reason I gives me hope is because that means that we can still have conversations about what needs to shift even though there's some gridlock in Congress because we've frankly locked in some districts that don't reflect the way America looks right they're not as diverse as the nation and therefore the conversations we have don't cross the racial lines in the way we need to and your leadership can do that um if I could just speak briefly to congressman Holmes Norton some excellent points I agree that talk isn't isn't what people are necessarily looking ivy people are looking for accident I think that's a that's a very good point that people are looking for action results and and and so make it specific and and and maybe the specifics of stain your ground law so but to your point about black boys or or program for all boys here's so here's the difference and here's here's why I'm there's a kind of a problem there just a brief story I've two sons one both of them grew up in suburbs one who's now 30 when he was in high school he has a deep voice like mine and so I answer the phone one day and it's one of his friends of a white kid who thinks it's my son Aaron and so I pick up the phone say hello and he's like yo was a dull blade a bit of it everything sounds like he's straight out of Compton you know or and I said oh this is mr. Robinson he says oh hello mr. Robinson you know like Eddie Haskell 10 leave it to beaver show you know he's like all of a sudden he's just and um and it struck me and I so I had one of these periodic conversations with Aaron and his brother that I but i have about how society understands that when your friend Rick talks like that it's a pose and it's a phase or it's at this or it's a costume that he wears when he when his jeans are slouched in and this and that and that at some point it'll take off the costume and move out of the face and go off and be a lawyer or something like that and society doesn't necessarily assume that about you uh you know you can you can do all those things and you can you can take that but but people are not going to necessarily assume that it's just a disguise it's just a your pose are like your friend Rick which is at what he was right i mean this is you know these are kids who were the softest off could be but but there are a lot of situations in which that's not the assumption that would be made and and so will your question congressman tell some what do you what do you say to but young black men to black boys and you say you know what i said was this is not fair but this is the way it is and and we can complain about it and you know and i'll share your pain and i'll tell you my stories and you tell me your stories but we're good we got to move past it okay and we're going to help you any way I can but but no it's not fair but yes it is the way it is congressman ellison i'll try to try to answer your question how do you how do you reach out to a person with racist attitudes that's all that was most my kinfolks bang alabama and you know that the black people that i picked cotton with in the cotton fields my daddy was a tenant farmer we didn't own any land they had to leave I've been practiced all 52 years I'm 77 this year so you can know the time frame they had to leave and go north for jobs and when they came home they told me I think I like the southern people who are overtly racist versus the northern people in implicit boss and you know I think I find the person with the implicit bias probably harder to convince because like you say they don't even feel their races on the other hand over traces to me you're the easiest people to talk to because i found that because i simply you know we got these shared interests and once i start talking to them and they'll listen and you know it they can they got only one way to go and that's to change these people in implicit bias you got to educate them on what they're even thinking about but we haven't won a single lawsuit against eight groups in this country that I didn't have some of the members of the hate group testifying for us actually you know started out as a I guess you know doing a little Southern Baptist preaching when I was 16 years old and I'll call myself bring them to the foot of the cross you know I mean I'm best show them that the ways are wrong in all these cases I've been able to get these young people to see that they're wrong something happened last week probably hadn't gotten to y'all's attention but the largest pate pate bulletin board posting thing in the marriage called storm front storm front is 250,000 registered users run by Don black who's married to David dukes widow and Don black son born into that and he's twenty three or four years old now he had a radio show unbelievable racist he sent us a about a four page email to the Southern Poverty Law Center last week renouncing his racism and saying he apologized to all the people in gays and everybody else's it here put down so I think there's great opportunities to find people like this young man and people who make changes to be it to be a spokesperson to convert some of these races we're now going to be able to move to our final four questioners of the afternoon we appreciate the patience of the panel and our colleagues congressman ted deutsch constant Gregory Meeks congresswoman jan Schakowsky and miss Wilson is no longer with us mix oats that'll be three thanks thanks to the leader and and steering and Policy Committee and CBC for hosting this I am I just there there are so many issues that you raised it that I'd like to talk about but there's Marcy you talked about you talked about how the the March for justice continues and and my you you talked about and I love this the need to find non-competitive community activity but we don't we don't have we struggle enough finding community activities at all so too how do we how do we both brought that to include to be more inclusive but beyond that with all of the and everything you laid out Eugene and that you write about and I mean just today all the discussion about about drug laws of incarceration rates and adequate representation and profiling and everything else how do we make that march for justice relevant for people and in particular how do we make it relevant for all of the young people for whom marriage equality has become has become so it's self-evident to them that this is an issue that everybody should grasp that this why why is this controversial how do we how do we make the struggle for civil rights and the the fact that that's not over and this march for justice continues how do we help them see that thanks anyway Thank You Ted representative egg in here go ahead on sir excuse me we're actually going to have the questions first then go the answers if we could thank you mr. race is so deep that we've got to for example I get nervous sometimes because when we talk with issues that we talking about here everyone having a right to education everyone having equal opportunity set those are all things that we need to do institute stop the institutional racism but one of the things that I'm afraid of and talking to a young black boy that I was just with today was thinking that they needed to do those things so they could be accepted where it looks like you're trying to make them do something so they can be accepted by somebody that's just the right thing to do and when you have an individual's everybody in this room I know when I go on Fox television talk about racism the response that i get for my office gets from the telephone and the kind of hate mail that I get just from basically going on television show that you know that's the kind of racism that I think that we're talking about where even a member of Congress feels comfortable telling the president the United States you lie I don't think that would have happened if there was another president other than Barack Obama so that's the D kind of institutional and so my question is just this when we our job is to try to fix that but when you have the Supreme Court saying that diversity and then reversing a lot of the diversity rules that it does makes one see that well can we do we're trying to get there too so with the laws that are being passed well the rulings of the Supreme Court is making in regards to reversing some of the gains that were made just a short while ago what is done in that regard and where we got to go for example in New York with stop and frisk loss all right congresswoman jan Schakowsky is our final question will go the panel thank you morris dees I think I get mail from you about every other week oh it's a pleasure to meet you in in person and what a wonderful panel thank you to our leaders I want to mention two women with the last name Alexander one is Marissa Alexander who as far as I know she's still sitting in jail in Florida having shot a warning shot no one hurt into the ceiling because her abusive husband was threatening her and and stay on your ground did not apply to this African American woman and with her threat by the African American husband I it I it just drives me crazy I think there needs to be something done about that so that's really one question about what to do but the michelle alexander and the new Jim Crow I'm sure you talked about I'm sorry I was like but this the war on drugs has is a complete failure in every sense I mean there's more drugs in the white suburbs in my district there's a new heroine wave and and and this is all all white and and and the problem it seems to me and seems to her is that once you get that felon label this is a life long sentence you can't you mentioned mores voting but it's not just voting its public housing it's all kinds of benefits you are marginalized for life and the prisons are full so I mean I it seems to me that we have not concentrated enough on that intentional or not she calls it the new Jim Crow even if there isn't intent the effect is so clear and we really haven't dealt with thank you yes and Carson Thank You Jan for that we'll have our panel respond please I'm just gonna see to mr. D's because he has a plane to catch so no that's okay I don't worry about that by march till tomorrow bye this is honor to be up here we're happy that you didn't was the debt to you so thank you so much and I'm so pleased that you raised Marissa Alexander because actually there are people starting to organize around her case but and I think to your point orgonite and others points organizing against stand your ground laws because thirty-four percent of whites who shoot someone who is not white are exonerated by stand your ground three percent of people who are black are exonerated under stand your ground so that's obviously another example of the way the system is not functioning in a fair way even if someone's not thinking that they're doing at or treating Marissa Alexander unfairly right so what do we do about it again I think I'm going to fit the point about activities first of all and I don't know everyone's district but actually leadership can bring together people in activities that are non-competitive and to have a conversation about the policy solutions that will support more of it so I think that is something that is important to do I will go back to my statements about continuing to fight for both the laws that make it unfair to behave this way let me just say one thing about the US Department of Justice said that would be very difficult to bring a hate crimes suit against George Zimmerman because he did not hurl a racial epithet and what we know from the social sciences you don't have to there are there several other kinds of indicators as to whether or not there was hate involved but the law does not reflect that social science as lawmakers one of the things you can do is press that those evidentiary standards in law right need to be changed to catch up to two decades of established social science I'll stop there thank you very much others on the panel I would just first of all that was that's fascinating I think um on the question of what what can be done um given the climate given your email in my email add x is available and and Lord knows Morrison Sigma over over the course of since before there was email and and given the current political climate and I would just note that you know those who control state houses and governorships get to draw congressional districts every ten years and also get to write state laws or unwrite state laws and and I you know it's it's harder it's more diffuse but I think both parties will be focused a lot on on those state contests and and maybe not enough attention has been paid to them but that's going to be crucial you know we're the congressional districts are what they are and are going to be what they are or were probably not a lot better until there's another census Thank You mr. Ross mr. Dees you want to wrap up for us real quick I just say we got to elect the Democratic Congress House and Senate well said Emma cratic president and that's going to be the solution to this problem and that's well you couldn't improve on it before we close I think we want to ask a chair of the CBC to give us some concluding comments for yours I want to say thank you for to our witnesses I want to say thank you to all who participated and especially thank you to the leader in to the chairs thank you very much chairman because my daughter does have a plane to catch I will be brief Christine I want to add a joint at the distinguished chair that congressional black caucus and acknowledging the excellence of the presentations you made today but more important to that how you have led on these important issues and they are central to our forming a more perfect union so we look forward to continuing our work with you on on these important issues to our country Marcie's thank you you're an icon in this country and we salute your leadership Maya just dazzling in terms of your TV and the rest and Eugene of course thank you for all that you do now I'll compare my emails with anybody because but let me acknowledge how quickly our the leadership of our Syrian policy committee chairman Rob Andrews to ensure woman rosa DeLauro brought us together today with such excellent testimony with so many of our members Thank you Thank You styrian policy thank you we did want to acknowledge Doug Tanner's presence and thanks for what the faith in politics tannic

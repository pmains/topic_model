thank you very much for speaking thank the gentleman for giving me the time while today's vote to provide relief to families who are suffering due to circumstances far beyond their control is welcome it is long overdue and insufficient to fully meet their needs democrats put forth our priorities last may to bring relief to those who are sick unemployed homeless and hungry republicans there choose to ignore and obfuscate the widespread suffering this short term package will provide direct payments and unemployment benefits extension and some assistance to help families afford rent food water and broadband i applaud our speaker for negotiating these critical provisions and of my colleagues who came together in a bipartisan way to drive this compromise but this package must be viewed only as a down payment most of us can hardly wait to begin the new year with renewed hope our resolve has become 2021 with the new congress and the new administration is to provide the leadership and support americans need and deserve to get us beyond this pandemic there can be no greater pursuit in 2021. i'll you back the balance of my time

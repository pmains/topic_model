alright let's talk about coronavirus the big cause for concern right now is is the leadership good one quick point on that and then I want to finish on testing and what you know about us getting better with the testing because this second case in California is again two cases so what it's community spread there's no reason for panic but testing is again a factor don't you think there should be focus on both sides of Congress and the White House allows States to test who are competent to do it get more testing out there to give people more confidence in the reality the answer is yes and I have seen publications come out as recently as a few hours ago from groups like Bain Capital who have said there could be 10,000 people with it right now and we won't know about it for another few weeks so absolutely I agree there should be more testing you and I may have it and not even know it God fell but what I'm saying is that's the CDC and they're saying right they're being kept very tight by the White House in terms of what the criteria and protocols are why let people test I think you well I think you'll see in this next week to come there's already talk in Congress about passing a supplemental appropriations bill that's going to send more money and more resources I think 7 days from now if you and I have the White House could do it today Lance they could call and say to California and New York hey you guys have your own protocols go ahead and test my point is I think that's happening I thought every day is something new I think this is happening though and I think that you're seeing the White House do a pretty good job considering this is all new territory this is very scary but I'm pleased with the effort so far and I think we all need to be pulling together and fighting this together not playing politics I agree with you on that and I'm telling you the testing is key I know people think that if there are more cases politically that looks bad I'm telling you it won't work like that because you'll see people getting better and I'd rather know about 8,000 cases in California that aren't being monitored that are actually active cases and then see how many people go home in a week right and days people would be better for that the White House can change it with a phone call hopefully it happens Lance good I appreciate you taking on the tough questions as always have a good weekend stay healthy you too take care of thank you

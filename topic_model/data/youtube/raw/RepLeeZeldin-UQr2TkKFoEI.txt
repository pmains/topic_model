well Thank You mr. chairman I rise in support of HR 43:24 which I co-sponsored the strengthening oversight of Iran's access to finance Act introduced by Congressman Roger Williams I stand with the courage of my convictions while I listen to others stand with the courage apparently of a conviction to coddle the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism I have a problem and I'm not going to apologize for my colleagues aren't going to apologize for it when we have an adversary of our nation overthrowing foreign governments financing terror developing intercontinental ballistic missiles and violations of UN Security Council resolutions calling Israel the little Satan America the Great Satan pledging to wipe Israel off the map chanting death to America just a few weeks ago the CIA dropped 470 thousand documents collected in May of 2011 in the raid of Osama bin Laden's compound in those documents it shows of a strong relationship between Iran and al-qaeda in Iran offering finance and arms for carrying out attacks against America I signed up to run for the United States Congress and take an oath to protect this country and right now while we're here this holiday season tonight is the second night of Hanukkah we're about to have Christmas New Year's we have people who are overseas sometimes on our 8th 9th 10th deployment willing to risk everything in defense of our freedoms and liberties putting themselves in harm's way so when 10 Navy sailors end up getting held hostage and embarrassed with photography and videography being shamed by the Iranians and then we say is a matter of response thank you that was our response when they released our 10 detained Navy sailors and you ought to question the conviction of congressman Williams introducing legislation that is incredibly important for protecting the United States and our servicemembers and our allies and you want to mock us for having a problem with them chanting death to America whose side are you on for anyone who has the courage of conviction to coddle the world's largest state sponsor of terror since the u.s. entered the jcpoa iran's state-owned airline iran air has used this access in the u.s. aviation industry to purchase planes that have aided the Assad regime and carrying out its war crimes in Syria against its own citizens innocent women and children courage of convictions to stand with the United States with our allies and on behalf of women and children being targeted by the Assad regime in Syria we have a problem with that we want to do something about it and don't try to shame us into being apologetic and unwilling and afraid to stand up for all of those rights principles that's the courage and conviction that I stand up with today with congressman Williams with chairman Hensarling and all the others who are encouraging a strong yes vote for more accountability for a stronger national defense for a better future I yield back

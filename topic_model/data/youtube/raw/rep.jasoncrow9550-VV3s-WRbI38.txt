in colorado jason crowe here uh thank you so much for joining us in the next installment of our virtual job series and webinars to help the community navigate the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic about the health challenges and the economic challenges as many of you might recall last year we held the first ever congressional district 6 cd6 job fair we had over a thousand job seekers connect with over 60 employers from throughout the community and we helped connect dozens of people into new jobs to help take their career to the next level we were planning on doing that again this year but unfortunately the pandemic does not allow us to have everyone come together under one group to do that so we wanted to think of a new way to provide this service and to help people address the crisis uh when we need it more than ever when we're seeing unprecedented levels of unemployment and health issues throughout the community so we came up with the idea of doing this virtual series uh that does a number of things we've had uh seminars on resume skills interviewing skills uh looking at new jobs making the transition the new jobs and a number of things for both businesses and employers we have a special guest who's going to talk to us tonight about uh how to safely reopen businesses but before we do that i want to give you a very quick update i'm in washington this evening and we're working really hard to try to negotiate with the senate and extension unemployment benefits uh more money for stimulus for local communities for our schools and for testing the development of a coronavirus vaccine and treatment this is critical we are in a severe crisis both health and economic and we can't short shift this we have to make sure that we're addressing this with the urgency in the boldness that it deserves at this time and we're working hard to try to deliver for the american people and for the people of colorado so with no further ado i'm really excited that melissa sager with tri county health department is joining us this evening to talk about a really important topic and that is how to safely reopen your businesses uh during this health crisis and what are the considerations and the things that you should be thinking about because one thing we know is true and that is you cannot separate the health crisis from the economic crisis some people want to talk about you know how do we just deliver aid for businesses how do we just deal with the health thing the the two issues are late because so long as people don't feel comfortable going back to work as long as people don't feel comfortable going to restaurants going to businesses and shopping uh if they do not have that confidence and if people are not healthy then their economy cannot be healthy so how do we do both at the same time a really important topic uh melissa sager with tri county health is here with us tonight to talk about it so melissa thank you for joining us and i'll toss it over to you yeah thanks so much congressman we're happy to be here and uh honestly it really is exactly what you just said uh working with businesses to open safely we know it's great for businesses and it's great for health and we've had some really fantastic success so with that i'll jump right into the presentation thanks so much for having me um i'm gonna start with just a little bit of background on how uh the system kind of works behind the scenes just so folks have an idea um because it gets a little confusing when you uh have the governor uh saying some things and the state health department and then you have your local health department that's me and then you have your locally elected officials and your congressional representatives and so it gets a little bit confusing but what we've seen very generally is that uh we have the governor issuing an executive order and his executive order directs the state health department to issue a public health order and the public health order usually has all the details so the governor's executive order will have the general outline of the requirements we need a safer at home order and it needs to do this this and this and then we get the state health department order and that has all the details um for all the requirements um from everything to cleaning into how many employees you can have how many customers you can have in your business all those details are generally um included in the public health order and that comes from the state your local public health agency can also issue public health orders that are more restrictive than the state so we can't issue anything less restrictive so when you're talking about businesses your local health department tri county health cannot say we're going to allow these businesses to open even though the statewide order says it's not okay so but we can do things more restrictive uh recently you may have heard about our masking order so the tri-county health department issued a local masking requirement and then the state just a few days later issued a masking requirement for the whole state so tri-county aligned our language with the states so the requirements are the same but we left an additional requirement in for outdoor activity where six feet can't be maintained so it's a little bit stricter and just builds on the state order so these things generally change at the state level and the your local health department tri county is uh coordinating between the state and our communities uh whether it be with our elected officials or our businesses themselves and we do that in a variety of ways and through a variety of channels i'd encourage you to check out your county government's page we do a lot of town halls right after this webinar i'll be jumping on in arapahoe county town hall so i'd encourage you to jump on that lots of good information from a lot of different experts uh we do these webinars with all of you here uh we do uh daily i mean weekly webinars through our business reopening task force where we provide uh technical assistance to businesses as they reopen and i'll provide a little bit more information on that in just a bit um but that's the general structure so lots of things coming from the state locals can do a stricter requirements but not more lenient and we really serve as an in-between for these requirements from the state and then really enforcement that happens at a local level so we are tasked as the enforcers of the statewide public health order so that's generally why you hear from us but the requirements are coming from the state so i'm going to do a little bit uh i am going to share my screen here just to do a little navigation with you because rather than um walking you through everything without any kind of visuals here um i'll be able to show you uh what i'm talking about so this is the colorado department of public health and environments uh website their home page is covid19.colorado.gov it looks just like this and it's a really fantastic resource for both employers and employees to check out because all the updates are here all of the requirements if you click around you can find a lot of great information templates and i'm going to walk you through a little bit of that right here um so this is the main page as i mentioned if you scroll just a little bit to the bottom you'll see regular updates here so this is the most recent information that's come out from the state health department again your local government is following this um guidance for schools just came out um and the mandatory mass order was the most recent um information here so both all of these things are relevant but i want to touch on some of the guidance for businesses just where you can expect to see changes how you can follow along um and stay informed um and not only through these channels like this but just regularly on your day-to-day being able to access this information i'm just empowering all of you with that um so from the main page we have um safer at home and in the vast great outdoors this is the phase of reopening that we're in um the next phase is protect our neighbors and i'll show you that um at the end but uh just walking through these are gonna be your current requirements um and i'm gonna touch on best practices for all businesses first um just walking through some of these general requirements so this is for essential and non-essential businesses so for it's for those businesses that have been open all along it's for newly opening businesses um and it's pretty detailed here what we're looking for um but at the same time it builds in flexibility so you'll see um we're looking for you to uh deputize a workplace coordinator and so as an employer or an employee you want to know that someone um one shift there is in charge so should something happen in the workplace and just someone who can handle those situations and coordinate and so um there are some lots of great guidance documents and training documents for employees and employers to use um and so we we try to make it less difficult um but your local health department is available for guidance along the way so as you access these resources as you hear something online a live video stream from governor polis somebody's tweeted something uh you've heard that this business is allowed to do it and why can't you these are all questions that we're happy to chat through with you uh through our business reopening task force i'll just mention that email address really quickly it's covid business recovery at tchd.org we have staff dedicated to answering all kinds of questions really with a goal of accommodating unique situations business practices employees we know that a public health order couldn't possibly encompass all of the requirements and touch on all of the businesses and unique activities or unique employees in those settings and so we're here to bridge that gap between the information we're getting from the state and then practically implementing it again whether you're an employer or an employee here to support you so deputizing coordinator really having someone available um to answer those questions that come up and deal with anything urgent a call from the health department an employee got sick i'm just someone in charge of those issues uh six foot distancing a lot of this is going to be what you've heard already staying six feet apart it's the same in the workplace um posting signage um and i'll just posting signage here it's it's even more than this um really communicating um as an employee um you want to know uh what is expected of you on a regular basis uh what are the standards um they're all different and changing frequently and so you want to be able to feel like you're doing things properly and safely and really there's some onus on the employers here to provide some of that guidance and so really encouraging employers to reach out so that we can help you find those materials that you need help to train your staff make sure you're on the same page and really regularly um we're available monday through friday 8 a.m to 5 p.m we have folks on call so we're here all the time to answer these questions and really walk folks through uh what's required um avoiding gatherings of 10 or more keeping things small you know you have an all-staff meeting you don't all need to be in the break room at one time can you transition those virtually can you do them on the computer before work um keeping people apart sometimes it really doesn't feel intuitive to what we're used to when you're in the work setting having an all staff meeting when you know you're going to be there in the building but this is really what we're looking for here whether you're in retail or an office space or manufacturing we don't want people all in the same room at one time it really creates issues and risk of spread and so some of it really is um different than what we're used to may not feel as comfortable um but really keeps folks safe so uh taking that extra step to even suggest an innovative approach take it outside whenever you can all different kinds of things that you can do to just decrease that risk of spreading your setting symptom monitoring is a requirement for all businesses so um just for employees knowing that your employer is required to symptom screen you before you come to work um in person and employers resources here for you to set that up so um you'll see throughout when i click on a few more of these things um there's lots of links so this is additional guidance specifically for symptom screening and when you open it up it links you to all all the guidance of video on symptom screening um what equipment personnel set up um explains all the requirements template documents here um for what uh symptom screening um should look like i'm just going to open this up really quickly for you all um because it is really um it is really trying to make it easy on folks um and we know things are changing um we know things are complicated it's not as straightforward um but um we try to put these supports here and then filling the gaps with technical assistance along the way um from your local public health agency um symptom monitoring uh eliminating regularly touched surfaces any common areas where folks would gather anything that people touch regularly you want to increase those sanitation processes that you stand that you would use um regularly do more the bathrooms even closing off areas where you can so if an open seating area in a lobby or your waiting area in a restaurant those aren't necessary keeping folks outside when you can and closing those areas off we're really looking for folks to operate by appointment only to the greatest extent possible so you're not getting unexpected people in your building that would need a waiting area uh the folks visiting your restaurant or office have an appointment to be there looking for very controlled movement and comings and goings um both to prevent contact as folks are coming and going um but also to enable contact tracing should there be an issue so we want to be able to reach out to you and you know exactly who was in your building uh for restaurants looking for a sign in uh for customers as an option for contact tracing we know not everyone wants to share that information but whenever we can reach people quickly should there be an outbreak giving folks an option to do that um providing appropriate protective gear we uh work with businesses to figure out channels to obtain this we know um masks maybe in short supply or hand sanitizer although we're seeing these come back um helping um you navigate how to obtain those um reassuring you when they're not in stock that it's not you they're not they're not available right now and oftentimes we're facing the same issues in our office spaces but just being a sounding board for those issues talking through how to open how to stay safe while you reopen resources for employees and i'll touch on that in just a second for employees uh a big protection here we want folks to stay home when they're sick and so uh they're required to provide um paid leave uh for folks who are sick for short durations both federally and at the state level now um and so we're looking for employers to provide that uh leave when folks need to stay home we don't want any incentive uh for folks coming to work uh sick and so anything we can do um to uh reassure people that it is um good for them to stay home and assure um employees that they have that ability with no repercussions um in addition to these required paid leave and i'm happy i'll provide my contact information at the end and i'm happy to provide more if you have questions um we're looking for uh flexible work policies so if your employees can work from home if you as an employee can do your duties uh from whom we want um everyone who can work from home to be doing that still while we're seeing increased openings we are still looking for folks to minimize that movement to the greatest extent possible so i'm in my home right now um working from home and just doing that whenever possible so um if if you as an employee have some concerns we are happy to provide resources to your employer about what that looks like what some of the requirements are for reasonable accommodations on what kind of flexible work policies could be put in place and there's a lot of new guidance out for this um so if you or your employee have you or your employer have questions about that we're happy to chat through and i said these encourage remote work minimize in-person meetings um so a lot of these things um are are basic and haven't changed at all since the beginning you'll notice that these are just some of the basics cleaning a lot staying apart that's where those flexible leave policies come in work from home um you know it's it's not how we usually operate but this is the requirement for everyone even as a government agency the the local public health agency we're still working from home to the greatest extent possible and really encouraging all employers to do that we do know that some industries cannot work from home and so that's really where we get into some of this uh additional guidance for the workspace so safer at home and in the vast great outdoors guidance for businesses and i'm to go down here to resources and you'll see that i'm skipping a bunch of these we did talk about how to screen for symptoms so i did click on that i'm going to go back to employees and customer safety but i'm going to touch on resources now there's a lot more here that i couldn't possibly cover um in this time but um i really encourage you to check out the website um for some really interesting uh resources i'm gonna touch on a few here um so we have workplace outbreak guidance this is a question that we get a lot at the um through the business reopening task force what do i do with an employee test positive um we do get questions from employees as well i know that a co-worker of mine tested positive why isn't my office closed yet or why isn't my retail establishment closed because two employees have tested positive this provides some guidance and i'd encourage employees to check it out too geared toward employers how to respond um but we'll give you an idea as an employee on what you can expect i will say here though that um this is really situational specific and so uh we have teams of um um investigators um and contact tracers that really thoroughly um have conversations with folks who have tested positive um and business establishments if they need to um it's just based on how much contact was there um what the activity looked like how um how separated someone was um and so it's case by case and oftentimes your business isn't going to close down right away because of one case or uh your coworker got sick it doesn't necessarily mean that um you should stay home it's so specific and so check out the outbreak guidance there's a lot of resources on here for individuals as well when it comes to um what you should do if you're sick or you think you've been exposed or have been um and so really check out this uh state website here i'm going to show you tri county's website too but just um in the interest of time here um going through the state guidance um cleaning guidance worker and consumer protection masks and protective equipment some of this is you'll get the basics here why wear a mask um what what you how you need to wear a mask other tips some of the guidance is a lot more technical like when it comes to worker and consumer protection is going to get into a lot of text and details here um you'll see here lots of different um depending on the industry that you're in agriculture even guidance for grocers municipalities public transportation farmers markets um so just uh trying to promote this so as you um as a resident uh watching uh this video here pass it on um that there's a lot of resources here we know it doesn't always get out effectively we do our best um but you all can be message messengers as well so please uh uh reference this page when folks uh have questions um restaurants and food manufacturers schools and child care lots of new guidance coming with schools um so this is a great resource lots to read up on better understand what to expect should something happen but a lot of great resources i want to quickly touch on um in keeping employees and customers safe this was one of the topics that i had on my list just to touch on because i know that we are talking to employees on on the line here so um really focusing on how um to keep your workspace safe um to keep you safe we talked about a lot of them a lot of them are required here um but um really uh focusing on um how you can keep employees safe here tips for workers specifically so you as an employee um and this is stuff that we're looking to connect employers with uh to train folks oh um as an employer you should use these resources um to communicate with your employees and a lot of these have translations here so folks with employees or employers needing different languages this is a great option to connect your employees with information so not looking for anything fancy with training uh really looking to connect uh folks with this information right here uh print out this page make sure your employees are connected with it to know uh what's expected of them at different times and in different situations and as an employee just being able to check this out yourself and and feel confident that uh this is where we are um making sure you're checking that home page for updates because they come sometimes hourly making it difficult to keep up which we know so keep reaching out i'll mention uh the business reopening task force again they can be reached at covid business recovery at tchd.org happy to answer any questions that you have all right i'm going to quickly touch on tri-county's website here let's see um [Music] when you go it's tchd.org at the top here you have coven 19 updates and resources some of those main ones are on that main page there and then you can navigate to our resources here we have a lot of the same resources as the state we link them here um should you come to our page instead of the state so you can pull together resources here we do have some unique resources specifically for businesses so that's what i want to touch on really quickly um this is our business page we have our how to connect we do weekly webinars so feel free to jump on those um chat in your question uh talking your question chat with us um the whole task force um participates um well not all at once but we participate throughout and so we're happy to talk to you live during those webinars and encourage you to join those again tchd.org and you can quickly navigate to the coven and business updates we have a lot of guidance documents here some of these are unique to our jurisdiction so we have our best practices for all businesses we talked about that um but we also flag some resources here from outside organizations so this is um cpra colorado parks and rec parks and rec association all we have um uh guidance for car washes we have a lot of car washes in our jurisdiction and so we got a lot of calls and this is really um an advertisement for all of you um you help us guide um our guidance documents and what we focus our time and attention on because we are trying to be responsive um to your needs that's what we're here for so that's how car wash guidance got on our website and we do go through and talk to the industry um we worked closely with the industry on um what uh their business model looked like you know public health agency we're not necessarily car wash experts um who know and so this is where you all come in to hear from you about what your business model is how it doesn't work um how it's not a great fit um you're not sure if you exactly fit under this is your business model complying um we and that informs the guidance documents we put together um but it also informs our um communications with the state so can we advocate on your behalf this isn't working in this space and have we thought this through so we have regular conversations with the state health department uh with representatives from the governor's office with school superintendents with uh gyms um and so just connecting the dots and making sure that uh your voice is heard um because again and just like we talked about at the beginning um the public health orders just couldn't possibly address every single situation and so serving as that bridge filling the gaps with car wash guidance and answering your questions along the way is really what we're here to do um we have um dora um spas symptom screening again some of these uh connected to uh state health department guidance more unique ones guidance for drive-in events a small event guidance we've heard a lot from the community with a need for this uh what does a small event look like and this can be whether it's for you personally or within your job setting or allowing these uh larger events to take place still small restricted but larger than 10 and what does that look like whether you're a caterer or a restaurant hosting someone or a venue or it is your own backyard i'm just connecting with some practical guidance here on what small events canon should look like um and just as we said for businesses in general communication uh across the board here that's what we're looking for uh same for large events we want to know um people are informed we want to know uh people are taking um um intentional action to keep folks safe and so as an employee you want to hear that from your employer that they're taking intentional action to keep you safe and that's what we're looking for across the board really and that's what this talks about here um i'd like to bring up the small event guidance because it says things like um you know maybe don't pull out um the yard games this time and have folks bring separate shares we're talking really practical um but that's what we're looking for in the business setting too what can you practically do as an employer or employee to keep folks safe and when it doesn't match up with guidance here having you all reach out to us so we can say could we tweak it a little bit can you make it more like this um to match up here or have you thought about doing it this way um and it's really conversational um again because we're not the subject matter experts in your business and so to hear that feedback from you and ultimately relay that message to the state is the goal so um lots of different guidance here i encourage you to look through um and then the last thing i want to touch on before we get started with questions because that's really what i'm here for to hear from you is our data um so this is tri-county's no matter where you go on tri county's website i'm going to take us back to the home page just so you can um take a look at that no matter where you are you scroll to the bottom and our data page is here this is the easiest way to navigate um but it's keeping yourself informed as an employer or employee knowing what's happening within your community making common sense decisions about what's a good fit for you and your business and thinking through the activity that you're engaged in and voicing your concerns when you have them um especially now when we see case counts going up so i just want to show you this uh so that's our data page that covid19 data and we have a lot of information here so i'm going to take you to the case dashboard and everything from the number of positive cases you can break this down by uh our data team put this together and it's actually very um uh fun to play around on this and and kind of see um how far you can narrow the information down and what you can see uh within your specific community and time period so everything from those general cases um we have uh cases by county um this is it does get technical um all the way down to um the amount of mask wearing that we're seeing across the county so uh tri county has done um something pretty innovative here within our environmental health division we had folks go out into the community and because as we were considering if a mass mandate was necessary and and what benefit we've received from that as a community um we we talked to folks who either said no one is wearing masks or everyone is wearing masks and we don't need it and so we really wanted to be informed in our decision making and what we saw was that a lot of folks are wearing masks a lot of folks aren't um and the website isn't updated yet and i'm so sad um not to be able to show you because this is uh the week of july 5th this is right before any mask mandate uh was issued and then the following week after the mass mandate every county is in the 90 percent up to 97 and so what we saw is a lot of people are wearing mass that's true and a lot of people aren't so that's true too and a mask mandate uh worked we did see a significant uptick in the number of folks wearing masks in the community so um um i do want to show you one more thing and then questions um i want to show you the information on masks because we've heard um from employees from employers this is a really challenging issue for you all to tackle here um we know that folks don't want to wear masks always you may not feel empowered to um remove someone or deny services to someone um who claims a medical exemption or all kinds of issues that come along with uh this mass mandate for businesses and so uh guidance for wearing masks here from that main page um there's some really great resources specifically for employers including the civil rights guidance for employers and places of public accommodation so this goes through um what the requirements are um what uh language you can use in your conversations with customers about what the requirements are what what you need to do as an employer for your employees and customers um and i will just say that one of the things that that we try to um reiterate each time we talk about this is that um businesses do have the authority um to deny service to anyone not wearing a mask even if they have a medical exemption you are really encouraged to provide a reasonable accommodation so curbside pickup outdoor seating to go food or delivery but at no point is someone do you have to let someone without a mask into your business so lots of great resources here we are working on tri-county's website on our business page uh we will have a script there for businesses to use with masking and this is also something that we're happy um to chat through with you as you encounter issues and again advocating to the state on what kind of guidance we need to fill these gaps and and support all of you as employers and employees because we know that this is intense and uh very politically charged unfortunately and um can be trouble for folks so we want to make sure that we're supporting you in that way so reach out if you have questions about that um it will appear under this guidance page just in the next uh tomorrow actually so uh keep an eye out for that here all right that was a lot of talking um so with that i'm gonna turn it over to questions and i see them coming through here in the chat box um my employer wants everyone to come back to the office they said people who are at high risk can stay remote workers i believe i am high risk i have health conditions and my child has severe asthma my boss says i'm not high risk because he read that kids are safer and asthma isn't a big deal who decides me or my can he fire me if i demand to stay remote so this is a really complex issue and one we do hear a lot um just what the parameters are for accommodations here i'd really encourage you to take a look through some of these resources that i referenced uh the civil rights guidance here and i'm actually um i did talk to congressman crowe's office and i will put together a one-pager with some of these uh links for folks um that can be posted alongside this video so keep an eye out for that because i'll post some of these main things but um this guidance for um civil rights guidance it includes in the workplace so take a look through that um there are a variety of uh guidance documents um through the civil rights division and i'm just trying to see if it's um if their information is included here but if it's not i will uh pull i'll include that as a link um it's not um it's not easy to give a clear answer on that but these documents will be supportive i will say that businesses should still be operating remotely and is it is a requirement of the public health order for businesses to be operating remotely to the greatest extent possible and so if your job can be done completely remotely um you are encouraged and your employer is urged to allow you to do that um especially if you've been doing that um and and can do so um so if you have questions reach out to that uh to our business reopening task force um business or covid business recovery tchd.org uh we're happy to connect you with uh these resources here they'll be in that one pager um but just reading through the documents and then uh there are avenues by which you could um bring in action if you uh thought that um you were at high risk and weren't being accommodated appropriately so um lots of details there it can get sticky but there is guidance that can help facilitate that conversation with you and your employer or the state if you uh decide that that action is needed are gloves required for office employees so um this gives me an opportunity to mention um that we expect a new public health order tomorrow this will be ninth amended public health order 2028. i'm going to bring up this page since i'm still sharing my screen here hopefully i've been sharing it this whole time um this is where you can find the public health orders and executive orders i mentioned the governor issuing those executive orders first a public health order usually following both of them can issue orders independent of each other but usually it follows that executive order public health order so you can find both of those here um this is going to be ninth amended public health order 2028 safer at home and in the vast great outdoors we expect to see this tomorrow and we expect it to touch on gloves interestingly um because if you have looked through the guidance um you'll see that gloves are required generally throughout and so um it gets a bit confusing because it's not required um for all things in an office um setting um it is now recommended um for your industry if it is um something that your industry usually wears gloves for you should wear them if you are passing things back and forth you should wear them in those occasions but no you wouldn't be asked to wear gloves as an office employee more generally keep an eye out for that updated public health order and then again this really is a tool um you know we're happy to help but just to empower you to advocate for yourself checking out these uh guidance for businesses because uh guidance by sector here you can go to whoops guidance by sector office based businesses and the requirements for office based businesses specifically are outlined here and so just a way for you to advocate for what the requirements are on using this guidance information so whether it's a conversation with your um employer or employees or a conversation with us feel free to check out these documents please do actually um and and it really outlines the requirements based on a variety of settings and i'll leave this up because you can see here to the left of what those requirements are uh what are the consequences for non-compliance with your rules will the police shut my business down if i don't make people use a thermometer every day no so it's really tough what we're looking for um well first uh your local public health agency tri county health department is tasked as the primary enforcer of these orders um we do have support from a variety of entities whether it be law enforcement um it's going to depend on the law enforcement agencies policies what they respond to what they engage in and so it depends but our law enforcement are responding to calls and certainly egregious violations of the order um that really pose an imminent threat to to the health of the community so a law enforcement is engaged um our business our business licensing folks at the local level are engaged whether you're hearing communications from them um they've emailed you and let you know the current status um or they've issued you a warning or in order to close your business um because you're not complying um tri-county and all of these entities are focused on uh education first so we know that our businesses are um interested in complying keeping their customers safe and so it really looks like a conversation with us just like we're doing here have you seen this guidance did you see they changed that last week we expect a public health order looks like somebody's required to wear gloves every day in an office we want to make sure that we're letting you know that you don't have to do that um the the guidance has changed it changed yesterday it's changing tomorrow i want to keep you informed about what that is and we know it's changing so um no um you're not going to get in trouble for a slip up um for um a misinterpretation of the order making a good faith effort to keep your customers employees safe as you operate your business um i will say um there are some requirements here um that really need to be in place and so if you don't have them in place you you will hear from us about that and if you're not willing to comply it does look like further action like a warning to let you know um that you are in violation of the order and this is a requirement um tri-county does have the authority to close businesses um that pose a threat to public health um we have not um had to do that very often under um covid19 because we do gain voluntary compliance um specifically related to your thermometer question because um it is specific and one that we get um it is not required um in all situations and it's tough to do these webinars without having a conversation and again just an opportunity to mention uh the business reopening task force uh covid business recovery at tchd.org because we'd love to chat through your specific business and whether or not a thermometer is required in most cases symptom screening like we touched on those those best practices for all businesses um you have to symptom screen you don't always have to take a temperature so if you were not symptom screening at all um that would be a problem and something that we would chat through with you if you can't get a thermometer or it's impossible for you to scan all of your employees before they come into work each day we'll chat through uh with you what you can do in place can you get your employees to symptom screen at home before coming in or at our office we have um a website right as you walk in the door it says please symptom screen yourself and we do our symptom screening right there we scan the qr code and put in um whether or not we've had symptoms so we need that symptom screening every day but we're happy to work with you on how that happens and we're not interested in coming to shut your business down um for violations or misinterpretations or inability to meet a requirement we want to chat through what that can and should look like with you if a patron in a restaurant refuses oops refuses to wear a mask and a restaurant serves them and allows them inside who is in trouble for breaking the code the patron or the restaurant i hate to do this to you guys again but it really is um situational and we would love to hear the situation that you're in um and and who you know what's the issue are there medical exemptions is it um you know a miscommunication or um but under the governor's um executive order and i'll just uh navigate to that really quickly maybe um under uh the governor's executive order businesses are required to require masking in their establishment and uh patrons are required to wear masks and so there's really this bonus on both the business and the patron of the establishment to wear a mask um the way we have it structured at tri-county and so this is how we're responding to our businesses um and just in general we um operate on a complaint basis so we do get lots and lots of complaints um and so the community is interested in staying safe and healthy and we hear from them we hear from employees we hear from employers across the board about this but with math specifically there is a medical exemption i mentioned this earlier but a business is not required um to allow a patron to enter without a mask looking for a reasonable accommodation there can they do curbside um do you have outdoor seating that they could make their way to as opposed to indoors um and so looking for an accommodation there um but if we're hearing that a business is regularly um not complying with the order not requiring customers to wear masks customers feel comfortable not to comply because a business has implied that they don't um we'll respond to that um and honestly um sometimes you know if we if we get three complaints four complaints on a business um people aren't masking here we follow up what's the barrier i mentioned an employer may not be requiring masks may um have taken an extreme approach and said we don't wear that's really where we're looking to um gain compliance let them know look this is serious you can't do that this is the requirement of the order maybe a warning i mean we usually gain compliance that way um lots of times it's a lack of resource lack of knowledge lack of knowledge of a change that recently happened we touched on that um and so lots of education connections to resources uh the business reopening task force will be doing a mask project with the business community i'm connecting some businesses in need of masks with those resources free of charge so i'm really exploring different ways of course we have limited resources but connecting to other resources um providing template signage um you know with the tri-county logo so they um feel confident that this is coming from the health department not just my random restaurant put this is making me do this this is this is a public health order it's the law and you need to require so um uh you know a variety of ways to deal with that but um not not looking to uh penalize folks looking to educate um making sure folks are connected to resources and um gaining compliance through that road my employee printed a card off facebook that says she has a health condition and i can't make her wear a mask i know i can't ask her to tell me about her health conditions but i have seen one i've seen the card on facebook too and it's totally bogus right so i encourage you to take a look at that civil rights guidance again i'm going to send over a one-pager to be posted with this video so um you can get connected to this quickly um but it is on the state health department's uh website that main website uh covid19 um but it's the civil rights guidance and employers actually can um ask for documentation um of um a disability that requires a an accommodation in the workplace and i don't want to get into too many details because i'm not the appropriate messenger of that information but the state has outlined it here and it's different for employees that are asked to make a reasonable accommodation i will say um depending on the industry that you're in if your employee can't wear a mask um there are situations in which they cannot have direct contact uh with the public or co-workers and so those requirements are under the industry specific uh guidance that we touched on earlier but retail is an example if you're a retail worker at your grocery store and you medically cannot tolerate a mask you should be doing a task that does not involve um direct contact with the public or your co-workers um to ensure everyone's safety in that situation so check out the civil rights guidance cdphe's website um but feel free to reach out to our business reopening task force as well i'm happy to chat through that with you co-workers keep wearing masks under their nose and they are breathing all over me and my space do you have any facts that i can show them about how the mask needs to cover their nose or it's useless yes we do because you are not alone um in that concern so i'll take you to the state health department's uh resource tri-county also has resources on mask wearing going to go down to this mask update here mandatory in all public spaces fast facts um masks should and here um it tells you that it should fit snugly but comfortably against the side of your face it should be secure um we have some there's some faq information in here about on the importance of and what masks do i will say if you reach out to us we're happy to connect you with some of the science um just maybe some diagrams on how to um wear a mask but check out these resources because there's a lot of good information here and then this looks like the last question here if masks work why did tri-county health wait until now to make a rule um you know this is a tough question and uh we um labored over this um intensely um for quite some time because there's a balance here we want to respect um um people's um uh wishes as far as what they do with their body and whether or not they wear a mask um we did see fairly high rates of mask compliance um and that is where that survey that i referenced a bit earlier where that monitoring came from because we wanted to know what really was happening within the community and so we saw compliance rates um in the 80 percent uh we talked to our local governments um what's really important with the mass mandate is collaboration between um our local governments who are really within the community uh very regularly throughout their regular jobs whether it be uh their their government buildings their parks and rec folks their business licensing uh courts etc um um having buy-in from those folks that it's gonna work for them that they're gonna put up signage they're going to um take this seriously and um help us achieve this um greater of risk offset through mask wearing so there were conversations about it um needing this local support to gain compliance and spread the message with us about mask wearing and then we ultimately got um mask wearing messaging from the state which really helped spread the message far and consistently and we had been asking that of the state and we're very happy when the governor issued that um just making it easier for folks to understand one-stop shop you know this is the requirements um although i'll say um in the tri-county jurisdiction um there's masking requirements outdoors that's our additional provision there so um there was a lot of thought we wanted to be thoughtful in that decision in making such a such a big decision from um your local public health agency and so we wanted to be sure and consistent with our messaging and regionally and so a lot of thought went into it but i appreciate the question and i'm happy to chat more if you'd like to okay well thank you guys so much for having me this has been really fantastic i appreciate all your questions of reaching out again to the business reopening task force covid business recovery at tchd.org i'm happy to answer your questions as you navigate whether you're an employer employee concerned parent we hear from those two uh feel free to reach out we would love to connect you with resources and provide education and just thank you for participating thanks

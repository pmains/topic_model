congressman great to have you on the show today sir well thank you john it's great to be with you this afternoon it's an amazing time i i remember exactly a year ago this day i was sitting in front of the computer writing breaking news alerts about the horrific frenzied airport access in kabul the sort of the end of the bungled biden exit from afghanistan and i wonder a year later your thoughts i mean you served our country in the military been really concerned about where afghanistan has gone since we left a year later are we safer or less safer after that withdrawal oh no um john we are definitely less safe after that uh a horrendous withdrawal that botched withdrawal biden has shown uh to the entire world his failed leadership his failed military leadership and and afghanistan uh is a big black eye for the united states you know i served three combat tours in iraq and kuwait uh and um you know one of those was in direct support of the operations in afghanistan and and uh it just broke my heart when i saw what happened i mean the way that the president um you know just abandoned bagram air base which was really the key to maintaining stability within that region right there i mean we had bagram air base uh it was such an incredible base that was built there and the prison that was then left wide open and and you know 5 000 terrorists then went out into the into the night and um that was just such a travesty um we it did not have to be that way president biden bears full responsibility for it and here we are a year later with the taliban in total control of afghanistan and with them just just beating the drum now about potential new attacks and uh and and this is um this is uh uh this is just terrible and you know when we take back the house in in january and i firmly believe that republicans will uh we are going to give this a proper investigation because no one has been held accountable here john no one has been held accountable and they need to be you know from from the the state department to the department of defense um this has has just been a disaster for america on the world stage and and you see the results of that um with ukraine and potentially taiwan too yeah there's no no doubt about it and i think the whole world was shaken by the fact that america could exit so messily so in disregard of the security protocols you've probably seen the testimony now it hasn't got a lot of attention in the news media but when you see what the former commander of u.s central coming in centcom general kenneth mckenzie when he testified i told the president i thought we should have 2500 treats behind and that we should hold bagram the implicit acknowledgement is that the president rejected his best military advice on this that hasn't gotten the attention i think a lot of people think it deserves what does it say when a president doesn't listen to his own commanders the experts on the ground in afghanistan well it says that the president thinks he knows best uh he's obviously a man of no military experience and uh you know president trump though he may not have military experience either he has business experience and he knows what it takes to run an incredible organization and you listen to those who are under you who are experts in their particular area you hire people that are quote you know smarter than yourself and and you bring those together through incredible leadership and you build that sort of a team i mean president trump had a conditions based withdrawal plan and when the taliban violated those conditions he hammered them joe biden's withdrawal plan was based on a date he wanted to be out of there you know by the 31st of august so we could celebrate being out of there and then on the 20th anniversary of 9 11 and it simply would never work it will never work when you have a date that you have to be gone by and it and it doesn't matter what kind of pain is inflicted on you that never works militarily as we saw it was a debacle it was a disaster we lost 13 incredible members of our military because of it died in a terrorist attack that that could easily have been prevented if we had held bagram i mean it just it it's insanity what we saw happen over there and um and as i said president biden bears full and total responsibility for that debacle of a um of a retreat yeah i'm just going to read this line because it's six in my mind i remember the day he gave it back in march unfortunately we were focused on other things back in march and so the news media didn't cover this for the extraordinary moment but this is general mackenzie's exact quotes in the spring of 2021 that's when joe biden was in uh in charge now it was a mistake to go below of 2500 troops if in fact we did so we expected the government of afghanistan to collapse that reflected my opinion in the opinion of general miller his deputy who was in afghanistan we had an opportunity to freely express that opinion i'm confident it was heard but it was rejected really remarkable testimony you served you know what it takes you you had a company that grew into an important armory company there were 20 years of bloodshed in this country how do veterans out of people who gave all or gave so much to fight that war to make sure it wouldn't become a terrorist haven think now when they look out and realize well auswari was sitting at a deck so comfortable in afghanistan he thought he was free have those who have served feel the pain of the fact that that's back to being a terrorist haven again yeah you know that does have to be incredibly disappointing and um and and tragic for people who especially those who lost loved ones over there but they just have to be comforted in knowing that for 20 years we have their sacrifices have protected americans on this side of the globe and so their sacrifices are not lost they were not for nothing and you know it's it's back to to where it was before but we have learned a lot more about that region and so i would say that their service is still there's no difference in the honor of their service now than it was before it's just that we're we're just going to have to um you know make our shield stronger and um and we're going to have to fight more now i think we're in a less safe place like what you said earlier than we were when we had troops on the ground in afghanistan being able to control that or help can help the government control that country so um uh you know their service was incredibly honorable to our country and it did preserve our liberty for years there's no doubt we were safer because of all those sacrifices there was a report earlier this week that some of the elite afghan fighters after the collapse of the government when it was clear taliban was in charge they fled with their equipment to iran i just think about that right now iran has not only the soldiers we trained in afghanistan but some of the equipment and meanwhile they're talking about and plotting to kill people on our own soil president george w bush john bolton the two most recent examples why are we negotiating with iran given the bad record that we're seeing with their behavior in the world well you know that example you gave just shows the extent of the disaster of the retreat out of afghanistan when the 80 plus billion dollars worth of equipment that we left behind for the taliban or excuse me for the the afghan government that was then just turned right on over to the taliban forfeited to the taliban and then to to have any negotiations with iran um it just shows the lack of leadership on the world stage i mean obama was doing it during his tenure but president trump was strong during his uh time in the in the oval office when you negotiate with terrorists and you do it from a position of weakness you are going to lose and that's exactly what we're going to see and we're not going to get any sort of a good deal in negotiating with iran from a position of weakness you have to show strength they have to respect you right now i don't believe they do respect us there's other countries in the world that don't respect us simply because we have shown tremendous weakness on the world stage it really is remarkable another place where we're seeing a lot of weakness right now the economy you're a small business owner you know what happens when government gets in the way of business you take a look at the law that they call the inflation production act even though the cbo is clear it doesn't have any impact downward it doesn't put inflation down when there are some estimates it brings it upward we're already in a tough economy what happens over the next six months when we pour that 700 billion dollars into the economy oh i mean the the title of the of the bill the inflation reduction act is just a flat out lie uh to the american people it should be called the inflation expansion act or the inflation inflation act that's a good one i like that i haven't heard that one yet that's what it's gonna do when you inject 740 billion dollars almost three-quarters of a trillion dollars into the economy you're going to increase inflation that's just the way economics 101 works i mean the democrats obviously don't understand economics i don't i wonder that they understand math they certainly don't understand how to define a woman so you've got to wonder where their heads are in this particular bill uh i think it was a smoke screen uh for their green new deal uh as nancy pelosi said um you know how can people vote against mother earth well they're not talking about inflation reduction anymore once the the senate passed the bill and the house passed the bill on a party-line vote basis not one solitary republican voted for this it is a disaster of a bill they are leading us down the wrong path so we are going to see in my opinion inflation continue to increase it's going to continue to take a bite out of out of people's earnings every year and and you know where the administration said that last month uh we had zero percent inflation and yet we know it was eight point five percent i mean if it was zero percent why did we even need this bill the inflation reduction act i mean that just goes to show you uh the deceitfulness of the title of the bill so and then probably the worst aspect of this bill is the increase in the irs literally 80 billion dollars to the internal revenue service over 10 years where their annual budget is only 12 billion six times their annual budget they will be getting in additional funds to hire additional enforcement agents and who do you think they're going to going to go after john you think they're going to go after the democrat donors the or the the high income earners that have an army of tax accountants and that don't even do their own taxes no they're going to come after you and me those folks in the middle class or in the lower class that don't have the ability to fight against the irs to basically just fold because you know if whatever the irs says extra that you owe it's not worth it fighting because you're gonna spend more money fighting the irs than what they're requiring of you so they're just gonna milk the middle class uh and um and it's it's going to be devastating economically for our country it really is remarkable and and we had some accounting firms on who they said you know when someone gets an audit notice if you're a montpar or you know joe working at the factory and you get a notice you're automatically gonna spend between three and five thousand dollars to just address the audit and most people fold their hands and pay whatever the irs says because it's not worth the extra time away so that's an additional penny three to five thousand dollars is the average according to the accounting firm and we went and grabbed this data from very respected university data tracking center it's called transactional records clearinghouse out at syracuse university they looked at the last two years of irs enforcement 61 of all audits occurred with people under the income level of 25 000 because they've been auditing people who get the earned income child tax credit we're focusing on people who have the least amount of money to give back how did this system get so out of whack well it just goes to show you how the internal revenue service can be manipulated and can be used to as a weapon against whatever the enemy of the political stat establishment happens to be whoever that enemy i mean for me i wish it would have only cost me three to five thousand dollars in my dealings with the irs but back in 2013 in order for me to win my case against the irs it cost over 150 000 john i mean so so mind you we were dealing with a whole lot more money they came against business all right through civil asset forfeiture but this is a weaponization of the internal revenue service and and this is 100 on democrats who want this who want to increase their ability to threaten and coerce and intimidate conservatives and the vast majority of them are going to be those who make under two hundred thousand dollars in fact actually under seventy five thousand dollars and uh that's your average hard-working american citizen and we need to stop this and we need to do it by by making our voices loud and clear in november and throwing out the current leadership so we can we can reverse this issue we can reverse this policy and in fact honestly john we what we really need to do is eliminate the internal revenue service that would be the solution hr 25 the fair tax act i think is the right way to go here i'm hoping that this that what has happened that this build now the uh um the inflation expansion act will give us the the motivation and the the energy to pass this particular bill and to completely eliminate the internal revenue service and that bill would then eliminate the tax return from every citizen's life and we would be so much better as a country for it the flat tax fair attack sort of came up about a decade ago it had a lot of synergy for a while then it kind of faded a little bit seems like that is catching fancy with members of congress are your colleagues in the house beginning to talk that hey maybe that's a great way to go back get rid of the big bureaucracy everybody knows what they pay out the door and we're done is that picking up some steam it is it is picking up some steam i'm excited about that fact because i want to see the irs terminated it is an agency that has outlived its usefulness in my opinion i think we can go to a better tax system a more fair tax system across the uh across the united states and and then it eliminates the weaponization of the irs and that's exactly what we're going to see with these 87 000 new agents that are going to be on boarded into the irs and uh i think that that we will see um you know this being talked about more and more in fact i'm hoping that that maybe we will uh be able to do a discharge petition on the house floor maybe we'll be able to leave that and bring the bring the fair tax up for a vote yeah i think that there's such an important dynamic and it's so funny to see it catch fire again because it was an idea that had some momentum for a while it's definitely back in vogue it's going to be very interesting to see all right the last part of this inflation reduction act well everybody says this is a big green economy the transformative if you listen to democrats the transformative moment in american history we're going to get to a green energy economy i heard this promise once before in 09 when they did the shovel ready package for america which by the way another project yourself already gave us solyndra but there's a number in here that drives me nuts because there's no explanation how they're going to get there it just says flatly in seven years we're going to cut u.s carbon emissions by 40 percent do any of your colleagues in congress have any data from the administration how they're going to get to that extraordinary number in seven years no i don't think so whatsoever that's a pipe dream in my opinion i mean to think that we're all going to transition to electric vehicles i mean that's simple insanity that is that is their their utopia and that is not going to happen uh you the electric vehicles aren't there for one thing in fact i think you know having electric vehicles in certain places maybe metropolitan areas and and uh but long haul with electric vehicles no that's just not an option and i don't think it'll be an option in your lifetime or my lifetime fossil fuel is here to stay and it's here to stay for a very long time the united states has over is estimated at current rates at over 400 years worth of supply of fossil fuels and that is where our focus needs to be green energy is not reliable wind is not reliable solar is not reliable but fossil fuel and nuclear are incredibly reliable and that's what we need that's where our focus needs to be that's where um americans need to to you know that's what needs to drive our economy and there's so many ways to use fossil fuels and and still bring down emissions it isn't like republicans want to pollute right you keep getting this the democrats have this false narrative as well republicans don't care about the green economy they don't care about the climate actually most republicans have given us the most famous climate legislations in history you got the park system with teddy roosevelt you've got reagan's famous montreal protocol deal that got rid of fluorocarbons and you got donald trump and the republican congress passing one of the largest conservation laws in the world you guys care about it but you keep getting blamed how does that dynamic change how do you turn this around on democrats and say they spent a lot of money got us nothing we spent a generous amount of money and we got a lot of effect for our republican policies when does that debate change you think well and then you look at where this money is going i mean the vast majority of this green new deal money is going to china the china who makes the solar panels who makes the wind turbines who makes that sort of stuff you know and but how do they make it with coal with fossil fuel i mean if if if we're concerned about you know global climate change then we should be concerned about what china is putting into the air when it comes to emissions and we don't we're not you know we're not gonna we are not the entire world here in the united states we're only a very small portion of it and um and our we can cut our emissions totally a hundred percent and it's hardly going to move the needle at all in the world when you have other countries like china and they'll just take up the access and beat us at it yeah i mean you know russia whatever i mean russian national gas is russian natural gas is um is tremendously more dirty than u.s natural gas so it just doesn't make sense what where they're going but that's just normal you know that's a protocol for democrats i've never found them to really make sense nope they have an echo chamber in the media and over time i think people will begin to absorb it i think they know now there's a moment in your state that i think is going to be critical obviously the senate race is a big deal you've got the incumbent against herschel walker so you got a democrat who's trying to hold on in a purple state and in this bill there was this tax credit for ev vehicles and as soon as it came out it was learned that kia one of the largest employers in all of georgia i think 4 000 employees they're not going to be able to take advantage of this tax credit because of the way it was written it actually nullifies their ability to be eligible or have their cars eligible for it that seems like that's going to hit really hard the georgia everyday voter how big a mistake was this for the democrats well i think you know this tax credit for electric vehicles is a mistake across the board because what we are doing is we are incentivizing specific industries we are choosing winners and losers and that's not what the government is here to do that's not what our capitalistic system is designed for we are not in the government here to pick winners and losers we are here to to make it fair okay our regulations fair uh for people to to innovate and to bring their exceptional ideas and bring them to market and through hard work to profit from it but um but that's not what government is doing here when you incentivize specific things and then and and overly and tax other things then you're picking winners and losers and that's wrong that is not good for georgia it's not good for our country and that's another problem with this bill yeah i'm really jaw-dropping last question because i know you're real busy but you're on the oversight committee you play an important role in creating accountability in congress fbi raid at mar-a-lago a lot of questions that i assume that you and your colleagues are going to want to get answered probably in january because it doesn't seem like the doj is going to answer anything before then is this going to be one of the many focuses that your great committee will be focused on i think it will be a focus of both the oversight committee and the judiciary committee i believe we are going to dissect the fbi and the department of justice and we are going to put them under a microscope piece by piece and we are going to see where the corruption lies not if there is corruption but where the corruption lies and we are going to expose it because it is very evident through this raid on president trump's residence his home that um uh that the fbi and the doj have been weaponized and they are trying to do anything and everything in my opinion to disqualify president trump from running for office again in 2024 and they're going to lose i think that the american people see right through this i think that's one of the reasons why that they don't want the affidavit released they don't want the american public to know the real reason behind this raid and um it's unconscionable and we need to hold the fbi and the doj accountable and honestly where we need to impeach folks for violating the law we need to do that yeah absolutely well sir what an honor to have you on the show i really appreciate we covered a lot of ground i also want to thank you for your service a lot of people don't know this 28 years in the navy three combat tours your country owes you a great debt of gratitude we want to thank you for your time today john great to be with you thank you you as well sir

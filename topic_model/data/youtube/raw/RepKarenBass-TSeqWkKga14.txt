joining us now member of the House Judiciary Committee and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus democratic congresswoman Karen bass of California good to have you on this morning thank you what do you believe is imminent in the impeachment proceedings that actually will not end up in the White House blocking someone talking well we begin our process tomorrow and you know we're going to begin by hearing from scholars talking about what are the grounds for impeachment what is the impeachment process I'm particularly interested in high crimes and misdemeanors and abuse of power exactly looking at it historically how does that and why would that lead to impeachment so hearing from you know several key experts it might help back up the facts that have been put forward so far by the Democrats facts that are being disputed I mean you even have President Trump on the world stage talking and mischaracterizing what the leader of Ukraine has said to him manaphy for the truth I think that the president has been consistent over these last three years he has no understanding of what the truth is are no concern for what it is but remember also now the report is going to be released tonight - so the Judiciary Committee will have the report will listen to experts and then decide what to do I think it's very important that we have a transparent process but that we have a very thoughtful process as well and I think that part of that part - of that begins tomorrow morning does the process include you Democrats having behind-the-scenes meetings with your Republican counterparts is there is there any potential that they there could be a bridge between Democrats and Republicans and at least calling out the President on certain facts or are they just holding strong in their corner well I mean so far they're holding strong in their corner and as you know they've really not debated the facts they debate the process they've actually sound particularly juvenile because they've protein that we weren't having open hearings there were no transcripts that we haven't had a floor vote we've done all of that and they're still just arguing about the process you know that they went ahead and released their own report refuting what the process was they had a press conference about that yesterday so we'll see exactly what the committee puts forward what they vote on and we'll take all of that information under consideration yeah Republicans leaning into the conspiracy theory refuted in public testimony that it was in fact Ukraine that meddled in the 2016 election so congresswoman for people watching this process at home it sounds like in the Intel committee you had all the witnesses come forward who can provide evidence fact witnesses they didn't want to weigh in and whether or not the offenses were impeach them well they said that's not my job I'm here to tell you what I saw and what I heard it sounds like as the process moves to your committee to judiciary you will in fact have constitutional scholars who can answer the question of whether or not all that evidence we've seen now adds up to something in P chable is that a fair assessment of where you all see your job I think that's exactly right I think that is an assessment and I think that you know we're going to be very interested in that you remember the Judiciary Committee had been looking at the Muller report had been looking at obstruction of justice and now after the whistleblower it sent it off in a slightly different direction and to me what's most important is is that what the President did with Ukraine has him interfering in the next election the Muller report talked about what happened in the past and I think that it is absolutely critical and to me that's the urgency with why we cannot wait until the next election if you have the president attempting to intervene in the next election we need to be very clear about that and we need to stop him in his tracks I think it's very clear that he was going to continue forward you know he made the call - he had the call with the president of Ukraine just a day or so after mother testified before the Judiciary Committee which means he essentially felt well I'm off scot-free let me see how I can interfere in the next election and that to me is particularly egregious the other thing that concerns me during this whole process when he came unhinged around the Intelligence Committee investigation then you had him make the deal with Iran that led to hundreds of people being killed in Syria so I'm concerned that when he is put in a corner how irrational how erratic he be in what danger will he put our country he's over there at the NATO conference right now you know he's going to have a fit tomorrow at the hearing so what kind of irrational crazy statement is he going to make tomorrow what kind of new policy is he going to propose on the fly all of this to me creates an incredible sense of urgency for why we need to put a halt to this behavior right now now whether that leads to impeachment what articles we introduce in all of that that remains to be seen Steve congressman Steve Rattner you made the point that the stuff around the mauler report really relates to what happened in the last selection whereas what's happening with Ukraine relates to what's happening in this election I don't want to I'm not trying to put words in your mouth but does that mean that you think the Muller stuff should not be brought into this engagement proceeding no no no it doesn't at all I think we have to determine what we what articles there will be introduced whether or not we introduced articles around obstruction of justice that relates to the Muller report we can we'll see but you know he's continued to obstruct Congress by not allowing information to be received by the committees not allowing people to come and testify so his obstruction continues whether you're talking about obstruction of justice or obstructing Congress all right member of the Judiciary Committee congresswoman Karen bass thank you very much for being on this morning

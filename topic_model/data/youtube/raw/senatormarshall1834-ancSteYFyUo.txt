you on this and and whether we should commit to infrastructure spending and if so up to two trillion dollars as lindsey graham seems to be open to well i would sure not never want to argue with lindsey graham he's one of the most entertaining people i've ever ever met he should be called the johnny carson of the locker room and we probably agree on the same goal here but we've already borrowed eight trillion dollars from our grandchildren over the past couple of years this is pretty scary this last two trillion dollars we just borrowed i would have loved to spend that on infrastructure but remember the bill they're talking about is not an infrastructure bill the democrats they should call this the grab your wallet bill or this is going to be the raise your taxes bill you know my grandma told me that there was three things you could count on the democrats to do spend your money raise your taxes and increase your regulations so i'm all for infrastructure we got to figure out how to pay for it and i just wish we would have prioritized infrastructure over some of these other issues but the bill they're putting before us a trade trojan horse and it's going to do all three of those things my grandma warned us about well i'm sure your grandmother was aware that republicans were pretty good at least one of those three things spending money so um you know it it republicans in the position now have questioned a lot of spending considering all the spending and debt that built up on the prior administration and to be fair saying you and i talked about this before that's been a bipartisan trend uh democrats republicans so i'm just wondering now uh especially when lindsey graham seemed to leave out the possibility of paying for this in other words raising taxes or anything like that then are you open to that too a two trillion dollar plan an infrastructure only plan that uh doesn't call for raising taxes well look i i would love to talk about an infrastructure plan we have to figure out how to pay for it though and that's what the democrats always leave out i'm really not wanting to borrow a lot more money today i think that the economy is recovering but i'm very very concerned about all their new rules or new regulations i'm very concerned when they raise the taxes they're going to kill the economy uh you know what pre-coped we had the greatest economy in my lifetime and i think that came about because we lowered people's taxes we lowered regulations and we lowered uh energy prices so back when gasoline was a dollar seventy a gallon uh having some type of uh of a user fee maybe we would have considered it but now gasoline is already three dollars a gallon and we haven't seen even the you know the tip of the iceberg here so it's it's going to be a challenge how to pay for it you know transportation secretary p buddha judge raised the possibility of a a mileage tax maybe owing to the fact that so many people are getting electric cars uh and the like that that a gas tax wouldn't even touch them what do you think of that well it like i said i think it would have been much more palatable when gasoline was a dollar seventy a gallon but now it's three it's on its way to four gallons so that's going to be a challenge at the same time i know the roads and bridges of kansas are have never been in bigger disarray right now and that there are huge infrastructure needs that have been so good to take the two trillion dollars we just borrowed and invested it on infrastructure so with the people we were borrowing it from could have used it so you know i'm all ears i want to listen but i just think it's challenging times that we've already added so much money to the to the national debt right now that i'm concerned about even raising taxes more that that could even kill the economy more ultimately if you want strong roads bridges uh high-speed internet all those things good schools a strong military we need a strong economy and that should be our focus right now is getting this economy up and going before we borrow more money from our grandchildren do you think senator that's spending money uh in in this way on infrastructure i believe the president cited that the u.s ranks 85th on the list of countries and their how much they spend on infrastructure per capita basis i think it was and i might be wrong on the on the figures and i didn't check his out so i apologize but uh that that it it will pay for itself over time that's a line i hear a lot that it will pay for itself will it well we may never know because again this bill is not about infrastructure it's more the focus is on the green new deal adding rules and regulations so if we're spending more money to get a road and bridge through the through the permitting process than we do on the ass folder of the cement it's never going to work out so we need all those departments within the the government functioning more efficiently and truly shovel ready means shovel ready as opposed to going through 10 years of permitting so i think we need to get our house in order first you know the potential is there and i'd much rather people be building roads and bridges than paying them unemployment checks but i really see unemployment in kansas less than four percent we're predicting a lot of six percent gdp growth for the country um i i think that this bed the money is probably better spent at the local level rather than raising people's taxes to do this senator marshall very good seeing you thank you sir now good to see you as well have a great saturday

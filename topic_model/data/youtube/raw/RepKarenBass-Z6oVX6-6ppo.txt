unfortunately the president has a track record of banning countries with a high Muslim population from entering the United States in Africa alone Libya Somalia Eritrea Sudan Tanzania and most recently Nigeria have been added to the list of nations facing travel restrictions I've one of my colleagues a few minutes ago mentioned Somalia Somalia we actually do have an ambassador to Somalia we it is not completely run it obviously al-shabaab is a problem but the country is not completely run by al-shabaab last month I traveled to Sudan with members of this committee our foreign policy currently which is led by this administration had us moving closer to more normal relations with Sudan so Sudan last year went through a massive upheaval that led to a new government so while our delegation was meeting with representatives of the new government we received word about a ban on people from Sudan entering the United States you can imagine how this was received and how we looked meeting with the new government encouraging them along and then they find out a couple of minutes later that they're banned from coming to the United States so the policy is actually in direct conflict with the direction of the administration's own policy towards Sudan last Sunday I attended the opening session of the African Union in Ethiopia leaders from multiple countries approached our delegation completely confused by US policy so they now question what is our policy toward the continent of Africa we simply cannot continue to preach democracy freedom of speech and the freedom of religion when we ban people from our country and regardless of how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think it is perceived it is perceived that we are banning people because they have the Muslim faith I yield the rest of my time thank you

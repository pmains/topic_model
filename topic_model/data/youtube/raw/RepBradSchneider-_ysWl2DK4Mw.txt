about finding out how the Russians did this and stopping them from doing it again are you anywhere on those questions well it was very telling during the sessions testimony when Brad Schneider one of my colleagues said what have you done help protect the country in terms of the next elections and his answer was you know I don't really know I'll have to get back to you of all of the important questions not to be able to answer that is pretty much at the top of the list and I think it's indicative frankly of the fact that the administration has done little to nothing to protect us from the next rush of intervention because they won't admit the first took place and this is the the broader problem we can't both fashioned a response in terms of administration in Congress and we can't develop the national consensus of rejecting for interference when we have a commander-in-chief who won't even acknowledge what his intelligence agencies have been telling them congressman Adam Schiff thank you for the update and your take appreciate it

21 plus 350. 24.50 you can't help katie porter [Music] the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children or wic is a program that helps get nutritious food to low-income pregnant women new moms and children up to age five i'm proud that the american rescue plan makes it easier for wic families to get nutritious food orange county families who usually receive eleven dollars per woman and nine dollars per child each month will instead get 35 for each mom and each child during june july august and september today i'm going to show you how much this increase in food assistance helps families get nutritious food and how it still falls short all right that's about five pounds so about three dollars and fifty cents let's put it in the car so 499 plus 350 some quick math that's about eight dollars and fifty cents now that picks us up with our bananas our grapes and our apples about 14 little over 14 we're already over budget if the american rescue plan hadn't increased the amount of food we'd be all out of food this is a two dollars a pound so go see how many pounds you have um that is one eight i think uh that's not very good at measuring that's about one and a half pounds so three dollars three dollars in broccoli okay that's about i think about 15 brussels sprouts and they're 250 a pound do you want to go weigh those again let's see that's worse for you oh we're like magic about a pound and a half again so we're right around on this four dollars all right paul let's get carrots and celery put that up here all right nice big bag of carrots all right how about um some cucumbers some tomatoes let's make a salad all right let's go check out so this is enough to make a couple salads some snacks for the lunch boxes some veggies with dinner some breakfast let's see how close we get to what the american rescue plan gives for um a mom and two kids oops we just went we had about 26 dollars um so we have to figure out we're at 30 83 so we'd if we were shopping for a family of a mom and two little kids we have to put some stuff back all right so our total receipt here came to 30 and 83 cents um if we were shopping for a a pregnant mom um with two little kids at home we would only have had 26 dollars so like i said we're about four dollars over and this is with the expanded amount from the american rescue plan come october if congress doesn't act this family would have to put virtually everything back because their weekly allowance would only be a few dollars allowing them maybe to purchase a bag of apples and a couple of bananas that's why it's so important that congress continue this expanded wic food assistance so that kids pregnant moms can get food on the table and eat good high quality nutritious food to raise strong healthy children

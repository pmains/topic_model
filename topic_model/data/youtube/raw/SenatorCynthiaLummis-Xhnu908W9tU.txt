uh you're not in the uh on deck circle you're up to back well thank you mr chairman i want to follow up on ranking member capito's question regarding advanced nuclear reactors specifically fuel wyoming has enough uranium to power america's nuclear fleet for decades including new advanced reactors but america lacks the ability to enrich uranium to create the high assay low enriched uranium or halo for short that those reactors will need today the only source of that uranium is russia america's national security requires halo enrichment capabilities today but building those plants will require license from the nrc so what can be done to ensure that any application for halo enrichment can be expedited i address the question to both of you um yes senator i i understand there is a need for this high essay low enriched uranium and the need is getting more and more pressing i think as companies further their development and and look forward to filing applications uh their fuel will need to come from somewhere there are three companies out there that have enrichment technologies um some of which have licenses but probably not licenses for this level of assay um so were they to pursue construction of a facility um they would need to gain a license amendment to pro to enrich to that level um and once again that's something that would be through our fuel facilities branch and i would expect making sure that such companies give appropriate notice to the agency so that the agency can budget accordingly it's a matter of resourcing and in that our personnel are certainly capable of conducting those reviews there's one company out there in new mexico that is currently operational it would also need to pursue a license amendment to do that extra capacity but i believe the agency is certainly capable of of accomplishing that should any of any or all of those companies come forward so how do the commission members i mean and i i want to get to you as well same question um how does a commission members um get things past square one it really begins with the applicants um the commission can't review something that isn't before it so it really begins with the applicants notifying the agency that they intend to file an application and that is the signal if you will that the agency needs to budget staff accordingly and train so that we're ready as soon as those applicants file their application so we can conduct an efficient review but that's really the the starting signal if you will other than that we you know we have significant staff on board with expertise in these areas um it would simply be a matter of refining that expertise and and making sure we're adequately staffed thank you mr crowe thank you senator lemus um i agree with the premise of your question and and i would say that it's uh long overdue and being addressed both from our national security as well as a uh energy security standpoint um uh we have to do it we have to pursue this in a responsible way but do it quickly if we are going to uh you know position ourselves to really lead in the advanced nuclear technologies in reactor space we can't do it without a secure domestic supply of enriched fuel as necessary so to the extent that um you know i think that the commission will be should be willing and able and nimble in uh responding to any application that comes before it and my understanding is that the commission is working on um uh implementing a more iterative process with applicants uh for various for various um applications and i think that's a good way to expedite things and so i will look into this and i agree that it's of urgency thank you both for that response um and as you both know certain technologies for use in uranium ore processing are dual use remediation technologies they can not only be used in nrc regulated activities but remediation projects governed by other agencies like the epa so the nrc's determinations in regulating certain technologies would directly impact their use for remediation projects under other agencies will you work to inform yourselves and work with us on developing uh these dual purpose uh technologies going forward again addressing it to both of you thank you senator i'm i have actually toured several uranium production facilities in wyoming both in my former capacity but also as a commissioner so i'm i'm somewhat familiar with uranium production technology i'm not specifically familiar with the remediat remediation technology that you've mentioned but i would certainly look at that and and work with my colleagues to address that technology thank you mr crowe thank you senator i agree that there's some promising technologies out there and i think similar to the discussion earlier about how small modular reactors may help um with our waste profile by using spent fuel or or or reprocessing um we could do the same potentially through remediation on the uranium front i know this is of particular interest to senator kelly as well in his state um but i think it's the nrc's responsibility to be knowledgeable in these areas so that if something does come before the commission for approval that they can act quickly and responsibly well thank you both thanks for your willingness to serve and i agree senator this is something senator kelly and i will have in common that we can work with you on thank you thanks

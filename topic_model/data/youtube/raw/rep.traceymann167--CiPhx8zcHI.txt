mr beaker i want to take the opportunity today to speak directly on behalf of my constituents and their concerns each year i make a point to host a town hall in all 63 counties of the big first district because visiting with and listening to kansans who i've taken an oath to serve is one of the greatest joys of my work as a member of congress so far in 2022 i've hosted seven of these town halls and at each meeting i heard the same concerns echoed government spending labor shortages vaccine mandates and the next farm bill kansas believe that government spending is out of control and i agree with them one of our country's fastest growing expenses is just the interest payments on our national debt which is estimated to be two to 562 billion dollars for fiscal year 2021 alone you could fund the entire department of agriculture more than twice over for that amount given the situation this administration's spending as we've seen in the bloated buildback better plan is short-sighted and dangerous while discretionary government spending has weakened our great country and not only that spending on some programs during the pandemic has incentivized staying at home instead of returning to work kansas believe that labor shortages are hurting americans and i agree with them people can't find bus drivers to take their kids to school or sanitation workers to pick up their trash meanwhile inflation is at a 40-year high grocery store staples are up over 12 percent and people's essential goods like car parks and refrigerators are still stuck in cargo ships we're in an economic crisis and this administration has yet to act meaningfully to combat the effects kansas believe that vaccine mandates are unconstitutional and i agree with them anyone who wants to get a vaccine should be able to get one in this country but is not the federal government's job to dictate personal health care choices of american people vaccine mandates are a terrible idea for the present situation this country and they will only continue to strip the workforce of even more people kansas are also worried about the next farm bill particularly as it relates to crop insurance in the livestock indemnity program and i share these concerns the 2018 farm bill did not include any major changes to federal crop insurance which provides a robust and a strong safety net for farmers across the country i also want to ensure that the livestock indemnity program remains intact as it offered critical support to folks in my district after natural disasters like the recent wildfires that we saw last month farmers and producers are rightfully concerned that the 2023 farm bill could see significant changes however given that fact house democrats have held zero farm bill implementation hearings so far my goal is to do everything within my power for my constituents to ensure that no significant changes are made to reduce either of these essential components in the next farm bill the new year which has just begun brings with it a hope for change and growth if we've been dissatisfied with the course of our lives or that of our nation january ushers in a fresh start it gives us an opportunity to examine ourselves and to reassess our goals and ambitions most of all the new year reminds us of the greatest privileges we have living in a free nation where we have the right to life liberty and to pursue happiness as we see fit and as we get begin the second year of the 117th congress i want to reiterate my dedication to serving my constituents in the big first i'm fighting to preserve the foundation of our free nation and to protect your values kansas is still the pilot light of freedom for america and as long as it continues to burn i believe that our brightest days are yet to come and mr speaker i stand

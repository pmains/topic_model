hi i'm congresswoman marcia fudge please join me in celebrating hispanic heritage month our country takes pride in being called the melting pot a nation that was built by and for people from all over the world the fusion of foreign and native cultures has been mutually beneficial resulting in stronger education health care and agriculture industries to name a few democrats in the latino community are committed to providing access to exceptional public education affordable institutions of higher learning a fair living wage and quality health care for all people unfortunately many of my colleagues in the house block efforts to act on immigration reform and refuse to resolve the issue their actions or inaction have fallen short of american values of promoting cultural diversity it is time house republicans stop denying full economic participation to those who contribute so much to our communities it is time house republicans stop denying full civic participation to those who immigrated to our great nation to realize the american dream more than a year has passed since the senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation the house majority must stop playing politics with people's lives and work with democrats to provide a secure future for our friends and neighbors we cannot afford another year without action that will keep families together and make our nation prosperous thank you you

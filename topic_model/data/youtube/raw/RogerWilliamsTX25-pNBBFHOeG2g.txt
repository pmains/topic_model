to get a gentleman from Texas mr. Williams recognized for five Thank You mr. chairman and thank you chairman for being here today chairman we have become aware of NCUA policy of awarding on-the-spot bonuses and cash awards to employees cash bonuses of up to twenty five hundred dollars that can be paid to employees twice a year now for services and they get these for services going above and beyond the call of duty we've heard that the NCUA's HR department bragged actually bragged about pain over approximately 1.2 million dollars in these bonuses in 2014 frankly for just doing your job now from what I can see there appears to be little to no control over these payments any management give a cash award to anyone with as little as one paragraph justification we are told that this program has become commonplace within the agency so my question my first question is who approves these bonuses and what policies and controls are in place to manage the distribution of these casual rewards for the smaller ones the 250 dollar on the spot Awards it's the first level supervisor they can only give a certain budgeted amount each year so that is somewhat prescribed they can't just keep giving them they only have a certain number that they can give the larger it is the more sign-offs they need on it have you personally awarded such a bonuses to your staff yes and to whom and into what amounts that's a good question I believe I it's only money I I believe I awarded 25 hundred dollars my chief of staff who had not received the pay raise in five years a lot like the private sector I'm sorry much like the private sector that hadn't received any pay raises and I provided a cash award to my administrative assistant and I believe that was either a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars when was the last time he awarded one of these bonuses um it's probably a year ago okay now how about in 2015 how many on the spot bonuses or cash awards has have NCUA given out I don't know but it is well it's on our internal website we posted so our employees are aware of who's getting oh you're not sure how many went out I don't know I we as I said we have a total amount prescribed amount beyond which the agency can't go okay now correct me if I'm wrong but this is money that the credit unions give to you through fees I'm sorry this is money that the credit union gives to you and fees correct okay and for the purpose of supervision to ensure safety and soundness correct but I bet some of these credit unions would actually love to be lending out the money to their customers then rather than having some bureaucrat in Washington get a bonus for doing the just doing their job so what would you say to the credit unions that I have back in my district have quite a few what would you say to the credit union community about these bonuses i would say that their bonus is to people who are very hard to protect the safety and soundness of the deposits that they have in their credit union and that when people go above and beyond they deserve to be recognized so that we can retain our talented employees and you think the credit use would agree with you as opposed to having that money to loan out to small business owners like me I have no idea it might be a question you might want to ask him next time you meet well I'm sure they give bonuses to their employees as well their members monies finally since this hearing is focus on transparency would you provide this committee with a complete list of employees who receive these bonuses in 2014 and 2015 so that we can shed some light on the policy and learn more how it works sir would you do that for absolutely yeah appreciate mr. Chairman I yield back I thank you gentlemen

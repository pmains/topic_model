for five minutes uh thank you chairwoman for holding this really important hearing on a critical issue for our military and our young men and women um the the military goes to great lengths to instill a spree decor to instill culture among its ranks when i was a young enlisted soldier my career started when i was in the enlisted ranks as a private i remember going to basic training and the amount of time that was spent learning knowledge you were given this book and your told to memorize the army song army history the great battles in american history you memorize the ranks the command structure you know it's a reflection of the priorities of the force where you spend your time and instruction was broken down by the hour you know x number of hours on marksmanship x number of hours on physical fitness and where we spend our resources so with that in mind i'm concerned that our time and resources still do not adequately reflect the priority and the urgency of this issue um dr galbraith you said that within 14 days new recruits are informed about the program and then when they go to their advanced training they're provided quote additional information about the program so can you shed some additional light for me as to how many hours of instruction and how how many how much time is spent for these new recruits who get their first exposure to military culture and the priorities of our force uh to instill in them how critical this issue is i don't have that number on me because this is a service equity that they all execute just a bit differently but it is uh once again there's a substantial amount of time spent i just don't know what it is per service i would think you would want to know that i mean you are one of the top leaders in the program that's designed to instill accountability into our force and i understand that there are some disparities but this starts from day one and and i'm uh you know i'm dismayed to say the least that you don't know how much time and effort is spent uh instilling culture and priorities on our recruits from the first day they step off that bus right because when you get yelled at by the drill sergeant right it's a reflection of the priorities of the force but we're clearly not doing that with an issue of critical importance that goes to the esprit de corps the values the culture and the morality of our military so i want for the record to get that information from you and i want to know that this will remain a priority uh dr galbraith can you tell me how many of the sharp representatives throughout the force i believe at the gs level they start at the brigade level how many of those are women the vast majority of them are women i don't have the exact percentage of what the gender breakdown is but so so it's over 50 that is my understanding okay vast majority is all that you know okay again that's a number i would expect you to know because that's important because that's also a reflection of the priorities of our force and how we're allocating our resources and i would expect as a leader of this organization that you would have that information that you would know how many women are out there within our units actually addressing this issue the um the last part i'd a question i'd like to make is actually a dovetailing on the ranking member general kelly's comments about the impact of ncos because we've talked a lot about the officer corps and certainly you know the buck stops with the officers but the ncos are are critical i could not agree more with general kelly's comment that if you want to know what's going on in the barracks if you want to know what's going on during off hours on the weekend it's our sergeants our ncos that know what's going on within the units and i don't believe that we are adequately training and equipping the nco core uh through the nco development system and education system uh to lead on this issue so my last statement would actually be a request that we figure out a way to better equip the nco corps and use them uh as kind of our eyes and ears and tools on the front line to address this crisis so thank you madam chair i yield back i thank the gentleman

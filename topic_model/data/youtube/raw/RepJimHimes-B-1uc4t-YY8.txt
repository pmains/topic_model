Thank You mr. speaker Fingal for yielding I'd like to thank the Chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for the bipartisanship with which they have led this bill in which I think we will accomplish some very good things tomorrow the figures around this program speak for themselves the millions of lives saved the orphanages which are no longer full the many pregnant women who will not transmit a deadly virus to their children these things speak for themselves this is without question PEPFAR on the Global Fund one of the most effective foreign aid programs ever conceived in this chamber but Americans might ask in good faith why spend money in places like Africa and Asia and the Caribbean where then when the needs are so intense right here at home and the answer to that question could not be more clear Africa and Asia where PEPFAR in the Global Fund do the most good are areas of great instability but of great promise where countries like China are buying up commodities are exerting their influence are throwing their weight around we have the opportunity through the continuation of programs such as PEPFAR in the Global Fund to win for generations the hearts and minds of people who will think back on American assistance as the reason that their family had continuity as the reason that their country continue to develop so the question we're answering when we think about continuing these programs and our involvement and our taxpayer dollars should really be are we a country that offered the opportunity to continue to save lives will we do that do we want to save lives if we can do we want to be known just for our economic and military strengths or do we want to also be known as an unqualified force for good in this world i would say that at this point in our history our ability to say that it's not just about a military power but it is about a quality of Mercy that we all cherish that this is a wonderful opportunity for us to say who we are by supporting this legislation and I yield back the balance of my time

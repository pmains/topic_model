thank you very much Dina for that very kind thoughtful warm accurate honor to my colleague Mike Conway I see Jim here from the government I suspect there a few other members who's been serving on the house activity I know Jim and I got a number of conversations on this because of this issue he is a passionate about the issue of hundred and not only in our country but around the world and really what the scattering is not only celebrating the 65th anniversary of this remarkable food for Peace program that President Eisenhower signed into law in 1954 but also because it's about children it's about children and so by people around the world and where those of my colleagues who have had the opportunity to try to see what America is trying to do in terms of the constructive foreign policy we're reminded of the fact that the climate change famine and hunger sadly exists around the world notwithstanding our best efforts in this case this foot food for Peace program over 65 years you know I like to remind people I kind of collect facts and sometimes but 200 years ago the planet was estimated to be approximately about 1.7 billion people two hundred years later actually a couple of years ago we clicked seven billion people think about it two hundred years we've gone from one point seven seven billion plus and it's estimated by maybe the middle of this century that we could add another two billion people so with climate change with sea levels rising for those of us who come from an agricultural background as was noted I always tell folks food food is a national security issue I mean the majority of Americans obviously don't think of it that way as a matter fact I lament oftentimes that there's a real disconnection between the majority of Americans and where their food comes from I mean for the majority of Americans we've been very fortunate with spaces I think good customer grocery store are a restaurant I mean that's where they get their food right they don't understand the challenge of getting that food to grow that food and then to get that food places where people can use it every day for their nourishment because we cannot live without food as Mike noted in his experiences as chairman of the outside agricultural subcommittee on livestock and foreign agriculture and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee I think there's a a good nexus the the the subcommittee that I chair also has a addition of the food for Peace program we have a lot of differences in last year's farm bill and armwrestling the trend work about but I think there was a strong bipartisan agreement on the food for Peace program but let's think about it in different ways let's think about it as a global food security system a global food security system because that's what we're talking about and if we're going to have another two billion people on the planet and you know by the middle of this century or so and we're having climate change at sea levels rising the ability to create sustainable agriculture you know many parts of the world is one of our greatest challenges and and to add the water to make sure that you can have that sustainable food supply is critical we have a saying out where I live you know in California as we either have water snow and water then we can use or not enough but where the water flows food grills that's that's real that's true so this program brings I think together and and this is the exciting part all of what you're doing a unique cross-section of stakeholders and the program designs and plenty of mechanisms to really people try to provide a hand up and that's why I'm so proud to be a supporter of your reference you're where the rubber meets the road you make it happen folks like Jim and I and try to give you the resources to make sure you can you can make it happen and so you that my commitment to continue the fight for the food for Peace program is the subcommittee chair we haven't held a hearing in a while on this I think later this year I know my other colleagues will want to be there and as we talked about an agenda that really reflects your needs and where you think we can make it better in terms of our response to give you the tools you need let me give you some numbers again I like these the food for Peace program reached approximately last year 76 million people in 59 different countries I don't like that those numbers right right 76 million people in 59 countries including 68 million people with emergency assistance and Inc million people for development assistance but we can think about the size and the dimensions of this challenge we must do better it must have been because millions of people face hunger and food security on a daily basis on a daily basis even some here in our country sadly where we produce more than we can possibly consume but it all versi results in the same threats and that's the threats to those are most laudable children and their parents lives and livelihood and it also has if not a direct and indirect connection I believe to conflict in the world because you know there are ingredients that come together Kandra and we know that one of those ingredients to create conflict is spam and you see many of the war-torn areas around the world hunger is a part of the circumstance that those folks are dealing with so let me close by saying that the organizations that are represented here this afternoon we solution we commend you we thank you interaction action against hunger bread for the world care Catholic Relief Services food for the hungry The Hunger Project Mercy Corps Save the Children the World Food Program USA World Vision and others work on the ground to provide emergency food services a lot of times with our international partners and we have some tremendous international partners not only with the United Nations but European Union does a tremendous amount that makes a difference and we should thank them as well so the kind of crisis we know that that we need to be looking at long-term solutions and so let me close where I started off food is a national security issue food is a security issue around the world and I'm proud that this program does a significant part to deal with that but I believe we can do better and I think working together will put together a subcommittee hearing and you can tell us how we can figure out ways to do it better and all I want to do is say thank you thank you the bottom line heart keep up the good work [Applause]

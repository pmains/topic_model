in 2026 the year which most of the new Republican legislation tax legislation would start having an effect that's the first year in which all members of the baby boom generation including the younger the youngest will be eligible to jaw Social Security retirement benefits it's also the year was the oldest baby boomer will turn 80 so now what we're looking for is and I agree with the Reid and those who brought this up what are you going to cut in order to make up for what you've done it's pretty bad to listen to both sides well to start by cutting Social Security that's already been proposed Medicare Medicaid that's already been done so here we have Caddyshack - weekend at Bernie's - jaws the revenge the sequel is never as good as the original in this case in this case I sure hope this tax scam - is just as popular as the first one 34 percent popularity I can't imagine anyone in the movie business backing a sequel to such a flop consider the headline Fox News poll voters like Obamacare more than the GOP tax cuts even guys and gals on our side find that funny to even say that's right a majority of all Americans now prove the Affordable Care Act let that sink in a minute maybe that's why New Jersey Republican Leonard Lance last week called this new attempt an exercise in futility he's not the only one another headline from the week Republicans considered dropping second phase of tax cuts after the backlash of Seoul so why exactly are my friends on the other side bringing up this bill what problem is this tax bill trying to solve consider the original tax scam way back in January the GOP saw that corporate profits were at historic highs and they concluded not high enough we need to shower them with lavish tax breaks they came in they saw that the middle class families were struggling with health care housing costs and said let's make health insurance costlier let's make homeowners pay more taxes by eviscerating the individual mandate and capping the sauce reduction which goes back to the Civil War not the cold you're wrong and now they see how unpopular the first goal at the tax cuts were so let's do more the same but why would this time be any different Paul Ryan and the president said when they passed the tax scam that the average family's wages salary would go up by $4,000 he said it I didn't wages are down for most workers only about one percent of workers are getting a wage increase the Republicans only come up with four thousand based on the flawed assumption that workers would successfully bargain for a bigger share of profits from corporate productivity but that hasn't happened for 40 years Republicans have waged an all-out war on labor unions collective bargaining rights what power do workers at the bargain for a higher pay official data shows that workers wages are flat or even slightly down in real terms over the last year I have all backup information since you've asked me that a couple of times you want it well corporations reap historic profits their gains have not circled down to regular workers in fact this tax bill has only made it harder for them to get ahead companies aren't investing in employees or innovation and then line Trump tax cuts have no effect on most businesses hiring plans corporations are spending 101 times as much on shareholder bonuses as they are on workers bonuses and wages telling us the way telling workers to wait they didn't raise wages they simply passed the tax cuts by the US Treasury to the wealthy shareholder pockets I'm afraid the sequel is just more the same failed trickle-down economics that has never worked before in fact I'd rather go see weekend Bernie again then watch this and read this sequel we have real urgent problems facing working people in less time mrs. Gerard and I thank you for your indulgence de pesca I will

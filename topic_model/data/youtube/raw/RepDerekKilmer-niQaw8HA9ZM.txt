Thank You mr. swallow and thank you mr. speaker you know I grew up in a small town in washing the state that I now have the opportunity in the honor of representing my folks were schoolteachers my father actually this year is in his 50th year as a teacher in the classroom and the reality is I couldn't have gone to college if it hadn't been for the support of my community and the assistance of financial aid I got grants and I got loans that made the dream of college of reality and I had a community that had my back that literally passed the Hat by providing me with scholarships to help me fulfill my own dreams of a college education I believe that education is the door to opportunity and for a lot of families including mine financial aid is the key to that door but the reality is for too many families today that door is locked we've got work to do you know in 2013 Democrats and Republicans came together to pass legislation to protect student borrowers so that they can obtain low interest rates but our work isn't done we need to continue to have a commitment to quality and affordable education now that's why I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of a bill that would allow those with outstanding student loan debt to be able to refinance at the same low rate as new borrowers two and a half centuries ago benjamin franklin wrote an investment in knowledge pays the greatest interest i think that was true when he wrote it and i think it remains true today we know this you know not every student's going to go to college but we know that college is a door opener we know that we know that America's competitiveness depends on our ability to have a good skilled qualified workforce to have quality educational opportunities for our workforce we know that as educational attainment rises so do wages and so does employment levels we know that it is wiser to invest in education on the front end than it is to pay for prisons and unemployment on the back end and that to a large degree is a decision that we make as a country and as a society but that only were if we provide opportunities for students if we ensure that they don't drown in debt in our nation student loan debt debt now surpasses credit card debt you know we need to make sure that when young people graduate college they have an opportunity to join the workforce to start a business or to teach the next generation not simply to be bogged down with debt you know I get one of the coolest parts of this job is the opportunity to get to meet with young people to get me get to meet with college students and high school students get people who have a long runway ahead of them and you know I think about what I want for those students I think about what I want for my own kids I want them to be able to look at the future not with fear of of debt and fear of astronomical financial obligations but with hope for their future I know that the college education that I was afforded and the financial aid that I received that paid for that that college opportunity enabled me to live a lifetime that was filled with hope and so we've got work to do and I for one am committed to working with the good gentleman from California and others in this Congress hopefully from both sides of the aisle to address this opportunity and make sure that all young people and frankly all all who want to pursue educational opportunity see that door open to them if the gentleman from Washington will yield for a few questions you know I know there are a number of colleges in your district or around your district and when you talk to young people today and they're thinking about going to college how much are you hearing that the potential of debt is weighing on that decision you know I appreciate the question it is the main concern that we hear you know I was in a high school classroom just this last month and heard concerns from students who said I want to go to college I want to pursue that opportunity but I'm fearful that I won't be able to afford it and we've seen in my state and states all throughout this country that is States face difficult budget times two things happen one state support for our educational institutions got cut and and tuition rose and oftentimes a financial aid either from the institutions or from other sources didn't keep up with those increases in tuition so young people are concerned about that they recognize that further education is going to be really important for their chances of getting a good job again not every job requires a higher education but as we look at those fastest growing jobs in our economy more and more of those jobs require at least some post-secondary education and it is just young people that are concerned about it or what do you hear from their parents as far as what what the debt means if they've got a child who's just graduated college and is out there and the job market are you hearing from the parents as well certainly a huge concern every nearly every town hall meeting I have concerns around student loan debt and around access to affordable quality education comes up but but even outside of parents you know there are there are folks in my community who have unfortunately lost their jobs and want to go back to school I was at Olympic College in my district in Bremerton Washington and they are foundation had a luncheon that was to support students and their ability to pay for college and we heard from one of the students who was more mature student who had started her college career either sleeping in her car or sleeping in the student center and that for too many people is a reality these days we need to make sure that education is affordable that education is quality and that that that key that financial aid represents to that door of opportunity is available for everybody great I thank the gentleman from Washington and I look forward to seeing your good work across Washington and in this Congress to address this moral crisis of our generation thank you

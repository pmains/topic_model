the gentleman from Kentucky is recognized mr. Chairman I yield my time to mr. cloud from Texas Thank You mr. Massey I think a chairman for holding this committee meeting it's certainly an extremely important topic on the federal disaster recovery response including the 2017 hurricane season I have the honor of representing the 13 counties along the Texas Gulf Coast going from Bay City down on Oasis County which includes Corpus Christi of course as you know hurricane Harvey made landfall in my district at Rockport Texas and I do want to thank you first of all for the for the work that you've been doing to help us recover over the last few months we've been able to a number of grants have come in through have come through and it's really helping our district recover of course each disaster affords us the opportunity to evaluate and that's what this is about and I appreciate your comments at the beginning even in being proactive and a number of things want it to kind of tell you what I've been hearing is I've traveled the district of course the the the topics are broad I've tried to put them into three buckets that seem to be reoccurring of course each of them are interconnected and and related but housing has been an issue staffing with FEMA has been an issue and then seemingly wasteful and complicated processes I know that you're working internally to see what you can do about that I'm also interested to hear what you're doing internally but also what we need to do as legislative bodies to reform Stafford and free up your hands to to do what needs to be done also recognize that this is a team effort it requires communities being involved I think one of the successes we've seen while the process of recovery is ongoing in Texas has been the initiative that the people of Texas and communities and people across the country who've come and helped to participate neighbor helping neighbor churches getting involved communities being prepared and involved certainly there's a lot to be learned but but we're on the way to recovery because of some of those initiatives here's kind of what I hear when I'm touring and talking to people in our district there is a lot to be learned the the processes are pretty complicated and long if I were to we had one school district map out the process and if we were to lay it out across the table they have 54 55 projects themselves they were trying to track and so they created a map of it and the the process would would fill up that table it's it's that long and what happens often times or what I've heard over and over a number of times is you'll get to the end of the process and they'll be for example a tree that's not supposed to be in the in the process so it gets kicked back to the beginning and then by the time it gets back to the final part the staff has changed and they're reading using different parameters to evaluate and so there's something else wrong with it and so it goes back to the beginning of the process and so this this adds a lot of time it adds a lot of waste both internally for FEMA and to the people trying to recover I think it's important to remember that these people as they're trying to recover first of all they already had a job saying oh they had the new job of trying to fix their own house I think of in refugio the superintendent 80 to 90% of their kids were considered homeless so was the superintendent her husband who's the sheriff was also homeless and the Sheriff Department had been displaced so on top of that they're trying to learn what is this new full-time job of FEMA recovery in mastering these processes so that's the context that this is that this is in and so recurring staff was was a big issue I'm wondering one of the other issues that we heard when it when it came to housing for example was the issue of FEMA being able to share information with local governments for example FEMA goes in they survey the area they find out who the homeless were local entities county governments state governments are trying to help solve the problem and could not get the information that would be asked how many homeless people we have and were like we don't know we know FEMA knows but but they can't or won't tell us we know FEMA's designed to operate on a federal model what kind of information does FEMA share with local government entities is there anything we need to do to make that process better congressman thank you for the question there's there's a this could take a while to answer let's just start with housing I can't think of one disaster recovery housing mission in the history of FEMA that has lifted up as the gold standard and here's the problem I need more granting authority not me FEMA needs more granting authority to block grant funding down to a governor so that a governor can do housing the way he or she thinks that it would work best in his or her community not how FEMA thinks it works best you know we we tried something novel and innovative in the state of Texas with governor Abbott and I applaud his bravery for stepping up in the General Land Office for stepping up because just dragging in FEMA manufactured homes or travel trailers is incredibly expensive and there are there are some studies that suggest that one trailer by the time you buy it haul it install it get the permitting for landlord over it for 18 months then dispose of it properly haul it off could be anywhere between two and three hundred thousand dollars for one manufactured home why are we not being able to block grant that money directly to the citizen to do home construction to keep them in their house directly so even if we set a limit and what we tried to do was enter into an inner service agreement it was something innovative I didn't work as well as I had hoped it would work but you know what hit me all you know hit me for for trying something different we entered into this agreement and basically we were able if I remember correctly to provide sixty thousand dollars to those homeowners that wanted to take that option to do that direct construction imagine how much money we saved if we had to bring in those manufactured homes by doing that and we kept those folks in their house we've got to figure out more granting authority and become a block granting agency to push the money down to the GL o-- or to the governor's to be able to do housing the way that you want to do it disaster recovery housing is totally broken because it's solely on my shoulders there's no whole community effort in disaster housing and if a governor like Governor Abbott has to follow my big bulky bureaucratic recovery 2 CFR laws when it comes to doing housing then it's never gonna move that quick help me get rid of the complexity that's goal number three in our strategic plan I can tell you how to do that you know we're always looking to streamline the other problem with disaster recovery is there's this myth that FEMA is the only agency that does and provides Rida's astir recovery dollars in a disaster I believe that there's about 17 different agency pots of money that comes down from the whole host of the federal government and what we've never done is trained mayor's procurement officers financial officers at the local level or emergency managers on true disaster cost recovery FEMA has to graduate from this myth that we're a lights and sirens type agency you know what we do we're disaster financial recovery managers it's my job to come in and say governor here's what you're entitled to here's how the money comes from all these different agencies FEMA HUD SBA whatever it is here's how to use it in you know in in succession to do the greatest good but there's not one computer model they did I can provide anybody that says if you spend the money this way we will become resilient and we will never have to come back into your communities in Texas to do this again because we've used this money correctly and we factored in mitigation and we did it right that's the problem how do you streamline this there's too much of a time delay between FEMA's emergency housing and where HUD cdbg-dr funding can be used it's complicated it creates mistakes it's far greater than FEMA streamlining its processes it's how do we do this in a block grant format and allow governor's to control their own destiny take me out of the game gentleman yields back the gentleman from

mr speaker today i rise in support of the rule in favor of the allies act this bill would protect our afghan partners who risked their lives as translators and navigators to u.s military personnel by expediting the afghan special immigrant visa process and approving an additional 8 000 visas so they can come to america as soon as possible the withdrawal of u.s troops from afghanistan has placed thousands of these allies and their families at risk of retribution if not for the contributions of these afghan partners the united states military losses could have been greater than already endured during this prolonged conflict for 20 years their courage and sacrifice protected our troops and we're an invaluable asset to our forces in afghanistan we have a duty to ensure both they and their families are safe from retaliation from the taliban and other terrorist organizations in my district of rochester new york my office hears multiple times per week from siv advocates like keeping our promise and the association of wartime allies the stories they share are heartbreaking brave men and women stuck in bureaucratic limbo waiting for the visa they were promised so they can start a new life in america we need to pass this bill and honor the promise we made to our allies if we leave these people behind who will ever be willing to assist u.s forces around the world knowing that we lack the moral resolve to protect our allies that's not what we stand for the united states leads from the front now is the time to take charge of the situation and ensure we keep our promise and leave no one behind i urge my colleagues to support the rule and pass h.r 3985 with that i yield back to my distinguished friend

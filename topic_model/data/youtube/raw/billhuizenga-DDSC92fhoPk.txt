well thank you I'd like to thank my fellow subcommittee chairman for working with me to protect the state-based insurance regulatory model has served our nation so well for a hundred and fifty years into my colleague from New York I'm very comfortable with this bill and the underlying philosophy that that has brought us here because mr. speaker I'm a former state representative in the Michigan Legislature and I know firsthand that Michigan does a better job of protecting policyholders within their borders than the federal government does or could even more so Michigan certainly knows how to maintain a robust insurance marketplace that works for Michigan customers but additionally michigan serves as an entry point for several foreign companies who then come into the US market however there are bureaucrats in Washington who believe that they know best the dodd-frank act significantly expanded the federal government's role in the insurance marketplace by creating the federal insurance office and charging the director with representing the US during the negotiation of international agreements at the same time the dodd-frank act changed domestic insurance regulation which also led to the changes in u.s. participation at the International Association of Insurance supervisors or IA is the AIS develops international insurance regulations for it's a hundred and ninety jurisdictions in more than 140 countries that to then adopt those I'm concerned that this could influence the u.s. to replace the state-based insurance regulatory model with international standards that were created by unelected European bureaucrats mr. speaker our states are as Justice Brandeis so eloquently coined quote laboratories of democracy and in his words that means that a state may if its citizens choose serve as a laboratory and try novel social and economic experiments without the risk to the rest of the country end quote I can't think of a better example of a successful experiment than the state-based insurance regulatory system especially in my home state of Michigan that's why the protections provided in the transparent insurance Standards Act are so vitally important the straightforward bill simply gives the states and Congress the opportunity to comment any international insurance standard before it may be adopted and I urge my my colleagues to join me in support of this very very important bill and support our system that has existed for 150 years and with that I yield back gentleman

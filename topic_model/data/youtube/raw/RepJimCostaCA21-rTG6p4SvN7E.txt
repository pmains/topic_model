madam speaker i rise today to bring attention to the increased cost of building materials creating an affordability crisis for housing in america this is in part because of the kova 19 pandemic has played a significant role in harming our country's supply of lumber and building materials but in addition tariffs with canada along with long-term reductions of domestic timber harvesting have exacerbated the price increases according to the national home association prices of materials to build housings like oriental strand boards are up more than 400 percent since last spring the average price of lumber is quadrupled this supply cost has increased across the price of a new house a new single-family home up to nearly forty thousand dollars per unit i urge congress in the mind administration take action to address the lumber supply chain such as increasing domestic harvesting of timber and negotiating new lumber agreements with canada this is a way we can effectively reduce the cost of housing we need to build more housing

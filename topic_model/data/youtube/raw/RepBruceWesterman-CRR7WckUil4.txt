is Grady Trimble thank you for more on all of this economic uncertainty under the Biden Administration let's Welcome House natural resources committee ranking member Congressman Bruce Westerman along with former U.S treasury official Michael falkender let's start with you congressman and talk about the 20 states that are helping folks deal with inflation which certainly has not been transitory and actually has really hit the bach books of a lot of people now states have to write these checks or give some sort of break to Residents and essentially it's more handouts it's more stimulus while we're combating 7.7 inflation yeah well good evening Jackie good to be with you and we're getting into you know what old programmers used to call a continuous do Loop we've got inflation because we put too much government money into an overheated economy and the solution now is to put more government money into the economy so this isn't the solution to lowering inflation the solution is to increase Supply chains so that we've got more products out there and we're not putting undue pressure on a stress supply chain side now we have to stop bite from Jerome Powell where he's talking about inflation I want to listen to it because the words are really important we have a risk management balance to strike and we think that slowing down at this point is a good way to balance the risks the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting it is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy so Michael the market got very excited about the first part of this statement that maybe he could start not raising rates as much as he has been as soon as December but the second part of this I think is really important when he says restoring price stability will require holding interest rates at a restrictive level for some time I mean we're still in for rate hikes here we are in the confusion from chairman Powell continues because on the one hand he wants to talk tough because he was so late to starting to raise interest rates and curb inflation blaming it instead on transitory factors that now he's behind he doesn't want the economy to tank by having it go into a recession but at the same time he wants to send a message that he's going to be firm on on prices you know the other thing Jackie that I would point out that's that's a little bit frustrating about his remarks yesterday is that he said that only the FED is taking the lead on dealing with the labor shortages and as the congressman just mentioned there's also a role for the administration in Congress to play in relaxing some of these Supply constraints so that we're not solely reliant on monetary policy to bring inflation down right no that that's an excellent point but Jerome Powell did say back in the late summer in Jackson Hole that he was going to raise rates and he was going to definitely anticipate that the labor market would slow and there's a new survey out from Challenger gray and Christmas we could put that screen up you can see the layoffs are starting to add up here and that's what I've been talking about with respect to a cooling economy and this Administration keeps saying but the labor market is fine you start to add these numbers together most of them in the tech sector and you realize that they're adding up significantly and 2023 congressman is going to be brutal for a lot of people meantime you add to this 433 dollars per month year over year that's according to Moody's what inflation is costing the average American right now yeah and it's uh it's an untenable situation when you've got inflation and you're seeing a weakening job market you know we saw that the the new unemployment claims actually decreased but the continual on an employment uh claims grew this past week uh to a high that we haven't seen since February so there are signs out there that the uh the labor market is is weakening and it still doesn't add up to me Jackie this is a mystery and maybe somebody much smarter can figure this out but every employer that I've talked to back home and across the country tells me that they cannot find people to work yeah they've got jobs that they can't fill yet you're seeing continued unemployment claims growth so and lower yeah I mean I've studied this extensively I'm not sure I have the right answer but what it seems like is people are getting laid off yes those are people that were in the workforce gainfully employed um the labor force participation rate is going down because when you look at that map where we showed 20 states of people getting additional benefits of of uh to help them combat inflation but also of course this is an Administration that's spent a lot more to help people overall they say you know why should I go to work why should I bother if I stay home long enough they'll just they'll send me another check Michael right well that's exactly the problem is that all of this Federal money largely that was sent out did not have work requirements associated with it and so as you were saying we're seeing labor force participation rate last month in the jobs report declined we're waiting to see what tomorrow's report is going to provide us with but when you have people sitting on enough money from all of the excessive government stimulus checks that have been sent out now they're getting them from the states there's less work to go fill all of those job openings that are out there so we've got work we've got employers that are looking for jobs the the joltz report earlier this week said we're still above 10 million job openings and yet they can't find enough workers and this is where Congress I hope the next Congress reimposes job requirements for receiving federal aid in many of these programs yeah I know it's it's an excellent point and in the last moment that we have left Congressman if I can just ask you about the Railroad Strike which was averted house passed the bill yesterday Senate approved today those additional paid sick leave days not included but this would have been a huge colossal problem for the Biden Administration in this current environment when they said that they pretty much had it all wrapped up everything was fine and yet at the last minute they say we need Congress to step in and I think this is a bad precedent Jackie you've got a group that was literally holding the American economy hostage it was so bad that the hostages became sympathetic towards the hostage takers and everybody was born in Congress to uh to bail out the situation to approve an agreement that should have been worked out between the employees and the companies and it shows the failure of the Biden Administration to deal with an issue that he claims to be an expert in and that's that's labor issues yeah no that's an excellent point he certainly does and it's ironic to say the least Congressman Bruce Westerman Michael falkender great to see you both thank you so much for your time thank you all right the Supreme Court

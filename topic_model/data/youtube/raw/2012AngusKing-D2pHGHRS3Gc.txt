I'm announcing tonight that I'm a candidate for the United States set I agonized over this question the last three or four days is anybody who knows me can tell you and the basic question that I asked myself was can I do anything can I make a difference particularly as an independent in an organization that's set up around parties because i don't i don't want to go down there I don't want to just I don't want to be a senator I've done the trooper thing you know and the good parking although that's pretty cool but I want to do something as a senator now i remember in 1994 when there were articles and people saying you can't be a governor as an independent you'll never work you got to both parties in the legislature nothing's going to happen you know i can remember there were articles there's a big headline in the portland paper can an independent govern and guess who they interviewed for that story leaders of the parties what do you think they said hell no well i think we proved that wrong we proved that by civility common sense building bridges working with coalition's working with people individually one issue at a time we could get something done I don't have any illusions that it's easy in Washington that one guy for Maine is going to be able to turn the whole thing around but you know you got to start somewhere and my conclusion is that there's a reasonable chance that I can make it and if we go the way we usually go and send down a member of one of the parties there's no chance it will change and I think that's where we are today let's turn the question around if a person as capable and hardworking and experience with the sea ard and the character and the intelligence of olympia snowe left because she couldn't get anything done and it seems to me you've got to try something else we've got to try something else in a closely divided Senate I can be a broker for common sense in a sea of partisan anger I can be a voice for civility in a national debate that's largely been taken over by the extremes and i forgot the head i forgot to bring the Sunday paper remember the headline that said extremes taking over Congress I can speak for the middle the people who don't and this has been my universal experience in Maine people don't care who gets the credit they don't care which party passed the bill they just want the problem solved and I believe they desperately want to get back to a place in America where they can trust the government again or they can trust the government to look out for their interests the people's interest the people in my low and in Bangor nin York and Umbridge dit in Lewiston and frankly I think I might scare him and that would be a good thing because man would be sending a message that if they don't get their act together other states and other communities are going to be sending more people like me that would be their worst nightmare and instead of looking over their shoulders which is what they do now to the right or the left depending on which party maybe they'll look toward the middle and say how about all those people out there how about all the people in America that need these problems solved there's a wonderful story about EDD muskies first couple of weeks in the US Senate Lyndon Johnson who was the majority leader came up to him and said Ed when they want you to vote don't tell him how you're going to vote keep that vote to yourself tell him you'll get you'll get their vote when they get to the m's in the alphabet you know then you're your own man ad can't you hear Johnson so about two weeks later there's some kind of procedural vote and and Lyndon goes up to muskie and says ed oh I got your support on this one don't I and musky says senator he says this to the most powerful majority leader in the history the United States Senate senator they haven't gotten to the m's yet I want to be that guy they haven't gotten to the cage yet because now is Olympia Olympia sub statement on Friday was extraordinary she said we've essentially become like a parliamentary system where every vote in the Senate is a party-line vote and you've got to vote with the party no matter what the leader tells you how to vote and that's what you do why would you want it why would I want to leave main on a Sunday night and leave Mary and the kids and go to Washington and report into Harry Reid or mitch mcconnell on monday morning doesn't work here's the way I feel nobody will be able to tell me how to vote except the people of Maine by the way here's a prediction as I mentioned there will be stories about that will all quote political insider saying Kenneth Kenneth Independent Senator get anything done and they're all going to say no just predicting that they'll be in the next two or three days for this reason this is going to be a tough campaign because if you don't think the parties don't like each other much wait till they get a load of me they'll dissect everything I've ever written they'll go over my record as governor with a fine-tooth comb but you know that's okay I thought about it you know it gives you a little you say oh eight years man a lot of decisions then I thought about it and I said I'm not worried about that you know why I'm not kidding you every decision I made I made trying to think what was best for me wasn't always right particularly a 20-20 hindsight but I don't have any apologies to make because I know what I was trying to do I was trying to do my best and I was trying to call them as I see him by the way that may be a bumper sticker I call them as I see them that's my political philosophy in one phrase the campaign's going to unfold we'll talk about issues education the deficit economy energy dozens more I'll have answers that some of you will like some of you won't they won't satisfy both sides but they'll be the best I can do based on my own best judgment and the judgment of the people of Maine but the real issue in this campaign this isn't a me this is this is an extraordinary moment because we have a opportunity here you and I do something very unusual in American history the real issue is the system itself and whether we can start start right here in Maine right now tonight a movement toward a Senate that's focused on policy and not politics common ground instead of confrontation if you like the system as it is I'm not your guy if you want a shot a shot at changing it I hope you'll join me and finally I'm not running against anybody not running against anybody I'm running for something I'm running for a government that works that can solve the problems that the people of Maine so desperately need attending to and for that reason because i'm running for and not against you will not see a single negative ad come out of this campaign and I can't close without talking a bit about money one of the reasons our system is so messed up his money and as if it wasn't bad enough a year ago the united states supreme court issued its decision in the Citizens United case which is the worst decision of the United States Supreme Court says Dred Scott it's based upon the hilarious premise that someone can give you millions and millions and millions of dollars and there's no quid pro quo there's no influence it would be humorous if it wasn't so serious and that's one of the issues that we have to address now as luck would have it last week when I was wrestling with this in our class here at Bowden we were discussing Joshua Chamberlain on Tuesday and on Thursday and we learned a lot from Joshua Chandra there's a lot to learn we learned about courage and honor about perseverance and hard work the main thing we learned from Joshua Chamberlain is that when the circumstances are tough when the odds are long when the opportunities appear unobtainable when the moment comes you don't equivocate if you don't deny and you don't retreat Chamberlain gave us one piece of advice charge and that's exactly what I intend to do

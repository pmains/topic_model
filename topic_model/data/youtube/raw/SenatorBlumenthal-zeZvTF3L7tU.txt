sometimes when you listen to the news and you listen to some of these other politicians that they seem a little bit confused about what I'm saying we are going to continue producing oil and gas at a record pace that's got to be part of what we do but an energy strategy that focuses only on drilling and not on an energy strategy that will free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil that's a losing strategy that's not a strategy I'm going to pursue well that was the president today talking about his all-of-the-above energy strategy and also calling out Republicans for their repeated claims that their drill baby drill in rhetoric will lower gas prices we've said time and time again more domestic production does not mean lower gas prices and in fact a new report today by the Associated Press shows just that over the last 30 years even has u.s. drilling has gone up gas prices have not gone down now many believe that Wall Street speculators have a lot to do with the high prices so today there were a group there was a group of US Senators introducing legislation to get the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that's the CFTC which is a presidential presidentially appointed board getting them to limit oil speculation that bill would set a 14-day deadline for the Commission the CFTC to implement rules that are laid out in the previously passed dodd-frank act that requires regulation of these speculators in the head of the CFTC whose name is Bart Chilton said one of the members said that his commission should consider asking another body the financial stability Oversight Council to finish regular regulation that would help define the rules and this is what Chilton said I realize this is a highly unusual and perhaps incendiary move but we have a responsibility to act and it's high time we did so to protect markets and consumers and of course how he wants to act is kick it to another body I joining me now is one of the five senators who introduced the legislation to crack down on oil speculators Senator Richard Blumenthal the Democrat of Connecticut and he's joining us from Washington senator thanks for joining us we actually had senator Bernie Sanders on a couple of weeks ago about this subject but the the actual introduction of the bill was today it was today and the reason for it is very simply that the markets are not working and in fact talking about drilling the one reason why drilling is not the answer at least right now is that the markets supply and demand simply or not we have more supply now than a year ago and we have less demand lower consumption but prices are much higher and the reason is that we have speculation in the markets traders hedge funds betting on the prices going up gambling and at the same time earning profits when there is a rise in prices from higher prices at the pump that we pay so our bill very simply cutting through the agency acronyms the CFP c and the interagency this and that is basically to tell the agency that has responsibility and hasn't been doing its job that it has to use the emergency powers that it should exercise to restrain speculation impose limits on how much anyone can buy in those futures markets and here's the most telling statistic for me Jennifer and you know about this stuff because you've been an attorney general you've been a governor the amount of future contracts are controlled eighty percent or more of them by people who don't take delivery of the product in other words they're not the airline to the trucker's their people don't take delivery when you see people those are the speculators but they're really Wall Street firms like what Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley there are their entities like that right exactly right there on Wall Street they don't necessarily have to be all them located on Wall Street but they are dealing through Wall Street tactics and really speculating on and exploiting the kinds of international factors that cause fear and apprehension whether it's closing the Straits of Hormuz or Iranian shutdowns of their oil products but the point is that if the markets were working that exploitation wouldn't work and that's the reason that we need the Commission to exercise its powers now the Commission already has this powers it was passed in the dodd-frank bill it was supposed to have taken effect you know a year ago and they were supposed to have drafted the rules that would limit this they'd ret took a draft and they've done that right and then they kick it over to the Securities and Exchange Commission who's supposed to do something else but in the meantime all of these speculators filed a lawsuit right to prevent these these rules from taking effect what does your bill due to be able to circumvent the lawsuit that the lobbyists for the investment community filed the lawsuit was against the Commodities Futures Trading Commission saying that it could not impose this rule position limits which basically say that speculators can't corner the market can't in effect exercise their financial powers and we circumvent it I wouldn't say circumvent in any improper way but we use a different section of the statute that says use the emergency powers which gives the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation curb excessive speculation to make sure that the kinds of market manipulation taking place will not have an effect and I've asked for another move as well and that is for the United States Department of Justice to investigate any price fixing price gouging any of the illegalities using its subpoena power compelling witnesses as well as documents and maybe even using a grand jury if there is evidence of illegality yeah the so the Shin that you took today is going to be I mean if it's in fact passed by the Senate I don't know d a bipartisan support on it or do you have Republicans who are resisting we don't have bipartisan support and I'm hopeful that we will here's an issue where more than any other people ought to recognize we have a bipartisan common interest and where we should be getting together part of my frustration as you know I'm in my first year plus as a united states senator having served as Attorney General for 20 years working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle just as you did and you have to do it if you're governor or Attorney General here's a common problem that we should address noting and acting on our common interest yet much more in common than conflict and I'm hopeful that we will have bipartisan support as part of the all-of-the-above strategy a part of that all of the above strategy to bring down oil prices and to make ourselves energy independent would be ensuring that speculation isn't driving up the price at the pump my you know the the CFTC is appointed by or two of the members at least have been appointed by the President and the other bodies as well how quickly could something like this happen if they use their emergency powers they could do it really in a matter of days possibly weeks but a very very short period of time in my view they could issue it literally within days and it would have a tangible effect let's face it if the markets get the message that the administration is not going to tolerate speculation or the CFTC will come down on the speculators if the Department of Justice were to begin investigating that message would have an immediate effect and you know there's a real point to what the president said he's right we need all of the above and cracking down on speculation has to be one of the above otherwise none of the above will work if the markets don't work all of the drilling all of the renewables all of the other means that the president quite rightly let's use will not effect because the markets are key to a successful effort to fairly gauge prices well Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal thank you so much for joining us in the warm it's really great great to see you again up next Republicans like to trumpet themselves as the protectors of personal freedom it's a particularly disingenuous can't claim when it comes to voting rights and we'll talk about that next and later brett erlich has finally found something that he and mitt romney have in common coming up Mitt Romney whips out the pythons the monty python's don't go away you

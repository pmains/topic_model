Thank You mr. chairman for holding this committee meeting mr. Buchanan how many federal loan repayment plans are there today well that's a complicated question because for every bar the amount of repayment plans that they are have eligibility for varies based upon when they took out those loans wellyou're they graduated and when Congress gives and takes away repayment plans but in all in including forbearance is deferments five different flavors of income based repayment there are more than 55 repayment options that are available to any given borrower at a particular time and so as I said some bars may not have access to all of them and that's the complexity of the federal student loan program if you ask what particular borrower has access to what loan repayment options there's a whole laundry list of questions that have to be asked and assess before you could even determine which of those 55 are on the short list of things they could turn to I do do any of the applications for the loans ask the student how they plan to repay them in the master promissory note I'm not familiar I'd have to look at that so on the front end which is the part of Education originates these loans and as the lender so they handle all that loan disclosure or up front for originating the loans but my knowledge I don't know that that I don't know that that's specifically called out but I could be wrong if if a student wanted to pursue a PhD in primitive basket-weaving where along the process would somebody tell them that it's highly unlikely they'd be able to look repay the loan well one would hope that that communication came before choosing to take that degree and and and moving forward that's really an opportunity for and again this is not an area that we're involved because this all happens long before the borrower comes to us they've already made those choices and decisions and have gotten and hopefully graduated into the job market place but that's probably where from a front-end perspective as the lender the government should look at what is its level of disclosure and communication into a borrower schools should probably be playing a role in that in that conversation and I think that's also a great opportunity for States and others to participate with with individuals in their jurisdictions and be part of that education process the end of I think what we're all trying to do was help people make informed and better decisions right and and we'd love them to make informed better decisions became before they came to the servicing side where we have to in essence deal with those choices that have been made and try to put them on the best path that is available under the federal law but I think working together whether it's Congress schools the Department of Education and states and families on being informed about making good decisions before they take on debt I think that would be very helpful well does anyone know where it's mandated that the various parties that mr. Buchanan mentioned are actually obligated to help students make intelligent decisions about how much they're gonna borrow and be able to repay I don't believe that that servicers are expected to advise borrowers about how much to borrow when they're in school I think a lot of what we're speaking to from the borrower experience is that the cost of attending college increases in repayment due to service or error and misconduct I've seen borrowers who borrowed $6,000 to go to school wind up with six figures of debt because of servicing errors forbearances default and issues with staying getting into income driven repayment after years of struggling can make a balance balloon even after the initial borrow it sounds like we need to require a financial literacy test or at least a course before somebody's allowed to apply for a student loan mr. chairman I'd like to yield the remainder of my time at the ranking member thank you for yielding

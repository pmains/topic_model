Senator Bill Hagerty joins us now in Tennessee big Tech is a big part of his spoke about his Focus but first Senator thanks for joining us it's great to be back with you Brian thank you so Senator I want to get to Big Tech obviously there's no hotter topic or more worthy of newsworthy Topic in the country but what did you think of President Biden's speech what did you get for the 64 minutes well you know I was there in the chamber locked down uh it really was a bad Visual and watched it open up as President Biden took credit for a rebound in our economy and I'm sitting there thinking it's only possible because of the policies that President Trump been put in place in operation warp speed but again he took credit for somebody else's work we've heard this before for President Biden going all the way back to his days in school that's plagiarism by any other term but it was just then a Litany of one crisis after the other yet he didn't talk about the Border crisis which is the biggest crisis we face right now till the very end of his speech and he said well if we believe that's a crisis then we're going to have to vote for his bill for amnesty I mean it was just pathetic and he built this as a blue-collar blueprint what it was it was a blue-collar jobs killer first I want to bring you to immigration you just brought us immigration so here's what President Biden said about immigration cutting for more than 30 years politicians have talked about immigration reform and we've done nothing about it it's time to fix it on day one of my presidency I kept my commitments in a comprehensive immigration building the United States Congress if you believe we need to secure the Border pass it because it has a lot of money for High-Tech border security if you believe in a pathway to citizenship pass it it's over 11 million undocumented folks the vast majority of here overstaying visas it says he was running out of gas there but yes well so why not pass it it sounds great listen what this is going to do is create even more incentive for chaos at the border because he's talking about amnesty and he rolls right from that into his conversation about uh about voting rights so I think it's pretty clear they're just trying to create a turnstile at the border and as they process people as rapidly as they can and dump them into the interior of the United States they're making every town a Border Town in America no question he mentions if you want border security we have high-tech border money what are you talking about we've already paid for a wall to be built a fence whatever you want to call it do whatever is politically uh possible for Joe Biden to do say the money's already there we're paying people not to work that's what happens when you break the contract and the Wall's been made so if he was serious he knows this issue backwards and forwards secure the Border first so Republicans are never going to pay attention nor should they I think it's encouraging that Senator Mark Kelly is pointing out the crisis at the border that the administration is ignoring he knows he's not getting reelected unless they fix it for Arizona correct that's absolutely right and to see you know President Biden talking in this manner there's something called the impoundment ACT Brian what Biden has done is actually violated the impoundment ACT uh the Congress has already appropriated the funds for that wall to be built it's not the executive Branch's role to come in and undo that I mean we saw president Trump go through an impeachment trial because because of just that thing regarding funds to the Ukraine president Trump was accused of holding that up Biden is holding up the funds to Build That Wall we need it now more than ever he's proving that and instead it's interesting Mark Kelly's even acknowledging that in Arizona because he will never get reelected if if this crisis continues but this is a crisis of Biden's own making but I think there's a lot of intent to it again because he's trying to flood the nation uh and and really change the shape of America Sarah there's another story uh that I think is a pretty big deal is if you look at Senator Warnock and shocking the world and winning by a couple of points uh in that election to get that seat for two more years he's going to be up in 2022. where's the Republican challenge here a lot of people wondering why Republicans don't see that as an opportunity to take back the Senate I think it's a huge opportunity to take the Senate back and I know that Tim Scott I'm sorry the Rick Scott I was just thinking about Tim because the piece you just played Tim by the way did a great job last night but Senator Rick Scott has been working very hard to put the pieces in place to retake not only George but several other seats and we're going to have to put a full court press on in that state great candidates are are possible we just got to get them to come out and and be ready to run against Warnock I think Warnock is very vulnerable and I think we ought to be able to win that season do you think that Herschel Walker is a viable candidate I think he's polling great right now um I think if Herschel Walker decides to get into the race uh he'd be formidable I don't know what he's you know where his mind is today about that but uh I know the polls say that he could be extremely extremely formidable Senator just to play into what you're talking about you want to say goodbye to section 230 that gives all these big tech companies protections they don't deserve uh there's some perils with that though if they say they've got to be sued maybe they're not going to put in anything that could possibly get them sued therefore not getting access to anybody that they deem dangerous but having said that the latest reason why I think you have to pass something is Donald Trump did an interview with Dan bongino do you know they would not post that interview on YouTube the former president of the United States arguably the most famous person in the world it's amazing they'll press the important leader in America and the one of the most famous people in the world as you say Brian yet they will continue to allow Ayatollah Khomeini to post on their networks uh how how to death to Israel and how to go about doing it you know they'll they'll allow the New York Post article on Hunter Biden to be taken down I mean this is out of control and it needs to be addressed as you say and that's why I introduced my 21st century Free Speech act to combat this censorship by big Tech so tell me where to sound how it reads well what it does in the first instance is it eliminates section 230. what it does is looks at these companies as what they are today they are functioning like common carriers we regulate telephone companies we regulate uh you know railroads what we want to make certain of is that this modern day Public Square becomes more accountable to the public and allows equal access to all Americans a non-discriminatory access and it prohibits these entities from censoring using their own political bias so what uh you know I think the most egregious example is the hunter Biden Story and there's no no Planet no era is that not a story in America and they decided to take it down and if you're going to try to retweeted it they would uh their cut their their account will be suspended and then they said oops I'm sorry I apologize but the election was over by the time they apologized so for that for you is that when the rubber hit the road oh that was just amazing but I tell you you know I spent them in my my prior job before coming to the United States Senate I was the United States ambassador to Japan and I dealt every day with uh China what they were doing there this is more something you would expect from the Chinese Communist Party suppressing their citizens that'd be coming from Silicon Valley so indeed I think that that this this has been the breaking point the 2020 election and the involvement of these big tech companies in a way that uh really showed their political bias and their aggressiveness uh this is this is something that the American public realizes they appreciate they want to see action taken and I'm ready to do it so are you worried about taking away the protections that 230 allows will make them so cautious they'll decide that Republican speech is too dangerous to publish I think the best thing for them to do is step back and to allow uh the American people to decide what they want to learn they also need to to the the standards that they have today are extremely opaque I think they make it up as they go along depending on how the political ones shift again I I'm loathe to look for regulation is the solution to anything Brian but when you have entities like these private entities evolve into what really has become the modern day Public Square they really do look like common carriers Justice Thomas made this point clear in a recent opinion and I was inspired by that opinion and I thought you know this is the right approach Senator Bill Hagerty with us and Senator excuse tell me who's on the bill with you have any Democrats express interest we we have not put the bill forward to bring a lot of to to bring other Senators on it at this point we've just introduced it Democrats have privately expressed interest to me we'll see if we'll be able to get them on the bill and really move it forward but I think Democrats have the same concern that Republicans do they know that the tide can turn as quickly as it does and they'll wind up becoming the victim of censorship just as easily but there's almost no examples including of LeBron James who said you're next to a cop of Democrats and liberals or Hollywood stars being suspended can you give me an example there's no there's no motivation for Democrats to help you with this they've certainly benefited from it so far you're exactly right about that and again that shows the political bias that's rampant but the danger is there and I hope that I'll be able to persuade some of my Democrat colleagues to look beyond the immediate benefit that they have and think about our nation and to think about what's best for America and to really preserve the First Amendment and the freedom of speech that we all say that we support yet we see it you know trampled on every day by some of these big tech companies that decide to vaguely censor what we're saying another example what's happened in the global Community Facebook temporarily hit posts calling for the resignation of Indian Prime Minister Modi marking the platform's latest foray into a series of controversial decisions affecting free speech in this country but now beyond our borders I mean what the heck are they doing well I think what they're doing is building if they've got problems here in America India is a much more populous country than America I've had the benefit of meeting Prime Minister Modi I know he's very popular in India and and there are folks that feel differently though and the ability to express your Viewpoint your opinion I mean India builds itself is democracy as well and this Cuts against democratic ideals in that Nation just as it does here Senator how close is Tennessee to opening we are almost back in business Brian I mean what President Biden should have thought about last night uh what he called a blue-collar blueprint really was a blue-collar jobs killer he had a look at States like Tennessee you know we've become extremely successful I was part of that I was the Commerce Secretary when we came out of the last recession and what we've done is have low taxes you know regulations that are actually friendly and conducive to business we've created a climate in Tennessee that is positive for business and what's happened we've seen our jobs grow our wages grow we're one of the top performing Nations excuse me top performing states in the nation and people are moving from Blue states to Tennessee because of that instead of talking about raising taxes on America and killing jobs President Biden ought to look like exam look at examples like Tennessee and say that's the path that's the blueprint that we need can we drink without eating and can I stand at a bar on Broadway in Nashville absolutely can Brian you absolutely can I look forward to welcoming you back because we are open for business against Tennessee I have to I don't have to order food as of this week but I'm allowed am I allowed do we are we allowed to stand at a bar in New York do you know Allison Eric no then we're gonna have to go to Tennessee and stand you're gonna have to come to Tennessee and you're more than welcome Senator Hagerty good luck you got to get this thing passed okay thank you Brian appreciate your help you got it Senator Hagerty and Tennessee

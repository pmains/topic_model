joining us now to discuss what we should be looking for and a leader is the senator from the great state of South Carolina Tim Scott little known fact I think your mother wanted you to be a preacher I wanted you to run for governor I'm not sure where you wound up in the Senate right uh with about you know 60 something percent of the vote a couple weeks ago I've forgiven you but I'm not sure your mom has uh you've become a household name in your own right but I want to ask you so you are a leader but what are you looking for in other leaders what are the qualities you want to see you know Trey thank you for the question number one and I hope everybody had a Happy Thanksgiving truth is faith in the future gives us power in the present if we're looking for leadership we want leadership that has a vision on who this country is going to be and how we're going to get there there are a few things that we need to see within leadership the first is optimism we have to believe that the best is yet to come and then show people how to get there one of the things I've been blessed with is a miserable start in life I say a blessing because now when I look back I know that all things are possible because we are Americans America we are always a solution we are never the problem so the second thing I'm looking for in leadership is understanding that the key to our success the key to Victory is not politics it's not the government it's education education is the closest thing in America to Magic so how do you get a good education you make sure that every single kid and every single zip code is empowered with that powerful ingredient of Education which means that the parent needs to have a choice and it gives every single child a chance individual liberty and economic dominance a good economy makes all things possible so help me understand your vision of a good economy one of the things I understand as a small business owner a good start in life is having a job but a better start is creating jobs so understanding that you're always in charge of your economic future is another one of those key ingredients so leaders who understand individual liberty economic dominance and educational Freedom they'll get my attention as long as they are spending more time in the future than they do in the past all right I want to ask you about a word I hear all the time I hear the word fight people say they want leaders that will fight I actually want leaders who will think uh and who think enough to know which fights are are worth waging I mean every fight is not worth waging so look I've known you for a long time people just cannot believe what a nice what a nice kind person you are I have seen those issues that get you willing to fight so where do you this word we hear all the time what do you think it means and how do you have the wisdom to know when to pick the right fight well if if everything is a fight that might just mean you're a bully if nothing's a fight it means that you're not in the game so from my perspective the delineation we need to have is me knowing the difference between a fighter someone who's fighting all the time and a warrior someone who's willing to lay down their life for a greater cause I can't think of a more important cause outside of my faith than this country and my family anyone who comes to interfere with my family they're going to meet a very different Tim Scott at the door anyone who believes and disrespects our country they're going to meet a different Tim Scott at their door the truth is that there has to be something that you're willing to lay down your life in other words if all you're thinking about is winning you might be on the wrong page the truth is what are you willing to die for or lose for there have to be principles that undergird human flourishing and for those principles you've got to be willing not only to die but sometimes live and lose all right what are some of the non-negotiables in your own life and of course I'm talking to somebody that I that I I know what they are but but I want the viewers I mean what are some of those characteristics and traits that are just non-negotiables that you would rather lose a thousand times than sacrifice fill in the blank well one of my great friends taught me that even Jesus lost a Voice vote to Barabbas I'll let you figure out who that person was but the truth is that I would be willing to lay down my life for the concept of freedom and faith faith is something that is the foundation of this country the judeo-christian principles undergird human flourishing in a way that nothing else does if you are not going to be willing to lay down your life for your faith then you're not in the right room truth is that the question should be asked though what does that mean most often what it means is laying down your life for Americans you've never met think about the greatest Generation those folks who fought in World War II that made sure that we're speaking English and not German the truth is that those men and women went to a foreign land to make sure that the entire world was saved that's why we referred to them as the greatest Generation you think about those single mothers who go to work every single day like my mother did hoping and praying that in America all things are possible for the poorest the least among these we have proven that is true I would be willing to stand in the fire to make sure that every single child in this country has quality education because I know that is the greatest source of opportunity it's the closest thing to a Panacea known in our country you know Senator I started by saying your mom wanted a minister of the Gospel that's what she wanted for her son it sounds to me like that might be what she got she she got a minister she got somebody who's not afraid to preach it so Senator Tim Scott it is weird to me to be talking about leadership qualities with you because you have most of the ones I'm looking for but thank you for indulging us uh and I hope you had a great holiday I'll talk to you soon God bless you

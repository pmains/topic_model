I rise today in strong support of a president who carried out his oath of office I'm afraid the reason we are here today again is out of pure opposition to this president and not the serious national security issues at hand make no mistake terrorists Salamone is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans including those that my friend and colleague Ralph Abraham just read hundreds of Americans and he was plotting to kill many more the president used his full legal authority to take defensive action and eliminate this brutal terrorist the world is safer today because of it in times like these we need to come together as a country and stand-in behind our men and women in uniform who I've ever occupies the White House should have the ability to direct and address threats and prevent American bloodshed just 48 hours ago Iran attacked US military personnel and yet we are hastily voting on this partisan resolution that will weaken national security I urge my colleagues to vote no on this political show resolution and I yield back

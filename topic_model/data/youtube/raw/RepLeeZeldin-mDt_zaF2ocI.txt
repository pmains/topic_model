and it's my pleasure to introduce to you congressman for this district Li's Eldon I don't know how to outdo Steve I although I do see there's a bag of pepperoni but I didn't pre-approved that I think it's so cool for us to be here to welcome sully home and I think that as Tyler came up here with with trooper trooper was trying to get around here I think to get maybe Sully's autograph everyone understands the magnitude of Sully's service but we're also gathered here to talk about the service that is still ahead the service that's still head for Sully still ahead for trooper for America's vets I've known John Miller for a long time and it's so great to see that John Miller's at the helm here I remember one superstorm sandy hit and if you were going around to all the different high schools and all the different locations where people were being evacuated to you would see John Miller and his crew from the Red Cross everywhere over the course of the last few years as a member of Congress I would see John all over the halls of DC advocating for children and adults with Tourette's comes as no shock that John would be here now at the helm of a great organization and to his entire staff to the entire board for all the supporters of America's vet Doc's thank you for everyone who's watching at home trying to figure out how to give back because we're always looking for that motivation inspiration in life we want to be able to leave this world better than we found it we know that while we're here there are men and women who were overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere some might be there on their 10th deployment for many reasons were motivated and inspired we get to live in the greatest nation in the entire world and we want to do something about it and this is an organization that if I guess if Forbes came out with a you know top three list I would I'd be nominating America's vet dogs now for all of us and Steve mentioned us when he get home and he's gets asked about what he did today for all of us for those in the media when you go back and then the team is wondering what you're up to today this is an assignment that I think it would make everybody else jealous for for even I was talking to one member of my team and he said they have all the events that we've gone to through the years this is the one that my wife told me that she was most jealous that she couldn't and so Lee is America's most famous beloved dog it happened overnight and but what's what's really most important to talk about the mission that's ahead and at Walter Reed and I've been there many times it's filled with men and women who have suffered so much you'll meet a double amputee or triple amputee some of you may know chris levy he was his triple amputee from Suffolk County who spent a lot of time at Walter Reed and no matter how bad we might have it in life this is something that we often remind ourselves of that someone else has it worse or it's more challenging for them I'll tell you that the spirits of those in Walter Reed the halls the rooms are filled with men and women who are not resentful they're not upset that they served there's no regret they're filled with a tremendous amount of pride but I will say that there are also some who are having an extremely difficult time so for the mission that's still ahead for for Sully and for America's vetiver there's so much more work that still had more more inspiration to be found in aiming future sponsored dogs here more support for those who are watching at home to give and to Sully with for the admission it is still ahead not only thank you for your service in the past but thank you still for what is in front of you and thank you all for being here to give attention to an amazing organization American dog [Applause]

Thank You mr. chairman and thank you mr. secretary for being here a few questions first I want to ask about Iran in has Iran I guess there's a lot of agreement that Iran has violated the the spirit of the jcpoa have you seen any evidence that Iran has violated the letter of the jcpoa well we will await the quarterly report from the IAEA to see if they have found any specific violations I have read the entire jcpoa agreement now for myself so I can understand this spirit and intent quite frankly it is a poorly constructed agreement the the bar for Iran's compliance is pretty low and so it should not come as a surprise to people that they're able to comply it is not that difficult for them to comply having said that we intend a rigorous application of the compliance requirements and a rigorous conformation from the IAEA that they are complying the whole spirit and intent question is one that obviously is always open to interpretation by both sides and importantly remember the jcpoa is a multilateral agreement so we have partners I would say that we're on our side of the table best I can tell they will have their interpretation of that as well and thank you and your processor pointed out that it was a political commitment it wasn't a treaty it wasn't an executive agreement it was a political commitment one that we didn't even ask for a signature on an unsigned political commitment does the administration recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel the administration has not expressed a specific view in that regard I would incur my stay in my own position I believe strongly that the administration should recognize Jerusalem as the unquestionable capital of Israel will the administration eventually move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem that decision is evaluation by the president obviously he'll have to make a decision coming up on whether to extend a final decision on that or not he has not made that decision to my knowledge and the president was absolutely correct during the campaign when he had stated his position and intent then of moving the embassy and I would encourage him to go with his instinct from the campaign and follow through with that pledge how do you believe the United States can better leverage our foreign aid that we provide to the Palestinian Authority well I think again our engagement with them and our making clear on our expectations of how Aid is is utilized one thing I'd like to clarify from this morning's hearing several times and the question people suggested our our support to the Palestinian Authority was increasing next year that is inaccurate it's actually going down about 20 million dollars if I remember correctly and to remind everyone our a does not go directly to the Palestinian Authority it is given to them by way of Israel and we work closely with them as to how that money is delivered and for what purposes it is delivered and I appreciate that point and I would I would offer that whatever the United States can't do to the Palestinian Authority legally we should also have the position that we also cannot do for the Palestinian Authority indirectly I co-sponsor the the tailor force act as I know number of my colleagues in the House and the Senate do as well I believe it's now one that has bipartisan support over on the Senate side and that we should better leverage the aid that is provided for the Palestinian Authority which includes providing certifications that the Palestinian Authority is not inciting violence and as in the name Taylor force act United States Military Academy graduate the Palestinians are not only inciting violence on the part to target innocent Israelis but they're doing so to target Americans as well and just congressman just so you're clear it was with that straw by partisan sense of the Congress that we have taken the position with the Palestinian Authority in a very unequivocal way that you either take care of this yourself or someone else is going to take care of it for you and those are the words I have used with them and you have you have strongly stated that it's include recent statements where you have mentioned that the president brought this up with Abbas that you had received assurances it is in the news today that there are Palestinian officials pushing back on your position that the Palestinian Authority has agreed to stop providing these payments to financially reward terror and I really do wish you the absolute best as Secretary of State in your pursuit here and I'd love to talk to you further about those efforts moving forward in the weeks months and years ahead I yield back

thank you very much senator gillibrand was not an unknown quantity to me we work together to on the Eleanor Roosevelt legacy committee to ensure that women could compete in elections raise the money they needed to its new york state's emily's list we understood that what New Yorkers wanted more than anything for hardworking honest committed elected officials and we also understood that there weren't enough women in politics and an elective office and so I want to remind people that not only as the LGBT community found itself not always having the representation and voice that it needs but women have also needed to see strong committed dedicated women in positions of leadership and Senator Gillibrand is New York State's in our history only the second woman senator and we intend to ensure that she continues to be States Senator these are times that are very contentious and sometimes there is a desire to create a narrative that frankly as a woman I find disturbing the suggestion that Senator Gillibrand hasn't demonstrated enough leadership is absurd in fact the day she became a u.s. senator she became new york state's first senator to support marriage equality that support actually predated the support of our senior senator so i would just suggest those who are developing some bizarre notion that she hasn't provided the leadership and his follower not a leader I would suggest there are many instances where that is the case where she has been the one to set the standard and we are not only grateful we are proud we are proud of the work that she has done now there are other people who have suggested that perhaps they could do a better job at least in one instance that individual twice twice voted for a constitutional ban on a right of same-sex couples to get married a constitutional ban that dick cheney didn't support it's pretty hard to be to the right of Dick Cheney but apparently someone thinks that that makes him more in step with New York I don't think so so today I'm proud to be here with my colleagues in government who understand how tough it can be to raise the consciousness of people about the struggles that individuals have but senator Gillibrand was twice elected to the House of Representatives because she connected with people families understood that she knew that their struggle was going to be a fight that she was going to take to Washington and that she was going to win on behalf of them so I'm here to say that i will be doing everything i can to ensure that Senator Gillibrand who I consider a friend not just more senator will be elected in November and reelected for many terms there

congressman always good to have you thank you for taking the time thanks good to be with you you know congressman we're learning right now that uh i think a little more than a hundred of these republican primary winners um who were largely backed by donald trump had uh you know followed his claims that there was 20 20 vote of fraud going on does that sheer number surprise you i wish i said i wish it did surprise me not really you know let's keep in mind the former president does pick a lot of who he endorses based on who he's already gonna think is gonna win or who's ahead in the polls but look i mean it is sad to watch just i'm heartbroken by watching my party go from the party of ronald reagan a commitment to truth understanding america's role in the world to a party that frankly its leaders know better they know the election was not stolen and instead of focusing on how now to turn back to the american people and sell a conservative vision for government we're still relitigating 2020 and pretending like the system is broken listen neil when you convince half of the country or even 30 percent of the country that if they vote it doesn't count that's how democracies fail because that's the only basic contract we have to have is if you vote it counts so where does this go i mean you know the hearings have gone on for a little i know this one you know for tomorrow was pushed back a little bit but i i'm just wondering congressman whether it's your sense that trump lovers will still love him trump haters will still hate him but that it really won't move the needle what do you think of that well i don't you know i don't know if it moves the needle in the short term because i think your setup is right there's a lot of people that are committed to president trump and no matter what we put out there and these are facts and these are former trump appointees saying this stuff they're not going to move off that even if we talk about the fact that you know 200 million dollars was raised in 10 and 15 dollar increments by people that literally thought they were going to stop this deal and none of that was used for it but i do think in the long term and and what matters to me because i like to think in a historical perspective in five or ten years the truth is is going to be written in the history books and it's not even going to be controversial because of the work we're doing here and i think the republican party eventually comes back to its senses and focuses on policy again and constitution and not commitment to a man i just wish it would be sooner than it probably is going to be i'm just wondering do because uh a lot of people who look at you in your stance and your role in this committee think that it's some something that was born of the president's behavior at the time on january 6 or prior but actually it goes back to the 2016 election where you refuse to support him uh outright i i am wondering though whether uh if he survives this and runs for president again uh he might have a very good chance and and you're worried about that you've said that that a donald trump unleashed and getting the office again could do a number of things what did you mean by a number of things well look i mean what donald trump has probably learned is people you put in positions around the department of justice et cetera instead of people committed to the constitution you put people loyal to you as we're going to lay out in our future department of justice hearing we came very close to the doj doing the work of donald trump and not standing firm and that's the risk we run and so i can't support donald trump even if he's the republican nominee in the future but i want to say this to my fellow republicans i think we have a really good shot at winning in 2024. just look at the economy and all these other issues let's put a person in there in 2024 who is committed to truth like we learned in sunday school committed to the constitution and is going to raise money from you for the purposes they're using it not abuse you and your trust to raise money from you all right so if donald trump were to be the nominee in 2024 uh would you support the democratic nominee i don't even know what you did in 2016 that year yeah that year i wrote somebody in it's probably what i would do again not a democrat but i certainly don't feel like this kind of trump republican moment sir well i also have you here uh you had said and others on the committee have said that a number of republicans uh after the january sixth insurrection had been seeking pardons from then president trump uh one of them you cited with representative scott perry at pennsylvania he uh vociferously denies that was the case uh how many did according to you because they say none of that happened well i'll just say stay tuned that's going to come out over the next few weeks we want to do that the right way and with the evidence so stay tuned on that but i think the bigger story here is that a lot of these people and i would argue that after january 6 almost every member of congress i know knew exactly what happened and knew what led to it we just have a bit of amnesia at the moment um now you would opted not to run for congress again uh i'm just wondering given the fact that many people who did take on the president have survived to fight another day uh whether they voted out right for impeachment or were critical of donald trump after the fact now has that in retrospect made you regret opting not to run no it hasn't a couple things first off at the end of this term i have been in congress for 12 years that's a long time it's all it's a long time to be traveling to be going through the same battles over and over i want to focus on a broader message around the country so that it kind of goes in conflict with congress and let's keep in mind the democrats like they did in 2010 drew me into a congressional district with another republican member of congress so i i have no regrets about not running again and i think it was time anyway 12 years is quite a bit of time out here yeah you survived such districts that are you know molded together in the past but having said that uh we had bill barr the former attorney general on here who and he was very critical of the president and of course that the famous comment it was bs that there was any rigging going on here but uh he he said to date he doesn't see grounds for any criminal charges uh against the former president to you and will the committee move in your view to file criminal charges not only against uh president trump but maybe others yeah well let's be clear obviously we can't file charges we can't go to the justice department right yeah we can refer that's a that's keep in mind too this this investigation is still ongoing so even after these hearings we're continuing until the report it's a decision the committee will make on that i look at this and say there appears to be a multi-prong plan that the president tried to in essence have a soft coup to overcome the chan the election so as not a lawyer it's a little different to me it looks criminal but i'll leave the criminal charges to the department of justice they're the experts at what that is but the american people need to know uh what happened and by the way if this is a democratic administration in the future anybody supportive of what happened would be outraged we as americans just have to hold firm to the rule of law and truth so if if you had your brothers and you were looking at all the evidence presented and you could go and petition yourself to the justice department to to take up those charges and to pursue them and it doesn't would that disappoint you no i wouldn't be disappointed because again when i started this and when the committee started this the point is to put out the facts and i look at this exercise more as what is this going to say for the history books how can this you know fix the country going forward because neil this threat isn't over it's it's still continuing nothing has changed so that's what i really look for in terms of the impact is the future of this country and democracy congress and kensington are very good catching up with you sir thank you very much you bet

my generation we got 250 bucks a month and I'm happy for the folks that today who've served in Afghanistan who served in Iraq for the the benefit today they received but it's a knotted about a great benefit for the veterans and their families it puts in the words of I think it's Holly Petraeus i think is Polly Petraeus who works at the consumer feathers consumers around Protection Bureau Polly said that what the GI bill does is it also puts like sort of a bull's-eye on the veterans as they come back and what happens is a lot of college and university and training schools want to help those GIS their spouse's or maybe their kids go to school some of them are for profits some of them are nonprofits some of the public's guns colleges and university some up do a great job even some of the for-profits do a great job but some of them and you've mentioned some of them here today Senator Durbin some of them do not and what they do they spend more money on trying to recruit people to come to their schools and the action spread educating them they're preparing them for careers allegedly for where there's really no jobs and you mentioned what Corinthian has done to place people in work opportunities for a month or so just so that it looked like people are being gainfully employed there's a lot of money to be made by these for-profit colleges and universities and for the ones that aren't the white hats but the black hats the what's happening to the GIS and frankly to taxpayers is shameful just shameful and I want to say about 19 maybe 1992 maybe you're the early 1990s here maybe on this floor the Senate debated whether or not it should be some way to harness market forces to ensure that that the whether it's people using the Pell grants or other federal aid programs or maybe a GI Bill but whether or not they wish somehow harness market forces to ensure that taxpayer money going to people going to college weeping while use and initially when when Congress adopted something called the 8515 rule the idea was that at least fifteen percent of of the students in the school or the receiving federal assistance that they would have to be coming on non federal money not federal money eighty-five percent of his students and that seemed to make sense and so for a while that that worked pretty well then we change the rule was changed to 9010 rule so that like at least ten percent of the students ten percent of the revenues had to to come from non-federal sources and the idea was to have for use market forces to ensure that the quality of the polity the program was actually worthwhile at that school and then we had this new GI bill then we had the new GI go and it's we have spent I think in the Senate everybody knows better than me but I think we've spent today close to 50 billion dollars on the Iraq or Afghanistan GI Bill close to 50 billion dollars probably Dwarfs whatever we spent for folks coming back after the Vietnam War some of the smart smart for-profit colleges figured out a loophole though and what they figured out is the law didn't release was first adopted didn't really focus on the GI bill because it wasn't all that robust and the the 90 10 rule 85 15 year old 90 tendril focused on stuff that did not include the GI Bill so when folks veterans go to college and the GI Bill helps pay for their tuition or for their spouses of their children that does not count as toward the ninety percent so what we have is as a result there's like a loophole that allows a college or university private college university to realize as much as one hundred percent of their revenues from the federal government one percent nothing about market forces ten percent fifteen percent of your students have to come on by non-federal means all of them all of them are there on the federal government's dull the I think among the people who push for the early 8515 rule were Bob Dole and phil gramm here and they said a long time ago that you know we ought to have some something that like the 9010 roll and a couple years before that the guy did Senator Durbin remember named William Bennett remember him Secretary of Education here's what he called for profit trade schools here's what he called him 1987 he said this is his quote diploma mills designed to trick the poor into taking on federally backed debt milk them for their loan money and then wash them out or graduate them ill prepared to run a job market and pay off their loans that's what he called him and as I said earlier there's some for profits that do really good job but there's a bunch of the tunnel and that was the case of 1987 and unfortunately it's the case today I we just want to say we have viewer how you have I have Tom Harkin in past years continuously drawn the attention of our colleagues and anybody who wants to listen to this further to this this issue and this needs to be fixed it needs to be fixed and I want to thank Senator Durbin for working so hard and letting me help them a little bit on the stuff and and I think we're starting to make s we're starting to break through and some of the folks that are worst the worst factors in this business are starting to fall and that is a good thing

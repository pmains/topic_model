florida congressman michael waltz is a member of the house armed services committee and he joins us now um congressman i just want your your reaction to the biden's words there you know look i just want to say of course our heart goes out my heart goes out to any young person who is struggling uh to deal with their identity with their sexual orientation uh but you know especially five to eight year olds which is what the florida legislation uh actually dealt with not some emancipated teenager or or 17 year old but shame on joe biden for distorting that uh to to score cheap political points against ron desantis uh at the end of the day this really goes to the heart though of how progressives think how they approach socialist progressives approach government where they believe government and the state and state employees know best not mom and dad at home uh and not families and that's really at the heart of what this disagreement is and i think you're going to see people side with families all day long yeah you bring up state versus federal government which is a really um key point of what happened yesterday the rhetoric is one thing but this executive order that the president signed is something else entirely directing hhs to make sure that minors children can't have gender transition surgery and that's something that some states have banned so does the president have the authority to overrule the state laws well that's i that's what's going to end up in the courts that's not clear at all and i don't believe he does and let's be clear about what he is promoting here i mean these are young people uh you know 12 13 uh 15 year olds that they go through these surgeries were castrating young boys girls getting mastectomies research has shown that often these issues they work through these issues like many teenagers do and can move on to healthy and happy and productive lives but the age of consent is 18 and before that age parents absolutely have a role and that's why you're going to see when we do take the congress back you're going to see a parental bill of rights and and parents taking their child's future back away from some of these school administrators or in this case federal employees that are going to be forcing some of these issues on our kids we've got to protect our kids and we've got to protect our parents abilities to to control their kids lives and futures congressman i want to switch gears to this biden's energy secretary jennifer granholm is insisting that high gas prices are enough of a reason to buy an electric car let's listen to this and i want to talk to another side of it if you filled up your ev by charging and you filled up your gas tank with gasoline and you have the same size tank you would save 60 per phillip by going electric rather than using gasoline so it's very compelling case but again to your point we want to bring down the price at the point of purchase is this a compelling case like she says or is this out of touch well look i think it's some some honesty on her part and i think she's really speaking for a lot of progressives within the byte administration that deep down in their hearts when they they see these gas prices going up they believe when you're going to you know have to go pay a hundred and fifty dollars to fill up your gas guzzling carbon emitting ford pickup truck eventually it'll get painful enough that you'll trade that in for a prius or you'll go get uh you know that that electrical via that electric vehicle uh ignoring two key things one the cost of an electric vehicle is more than the median cost of household income uh and two it completely ignores the fact that the cost of transportation is the biggest driver of inflation that everything has to be transported and we're going to continue to see these just policies fail and we're not going to see solutions because they're cheering this on deep down in their hearts yeah and then you have president biden sending a letter to energy companies yesterday where he yelled at them congressman saying you need to work with my administration when he ran on a platform of ending fossil fuels in this country it's truly unbelievable congressman got to leave it there thank you so much for joining us this morning we appreciate it

congresswoman Karen bass who's a pro and she's California of course she serves on the House Judiciary and you Michel cinder there's a car aspyn for PBS newshour also a pro how can a chairman i watch i watch chairmen that are sitting there like job in the old testament with all these crazy people behaving around me he always seems a little bit surprised by their misbehavior but they are gonna be doing points of water like joe mccarthy we know it's coming how do you fight for that that crapola oh i think that the chairman is going to be very well prepared and very strong he is not going to put up with the juvenile nonsense that you saw in the Intel committee and you know what when you have members act like that that is an act of desperation because they have nothing to challenge the report on the substance well congressman why have you you know you nothing stops those people behind the basket at an NBA game from waving those crazy things around that screw up the guy doing the foul shot so they're not going to stop waving those things these Republicans just say it shows they're desperate no they're just screwing up the foul shooter they're just screwing up the presentation of what Nancy Pelosi wants to be solemn can they exactly how do you stop and not tell me how you gonna do it how you stop I think stop using the parliamentary power that he has we are the majority we control the process if they move to adjourn we just vote him down until we continue I think that we are very well prepared we know what they're gonna do we certainly have seen what they have done every time we have a judiciary meeting and you know I'll have to add in to the ranking member you know he's auditioning because he wants that Senate seat so he is definitely performing for Trump and they're performing so they can get on fox of a nightly news we know that I think we're gonna be able to push back okay you me so I gotta ask you I went to Catholic school you did that you're out in the hallway and then you're gone I mean I mean how do you stop these clowns from being clowns because you know they're gonna do it well the congresswoman hinted at it it's about parliamentary procedure it's about Democrats trying to use their the fact that they won back the house and the Nancy Pelosi is speaker to try to really quiet down these Republic but I will say that the president has really put out a mandate for Republicans he said I want to see you fiercely to send me I want to see you be strong he's he said Nancy Pelosi has these Democrats they all seem to be the lockstep where are my Republicans in lockstep and then a few days later Matt gates shut down that deposition so what you see is Republicans really trying to prove that they have president Trump's back well they'll do it anyway will ultimately fight for of fall to the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment they're coming in the next couple of weeks against President Trump maybe the week after next and these cities reports that according to individuals involved in that process there could be three to four articles of impeachment rafted by the Judiciary Committee they include one two to one abuse of power that's obvious we've got that Ukraine and that whole trade that shakedown one on broader contempt obstruction apparently know that because they won't let a witness know up or a piece of paper to show up and potentially one related to the mole reporting obstruction of justice The Washington Post reports Democrats have already debated the scope of charges to bring against the president the idea of Mullah related charges it's running into resistance from some moderate Democrats wary of impeachment blowback in their GOP leaning districts as well as Democratic leaders who sought to keep impeachment narrowly focused on allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals Congress what my hunch is the Republicans the ones with brain still will take the weakest link you guys put out in other words the weakest article they'll attack and say that that makes no sense it's no reason to get you can express doubt of the office for tweeting something that could be caused witness intimidation you can't throw them out of office for that they'll take your weakest charge and make it your main charge how do you deal with the choice of articles well first of all I think that tomorrow is going to be a really important hearing because we're going to delve into the impeachment process what does it mean high crimes and misdemeanors bribery etc I think that the evidence that we have is strong again maybe the President or the Republicans will come forward with some actual evidence that refutes what we already know I don't know that they'll do that because they haven't done that yeah but I think bribery is written right into the Constitution and I don't know how you can look at what the President did any other way if you we need you to do a favor in order to get the aid and you're talking about a nation that was under attack it can't get more egregious than that so we know that they will lie that's what they do consistently but I think that we will have the American public on our side 50% of the public feels that he should not just be impeached but removed from office and you know what the percentages were when it was the Clinton impeachment it never got about 30% so he's already in very serious trouble let me go you means well the troops be home by Christmas will this be over by say December of 1830 20th this sort thing that I haven't sent this that the vote to impeach the president which is it seems more and more likely that will be over before Christmas and then we will move then to a January Senate trial but I think Mitch McConnell has been very clear he said I know how this is gonna end this is gonna end with the president not being removed in the Senate I think you have to really watch where they're being impeached though it will and it will likely end with him being in peach but we have to really watch the Republicans and right now Republicans are still in lockstep with the president and as a result he's feeling good about that the other thing is demikhov's will continue to say but there's no one who can say that president Trump specifically told them hold this money up in order to get this money that's the argument that they're making even though Jeff John Bolton or someone else testifies maybe when you get closer to that well there's the president number 10 down and meeting with the prime minister but I think they mention I disagree I think nobody wants call on your stock thank you you're scaring guys thank you have a nice will have a nice and peaceful you

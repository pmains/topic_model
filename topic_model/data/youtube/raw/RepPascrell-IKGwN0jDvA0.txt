mr. speaker with all the rhetoric invoked around this agreement I'm reminded of what President Ronald Reagan since his name was used just a few moments ago by the leader what he told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in November of 1985 when they discussed the nuclear arms reduction go back to history and not have selective history president Regan said this I bet the hardliners in both of our countries as he spoke to Mikhail are bleeding when we shake hands if that doesn't resonate what will and when the United States struck an agreement with the Soviet Union two years later to reduce the size of our nation's nuclear arsenals President Reagan we see much criticism including as conservative columnist George will put it for accelerating listen to this the moral disarmament of the west by elevating wishful thinking to the status of political philosophy unquote almost 30 years later we see that President President Reagan's actions we're not a capitulation to an entrenched enemy but instead the underpinnings of a larger strategy that reduced the nuclear threat look this agreement should not be judged on its ability to curb Iran's hateful rhetoric or its role in destabilizing the Middle East because that was never the goal of the agreement no agreement can be perfect but I am not convinced that a quote-unquote better deal which exists only in the abstract at this point will materialize if Congress were to reject the one before us we ejecting this agreement mr. speaker would require the world's largest economies who are party to this multilateral agreement gentlemen tax expires I'll leave and reimpose sanctions the gentleman that I yield back gentlemen Michigan reserves the gentleman California is recognized

hi I'm Ben Sasse the Iran deal is the Obama administration's greatest victory in its ongoing war against facts the Iran deal is an absolute disaster for America and for all of our allies in the Middle East and yet team Obama continues trying to tie itself in knots to defend the indefensible let's dispense with the spin and fact check just three of the ridiculously false claims they've made the last two weeks number one they said there was no ransom well there was a four hundred million dollar cash payment at the exact moment that for Americans who'd been held captive in Iran were released if something looks like it not quacks like a duck and walks like a duck it's probably a duck their claim is false number two the administration is saying that Israel now somehow supports the Iran deal let's be clear Iran is led by a death cult of folks that think they have a divine mandate to annihilate Israel the Prime Minister of Israel came to the US on the eve of the Iran deal and explained what a disastrous and dire threat the Iran deal would be for Israel's future none of that has changed Israel does not support the Iran deal and number three the Obama administration says that the pathway toward to a nuclear Iran has been foreclosed that's not true what the Iran deal does is allow the Iranian government to delay and disrupt and even deny any meaningful inspections the Iran deal allows the Iranians to keep their centrifuges it allows them to continue stockpiling enriched uranium it allows them to continue their nuclear research program and allows them to expand their missile arsenal in what way is that possibly for closing the pathway to a nuclear Iran what it really does is drive the breakout time down to zero the Iran deal is a disaster and the Obama administration's spin isn't true the good news in this is that the American people aren't buying that spin and that's going to be necessary as we as a nation deal with the long-term threat of a nuclear armed Iran I'm Ben Sasse thanks for listening

I want to thank our advocates and our leaders standing behind me we've been working on this issue throughout their lives I am proud to be here in Georgia today stands shoulder to shoulder with these women and the millions of people around the country who are outraged and fighting for our reproductive and civil rights thank you for joining us here and for all the tireless work that you have already done and Artois and will continue to protect access to basic health care for all Georgians you are all leaders in this fight and I am joining you I am here to not only learn from you but I attempt to learn to use my platform to not only shine a light on what's happening here in Georgia and the deeply personal and troubling impact it's having on women's health right here but I will also lead the fight for women's civil rights across the country right now entirely too much of the conversation about women and what we can do with our own bodies is being driven by a group of right wing male politicians it's time for that conversation to be led by the actual experts women and their doctors so I'm here today to speak to the people who are most directly impacted by these horrifying bills and make sure as many people as possible can hear their voices I feel deeply about the stories I heard today about the mom who was so worried about her life and the life of her child and had to make the most heart-wrenching decision who can possibly make these are the stories of the reality of women across America from the male legislature who said why are men making all these decisions it's an outrage that in Alabama all white men made the decision to criminalize basic health care it's clear that the laws passed here in Georgia and in states across the country represent the greatest threat to reproductive freedom we have seen since roe v wade and we know that this is not a hypothetical threat as we heard from the doctors behind us from the providers they know what it's like to lose patients from the advocates who said when you make abortion illegal it doesn't stop abortion it's just stop safe abortions women's lives are in danger with legislation like this if they are allowed to stand especially for low-income women for black women for women of color they are the ones who will suffer most that is why we must come together to declare the reproductive rights are human rights they are civil rights and they are non-negotiable [Applause] is that this is not just happening here in Georgia just last night the governor of Alabama signed a law that completely outlaws almost all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest it criminalizes doctors and threatens them with life in prison for providing patients with basic healthcare already this year Mississippi Ohio Kentucky have all passed six-week abortion bans with similar bills introduced in ten other states these are just some of the over 250 bills across the majority of state legislatures to restrict abortion access just this year we need to call this what it is a nationwide assault on women's constitutional rights by ideological extremists who have no right to be making these most intimate and personal decisions a woman or a family inmate and they have one end goal overturning roe v wade and turning back the clock on women's civil rights and human rights in this nation as candidate donald trump said he would punish women for accessing abortion and as president he's made good on that promise by stacking the Supreme Court with anti choice extremists like that Cavanaugh and Neal Gorsuch over in Alabama the Lieutenant Governor said said the quiet parts out loud when he said he fully admitted that the ban is intended to chocolate roe v-- wade all while the Supreme Court overturned a 40-year precedent in another case putting crow at even greater risk this is a battle and waged on all fronts and that's where we have to fight this right in the courts in the states in Congress and in the White House we will fight back now there are two key ways that we need to fight this fight at the ballot box and standing up standing up for an unequivocally pro-choice agenda state elections absolutely matter the people who represent us in our state houses are making important decisions that affect the lives just as much as the decisions we make in Congress and we need to make sure decisions aren't being made about us without us in Alabama women make up just 15% of the legislature among the worst gender ratios in the country but let's be clear in order to make sure that all of our voices are heard we have to fight attempts to suppress the vote suppress the vote of people of color and young people throughout this country we can't defend the rest of our civil rights if we don't protect our own right to vote second as president I will both defend reproductive rights from political attacks and make guarantee and expanding those rights my priority last week I was the first presidential candidate to roll out a robust reproductive rights agenda I will only nominate judges and justices including Supreme Court justices who will commit to upholding roe v wade as settled law I'm going to take a significant step further today because as Republicans continue to attack our basic rights I'm sick and tired of being on the defensive I'm sick and tired of taking one step back every day I'm sick and tired of more and more women across the country losing their access to basic health care so today I'm making it clear that enough is enough as president I will take the following key steps to make sure that every woman in America no matter what state she lives in or how much money she has her pocket can have guaranteed to safe legal abortion first as president I will codify Romi waiting I will make it clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that women in this country have a guaranteed right to an abortion second I will end the Hyde Amendment which disproportionately Fox women of color and women with low incomes from getting access to abortion services and third in the most sweeping step that I am going to take as president I will guarantee access to reproductive health care including abortion no matter what state you live in the way to do this is I would ensure that no state can prevent private insurance from covering abortion as a reproductive health care I would create a funding stream to ensure reproductive health centers Act I would create a funding stream to make sure that reproductive health centers access in every state and every region of the country is available and I would ensure that no state can pass laws that chip away at access to reproductive care are criminalized reproductive health care providers federal law should supersede harmful state laws that take away women's reproductive freedom I believe access to abortion is a constitutionally recognized right and I'm not afraid to follow through and guarantee it with the power of the federal government this is about the fundamental question of whether we value women in this country and whether we see them as human rights who are able to make their own decisions and any Democrat who expects to win the presidency must answer definitively where they stand on this issue finally we must continue to support our local organizations women we heard from today who are fighting this fight on the front lines of our communities they're fighting here in Atlanta and across the country and they're putting everything they have on the line to guarantee and protect this necessary health care for the people who need it women of color low-income women women young people LGBTQ community members in particular I am proud that I am in this fight and I am proud that I am supported by the activists behind me and I'm proud to be supported by the millions of men and women who do not support these radical ads about women's reproductive freedoms and I can tell you one thing if this is the fight that President Trump wants if this is a fight that he wants with the American people if this is a price he wants with America's women it is a white people have and it is white people [Applause]

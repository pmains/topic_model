THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM KANSAS, MR. MANN, FOR FIVE MINUTES. MR. MANN: THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. IN PREPARATION FOR THEE RORSING THE FARM BILL IN 2023, I RISE TODAY TO DELIVER THE 10TH INSTALLMENT OF MY FARM BILL IMPACT SERIES WHERE I'M HIGHLIGHTING VARIOUS'SPECS OF THE FARM BILL THAT DESERVE THIS CONGRESS' SPORT. RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS EXIST IN THE FARM BILL BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF RURAL AMERICA, MANY OF WHOM WORK TO FEED, FUEL, AND CLOTHE US ALL, MUST REMAIN CONNECTED TO THEIR FAMILIES, LOCAL COMMUNITIES, AND THE WORLD TO DO THEIR JOB. . RURAL DEVELOPMENT SINGLE FAMILY  HOUSING PROGRAMS ENABLES  FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS TO BUY, REPAIR HOMES IN RURAL AMERICA. THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS,  QUALIFYING INDIVIDUALS CAN  FINANCE A NEW HOME WITH NO MONEY DOWN OR GET FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO REPAIR THEIR WELLS, HOOKUPS  TO RURAL WATER, SEPTIC,  PLUMBING, HEATED, AIR  CONDITIONING, AND ELECTRICAL  SYSTEMS, INSULATION AND STORM  SHELTERS AND SAFE ROOMS. USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT IS  COMMITTED TO HELPING IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN RURAL AMERICA AND EVERY COMMUNITY NEEDS STRONG LOCAL BUSINESSES. THE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM  IMPROVES THE ECONOMIC HEALTH OF  RURAL COMMUNITIES BY INCREASING  ACCESS TO BUSINESS CAPITAL  THROUGH LOAN GUARANTEES AS WELL  AS ENABLING COMMERCIAL LENDERS  TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE FINANCING  TO RURAL BUSINESSES. IN HEALEY, KANSAS, THE SHARPE  BROTHERS SEED COMPANY HAS SOLD  NATIVE GRASS SEEDS SINCE 1958. THEY NEEDED ADDITIONAL WORKING  CAPITAL TO BUILD UP THEIR  INVENTORY SO THEY USED THE USDA  RURAL DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS AND  INDUSTRY PROGRAM TO SECURE A $5  MILLION GUARANTEED LOAN FOR  ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL. THIS PROGRAM HELPED MAKE THEIR  OPERATIONS STRONGER THAN EVER  BEFORE WHICH IS GOOD FOR RURAL  KANSAS. FINALLY, STRENGTHENING RURAL  BROADBAND WILL HELP ENSURE THAT  RURAL AMERICANS, AGRICULTURE  PRODUCERS INCLUDED, CAN KEEP  PACE WITH A TECH-DRIVEN SOCIETY. I BELIEVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS MUST  BE SPENT JUDICIOUSLY ON EXISTING BROADBAND PROGRAMS AND THE GOAL  SET BY THE USDA AND PARTLY  CLOUDY MUST BE REALISTIC. LAST SUMMER, THE HOUSE AG  COMPANY ADVANCED A BROADBAND  INTERNET CONNECTIONS UTT FOR  RURAL OUT OF COMMITTEE WHICH  AUTHORIZED $43 BILLION FOR  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. I JOINED SEVERAL OF MY HOUSE  COLLEAGUES THAT WOULD LEVERAGE  THE RECONNECT PROGRAM WITH SOME  OF THE 2018 RURAL BROADBAND  INVESTMENTS IN RURAL AREAS WITH  LITTLE OR NO INTERNET ACCESS. IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A SUCCESSFUL  PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, AND  IT HELPS COVER THE COST OF  CABLE, IMPLEMENTATION AND  INSTALLMENT OF BROADBAND IN  RURAL COMMUNITIES. I SUPPORT WHATEVER DIRECTLY  BENEFITS THE RESILIENT PEOPLE OF RURAL AMERICA BECAUSE THEY ARE  THE LIFEBLOOD OF THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT THE RURAL  DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WITHIN THE  FARM BILL AND WHY I'M BRINGING  AWARENESS TO THEM NOW TO ENSURE  THESE PROGRAMS REMAIN STRONG IN  THE 2023 FARM BILL. I'LL BE BACK TO THE FLOOR SOON  TO DELIVER ANOTHER INSTALLMENT  OF MY FARM BILL IMPACT STORIES  AND HOW MORE PROGRAMS AND TITLES WITHIN THE BILL THAT I BELIEVE  CONGRESS MUST UNDERSTAND AND  SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT  AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AMERICA  THRIVES IN THI

we have gone through two years of this Trump administration you know everyday through this administration you think it cannot get worse and then it gets worse first of all I want to thank all of you every federal employee who has gone to work or been furloughed and have done their job even though this White House has not done their job I want to echo what Steny said it is time to open up our government [Music] [Applause] earlier today under the leadership of Ben Cardin and chris van hollen all the democrats came to the Senate floor and said pass the house feel open our government you want to fight about border security we'll have that discussion but do not hold 800,000 people's lives as political pawns Mitch McConnell said he can't do that Mitch McConnell said he can't do anything that the president won't sign well I would point out I would point out that the Constitution of the United States of America says the Congress is an independent branch of government the Constitution of the United States in article 1 section 7 Clause 2 says the Congress can override the president with 2/3 vote and the funny thing is in the middle of December the Republicans not the Democrats the Republicans brought a bill that would keep the government open and it passed 96 - to let us vote on that legislation and override this president Friday where it is something we haven't done in a long time in this country where workers contractors you think about businesses that live and work near our parks but particularly the 800,000 federal employees aren't going to get your paycheck that is morally wrong that is economically wrong and we must not let that happen so let your voices be heard what my hope would be is rather than this president getting on TV or rather this president taking what even called a photo-op trip to the border let Donald Trump come out and explain to you the workers of America why he's keeping this government shut we will succeed keep the faith god bless let's get our government open

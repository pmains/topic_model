I thank the Chairman thank you today's early-stage companies are not simply innovating existing industries but actually creating entirely new markets thanks to angel investing in particular the advancement in American technology and entrepreneurship is thriving but funding these early stage companies is challenging obviously investing in start-up companies is inherently risky which is why wealthy investors who qualify to become angels often shy away from it this is a major hurdle facing small and early-stage businesses that are struggling to find capital particularly in parts of the country like my district in western north carolina their pockets the country that really are capital deserts and we're trying to make sure that they are able to access Capital for new create new jobs in fact media reports indicate that small counties like I represent have actually lost more businesses than they have created in recent years this is problematic problematic for the larger economy as well and we must do everything that we can here in Washington to reverse that trend addressing the challenges facing angel investing is a great first step that can be accomplished by changing our mindset and creating a regulatory framework that encourages innovation and growth while also ensuring that shareholder and investor protections remain strong while the JOBS Act lifted the shareholder limit to two thousand for privately held firms it left and place the 99 investor limit for angel investing funds as a result many investors who want to become angels are excluded from investing in many early-stage companies fail to acquire the capital they need to get off the ground to address this problem ranking member waters and I have joined together and offering a bill that amends the investment company act of 1940 by increasing the investor limitation from 100 to 250 for qualified venture funds our proposed amendment would help with this problem this 99 investor limit problem this bill would increase the cap of investors from 100 to 250 for credit investors applying only to qualified venture funds narrowly tailored tailored to early-stage investing while my original legislation in enhance the cap from 100 to 500 working with ranking member water she had a number of of of things that actually improve the bill that enabled us to come to this compromise today thus our proposed amendment would open up an angel investing to more credit investors allowing for early-stage companies raise the capital they need to grow and create jobs both in her district and my district that's the mindset here is to help both her district and my district and the rest of the country although the bill is a technical fix in many many ways we worked hard to see compromise and find a common-sense solution to this complicated area of securities law well we have negotiated a good working bill my goal is to ensure that the language and operation of this compromise will work in the real world and have an impact on real people I look forward to continue this work to ensure that the law is useful and is a useful tool and serves an example of how policy can meet the needs of small and early-stage companies across this great country of ours the bottom line is that this bill is a sensible way forward it will allow more diversification for angel investors more access to capital for companies and ultimately more good-paying jobs i want to thank the chairman I want to thank the ranking member and I want to thank the committee staff on both sides of the aisle for working so diligently for this bipartisan compromise today and additionally I'd like to thank congressman Schweikart for joining me in as a co-sponsor of this bill I urge the sport I yield back the balance of my time

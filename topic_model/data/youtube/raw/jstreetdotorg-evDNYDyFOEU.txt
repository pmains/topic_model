hi I'm Marianne Williamson and I'm running for the Democratic nomination for the presidency of the United States I am an American woman and I'm also a Jewish woman issues concerning the Middle East are extremely important to me issues concerning Israel must matter must have tremendous priority for any American president I believe that the United States should have equal and equally robust commitment to both the security the legitimate security concerns of Israel and the human rights and economic hopes and opportunities of the Palestinian people I love the United States but I do not agree with Donald Trump's policies concerning the Middle East and I love Israel but I do not do not agree with many of Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies either it's very important that we all remember that according to international law the fact that you are occupying a territory does not give you the right to an exit and if Prime Minister Netanyahu goes anywhere near any annexation any part of the West Bank there will probably be a third in Fatah - it would be a very very terrible things to do I do not support the occupation of the West Bank I do understand the occupation of the Golan Heights simply because there is no negotiating party at this time in Syria but once again Netanyahu must realize that just because you are occupying the Golan Heights does not give you the right to annex it and similarly i do not support the blockade of gaza it hasn't worked and it is morally wrong we need something new we need to get back on the track of the two-state solution and as president I will do everything possible to make that happen even more importantly and I feel that my own career and my own background gives me a unique skillset in helping this to happen there needs to be a psychological and emotional even a spiritual solution to what is happening between Israelis and Palestinians that is where the real work is I've been to Israel five times and I have met both Israelis and Palestinians Palestinians and Israelis who want peace and are working for peace and know that primarily that will not occur on the level of checkpoints it will not occur on the level of the Green Line it will occur on the love the heart and that's not just talk that's not just metaphor you have two peoples with conflicting historical dramas and they have to share that same piece of land and I have seen the people who are doing the work to help that happen you see in my line of work I have an understanding of what this means to people both living out a historical trauma are so unprocessed in their trauma that they are incapable of being fully present for the trauma of the other the fact that I understand these things and that I have worked with these things that I have done that level of what you might call couples counseling where people are stuck in such heavy conflict that they don't know how to melt the walls that divide them the fact that I bring professional experience in that is no small thing here and in my presidency when we meet with the Prime Minister of Israel and we meet with the head of the Palestinian Authority let me tell you who else is going to be at that meeting the real peace builders in that area because I know that what they are onto is the path towards a survivable future I'm Marianne Williamson I'm an American I'm a Jew and I'm running for president of the United States thank you

i'm congressman tom emmer and i represent minnesota's 6th congressional district i'm grateful for the opportunity to join you today for this wonderful event and i want to thank voice for adoption for putting this together november is national adoption month and i welcome the occasion to highlight this issue my wife jackie and i have been blessed with seven of our own amazing children being a parent to each one of them six boys and one awesome girl has been our life's greatest gift our kids have grown up with something that every child deserves family permanency permanency is the idea that children have a home either provided by a birth foster or adopted parent where they are welcome and safe to grow learn and play for their entire childhood whether they're formed by birth or by choice creating a permanent home for a child can irrevocably change their life for the better i'm proud to serve as a champion for families of all types in the sixth congressional district and beyond i think of amazing adoptive parents like the jaegers who were selected as a sixth district angels and adoption honorees by the congressional coalition on adoption institute like many adoptive and foster parents marcus and sarah yeager moved mountains to make their family whole in may of 2019 the yeagers were matched with their daughter olivia they traveled from minnesota to nigeria but once there experienced enormous bureaucratic delays after two months in nigeria marcus was forced to make the impossible choice to return to the united states for work sarah and olivia remained in nigeria for months where they faced further delay steep fees and additional adoption expenses however just before thanksgiving of 2019 sarah and olivia were finally able to return home the yeagers were a family i tell this story because i understand there is no difference in the love and commitment shared between adoptive and birth parents and their children however the process of becoming a family can be more complicated for adoptive parents depending on the age of the children when they are adopted they can carry trauma from their birth families the foster system or simply the pain that comes with lacking a permanent home for children like these it's in it's especially important that we prioritize mental health services at every phase of the foster adoption process mental health challenges while understandable can complicate the process of pairing a child with their permanent home the work of creating stable healthy families must be ongoing and does not end at adoption by taking part in this event today you have already demonstrated your commitment to this important effort i'd like to thank all of you as well as the more than 2 000 adoptive families across our state together you have done the incredible work of creating what every child deserves a permanent home thank you and god bless

congresswoman Madeline Dean a Democrat from Pennsylvania so you have come out tonight in support of Joe Biden why should Elizabeth Warren join you well I'm thank you for having me Laura I'm enthusiastically supporting a former Vice President Joe Biden for a number of reasons for his heart for his intellect for his experience for his decades of public service where he has just dedicated himself to serving others to lifting up the little person to solving their problems he's a man of great compassion and empathy and at this time in our country we need that kind of a unifying force someone who can draw us together who can help heal this country frankly from the great divide that we are suffering right now but also lead us around the world we need to return to our standing as an extraordinary leader and Joe Biden can do that so how would it help his campaign if Elizabeth Warren were to back him well let me speak to Elizabeth Warren senator Warren is an extraordinary public servant I had the opportunity to stand in my office this afternoon and hear her remarks as she gave them from her driveway in Cambridge and I was surrounded by my staff many of them young many of them young women they were heartbroken they really identify with her I do too as a woman I I see her as a fierce leader someone who stands up for the middle class for the poor also for those who are vulnerable among us so her voice her leadership her provocative style that's what we need in politics a positive provocative style to challenge us to do better to say how do we afford health care for all how do we afford college for all how do we make sure everyone has an opportunity for an excellent education so Elizabeth Warren will continue to lead this nation and of course I think she would make this campaign a stronger campaign but what if she endorses Bernie Sanders couldn't that actually hurt Joe Biden I suppose it could because she has very loyal dedicated followers something I was thinking you know when this campaign began what seems like a very long time ago we had a field of very talented very diverse people running in this country for the very first time and I have to tell you I was not yet a congresswoman but I was so proud of the diversity the number of women running you know our past in the past we've had a single woman running as a Democrat or a single woman running as a Republican look at the field that we fielded this this year this cycle extraordinary women extraordinary people of great diversity people of color LGBTQ community with Pete we've had an extraordinary pool of talent on the Democratic side I will tell you that and so what I hope all people who are paying attention and who have followed Elizabeth Warren and the other very worthy candidates understand that it's time for them to lend their voices I hope to the Joe Biden candidacy to lift him up to bring this country together congressman Madeleine Dean thanks for being with us tonight

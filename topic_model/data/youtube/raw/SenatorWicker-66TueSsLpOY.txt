let's go to uh Senator Roger wicker on a list it's on the Senate armed services committee the ranking member there um you know Senator um I don't know what the Mandarin word is for for hutzpah but China certainly exercised it of late right I mean they're absolutely shocked shocked that we shot down this balloon they want it back they say that this is a provocation that has to you know be responded to I don't know what that response will be um they're also hanging up the phone on top us officials including the defense secretary when they call what do you make of all this uh well yes you've raised a larger question first of all let me say I'm glad we shot the object down I wish we had shot the uh the Chinese balloon down uh over Alaska we we certainly knew about it in time and decided not to do it at the briefing on Thursday the administration uh officials were really patting themselves on the back for uh the very professional and studied way that they had handled the situation letting it go not only all the the length of uh Alaska a bit back into the continental United States and all the way to the Atlantic so I'm glad that uh that it's clear that that they're not going to use this sort of procedure again the the larger uh lesson I think that that we have here Neil is that um NORAD under the direction of General van hurk doesn't have what he says they need and you pointed out in and the questioning with Tim Kaine just now um it's uh it's harder sometimes it's certainly different to track a slow-moving object this one didn't seem to have uh in any way to to decide the direction it didn't have a steering mechanism like the Chinese balloon had but for quite some time at least a couple of fiscal years General van hurk has said NORAD does not have all the capabilities we need and so your point about the hutzpah with China is absolutely correct I I I don't know that they weren't testing us with the first balloon incident we don't know where this one came from right probably China uh possibly Russia but uh you you can almost guarantee that it was it was uh launched by someone who does not wish us well yeah now what has come forward that's that's what's so weird about it yeah but Senator wicker it's always good seeing you thank you very much sir I appreciate it um we're going to

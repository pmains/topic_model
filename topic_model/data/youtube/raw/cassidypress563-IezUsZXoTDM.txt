if I were going to describe myself I describe myself as a man of faith the husband of dr. Laura Cassidy a father of three wonderful children I'm a doctor who's worked in a hospital for the uninsured for the last 20-something years teaching medical students and residents and enjoying every minute of it when I was in high school I wanted to do something to be fulfilled but didn't quite know what that would be and so at some point when I was a senior in high school they thought I had cancer turns out I didn't have cancer but almost like this came into my life to expose me to this wonderful field called medicine and that's when I decided to go into pre-medicine at LSU and was fortunate enough to get accepted to medical school and it's than everything I thought it would be bill Cassidy if I invite him into my home alone that he would be just as real as my next-door neighbor once dr. Cassidy makes friends he never forgets a face he remembered me as a patient but here he was remembered my name he had not seen me in almost three years here I was in a chamber and he wanted to know how I was feeling and what I was up to that's taken time my husband was a patient of Dell Cassidy's my husband worked at georgia-pacific he's a very hard working man and he noticed the district's enemy started having to eat a lot of candy and do a lot of couldn't stay awake I mean was having problems can we sign up the bill had a really bad liver disease I can't explain I can't say enough about how personal the man was but he didn't look at my husband's his hair or he didn't look at my husband's disease he said here's here's people that need my help and he helped he helped enough to save my husband's life I have been a TV anchor and reporter for the local of CBS affiliate in Baton Rouge for about 20 years I would call bill for an interview or a question and he would come right over come straight from the hospital scrubs and all when it comes to health care it was amazing how this man who has spent his life as a public servant would go above and beyond especially for those in most need I mean I do consider bill my best friend and I would say the feeling is likewise since we have the same background in medicine since we've been married for 23 years we have three children my mom has lived with us his mom was with us now we've just been through a lot together and I'm glad to call bill my best friend Oh

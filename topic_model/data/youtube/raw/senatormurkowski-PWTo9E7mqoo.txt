we hear it everywhere we go had an opportunity to be in the small community of tanana and heard firsthand the cost of of broadband to to communities they are effectively without broadband at all for 25 years 300 a month for 25 gigabytes sometimes you know the internet is down and the phone is down it's like okay i'll get the tin can telephone with the tight string out maybe that'll work there will be somewhere between one and two billion dollars coming to alaska alone for our broadband focusing on unserved and underserved areas that is by definition so much of alaska i talked to tribal administrators who say i can't apply for a federal grant because it just takes too long to be able to to download any of the the documents so we just don't even try that that means you're out of the competition before you've even started that's what we need to address everyone understands broadband is essential it is infrastructure so once this broadband funding comes through the networks are built out people will be able to do all the things you need to do in society senator murkowski has been an incredible champion for broadband for years and so this infrastructure bill is almost a culmination of those efforts when i think about the infrastructure bill and the benefits to alaska there's probably no more single area of importance than what we've been able to do on the rural and tribal broadband piece

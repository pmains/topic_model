hi I'm Don Clavin Tennison supervisor and I'm joined by colleague and government counsel in Anthony D Esposito and the head of the EMS right here in the town of hempstead dr. Dave Newport or as we like to call them dr. Dave as always I appreciate of all of you taking the time to join us here today and for any of our csca workforce I want to say thank you to each and every one of you particularly those essential workers that are coming on a regular basis from sanitation to highways to the cemetery to the water department to Public Safety and every other department if you're coming in thank you so much and on behalf of the entire town board as well as all the residents thank you for doing the great job you all do because you do a fantastic job and we're all lucky to work with every single one of you the purpose of today's meeting and discussion is to take some time to talk about what's taking place right now as well as answer some of the questions that may be lingering out there with not only the town workforce but as well as residents so with that before we introduce our in-house doctor who's been doing a great job councilman D Esposito if he has any comments oh thanks supervisor and it's great to be here once again with you and dr. Dave I think it was just a little over a month ago that we held our first coronavirus live on Facebook and since then we've been really working day and night with our colleagues on the town board to make sure that we keep our workforce our residents and our visitors healthy here in the town of Em's that I just want to thank all our essential workforce regardless of their department for the great job that they're doing and the leadership that they're showing in these tough times and I want to thank dr. Dave and his crew who have really just been all over the town of Hempstead and beyond helping those in need and making sure that we flatten the curve and get past the worst of this pandemic so thank you doc yeah thank you and and with that as councilman said this has been an effort between not only the government but the residents and all the co-workers here in the town about taking the steps necessary to flatten the curve and get past this epidemic and we're very fortunate to have dr. Dave with us from the beginning many of you work in the town might have had the time to interact with the doctor or his team they've been going out to facilities answering questions alleviating concerns and also helping us to put into place safeguards from the very beginning when we started looking at this back in January safeguards for the workforce as well as for the residents who used our facilities that I think have benefited all of us in the long run and particularly here in the town of hempstead have really saved lives as far as I'm concerned so with that I'd like to introduce dr. Dave too you know of course have your comments maybe give everybody that's watching a little bit of a breakdown of what what's going on there and then we'll start taking some questions and I know one of the first ones are gonna be some of the items right in front of you so dr. Dave as always thank you and please yeah supervisor Coughlin thank you hi everybody so I'm sure there will be plenty of questions about masks today so I brought some with us we'll do that when we get into the question and answer session as as my my friends and colleagues and government have been talking to you guys about it's been a long haul from the beginning and we all know everything that you're going through and the last time we did this I talked to you guys about being our civilian responders and and taking your steps that have to be taken for us to slow the spread of the virus and to protect each other and do what's socially responsible for each other at least at this point it does appear that the that curve that we've been talking about is starting to flatten and that we're at the plateau but all of us know that we have seen many friends and family members and colleagues and and and people that we know get sick and sadly we've seen people die and that's terrible and what you see in a pandemic the last time we saw anything like this was probably the 1918 flu pandemic thankfully that was actually worse than this so we are actually doing better but that does not mean that we need to be complacent and that does not mean that everything that we've been talking about is not important to continue we it's very hard to be disciplined to do social distancing it's against everything that we've ever done it's against our where New Yorkers we like to interact with each other like to shake hands and hug and and and hang out and do things together and it's very hard to tell people to not do that but understand that these these tools these these things that we're giving to empower you to protect yourself and to protect your colleagues and your friends they are extremely important and they work these are true tried and true steps to take when you have a pandemic and while it does seem that some of these things are archaic until we get antibody testing and vaccines and I was just talking to the cut of the folks here um I work at and while you went through hospital they're working very hard on treatments there I know all the hospitals all of the systems are working on this where they're looking to find treatments so there's things that we are doing this as medical professionals to make it better for everybody but until then we have to do the social distancing you need to stay six feet away from people will talk about the masks and a little bit into why this works and why now we're recommending them we'll bring that up in the question and answer session it's important to wash your hands if washing hands will kill the virus it deactivates the proteins and the facts that keep the virus together and actually hand-washing is the absolute best thing that you can do to fight this constantly washing your hands hand sanitizer if you don't have that got mine here you know making sure that you don't touch your face and making sure you stay separated so your cough droplets and you don't spread the virus to other people I you know it's gonna be coming up in the summer it's gonna be very hard for us not to want to congregate with people but we have to stick to what we're doing don't let up now it's working it's been a toll we don't want it to get worse we want to get through this we want to open things up we want the economy to recover but we have to continue doing what we're doing now and trust that we're taking the steps we need to take that we've been talking every time to protect you to protect our workers to protect um you know everyone not sound our frontline people that are on the you know fighting this on the frontlines we're doing the things we need to do to empower them you need to do what you need to do stay home don't go out to help us get the job done better we'll work together and you know we're gonna have to go through this together it's this is unprecedented none of us have seen this in a hundred years so we're figure this out together and make this work but we're here for you and with the you know here for each other so that we thank you dad on the team and it's great to see so many people are taking the time to join us one of the one of the questions that just jumped out at me was an individual said what's up with the property taxes over a month ago there were super taxes myself as well as the councilmen and the entire town board every member reached out to the governor's office to ask them to extend the second half property tax payment for school taxes they're currently due this year on a Monday May 11 we have not received a response from the governor's office in addition to ourselves I know the county legislators and I believe the Assembly members have asked the governor for an extension based on the governor's announcement yesterday that he is extending yet again the mandatory on was lock-in for another month we are going to be reaching out to the governor again and ask him to do the right thing and extend this time period to pay taxes 30 days that would extend it all the way to June 11 we're hopeful the governor will listen to us and I am going to urge everybody that has been emailing and writing and making this post do us a favor email the governor directly to let him know it's when you know the elected officials are one voice but the residents voices are the strongest when they've reached them directly we're going to be reinforcing and going and sending yet another correspondence to the governor's office but it falls on his jurisdiction and it has happened before it's been extended during time periods that it was necessary superstorms during other blizzards 9/11 there was an extension of time payment for taxes so we're asking the governor yet again but we're asking you to also take that time time to send us an email I know I've received countless emails that councilman has the receiver has as well as all of our colleagues in government and we're just asking you to join us to get that extra 30 days we realize that people aren't working right now people are you know with less paychecks right now if they have any and this is just the right thing to do so so please we're asking what we'd like you to do it again and and we're asking our school districts to you know accept and join us it's the right thing to ask for a 30-day extension you know as proceeds coming to the tax off the form receiver the monies are sent to the school districts on a regular basis when they're there but this is this is an unheard-of event and and we're asking all of us to join together for that that and that's a great question councilman that you have another question yeah so there was a question that someone brought up about licenses whether it's a marriage license or unfortunately death certificate so the death certificates have been for the most part handled by the funeral home and then they have been interacting with the clerk's office but for those of you with marriage licenses the best bet is to do one of a few things you could either call five one six eight one two three six zero zero which is the coronavirus hotline that we've set up here in the town of hempstead to handle any of your building Questions town clerk receive your taxes or Parks questions you could also call the Town Board at five one six eight one two three - four - or you could reach out to by email and it's toh Town Clerk questions at toh male org obviously you could visit our website at Hampstead New York gov to get all this information but we know that licensing is very important there are people that have been calling their office and that's why the supervisor in the Town Board and our great town clerk and receiver of taxes have established this hotline and different ways to interact with us we see a number of questions from residents who particularly have asked about the need for mass and with the new directive from the governor this week maybe you can explain to people the necessity of mass why we have and the different kind of mass out there as well as the the use of reuse of them of course so I this was a big question so I'm glad I get a chance to talk about this um it's a it's not a change per se with it we've always kind of been alluding to the the need for masks so understand that this virus spreads mostly through coughs droplets there's a little tiny kind of spit particles that come from our mouths and go into the environment around us in most situations those can only go about six feet that's where the so distancing six-feet rule comes from if I were to sneeze right now or took off those droplets would likely only go about six feet and then would fall to the ground so if you're outside of that radius you would be safe but there are tiny tiny little droplets that can sometimes stay hanging in the air and in most situations it's not a big deal however this is why we're telling people not to go into large groups or into small spaces if you have a large number of people in a small enclosed environment if that's why we are trying to prevent you know gatherings concerts clubs weddings that kind of environment then these cough droplets can stay in the air longer and can cause something we call a super spreading event where lots of people can get sick in a very short period of time so we need to do the social distancing we need to minimize the number of people that we have in one place and we need to ensure there's always good airflow with wherever we are because then that takes these tiny little airborne particles and lets them blow away and doesn't cause an issue unfortunately we don't know yet how much of the virus you need to be exposed to to be sick we use the idea that if you stay out of that six foot radius for about ten minutes and you're probably okay that is something they are researching but we want to just minimize your exposure to these in general and now that we're trying to move forward about opening some things up at some point in time that is why the masks now are becoming very important again if you look back through other pandemics you went back to the 1918 flu pandemic it's the places where people wore masks those cities and towns tended to do better overall moving forward same thing if you look in in Taiwan and you look in South Korea and some other places where they wear masks on a regular basis they seem to have had less of an impact from this the date is not perfect but these are very simple steps that we can take to make our social distancing better and the way the masks work is those those coughs droplets that I'm talking about they get trapped in the mask so if you sneeze or you coughed or you speak loudly and those droplets come they actually get caught in the fabric of the mask and then that's protecting the people around you so think about a mask as a way to protect others you still need to take the steps to protect yourself the distancing the hand-washing not touching your face but this protects your colleagues this protects your friends this protects your family members so the types of masks this mask which is the ones that we use in the hospital we've been telling you from the beginning you have to leave these masks for medical professionals like myself like our EMS providers that are out there every day our firefighters our nurses our doctors we are actually getting within very close proximity of very sick patients that are coughing and sneezing and cannot prevent that and we're getting showered with these droplets and this spray these masks help to protect us because they block out a large majority of them they require special training and fitting they have to be fit properly to your face if it does not fit properly around your face air gets in and then these masks are not really that helpful so if you have these types of masks please let them donate them give them to health professionals we still need them we're getting better but these masks are meant for us however these types of masks are meant for everybody and this is what why we want people to start wearing them so there's two types the this is a reusable one so this is just a regular surgical like a like a cloth surgical mask it's it's a more of a paper than a reusable cloth but this is a good this is a good tool to help protect yourself if you're going to use any kind of mask wash your hands first okay so I'm gonna put a mask on here so I'm gonna wash my hands okay make sure my hands are nice and clean because you'll want to touch your face then when you take your mask you want to fit it to your face so it's going to fit around like as you see and then you're going to tie this off like this and then I'm gonna do one down on the bottom here and then you can see I have this master now it's fitting my face and then what I'm gonna do is just take this and this there's a little wire in here and then you just make sure that that fits over your mouth the nose so you feel this kind of general warmth in there you don't really fear air leaking in and out this will block most of your droplets and prevent other people from getting sick if you have a mask like that it can be reused a number of times you notice that when I took the mask off I did not touch the inside of my mask I took it off this way and then you can this in something that protects the inside or if this is a clean table you could just put that down if you don't touch the inside and contaminate where it goes up against your face you can use a mask like this for probably a week or two if you're not getting it wet or dirty or wearing lots of makeup obviously if it gets torn or you it gets damaged you'd have to replace it when you take your mask off you wash your hands also because you again you want your hands to be clean and you don't want to touch the outside of the mask what's nice is now we have people making cloth masks we have companies offering cloth masks these are the type of masks that you that you see a lot of people in pictures from from previous pandemics these can be reused same way that you would use that mask it's just gonna go over my face after I wash my hands goes around my ears I drop it on Mike I drop it on my coat but usually it goes around your ears like this and again now it's fit to your face you can adjust this to your face and it stays like this it's comfortable to wear during the day you can now do what you need to do during your day when you're done the day you wash your hands and then you take your mask off when you get home at the end of the day and now these types of masks because they're reusable you can easily wash this so it's really a good idea for everyone to invest in one or two of these reusable masks because then you can be socially responsible wash it always have it with you and put it on when you're going to be in public situations you know social distancing still the best thing you can do but this is the next best thing you can do after that after the hand-washing of this holds a distancing to protect your family protect your friends and keep everyone else safe so I hope that answers your questions about the way the masks end with you guys know this great education or how to put it on and take it off right it's part of the the concept and again it was a great question and it led to a wonderful description so thank you oh and you want to make these masks and donate them to people we've been talking about that that's a very good way that people that help people are looking to help that's a very good way to help get these masks today to get it out to people so that way people have access to them great so I just want to provide clarification though I guess one question they were asking about the Stewart Avenue entrance to Eisenhower Park so there are many layers of government here on Long Island in Nassau County and Eisenhower Park is a national county park it is not a town of hempstead Park so the supervisor or any of the town border town board members have no authority on how we are exiting or entering that park but a common here and which is I guess great to see is that so many people are thankfully recovering and whether it's you know I think it's its own to everyone it's to people that have really followed the rules follow the protocol the amazing work that people have done in hospitals and doctors firefighters EMTs so it's great to see that people are recovering the question that comes up a lot here is once someone has coronavirus is tested tested positive and they recover are they then for the for the future immune to the corona virus right this is a great question and this is the 10 million dollar I think it's been asked over no so there's a couple things you may have heard people talking about antibody testing that governor's been talking about that a lot it's been in a lot of discussions the county's been talking about it we've actually been talking about it and looking into it this it's been it's been the forefront of the things that we've been doing with our task force so we think in most situations that you only will get get this disease once however like any other virus it can mutate and so some people may be able to get it again so the most likely answer is yes you're immune what we want to do is get that antibody testing available on a regular basis and then be able to test people because then new people that you know are recovering from it you'd be able to see if they had antibodies to protect themselves from it the other thing that comes up a lot this questions been coming up frequently is if you test positive do you need to then test negative so you don't get your friends or family set so the interesting thing about this virus unlike the previous SARS virus which we saw 20 years ago that virus shedded the most about a week to two weeks with into the disease this disease this Coby to the second version of this that we're calling köppen actually sheds the most in the first few days of the illness sometimes when people only have very mild symptoms also again now why we're talking about people wearing masks because they may not realize that they're sick and they may be shedding these virus particles so if you test positive and then two weeks later some people have been able to get to a second test and they're still coming up positive that probably means there's a little bit of residual virus in their system but that doesn't mean that they're going to be infecting others the most chance of infecting others is in those first two days and most people who get the virus once to your question councilmen will not get the virus again there is a chance that some people may either not clear it completely from their system or maybe it can be able to get it again but that's a very small subset so so we'll get hurt immunity from the people who get immune to it we'll get a vaccine to this at some point and then once we have those two things then life will definitely return back to normal so that's that's what we need a forum that's what we're going for so yeah doc one of the questions that I see is when things reopen you know for example last night I was on the phone with my my friend Brian and his wife Kathy in Wisconsin they were told yesterday they're not gonna reopen until the end of May so the governor set forth a new timetable mid-may what's the significance of and why is this continuing the delay if we open it would we need to explain to people I think or you get why this is necessary for a longer period okay so um again everything that you guys have done as our civilian first responders they made the hospitals able to keep up every hospital that I know of has put a large number of staff and they're bringing in help they've expanded their floors they've added ventilators they've created ICUs they made all this space because we get this big spike in people remember everyone that was like that week or two it seemed like everyone was getting sick and then and then people that were getting sick a lot of them that went to the hospital required additional health ventilators of a very high level of care and so what you guys do when shutting everything down by social distancing by putting on masks is you slow that down so the health system can keep up and that prevents people from dying it allows us to treat more people and allows us to slow that curve so less people get sick the fear now and if you look back to the pandemic in 1918 the Spanish flu there was more than one peak so we're at remember the curve we were on the curve and we're at this plateau right now we want it to start coming back down because the faster it comes down the faster then we can all start returning to our normal lives with the vaccines and the treatments and the things that we need and that people are working on the fear to the question of the supervisor is that if we let lighten up these restrictions if people don't continue social distancing you start to get crowds you start to get people back together is that it could peak again and then that could even be even worse than the previous peak if if you look at Spanish flu in 1918 the second peak was more deadlier than the first and they had all these what they call non-pharmaceutical interventions that the the social distancing the you know hand-washing the shutting down of schools the the stopping of you know congregations they had all that in place and in many places and then when World War one was over they had parades and parties and celebrations to to celebrate the end of the war and then in all those places they had this huge spike and a lot more people got sick because you brought everyone back together and that the virus got out the virus doesn't care the virus is able do it's a virus it does what it's wants to do if you have people together it will spread and remember the more people you have together the tighter the population density the more of those droplets and the faster people can get sick so we have to keep these restrictions in place until that curve starts coming down so we have reasonable ways of all of us going back to some normal ins of life masks can help us with that and then it's gonna have to be a slow reopening with people's social distancing so we don't get that second peak we wanted to continue going down we don't want it to go back up we've worked so hard now to stop this and to get control one to catch up we can't let it then you don't get the best of us again appreciate that well first I just I see that Brian Sullivan from the corrections officers benevolent association is listening and I just I know that the supervisor and I was just talking about it this morning we want to say thank you to him for all the work that he's doing on the frontlines and keeping his officers safe and everything he's doing stay safe but I also see a lot of of chiefs and officers from the volunteer fire service throughout the town of hempstead and I think although the question hasn't been posed and it's probably not it's probably not posed just because a lot of people don't realize the work that's being done but in addition to coming here and doing these live Facebook's and the conference calls and the protocols that we wouldn't and so much that we've done over the last 45 days with regards to Kobe we we also have a core group down at Point Lookout that's working at our Emergency Operations Center and maybe dr. Dave you could just kind of fill in the you know hundreds of people that are watching from home and give them a basic understanding of what's really being done down there and the end it's amazing work I really mean that yeah I appreciate it thank you so so then we have two main goals we have an emergency medical operation center and out of there we're doing two things the first is that we're keeping the town's workforce safe that has been my main charge with these gentlemen leading the charge leading from the beginning we have a phone number that our town workers can call manned by our personnel by our medical personnel where we anyone with any kind of code related concern if they develop symptoms if they have questions about how to protect themselves they have questions about how to protect others all of those calls come through there and and I personally reach out to all of our town workers who might be sick who are family members who might be sick who are having symptoms who are having questions - so they know how best to protect themselves so we can best protect the workforce if the workforce is protected then then the town is protected and and and that we have to keep our essential people healthy and that has been our charge from the beginning and that is super important so that that's very unique work that we have where there's not a lot of towns that have their own doctor and you know and these gentlemen have been more than supportive of what we're doing to make sure that everyone is faintly safe so you know it's it's it's our job to out of there to keep our workforce healthy to keep the government running and to give you guys the right recommendation so we can keep not just our workforce healthy but our citizens healthy and then the town has always had an EMS agency town Hampstead EMS that for many years worked very closely with our Parks Department and our lifeguards protecting our beaches and keeping all of our beachgoers safe and keeping all of our citizens that enjoy our parks down by the beaches safe when the pandemic occurred our agency last year had went to a higher level of care to paramedic level of care we were bringing more advanced medical treatments of the ability to support our local fire department all of that we started last summer we kicked that into overdrive when the pandemic occurred and with the support of the supervisor the councilman in the town board and everyone we were able to take town of hexade EMS from a seasonal beach operation this winter we had had a little bit more of a presence during the daytime and we were helping out fire departments with first response now we're a 24/7 operation we have vehicles running out of there we are we are taking care of going out to people's houses and helping them when they're sick giving them advice where we would just add our animal shelter the other day because we have some workers that might have to interact and we were showing them how to put the proper gear on so they could be protected we have been sending our EMTs out to all of our various departments getting them educated letting them know what has to happen and now our EMTs are responding and backing up our local partners in the in the fire service I'm a park fire department point lookout fire department Freeport fire department especially have been great partners out of the second battalion and we have been working with everyone down there and have become really this huge team effort to make sure that we have the proper you know resources in place to keep everyone safe you know where our agency is and we've always been talking about you know expanding that forward so that's something we'll work on but just know that our guys are out there on the front lines they answered the call just like all the other volunteers and just - thank you - what the heck innoncent said I they're all the Chiefs and the health department and the fire service and the EMS and they're you know we've won - eleven townsman helping us out the volunteer I am doing so we have had so many partners lately that we work with that we just have to say thank you it's been this huge team effort and the county level as well you know the the county EOC and and their OEM and the emergency ambulance Bureau from the county everyone really is been working together and stepped up and it's a really impressive thing to see that that all of your emergency service agencies are working together just to know that you have a whole team of people not just at the hospitals but pre-hospital that are taking care of everybody and so that's it's really important and I'm glad that you brought that to light Council it's really good a couple of comments and suggestions that came for we had today there was an event down in Elmont where Island harvest was helping with food distribution of those in need for anybody who needs assistance with food please dial six three one eight seven three four seven seven five again that's three one eight seven three four seven 75 and noticing I've seen a couple of people asking about recyclables first off recyclables were suspended and the purpose of that was to alleviate staffing where we could free up additional 15 trucks if needed during this pandemic I understand it's an inconvenience we apologize and we thank you for for working with us we know it could be an inconvenience we're gonna be re looking at that based on what our director our Commissioner of Sanitation says his SiC and availability is and we will instituted backup procedure when we can I do want to let you know though the Marek yard down in Marek wrote you can drop your recycles off down there if you choose to so you do have that availability if necessary but again we appreciate everybody working with us this is unheard of this is something that's never happened before you know let it be from from any of the services everyone's trying to do do their best and provide an irregular basis and and primary sanitation was an essential service that we need to have garbage collected and recycling will come back up and it will be recognized just like as the councilman alluded to before we see a lot of comments or people about reopening of parks and golf courses and in due time when the the governor allows us to we hope those will be instituted and reopen how will they be reopened and what would they look like that's something it's going to be have to be determined by medical professionals like yourself dr. Dave as well as experts about how we put Elvis but we recognize it but but again it's a two-way street it's the services we're trying to provide but also the understanding the residents and we're all very very appreciative of it so thank you all stop so kind of it's a great question obviously people have some more time on their hands their favorite gyms are closed so people are outside whether it's riding their bike whether it's going for a run going for a walk so there was a question from one of my constituents in Oceanside but I think you know it really affects everybody in the town if they go out for a walk or they go out for a run or a bike ride do they need to have a mascot so again the mask is to protect others more than to protect yourself that's the sort of the ideas and the governor's order was specific that if you can't social distance that that's when you need to be wearing the mask it's sometimes hard to know when you're gonna get too close to someone which is why you know routine wear a mask wearing it's a good idea but we can remember the droplets that were concerned about that aren't the direct contact have to be in the air in an enclosed environment so if you're outside and you're enjoying a bike ride or you're going on a run or you're in the end you know and you're more than six feet away from people then that air is clean it is not just floating through the air coming to get you you have to think about minimizing your time in enclosed spaces without air movement and with lots of people around you so if the exact opposite of that is going to a park and you're there by yourself or you're riding your bike those are very healthy things that you should be doing to keep yourself healthy we you know this is psychological as much as its physical and we need to do things to make us fail to feel some simply isn't normal so you want to go surfing if there's no one else around that's fine if you will to go on a bike ride and you're not you're not you're not running into other people that's fine if you want to go for a run that's great I mean these are all the things that you should be doing in order to keep yourself healthy and to keep your mind you know sane and you keep things you know going so supervisor if I can I just want to follow up there's another question about recycling and I think that it's important to kind of make it clear so the town of hempstead has suspended its recycling so that means anyone who is serviced by the town of hempstead sanitation there are many again layers of government here in the town some of you are serviced by incorporated villages some of you are serviced by sanitation districts that have elected board members so there was a question why does one part of the town of hempstead have recycling on one side does not if you are serviced by the town of hempstead sanitation your recycling is suspended we can't speak for all the other municipalities and all the other sanitation districts if you have a question you know you could call the hotline that we gave before and we'd be happy to help you out and along the lines of many of the residents you know so many of you have great ideas and you're posting them up and a lot of the concerns you have our issues we're addressing but we also love suggestions you know there is the concept that people are now taking gloves and coming out of a supermarket and just taking them off and and throwing them on the ground is gross which is gross and unsanitary and and a danger we've been reaching out to vendors who've all in those fields to try and come up with a plan you know that people can take them and put them in a secure location there was this story today about people taking gloves and otherwise it is flushing with out of the toilet and clogged in the sewer lines no I think not only in the town your other levels of government are looking at it but if you do have a suggestion or idea don't be shy about emailing it to the town you know some of the greatest ideas come from the residents and if they can be incorporated we want to incorporate that and do it and and the idea is sitting in your head just don't leave it there said to the town if you don't tell us or you don't share it with us how can we make that positive change if you're keeping it to yourself so what I would I would encourage anybody do that and again I see somebody saying you know when will the beach be open when will the pool be open a lot of those guidelines are going to be set forth by physicians like dr. Dave as well as the state and just so you know that we've been in communications with the other townships and other municipalities and we're just waiting for guidance to see how it's going to look but we're also meeting every single single day going forward with ideas and plans if there is distancing required at a beach if there is limitation of crowds and and they will be implemented and used and there are guidelines are just kept yesterday they were talking from the CDC about a phased reopening of various places and obviously we're gonna coordinate that with the state in the county and and our government but just understand that physicians I mean I can tell you they're been very hard decisions that medical personnel had to make we've never faced something like this we are very sensitive to the fact that a lot of you are not working that that is an economical you know depression that that you get we can't be working that it's hard for people to be inside that all of these things were asking of you are very tall orders but if you look over the years of any place that has dealt with a pandemic if you deal with it upfront and you take the hit upfront and then you stop the pandemic on the other side the economy recovers the people recover you have less dead people you have less injured people who have less sick people so Wow it seems some of this is archaic and some of this is hard and some of this might be an overkill we could promise you that these are the right choices to be making we're doing the right thing and together socially we'll get through this together and if we get this stuff done and then we do the right way and the economy will recover and people will get back to work and we'll do with things and and life will get back to normal it might be some time I mean it might be longer than we want but it will work and if you look back there's clear evidence that these steps work in the front if you if you follow them and that on the back end it then lightens up so just we have to just hold the course I know it's hard but it's just important I you know there's some questions from our valued workforce ask me about again kind of sort of the same question know what is the town going to be in operation and I think everything that we've said so far is really important we are making sure that we follow all the guidelines from the state we're taking the advice of our medical doctor and the goal is to keep everyone safe and healthy obviously we all want nothing more than our lives to go back to normal and you know wake up tomorrow and all of this goes away but unfortunately this is going to be a gradual process and just as we gradually reduce the workforce over a matter of a week or so I think the gradual increase of our workforce is going to be a little bit longer than that but obviously the goal of the supervisor and the Town Board is to get everyone back here is to get you know our our family back together be able to provide all of the services that we we promised our residents and we just want to remain everyone to remain healthy and and and you're right yeah look listen hey you know Gooch I read your comment out there you know we want to get people back but we want to do it in a fashion that is protective of every resident in the town as well as every employee and that's something when they're talking about we talked to the Dave and the Town Board talks every day about how we're gonna implement safeguards for both our co-workers in every department as well as for all of the thousands of residents who utilize these buildings these parks these services and there is no easy snap of the fingers that this is going to change overnight and there's going to be changes and everyone needs to be realistic to that in our in our daily but with the services here but we will get back but it was in some ways will be different but the idea is that we're all healthy in the end and it is the combination of every resident being safe but every single co-worker we have here in the town you know we want you to be just as safe and but we also want you to get back to work and we recognize that doc before maybe we ended up I'll let you have a couple of comments here buddy I'm sorry so this is actually a question that came up last night I got a call and maybe you couldn't I see that you know there's a lot of again our volunteer fire chiefs and officers and a lot of our friends and family from camp anchor that are watching from home and the question that I actually got last night was when you're you know obviously everyone's encouraged to wear masks they have to go outside and you know is there any tips that you can provide to someone who is trying to put a mask on someone who maybe has autism or you know it has a problem with things on their face you know I think it's definitely a it's it's tough and you know the parents guardians grandparents caretakers want to make sure that you know before their loved ones are going out in the public that they're providing you know every possible resource that they can sure and obviously sometimes it's tough to get to get masks on yeah well I mean I'd me clearly something like this that's gonna be you know force formed on someone's face is gonna be uncomfortable for someone that if you know a lot of times they have issues with you know claustrophobia or they have issues with with touching or people are in closing on them so I think that the best answer councilman is is that if you have someone that has that's on the spectrum or that has you know issues with you know with you know things being in close to them you know how that person is going to best react you know what makes that person comfortable what makes them not comfortable and then the face covering it could be a bandana it can be you know it can be a shirt so I mean I think you need something that's their favorite color or yes or or or and you can don't also maybe there's some smell that they like or some some texture that they like so they you know if they like um you know like a felt or some kind of like softer fabric you can you know if there's not um what this is doing is preventing and and the most important thing remember is that this is preventing others from getting sick so you're gonna put that mask on them but you want to make sure everyone around them so that's the most important thing is if you have someone that you're worried about that's a high risk is making sure that that you enforce that six week I went shopping the other day and people were getting too close to me and I actually said out loud stop you are too close to me you need to back up and they looked at me and I that doesn't matter like this is I think that it's a very nice way you can do that there you sometimes have to remind people because they're not used to this it's very hard to be disciplined when you're not used to this but I think you know if you have you explain to people how important it is for them to maintain that distance you find a way for the people around them to have masks on and then and then the person that you know the special needs person finding a way of doing that that they're comfortable with I think that that would be the plastic face shield wouldn't do the same job obviously as a no actually that would be fine to be far yeah if they would prefer a class down something yeah for the basal yes basically you want to prevent those droplets from getting towards her so so no a plastic piece shield as long as it's better than something if it wasn't by getting on there mill rapid they don't like that yep now give me two yeah and it's such a great question because just yesterday we were having a roundtable talking and the question came up with the the use of masks what if someone has a an issue where they can hear and they need the necessity to read lips and it's through having discussions that we were having about these that you know open up that that the air and make us say we need to take that into account that's why this is almost uncharted territory but but again it's through opportunities like this that we hope that the residents and some of the workforce that are watching here this has answered your questions again tak would you like to know and I mean get no I just want to end with that it's been very awesome to see the outpouring support for the for your frontline workers in this for the essential workers for the healthcare workers the number of people that have reached out to us you know understand that that your your police officers and firefighters your EMTs doctors nurses respiratory therapists all the medical people pas and peas we are seeing things that we've never seen it's very nice that I have all these people reaching out and asking how we're doing all of my colleagues people been dropping off food I mean it's important to feed everybody so I mean that you know but just understand that if you reach out to your friends and family members that are on the front lines they appreciate it and I think they're really cool or not cool but the really social we awesome thing about this is that our frontline workers are the people in the supermarket they are you know that there are our cashiers there are workers that are right where did you know guy tip the key that came to check me out at that the other day I got a $20 check for me because he was standing there and he looked scared but he was they are making sure that we had food and we had resources so you know they're just like you know our sanitation workers are our water department you know there are so many people that you don't typically think out as first responders you guys as civilian first responders but you just this is I think that has been the really good society thing about this is that we're all together in this and that we have people so so support them appreciate them thank them understand that we're all in this together I think that if we work together as a team we keep together as a society we understand that we're all in this together that's really the part I think that I want to make sure that gets out there I think that's what everyone can do that and appreciate the people that are out there working and understand that there everyone has a job in this and everyone's doing a really good job and we keep doing that we're gonna get through this together so that's the most of it thank you thank you as always yeah we're lucky to have you and like I said you have such a great disposition yeah you make any doctor you know if you're the first one I've ever liked yeah councilman any any close encounter I mean I listen just to reiterate everything that you and the doctor have said you know this is a rough time in our Township in our County on Long Island across our nation but I think that we could all agree that you know some of the worst of times bring out the very best in a lot of people and like the doctor said it's not just cops the firemen the nurses the doctors but all of those who are on the front line making our our lives move forward there's so many of you to thank but just know that they don't deliver you yes but everybody at home to our CSEA workforce that's doing an amazing job you know my prayers are with all of you we'll get through this and let's just keep working together to move forward everyone stay healthy and god bless stay safe yeah and and lastly let me just say again thank you to everybody thank you for your thoughts thank you for every co-worker you have here and for that one or two people that are on there saying hey you know I'm at home what can I do you know here's a great idea sherry you can make that clock mask you can sit there and make a couple of day and then we can give them out to their co-workers so if you're at home and you need something something like that goes further than you'll ever know because people out there don't have the means people don't have the ability and these are important things and especially for for this workforce when when it is back in full and it wanted strength we're gonna need things like this distribute it out to them and then we cannot then take it and take it to the next level and provide those things as a simple mask to that senior citizen at the Senior Center or to that dead clerk or any stores but again thank you all oh the hotline number you can go to the town website and get the hotline number or you can dial five one six eight one two 3600 you could be directed to the building department the tax department the parks department or the clerk's we will you know get around to doing a quick turnaround to getting your response we're providing providing services still five days a week here at Town Hall through these numbers or through the web and more importantly I just ask everybody to stay safe stay home and follow the doctor and at some day we'll be back together all of us again so take care god bless

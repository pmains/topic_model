turnout a republican congressman from louisiana congressman mike johnson good to see you and thank you so much for taking the time i'll start with your service on the judiciary committee this letter from representative grassley essentially saying alleging widespread effort to downplay negative information on the president's son do you think any action will come from this letter again written to the attorney general merrick garland i do there is a serious accountability that needs to be pursued here we'll be investigating that as soon as we are returned to the majority after the november election i serve as you know on the house judiciary committee and am the ranking member of the constitution subcommittee jim jordan is our ranking member of the larger committee we have been working uh feverishly behind the scenes we have whistleblowers from the fbi as well and we're collecting all that data putting it together look there's no question sean that the doj has been politicized in the butt administration some of us use the term weaponized it is doing partisan political bidding of the democrat party and that is a serious problem because it undermines the people's faith in that institution our whole system of justice i'm just curious to know this and i know it's jumping ahead but the january 6 committee holding their hearings um i believe they've had seven or eight at this point but they were put together by nancy pelosi not really allowing the minority leader to place their party's representatives on this panel the way they so deemed fit if the roles reverse republicans take the house a committee develop develops to investigate the president's son let's say that will that be the same case well republicans will the majority allow the minority to choose their own committee members have you thought about that our team is the rule of law team the republican party believes in in our institution the way it's supposed to function we have no interest whatsoever in partisan retribution and politicizing these functions of congress that is what has caused some of these abuses and the problems that we're facing right now that said the oversight responsibility of congress is critically important and we're going to do it in accordance with the rules and the procedures that exist that's what makes it legitimate we're going to follow the truth where it leads and you'll see that play out beginning in early january there's a long list of things that we have to go after and ensure oversight on and each of our committees will be involved in that in earnest i'll move on to uh to this topic one that affects just about every american a potential recession and the definition of recession seems to be in flux as does a male and a female these days it appears the white house is trying to redefine the term recession uh which would go against the past 75 years or so of what many have come to understood a recession as let me play this for you from the white house press secretary and then i'll get your response we're not going to be in a recession uh in my view uh we uh the employment rate is still one of the lowest we've had in history it's in the 3.6 area uh we still find ourselves with people investing we don't def i'm not going to define it from here i'm just going to leave it to the nber as as we have stated how they define uh recent recession but there's some of a contradiction if you pull this up again this from the white house website here it says while some maintain that two consecutive quarters of falling real gdp constitute a recession that is neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle end quote but when you google the definition of a recession it's two consecutive declines in gdp america could be confused by this your thoughts look i i think america has tuned out of the white house in their spin that's the problem with this administration they are so concerned about spin and they never address the real problems whether you're talking about inflation immigration their general incompetence afghanistan energy policy now the economy uh playing with the language is not going to solve the crisis that every american feels the fact is the fact this economy is contracting as a direct result of the bind administration's crazy policies and every american feels it all hard working families are struggling right now and it doesn't matter what they say at the podium or the white house it doesn't change that reality i want to get to your bill if i can here i know that you put this one forward you've recently introduced the unborn child support act if i can get your comment on that um tell the viewers about that yeah it's a bicameral piece of legislation i'm grateful to senator kramer north dakota who introduced it in the senate as we introduced it in the house we have a long list of co-sponsors this is a very simple common sense piece of legislation that says that mothers life begins a conception and after the dobbs ruling the federal law needs to be updated to recognize the reality of this the biological medical reality of this and the important point that fathers have responsibility as well so the onboard child support act does exactly what the title of the bill implies it allows a mother to receive child support payments for the child before that child is born all the way back to the date of conception as determined by a physician so completely within her discretion um if the paternity test is her call whether she goes to a court to get child support payments is her call but she ought to have that ability and i think the federal law reflects that it's been very well received since we rolled it out i can imagine i want to focus on really quickly and i'll let you go vice president mike pence recently spoke touched on the topic of somewhat of your bill in a general sense he talks about you can't be pro-life unless you're pro-adoption recently speaking your overall thoughts on the vice president's speech and his appearance there in dc as trump will be appearing later today well vice president pence is exactly right we believe in the sanctity of every single human life we now have a conservative majority on the court that is allowing the people to determine these important decisions at the state level as should have always been the case we have 50 years almost 50 years that we've been set back because of the atrocity of roe so his comments i think are well received i think the majority of the american people understand that and we need to protect innocent life it is a determining factor on what kind of country you're going to be the country that that protects and preserves innocent human life uh it's the most basic function of government so we're excited to advance public policy uh that uh that secures that idea once again and i'm grateful that he's bringing it up and it ought to be in all of our conversations and speeches that is u.s congressman from louisiana mike johnson congressman thank you for so much for your time we appreciate that thank you

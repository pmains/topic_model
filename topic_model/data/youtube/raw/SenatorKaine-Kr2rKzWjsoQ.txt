mr. president I also rise to celebrate this important anniversary 50 years ago today President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed into law Medicaid and Medicare with my favorite president sitting next to him president harry s truman and mr. president I came up and asked you a question and I'm proud to tell the whole chambers everybody listening there's only I think one member of the current United States Senate who was at the inauguration of LBJ and it's the presiding officer of the senator from Wyoming who was at that inauguration in January of 1964 clearly the signature of Medicare and Medicaid was one of President Johnson's and one of our nation's proudest legislative achievements Medicare the landmark program to make sure seniors have access to health care and Medicaid equally critical helping low-income seniors children and people with disabilities get their necessary health health care I want to talk today about Medicaid others have spoken about Medicare Senator Casey did a good job about Medicaid and I want to do the same because I have seen the success of Medicaid as a mayor and as a governor and now as a senator it's absolutely critical in 2014 is Senator Casey mentioned Medicaid provided health coverage to nearly 70 million Americans including 1 million Virginians in Virginia about 600,000 children two out of every seven kids are covered through Medicaid or its companion program chip and Medicaid it's important and mr. president because you're a physician you know this Medicaid is not just about health care it's not just coverage to get you health care when you need it it's also about financial security because health bills often are the things that push families into bankruptcy or into financially stressful situations so the Medicaid coverage that covers 70 million Americans given financial security Medicaid's about peace of mind if you're completely healthy but you're going to sleep at night wondering what will happen if your wife is in an auto accident or if your kid gets ill that's a source of anxiety that is helped a little bit by having the coverage that Medicaid provides and it's also for people with disabilities this is important to note it's about independence a lot of with disabilities because they were able to be on Medicaid are able to work part time because Medicaid provides them a coverage that enables them to live independent lives that's what medicaid's about now today at 50 we think Medicaid is a given but let me remind everybody Medicaid was controversial when it was past 50 years ago in the House and Senate there were a lot of no votes and Medicaid was an opt-in program not a mandate states could decide whether to opt in or not and a lot of states chose we don't want to be part of Medicaid they they were the slowpoke States I think every family knows what I mean every family's probably got a slowpoke I got a sister-in-law frankly and with we're trying to go to church if we're trying to go to a restaurant if we're trying to go anywhere we can always count that whatever time we say we're going to go we will have this one family member who is likely to be the slowpoke and hold everybody back well states were like that in 1965 a lot of states wouldn't sign on to Medicaid by seven years later 1972 49 states and embrace Medicaid 49 states but the 50th state arizona didn't embrace medicaid until nineteen eighty-two it took him 17 years to embrace Medicaid eight Arizona was the original Medicaid slowpoke so Medicaid 50 years old controversial at first increasingly accepted later embraced this kind of sounds familiar to me the biggest change in the health care system since the signing of Medicaid Medicare was the Affordable Care Act the Affordable Care Act has so many benefits protecting people with pre-existing conditions rebating premiums back to folks if they have to overpay their health insurers making sure women don't have to pay differential premiums than men so many other benefits but the biggest benefit of the Affordable Care Act is that in the United States right now there are 16 million people walking around going to work being with their families who have health insurance coverage because of this expansion of Medicaid who didn't have it before 60 million people that is a very big number let me tell you what 16 million people is mr. president and friends in the chamber to to put it in perspective 16 million people have health insurance coverage because of the ACA who didn't have it before that is the combined population of Alaska Delaware the District of Columbia Hawaii Idaho main Montana Nebraska New Hampshire New Mexico North Dakota rhode island south dakota vermont west virginia and mr. president wyoming 15 states plus the District of Columbia their combined populations have coverage because the Affordable Care Act but there's more to do one piece of the ACA is the ability of states to expand medicaid to cover those who make up to sixteen thousand dollars a year it's optional like medicaid was in 1965 31 states have embraced the medicaid expansion but as of today we've got 19 slowpokes and i'm sad to say that virginia is one of the slowpokes despite the best efforts of our current governor working so hard to try to get the state to accept medicaid expansion the legislature so far has blocked him from doing so this is just like 1965 50 years ago there are states that get it and embrace the program and then there are the slowpoke States I'm here today not just to say happy birthday to Medicaid Medicare but to urge Virginia and the other slowpokes to get with the program here's what it would mean in Virginia if Virginia accepts the Medicaid expansion it would open up the possibility of health care coverage to another 400,000 people healthcare financial security independence for those with disabilities peace of mind even when you're well and if all 19 slowpoke States got on board an additional 4 million Americans would get health insurance which would take the ACA coverage number up to 20 million that's all the states i mentioned earlier plus the state of Nevada 16 states in the District of Columbia now you shouldn't be consigned to second-class health status in this country because you live in one of the 19 slowpoke states especially since your taxpayers are paying taxes to provide you coverage senator Brown and I have authored a letter signed by many in this body to the 19 slowpoke states and we've asked them to join the program during Medicaid's 50th year the program has an amazing legacy the program has a bright future don't be a slowpoke and mr. president is going to conclude and say this remember how I said that Arizona was the original slowpoke the last state 17 years later to embrace Medicaid in 1982 well they may have been the original slowpoke but when it came to the ACA they learn something Arizona with the Republican governor two Republican senators a Republican state legislature and overwhelmingly Republican congressional delegation voting for Republican candidates in presidential election Arizona is not a slowpoke Arizona has embraced the ACA there now a jackrabbit good for them I hope Virginia joins them soon I hope that all remaining 19 states join them soon and I hope that four million more Americans can have health insurance coverage with the health and financial security and peace of mind that that will provide Thank You mr. president and I yield the floor

I recognize mr. Sablan for five minutes um thank you very much mr. chairman and good morning everyone uh mr. Chairman I am I actually never left the subcommittee like I couldn't whenever the word ocean is I i I'm there and so I I'm glad to be back but thank you for holding throughout this today's hearing and while I cannot speak for the residents of Alaska and Cape Cod where there are petition spending with the administration to designate areas off of Alaska and Massachusetts I can speak to you about an existing national marine monument that surrounds the Northern Mariana Islands the district I represent and while some people may see the establishment of monuments as calling off commercial fishing access undermining domestic sea food supplies and associated jobs and harming the environment this is not entirely the case in the Marianas Trench marine national monument then president george w goose establish the marine buddy right Marianas Trench marine national monument by presidential proclamation in January of 2009 over 6,000 people in the Northern Mariana Islands supported the creation of the monument in a petition campaign to the White House and as I have said before we are justifiably proud of this world-class conservation area 95,000 216 square miles of submerged land and ocean waters the marine monument that President Bush establishes truth is truly a national wonder it includes the Marianas Trench the deepest point on earth it includes 21 undersea mud volcanoes and thermal vents harboring exotic forms of life in some of the harshest conditions imaginable a pool of liquid sulfur at the daikaku submarine volcano in the monument is one of only two known location locations of molten salts offer the other one is on Io one of the moons of Jupiter in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands we value the monument it is home to is ranging from reef-building corals to threaten sea turtles too unique deep-sea my animals protecting this and other special places from destruction is critical to scientific discovery a national natural resource management after the creation of the monument it was important to follow up it was important to follow up with education scientific research and exploration of this vast area and that is why I had introduced bill that would authorize the construction of a multi-purpose visitor center for the interpretation public education and enjoyment of the marine environment within the boundaries of the Marianas Trench marine national monument later I was able to secure funding through appropriations for the assessment of a possible visitor center site and last September and last year in September the Marianas Trench monument Advisory Council hosts a public meetings to gather ideas from the community regarding the purpose and location for a visitor center a final report has been drafted and is being reviewed by the Commonwealth Government management plans are also being hashed out especially as the commonwealth government and the federal government continues negotiations on the terms to coordinate management around the island islands unit which includes management of the waters a submerged lands of the three most northern three northernmost mariana islands back in 2015 were able address management measures to allow non commercial fishing including sustenance subsistence recreational and traditional indigenous fishing within the island units this was an important step prominence that harmonize the traditions of the people of the northern mariana islands who are at the same time to help protect and preserve valuable natural resource its location is different and any president considering establishing or expanding a marine monument shadow is thoroughly consider the benefit and impacts up to that area and i'll begin my line of questioning with dr.

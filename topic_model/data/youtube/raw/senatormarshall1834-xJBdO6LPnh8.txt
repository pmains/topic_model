now right away kansas senator raj marshall senator marshall welcome back sir let me just begin with this uh uh you are aware of course of this crazy reconciliation bill with um 750 billion in new taxes and 850 billion in new spending in total let me ask you this is there one thing that you can find that would ameliorate the problem in the oil and gas business we're still short a million barrels of oil we're still short a million barrels of gasoline we're not getting permits we're not getting refining permits we're not getting any of the permits we need pipelining is there any single thing that you can find that might have caused joe manchin to vote for this thing larry i'm afraid you're assuming that joe biden wants the price of gasoline to go down and i don't think he does he gave us biden inflation uh he's given us a biden recession now he has a tax hike and job-killing bill in front of us as well this these tax hikes alone are going to be detrimental to everybody it's going to raise the price of gasoline of groceries of rent and he's going to be killing jobs they're going to pass on those corporate taxes onto small businesses onto to the consumer and then they're not going to reinvest money but but no i don't see anything in here that's good for oil and gas and by the way energy is leading the way for inflation right now now i'm afraid it is i mean i'm just trying to figure out how this came about and why senator manchin uh decided to throw in with it but there may never be a an adequate explanation senator are you preparing i mean the cavalry is going to come we're going to take the house i hope we're going to take the senate you got any new thoughts i mean we've got to have a new economic agenda with supply side tax cuts and deregulation and things that you and i have talked about as spending freeze are you preparing for this regime change that we hope and pray is going to happen you know absolutely larry i mean what was tell me what was wrong with the trump tax cuts and the job bill i think it's making those uh those those issues permanent it's uh less taxes it's more it's more economic freedom you know we want to protect the environment but there needs to be a logical way to doing that as well we need affordable clean energy emphasis on the affordable part as as well but remember it's going to take 60 votes on the senate to get most anything done uh we've got to buckle down here and keep pushing back and fighting against the democrats right now well do you think this reconciliation bill will actually pass do you think there's 50 votes do you think kirsten cinema might rebel against it because it's got some very nasty tax hikes that she has opposed in the past yeah you know certainly senator cinema has a good head on her shoulder she's one of the sharpest people up here she's able to work behind the scenes i always tell people look to see what kirsten's wearing today she's wearing black i think she's a little bit upset i think she's a little bit upset that she wasn't included but that class ring you were talking about maybe you could ask senator cinema to go steady with you for the next couple of weeks i would it would be considerable because joe manson's broken my heart we're not going steady anymore i'm sorry to see it um what about this chips bill the 284 billion dollar i know the party is divided about it but you know what i would have i would have cut taxes for all industries uh rather than just single out you know corporate welfare for one industry or one company like intel what was it senator scott said so let me get this right intel made a lot of money last year we're going to give him a tax we're going to give him a subsidy we're going to give him a tax credit then we're going to give him a refundable tax credit and on top of that they can still do business with china i mean we could have done a little better on that don't you think sir yeah larry here's the hypocrisy we're giving subsidies to to the chip manufacturers tune of almost 300 billion dollars but then we're driving other corporations offshore by increasing their corporate tax does this make any logical sense to anybody uh certainly it doesn't and your listeners know better this is total hypocrisy um i'm just ashamed right now of what's going on up here all right keep the faith senator you know i'm going to bolster your spirits keep the faith the cavalry is coming america is great it's going to be okay santa raj and marshall kansas thank you sir we appreciate your time very much

  TIME AS I MAY CONSUME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. HUIZENGA: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. TODAY, MY DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES  ONCE AGAIN ARE SEEKING TO HIJACK OUR SECURITIES LAWS TO PUSH  LEFT-WING POLITICAL AND SOCIAL  AGENDAS. DESPITE DRESSING IT UP AS  INVESTOR PROTECTION ONCE AGAIN. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS BILL WILL  INCREASE COSTS ON PUBLICLY OWNED COMPANIES, DISCOURAGE PRIVATE  COMPANIES FROM BEING PUBLIC,  AND, FRANKLY, COULD ENCOURAGE  NOT ONLY PRIVATE COMPANIES TO  STAY PRIVATE BUT EVEN HAVE AND  ENTICE PUBLIC COMPANIES TO GO  BACK TO BEING PRIVATE COMPANIES. THIS IS GOING TO RESULT IN FEWER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR  EVERYDAY AMERICAN INVESTORS. ALSO KNOWN AS OUR CONSTITUENTS. WHO ARE SAVING FOR RETIREMENT, A COLLEGE EDUCATION, OR SIMPLY  LOOKING TO JUST BUILD A BETTER  LIFE. IN SHORT, THIS BILL WILL  INCREASE THE NUMBER OF  GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED, MANDATORY  DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON  PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. WHICH WILL INCREASE COMPLIANCE  COSTS ON COMPANIES AND DIVERT  COMPANY RESOURCES THAT COULD  HAVE BEEN USED TO CREATE MORE  JOBS. NOW, TO BE FAIR, THIS IS A JOB  CREATION BILL. HOWEVER, THE ONLY JOBS CREATED  BY THIS BILL WILL BE FOR SPECIAL TRAUNCH OF ATTORNEYS AND  CORPORATE COMPLIANCE  COORDINATORS AND THE OCCASIONAL  SCIENTIFIC. NOT EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE AND  ECONOMISTS WOULD CALL PRODUCTIVE TYPES OF JOBS. UNDER THIS BILL, PUBLIC  COMPANIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO  DISCLOSE ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL,  AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES AS WELL  AS, QUOTE-UNQUOTE, CLIMATE RISK. THESE METRICS WOULD BE SET BY  THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION, NOT CONGRESS. POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND  DONATIONS TO POLITICAL  CANDIDATES OR TRADE  ORGANIZATIONS BY EXECUTIVES,  THESE ARE DUPLICATIVE OF  EXISTING REQUIREMENTS, FOR  EXAMPLE. THE RATIO BETWEEN THE PAY RAISE, PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S  EXECUTIVES, AND THE PAY RAISE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE, THIS IS  THE RATIOS THAT DEMOCRATS PUT IN THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH IS  ESSENTIALLY A USELESS METRIC. AND FINANCIAL REPORTS FROM  MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES, THIS  WILL UP-END THE  COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY TAX REPORTING RULES OVERSEEN BY THE I.R.S. LET'S BE CLEAR, MY FRIENDS  ACROSS THE AISLE ARE USING THE  FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS TO  IMPLEMENT THEIR PARTISAN WISH  LIST OF SOCIAL POLICY  PRIORITIES. THEY'RE DOING IT THROUGH  MANDATORY DISCLOSURE REGIMES  WHICH WILL NOT BE LED TO  INVESTMENT DECISIONS. TO BE CLEAR, IF INFORMATION  PRESENTS A MATERIAL INVESTMENT  RISK TO A PUBLICLY TRADED  COMPANY, THE COMPANY IS -- WAIT  FOR THIS -- ALREADY REQUIRED TO  DISCLOSE IT. THAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE  FOR THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAVE  MATERIAL RISK. MATERIALITY HAS BEEN AND  CONTINUES TO BE THE TOUCH STONE  OF OUR PUBLIC COMPANY DISCLOSURE REGIME FOR MORE THAN EIGHT  DECADES AND HAS ACTUALLY BEEN  AFFIRMED BY THE U.S. SUPREME  COURT. IT HAS HELD THE TEST OF TIME AND WE SIMPLY CANNOT JUST DISCARD IT TO APPEAL TO THE DEMOCRATS'  PROGRESSIVE AGENDA. OUR CAPITAL MARKETS ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD IN NO SMALL PART  BECAUSE MATERIALITY IS THE BASIS OF OUR DISCLOSURE REGIME HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. YET, MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS  APPARENTLY WANT TO THROW IT ALL  AWAY TO APPEAL TO LEFT-WING,  QUOTE-UNQUOTE, STAKEHOLDERS. ADDITIONALLY, H.R. 1187 WILL  GREATLY EXPAND THE S.E.C.'S  JURISDICTION TO REQUIRE THE  S.E.C. TO PROMULGATE DISCLOSURES ON ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,  POLITICAL SPENDING, TAX  REPORTING, AND POLICY ISSUES,  AMONG OTHERS. THIS IS NOT THE SWEET SPOT FOR  THE S.E.C. IT DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE  IN ANY OF THESE ISSUES AND IS  NOT THE APPROPRIATE ENTITY FOR  DETERMINING THESE METRICS OR  INDUSTRY STANDARDS. NOR IS THE SECURITIES AND  EXCHANGE COMMISSION THE  APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO REVIEW AND ENFORCE SUCH DISCLOSURES. THE S.E.C. KNOWS HOW TO REGULAR  RATE MATERIALITY. THAT'S THEIR EXPERTISE. THEY'RE NOT CLIMATOLOGISTS OR  CLIMATE SCIENTISTS. THEY'RE NOT ELECTED -- ELECTION  LAW EXPERTS, AND THEY MOST  CERTAINLY DO NOT KNOW  INTERNATIONAL TAX LAW. THAT IS MY -- THAT IS THE  PURVIEW OF THE E.P.A., NOAA, THE THE F.C.C. AND THE I.R.S. AND COMPANIES WILL BEAR  FINANCIAL COSTS. THIS WILL IMPACT SMALLER  BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES,  ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING TO GO PUBLIC OR, MAYBE I SHOULD  SAY, WERE LOOKING TO GO PUBLIC. THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE THE  INFRASTRUCTURE OR RESOURCES TO  SPEND ON FIXED COSTS OF  COMPLIANCE LIKE THIS. H.R. 1187 WILL RESULT IN FEWER  INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR  AMERICAN INVESTORS. IT WILL DISCOURAGE PRIVATE  COMPANIES FROM BEING COMPANY AND ENCOURAGE PUBLIC COMPANIES TO GO PRIVATE TO AVOID THESE  BURDENSOME, NEW, NONMATERIAL,  AND USELESS DISCLOSURE  REQUIREMENTS. SADLY, THIS WILL HURT THE  EVERYDAY INVESTORS, OUR  CONSTITUENTS THAT THE DEMOCRATS  CLAIM THEY WANT TO HELP. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS BILL STANDS TO HARM EVERYONE SAVING FOR  RETIREMENT, A COLLEGE EDUCATION, OR JUST LOOKING TO BUILD A  BETT

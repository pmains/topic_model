I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN SAID IN THE SHORT TIME WE'VE BEEN ON THE FLOOR HERE THIS MORNING. WE DON'T JUST MAKE UP THIS LEGISLATION. WE HAVE A TRADITION OF REACHING OUT TO OTHER SENATE OFFICES. WE REACHED OUT TO ALL 100 SENATE OFFICES. WE ASKED EVERYBODY, DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, A COUPLE OF INDEPENDENTS, AND ASKED WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE PRIORITIZED? WE WOULD -- WE RECEIVED FEEDBACK AND INPUT I THINK FROM EVERY SINGLE OFFICE AND WE TRIED TO INCLUDE THAT INPUT IN THIS LEGISLATION. THIS IS VERY MUCH A COMMUNITY EFFORT AND FOR EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS, THANK YOU FOR DOING SO AND PUTTING US IN A POSITION TO VOTE AND HOPEFULLY IN AN AFFIRMATIVE WAY. BUT BEFORE WE DO VOTE, I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS ONE MORE TIME THE SUPPORT FOR T WRDA. IT IS A BIPARTISAN PACKAGE THAT ASSURES THE TIMELY REAUTHORIZATION OF THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS PROJECTS. IT EQUIPS THE CORPS TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM CLIMATE CHANGE, EXACERBATED EVENTS LIKE FLOODING AND DROUGHT. THIS IS A PRODUCT OF TIRELESS COMMITMENT TO BIPARTISANSHIP AND DOING THE RIGHT THING. SENATORS CAPITO, CRAMER, AND AROUND AND MYSELF HAVE FOUND A PATH FORWARD ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS JUST AS WE DID LAST YEAR ON THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT THE PRESIDENT SIGNED INTO LATE LAST YEAR. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE DONE THIS. IT WON'T BE THE LAST. THIS CONGRESS, THE ENVIRONMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE, HAS CONSISTENTLY ADVANCED BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION ON DRINKING WATER, LEGISLATION ON WASTEWATER, LEGISLATION ON TRANSPORTATION, ROADS, HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES, AND ON RECYCLING JUST TODAY -- JUST TODAY. ALL OF THOSE BILLS PASSED EPW UNANIMOUSLY, JUST LIKE THIS ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEER BILL PASSED UNANIMOUSLY. AS EPW CHAIRMAN, I'M QUITE PROUD OF THE COMMITTEE'S WORK. I JUST WISH THAT EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY WHO THINKS THAT ALL WE DO IS FIGHT AROUND HERE AND AGREE ON NOTHING, I WISH HE HAD HAD A CHANCE TO TUNE IN AND MAYBE BE A FLY ON THE WALL AND HEAR HOW WHEN YOU WORK TOGETHER, YOU CAN GET SOME AMAZING STUFF DONE ON REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS AS WELL FOR ALL OF OUR STATES, FOR EVERY CORNER OF THIS COUNTRY. A WORD, IF I COULD ABOUT THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. I'M A NAVY GUY. I SPENT 23 YEARS ACTIVE DUTY. LAST VIETNAM VETERAN SERVING HERE. I HAVE HUGE RESPECT FOR THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. I LIKE TO SAY DIFFERENT UNIFORMS, SAME TEAM. IN MY STATE, AND THE OTHER STATES, THEY DO EXTRAORDINARY WORK, SOMETIMES WITHOUT A LOT OF RECOGNITION OR THANKS, AND I JUST WANT TO SAY, WE RECOGNIZE YOU IN DELAWARE AND EVEN IN THE NAVY AND WE'RE DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK YOU DO AND COULDN'T DO A LOT OF WHAT WE DO WITHOUT YOUR HELP AND THIS LEGISLATION IS NEEDED TO -- FOR THE ARMY CORPS TO MEET THEIR SPOMENTS AND OBLIGATION -- RESPONSIBILITIES. WE'RE SO PROUD OF THE COMMITTEE'S WORK. WHAT A JOY IT IS TO WORK WITH SENATOR CAPITO. I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT HER STAFF -- NO, JUST JOKING. WE LOVED WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR TEAM AND WE FEEL REALLY PRIVILEGED. AND WE'RE PRIVILEGED TO BE LED ON OUR STAFF BY MARY FRANN SIS WEB -- MARY FRANCIS WHO HAS BEEN HERE FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AND I THINK SHE STARTED AT THE AGE OF 12. THE CORPS IS A PRINCIPAL STEWARD OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVES AS A PROCTOR OF OUR DIVERSE ECONOMY. THIS BILL WRDA 2022 RECOGNIZES THAT THE CORPS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR LIVES AND THIS BILL TAKES CRITICAL STEPS TO BETTER SUPPORT THE AGENCY TO SERVE ALL PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY. FROM NAVIGATION TO ECOSYSTEM REGULATION, THE CORPS IS THE BACKBONE AND FOUNDATION ON WHICH OUR COUNTRY IS BUILT. I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT EVERY PROVISION IN THIS BILL IS A RESULT OF BIPARTISAN WORK. I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT WRDA 2022 WILL BENEFIT EVERYONE FROM ALASKA TO KENTUCKY TO NEW YORK TO MARYLAND AND RURAL TOWNS AND EVERYPLACE IN BETWEEN. AGAIN, I WANT TO EXPRESS MY HEARTFELT THANKS TO THE STAFF ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, THE MAJORITY STAFF, AND TO SENATOR CAPITO'S STAFF ON THE MINORITY SIDE, THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. YOU CAN WALK INTO SOME OF THE MEETINGS WE HAD WITH SENATOR CAPITO AND MYSELF AND THE STAFF, AND IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO WORKED FOR WHOM, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW. I THINK IT IS A WONDERFUL THING. WITH THAT IN MIND -- I WANT TO THANK AGAIN MY STAFF FROM AND SENATOR CAPITO'S STAFF WHO WORKED SO HARD. I RECOGNIZE MARY FRANCIS AND THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE COMMITTEE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MURPHY, MAX, KIM, KATH LYNN, HAYDEN -- KATHLEEN, AHEADOR, JORDAN -- JANNINE AND JOHN KAINE, YOU ARE A FORCE OF NATURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT LEADERSHIP. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY AGAIN -- I ALREADY SAID THAT SO I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT AGAIN. I WANT TO THANK AMY KLEIN AND DAVID WETHINGTON OF THE CORPS FOR THEIR COUNTLESS HOURS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT AS THE BILL WAS DEVELOPED. IN CLOSING I WANT TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES TO JOIN US IN SUPPORTING THIS EXCELLENT BILL BECAUSE EVERY STATE STANDS TO BENEFIT FROM THE LEGISLATION BEFORE US TODAY. AND I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT,

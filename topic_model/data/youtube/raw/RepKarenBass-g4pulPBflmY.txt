so joining us now we have democratic congresswoman Karen bass she serves on the Judiciary Committee and is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus congressman great to have you first before we get to what happened yesterday and what will happen do you have some insight into what speaker Pelosi will be announcing at 9:00 a.m. this morning I am sorry I do not I am not sure what she is going to announce but I will be anxiously awaiting like everyone else so this came as a surprise to you at 5:30 a.m. and it did that's right okay well then that will be very interesting to hear what she has to say so let's talk about what happened yesterday you had a chance to question these four expert witnesses three from the Democratic side one from the Republican side and you did question all of them except Jonathan Turley and that was the Republicans witness and I'm just wondering since he's the person who's making the case basically that Democrats are going about this the wrong way why didn't you ask him a question well I was actually surprised by him I expected them to put forward a witness that would be much stronger in terms of advocating their case it seemed to me the only point that he was making is is that yes maybe he did commit an impeachable offense but you were going too fast and that you need more facts and I think that that's quite ironic because we have the possibility of getting a lot more information but the president has blocked it every step of the way that's in in the general sense the same argument that my Republican colleagues are making but if they want this situation to not go on as long or to take longer they need to get the administration to allow people to come forward and testify and to give the information that we're building on to that they're blocking I mean one way to get the administration to do that is through the court battle and I think what Jonathan Turley was saying was that when it comes to the subpoenas of Bolton and Giuliani say people with real first-hand witness why aren't Democrats aggressively pursuing in court well well I think first of all we have a number of court cases going on but we cannot allow that to be a distraction and we do already have an awful lot of information but I will just say to you that the urgency that I feel is that this president has attempted to intervene in the next election and he needs to be stopped immediately Rudy Giuliani right now is over in the Ukraine who knows what he's doing they might still be attempting to interfere in this election so I don't believe that we have the opportunity we have the ability to just wait for the courts we never know how long that is going to take I feel a sense of urgency we need to act now I understand the sense of urgency I understand the argument that Democrats are making but what I don't understand is dropping the subpoena for Kupperman and not pursuing one for Bolton why not do both at the same time well I'm you know that's a judgment of our leadership you know to me it would be great if Bolton would come forward he seems as though he wants to tease it I don't know if it's over his book deal he's you know hinted through tweets which i think is very inappropriate he should do the right thing and just come forward we shouldn't even need to subpoena him okay so let's talk about that timeline because obviously that's still enough standing question when do you think there will be a vote on a beach rent well I will tell you right now I do not know but I think it is very possible that there will be a vote if not before Christmas before the end of the year ok so that's a little bit later possible what we had was possible for house vote the week of December 16th you know I think that's possible now you know one of the things that we're waiting for is tomorrow we're waiting for the administration to decide whether or not they're going to participate in this process at all I would imagine that if they choose not to participate in this process that it will probably go quicker if they choose to participate if they're going to suggest witnesses that are appropriate then it might take a little longer so part of the ball is in their Court not ours okay and what about what will be included in articles of impeachment what are you all talking about in terms of will it just be solely based on Ukraine will there be some Russia mullah report threads well I will tell you in the judiciary in our committee we have not discussed yet what specific articles of impeachment will be so we will see I don't know I mean it could be a few I don't believe that there would be a ton of articles but we actually have not had that conversation yet so I mean can you just share with us what the feeling is about beyond Ukraine are we certainly that we certainly know that abuse of power we know that the president has abused his power I mean that's what we examined an awful lot yesterday I believe he's betrayed the Constitution and I also think that he has obstructed Congress I mean he won't cooperate with anything and then the mullah report certainly showed ten examples of obstruction of justice now whether or not those will be articles of impeachment in all honesty I can tell you that we have not had the specific discussion has a discussion come up about possible perjury involving the president's written answers to robert muller no that has not come up yet but you know there is one of one of the problems and one of our dilemmas is there is so much there's so much that this administration has done that the president has done I do think it's important that we focus but again the the sense of urgency to me is about the next election and it's also about our national security I mean I think it's difficult for us in the United States to imagine the situation that the president of Ukraine is in I mean he was a popularly elected president his ratings have gone down we have compromised his presidency this is a man who was under attack by another country Russia is occupying part of his territory and then the president had nerve enough to say well you know we have money your defense assistance but we need you to help us out first it's just incredibly inappropriate I believe it was illegal but I also believe that in the United States it's kind of hard for us to imagine the situation that this president is in and all of that compromises our national security but we do know over the last three years we know who this president and it's not the American people it's Putin well I mean there's a lot there the president obviously didn't state it in that conversation as overtly as you just did that would have made your job much easier there was a lot that was implied and that's what the Republicans say you can't hang your head on but you know what the president's acting chief of staff came out and told all of us to get over it he said that's the way foreign policy is done and you know I also served on the Foreign Affairs Committee and I will tell you that is not the way our foreign policy is done what is fundamentally wrong here is that the president pressured another head of state for his personal gain yes of course we leverage our assistance for on behalf of the United States but we know that that is not what the president was after it's not the way our foreign policy is conducted and I really think you know to see the three heads of state and NATO joke about the president we do need to understand that everybody jokes about the president if you go overseas and I travel a lot I meet with prime ministers and presidents and everybody ridicules what is happening in our country right now which is why I think if Pietschmann is important because it's important for us to demonstrate to the world we are a democracy and when a democracy like the United States is in trouble we have a vehicle to address the situation we're in and it is called impeachment it is important for us to demonstrate to the rest of the world that we can put this ship back in order Congressman Karen bass we really appreciate your taking time to be on new day thank you thank you

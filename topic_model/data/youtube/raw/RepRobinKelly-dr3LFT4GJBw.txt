our congresswoman okay all righty good morning and thank you all for joining us here this morning i'm so excited for our conversation today for those of you who don't know my name is congresswoman robin kelly and i represent proudly the second district of illinois in congress and i also serve the congressional black caucus as the cbc health brain trust chair and i'm one of the co-chairs of the congressional caucus and founders on black women and girls and i'm so excited to be here with phenomenal women during black history month i cannot think of a better group of women to join me here today to celebrate black history month and discuss the effects of health inequities on our communities and how we move forward from covet 19. it's so important for us to have this discussion this morning because it's not every day that we as black women get the opportunity to bask in our own black girl magic and i'm here to say it's more than magic black girl talent black girl determination black girl intelligence especially after a year we we were credited with saving our democracy without power as a voting bloc we accomplished this with great courage and determination and in the middle of a pandemic i'd like to introduce you to miss angela williams ceo of ins of easter seals an organization that is headquartered in my home district of chicago and serves the needs of many disabled individuals across the country welcome miss williams ms stacy stewart ceo of the march of dimes who's worked with the crucial newborn and pregnant population is respected nationwide her role is so important has helped me in my work in congress for fighting maternal health and i'll just throw in miss tracy brown my soror and ceo of american diabetes association uh welcome to you and i know we will be joined by miss linda blangoller ceo of the black women's health imperative the go-to organization on all issues related to the health and well-being of black women and we've worked with linda uh so many times over the years that i've been in congress i want to thank you ladies for being here i'd like to turn to you for a few words of introduction and let's start with you angela then stacy then linda and then tracy uh you can close it out so um angela thank you so much congresswoman kelly and i just want to thank you and your staff for being so gracious to host us today this is such an important and critical time in our nation's history and it's an honor and a privilege to be here during black history month 2021 to really lift up our voices and talk about critical issues that are affecting our community as the national ceo and president of easter seals which is a disability organization i'm just really privileged to be an advocate for those that are living with disabilities there are 61 million americans in this country one in four individuals that are living with disability and of that one in four one in four are african-american when we think about disability we we tend to think about physical disabilities or disabilities that we could actually see but disabilities are both visible and invisible they range anywhere from what you were born with at birth whether it's a physical or in an intellectual or developmental disability it could be as a result of an injury or an accident or it could be simply a part of the aging process easter seals is serving as the 102nd year anniversary we serve individuals throughout the lifespan from early childhood intervention to seniors and all all in between what's so unique about our organization is that we sit at the intersection of health care education and workforce development all three are vitally important um for the african-american community and what we saw and with the advent of covet 19 was all three of those being disrupted in a very real way that's extremely um that has been i think a setback for for for african americans and so i look forward to this conversation and having the ability to talk about it we also at easter seals serve veterans and their families and the last thing i would say and this has been part of the disruption is that people of color serve as direct service providers or caregivers for people with disabilities they have suffered enormously whether it's with the loss of jobs lack of ppe etc so i look forward to our conversation today to really uh dig into some of these issues even more thank you so much angela stacy would you like to great work thank you so much absolutely just uh taking myself off mute um it's so great to be with you thank you for hosting uh representative kelly and uh it's really nice to be joined by such dynamic women and who are doing great things in health and public health and for our country so it's great to be here with all of you all my name is stacey stewart i'm president of ceo of march of dimes and we are the leading organization really fighting for the health of all moms and babies a lot of people know march times because of a former public health crisis that we faced um in the earlier part of the last century polio and uh martian sits at the very crux of being in the business of solving that major public health crisis that we had then funding the vaccine that really effectively brought polio to an end and here we are today in the midst of another pandemic and here the march times is really working on a leading public health crisis today and that is the state of health for our moms and babies today in this country it's sad to to think about the fact that every single day two women will die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth and every single hour a baby will die and that is really a striking um those are striking statistics to think about especially in a country that spends as much as we do on health care and to be the one the wealthiest countries in the world we are considered today to be one of the most dangerous fellow nations in the world which should give birth a black woman today is three to four times more likely to die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth we have a crisis for all women but it's especially true that we have one for women of color especially black women and a crisis for our babies as well where our black babies are still twice as likely to die before their first birthday so we're really um facing a tremendous crisis that a lot of people don't uh are really not as aware of the fact that and don't assume that we would have these kinds of outcomes in the united states of america but we do and part of our work at the marsh times is to raise awareness of these issues we've been really honored to work with representative kelly who has been a tremendous leader in congress raising the awareness and and really galvanizing her congressional colleagues to become involved in these issues for maternal infant health but health overall and so we are greatly appreciative of her efforts one of the things that we know and i think all of us can touch on this all the speakers today is that a lot of us think about health in in the form of health care health coverage and things like that but it's really important to understand even as it relates to maternal infant health that the biggest component of what determines our health isn't what happens in the in the doctor's office or in the clinician's office it's actually how we live the safety and health of our communities whether or not we have access to good nutrition whether that we have access to safe peace and affordable housing all of these things that we call the social determinants of health and so i'm really looking forward to this conversation where we can really address how we improve health overall for for everyone in this country especially for people of color by looking at those other components of what can determine our health overall and ensure that we address all those issues understand what are the underlying causes for these social determinants being such major factors in determining our health um especially as it relates to those communities that just that are disproportionately impacted by many of the outcomes that we're facing today so thanks for allowing me to be a part of this conversation and looking forward to questions and answers and a great dialogue so thank you thank you so much stacey and you know we're so committed uh in particular to the maternity maternal mortality issue uh devastation i would say in the united states thank that uh welcome linda i already talked about you a little bit but we would like you to take about three minutes to uh for an opening statement and introduce yourself okay well thank you um congresswoman kelly and to my esteemed colleagues and and for your patients with some technical difficulty um i'm linda goldberg president and ceo of the black women's health imperative and this is year 39 for us being the only national organization focused on the health and wellness of black women physically emotionally and financially and and so honestly as as my my sister colleagues have said you know this couldn't occur at a more important time in our history the black women's health imperative was founded as as a self-care organization um and billy ave brought 2 000 of her closest friends together onto spelman's campus to talk about how we should take care of each other but more importantly how we should take care of ourselves and practice self-care and that has informed all of our work um for all of these 39 years and now as we kind of look at what's happening um this notion of intersectionality is really highlighted black women we've seen now live at the intersection of of racism um of economic oppression of health disparities and it is playing it's playing out in in our health as we see 2020 will go down as a year of heightened ptsd we we've already seen plenty of examples of how black women are suffering from stress from seeing graphic police and violence from losing close relatives loved ones to covet 19 to facing an angry unmasked public for those of us who don't have the privilege of working from home our research has shown that actually mental health and stress is the number one health issue for black women and when we look at something like covet 19 where we're in not only contracting it but dying it at two to five times the rate of white people depending on what city you live in it becomes really apparent how serious this is a year ago people weren't paying a lot of attention to black women as you know suddenly we became essential suddenly we're on the forefront because we're the ones taking public transportation to work we're the one working the jobs of front line workers we're the ones who don't have that benefit of being able to force people to wear masks around us and so that has increased our exposure but all of this that we are seeing you know is not new um we it was predictable back in march when when all of this really started and all this stems from frankly 400 years of historical legalized oppression and so that's why the work of easter seals and the american diabetes association and march of dimes is so critically important right now because all of this work not only speaks to the health of the woman the mom the caregiver but literally the community what we're doing keeps our communities vibrant and resilient and that's why the black women's health imperative has programs to prevent chronic disease and hiv maternal mortality and to ensure reproductive justice and that's why we provide evidence and research and information so black women can make the best health care decisions for themselves and their families and that's why we work with congresswoman kelly and the congressional black caucus so that we can make sure that policies are developed enacted and enacted that place black women at the center that promote health that eliminate barriers to doing what we want to do anyway which is to be as healthy as possible and that's why this conversation is so important because last year i heard probably like many of you from so many folks i had no idea i had no idea health disparities was a thing i had no idea racism was a thing i had no idea that racism and health disparities were related we've been talking about this for a very long time so i'm really excited about this opportunity to have a conversation so that we can look at the issues so that we can start developing the policy solutions and the program and practice solutions that we've all been working on for years and so that no one can say anymore i had no idea thank you thank you thank you so much london wow 39 years and i said before you got on how we work with your office so much and you've been uh such a resource to us so thank you so much and last but certainly not least tracy brown if you want to give us a few words before we get into the conversation and the questions absolutely uh congresswoman kelly is always a blessing uh to be with you and thank you for hosting and bringing us all together and to the other phenomenal leaders on this zoom call it's a pleasure to be uh working together to drive some change and certainly as we think about uh black history month um i would be remiss not to talk about dr carter g woodson who is the founder of black history month and really over a century ago he wanted black history month to be a vehicle to drive transformation and social change and that again couldn't be more relevant today than it was a hundred years ago uh as the ceo of the american diabetes association one of the things that i talk about is that you can't talk about improving the health and well-being of people in this country uh people of color in this country without talking about diabetes and you certainly can't talk about increasing the health and well-being of people of color in this country without talking about health inequities uh when you think about the fact that one out of two people in this country are living with diabetes or pre-diabetes and every two minutes somebody's dying uh or having a stroke from diabetes and it's complications every four minutes somebody's losing a limb and every 10 minutes somebody's having kidney failure and if you're a person of color those numbers get astronomically worse and so we have to ask ourselves are people of color genetically sicker the answer is no right we we we've heard that already this is about the inequities uh and as linda has has talked about the the 400 years uh of policy uh procedures legislation mental models all of that and so the only way we are actually going to allow great health and great access to health care because that's a human right everyone deserves that right regardless of the color of your skin the only way we're going to do that congresswoman kelly is we have to continue to work together to drive what we talk about is ground water solutions uh what we're talking about this inequity is in the groundwater and so that's part of the reason the american diabetes association is leaning in and leaning in hard on our health equity now platform and we can't do it alone it's going to take all of us to get that done and so i'm excited to get get straight into it congresswoman thank you so much tracy and you know those statistics as we say uh they might be shocking but as was mentioned but they're not surprising because this has been going on um forever i know uh your organization sent to open letter to president biden and bp harris asking that the administration continue working to end covet 19 and prioritizing and addressing and ending health disparities by responding to the health care needs of black americans ensuring quality and affordable health what quantifiable changes would you like to see come from the administration and how can they engage with organizations like yours to ensure these changes are enacted you can jump in well i'll start by just saying that from the lens of disability but i think it applies to everyone and we've we've heard it already about access to quality health care and ensuring that the aca is strengthened that's extremely important then we heard stacy talk about the social determinants of health we know for example people black folks tend to live in food deserts there there is the issue of transportation there is the issue around quality education one of the most important things for example is medicaid medicaid exists to serve those in critical need of supports long-term supports and services whether it's people with disabilities seniors and others what what i'm concerned about is that as congress continues to look at budget cuts and especially with the the huge outpouring of um money over the last year or so they're going there there's going to be this this push to look for budget cuts and reckon budget reconciliation and all those things that you know so well the concern that i have is that this will be done at the expense of medicaid i've already talked about the fact that uh direct care support providers and caregivers they are currently grossly underpaid and reimbursed the reimbursement rate from medicaid is extremely low we continue to see turnover rates of anywhere from 40 to 50 percent of caregivers to me that's a national crisis and to me that begs for a solution and i'll stop but i will just say that when it comes to education funding education programs and and then we talked about even social justice criminal justice reform we see that if kids and especially black kids and especially black boys are labeled and they're not identified with having an intellectual or developmental disability and the intervention process is not started then what we see is a public school to prison pipeline so again there are just so many many intertwined issues that have to be addressed and congress needs to take a look at these seriously and and i would say i would add to that that we it we have to start with the assumption that racial and ethnic disparities and inequities will occur i mean we always see that and there's a there's this old saying in medicine effective technologies are always disparities producing because those who have resources get the effective technologies first and so as as you do congresswoman kelly you start with what will the impact be on the lived experiences of a population and if legislators start with that and and start with the assumption that disparities will occur then that can reframe the way they approach the work so in in science for example you know i want to see diversity requirements enforced for clinical trials i want to see more high-level grants go to researchers of color because what becomes evidence depends on who's asking the questions and who they're asking and i want to see reimbursement i mean you know angela's talking about medicaid i am absolutely in agreement but i want to see reimbursement for hospitals and providers connected to quality outcomes by race and ethnicity because i guarantee you if hospitals were reimbursed on the basis of their black maternal health outcomes we would see the black maternal death rate drop and you know talking about public education we need to see a public education system where child achievement isn't tied to poverty because that guarantees low achievement if we if we're only funding our schools on the basis of income taxes property income taxes then we're already building in inequities we've learned so much in the last year and it's it's rare when we get a chance to predict the future but this is one of those opportunities and so now we have an opportunity not to repeat the past mistakes and actually create a new future for ourselves and our community yeah i'll jump in there to uh congresswoman and kelly we we have to continue to um lean on these legislation and policy changes so again if you just take a look at uh some of the recent data fifty percent uh of low low-income americans with diabetes have lost some of their income right now one in five people are choosing between whether they buy food pay the rent or get the diabetes medications that they need 43 of people have delayed their their care uh diabetes care and that that's deadly as someone who's living with diabetes you just can't do that and one out of four people are rationing either their insulin or their oral medication or testing their blood sugars these things are deadly and so when you start to think about what we're trying to do and needing to do uh collectively with congress we've got to drive uh access uh first and foremost everybody needs to have access and you know i've heard you know with covet telehealth and all of those things these are all good things but they also have to be reimbursable and so we are continuing to work with congress on those things you actually have to have uh the ability to have affordable care um again and so we are asking for when you think about the number of people who have lost their jobs right now this this notion of continuity of health care coverage becomes a very very critical uh component and piece of the equation because we know insurance correlates to uh your ability to live a healthy thriving life and then when you talk about nutrition nutrition and diabetes inexplicably linked we've got to do more the number of food deserts and food swaps that are in this country and particularly in the zip codes for people of color it's unfathomable and so we've got to do more actually to disrupt that and then finally when you just talk about the copic testing and the vaccines getting into the neighborhoods that actually need it these are the the pieces of legislation that we are leaning in with on congress to kind of drive we've got to get the funding we've got to get the access into the neighborhoods uh that need it most and representative kelly if i could just add to to that and all the points are extremely well taken i just want to take a step back because i think um and tracy you may have mentioned i think you did mention earlier when we talk about inequities there's often this sense of of um that we have so many inequities or disparities in communities of color because of something genetically wrong with um with communicable and that's just simply not true um if we ask the question when in this country in the history of this country have we ever provided equal access to affordable high quality health care for everyone especially and including indigenous people um you know descendants of the formerly enslaved people you can honestly say that that has actually never happened we have never happened people of color have never had access um to high quality affordable care in this country ever and on top of it living with the kinds of experiences stemming from racism discrimination a whole host of things that have impacted our social systems that have inc that have um created this environment in which we live in situations that don't produce uh you know the best health outcomes we've been living for hundreds of years in a situation that this country has never had the will to address only only by investing and through policy change are we going to be able to really address the health inequities that we see and that is true for maternal and have been health so we've been calling for through our campaign hashtag blanket change um a and inviting communities and organizations to come together to demand holistic policy change blanket changes comprehensive change for maternal and infant care but frankly it's in many ways to address so many other topics that we're talking about today whether it's around diabetes or other kinds of issues because if we fix the underlying issues around our social determinants we can actually solve a big chunk of improving health outcomes we're fortunate right now that vice president kamala harris before she became vice president was one of the biggest champions in the senate for maternal infant health legislation we're so excited that the omnibus act addressing maternal and infant health especially maternal health improvement over time a whole host of bills that have been reintroduced into the house is well on its way with the leadership of folks like representative alma adams representative underwood representative kelly you are a big part of that as well as so many others you know a whole host of different things that look at expanding medicaid is so important extending medicaid postpartum because it doesn't help if you've got chronic health conditions and you get dropped from medicaid two months after your baby is born but you're still dealing with issues around diabetes or hypertension or other kinds of chronic health challenges and you cannot get to affordably to seek care even paid family leave is a huge issue for us because these are the kinds of policies that have already been in place in many highly industrialized countries and we know they work so taking a more evidence-based approach collecting good data leveraging technology if there's one thing that pandemic has shown us is that we just can't go back to business as usual we need to figure out how to reach people for the half of all the counties in this country that lack or have very limited access to maternity care affecting millions of women of child bearing age we we should no longer accept that women don't not only do they not have health coverage they may not even be able to see a um a high quality health care provider within an hour of where they live and that and nor may they be able to access it through any virtual means either so again we should take this lesson this pandemic but we should also not forget that for many many decades we've been living with a situation which this country has failed to confront the very essence of why we have these health inequities in the first place and that is because we have systemically failed to invest in the people in in in this country with respect to their health outcomes and we've absolutely failed to do that for communities of color and that's exactly what our organization the march now just is largely about is making sure we advocate for those changes alongside these other tremendous organizations that we're talking with today thank you so much and i'm happy to say you know we had all of our markups and the expanding uh medicaid to a year uh made it through in the reconciliation and energy and commerce and we'll we'll be voting on it when we return this week so i am very thrilled about that you know we still want to push the different parts of our mama's act too we're still not giving up on that and best practices and those kind of things at this time i'm returning over to my senior advisor and my everything health person nicole and she has some questions for you guys so nicole thank you congresswoman and thank you again um ladies for just being here to join uh joining us here today um you know it's so inspiring for a young person like myself who didn't expect to be speaking today to be surrounded by women such as yourself the congresswoman uh miss williams miss blunt miss brown ms stewart if if you ladies would like to weigh in a bit about what it's like to be a woman of color in positions uh you know at the at the top of your of your fields um you know congresswoman is a vice chair of the energy and commerce uh committee and and you ladies are ceos if you could just talk to young black women like myself and tell us like how did you get here and and what advice can you give to the younger generations who are coming uh your way it's blunt i'll pick you first you'll pick me first okay um well i i'm just thrilled that there are young women like you nicole who are interested in the subject matter you know not everybody can bring policy to life and congresswoman kelly is one of the rare numbers of people who can actually make it really relevant but but it is because it determines as you've heard access it determines what our our cities look like what our experiences can look like and and you know as stacy said you know we're talking about policy that has to combat hundreds of years of legalized oppression but but i would say you know just from my own experience having come through the sciences um epidemiology you know it was a bit of a struggle because you know back then um black people were not assumed to be competent in science we know that is ridiculous but i faced personally a lot of questioning a lot of doubt a lot of second guessing because i wanted to be in the science i mean i literally in my public health program had a professor say well you know black people really don't do bio statistics very well um so so i mean that's you know sort of in your face racism um and of course you know it didn't hold me back but the the issue for all of us i mean being in georgia where i am and i'm having the privilege of of being able to support and stacey abrams and watch what state stacey abrams did here underscores the importance of understanding the issues understanding what's happening in your community being able to ask the right questions i mean we we all of us on this call now expect agency and capability from black women and black people and as dear sister of mine said you can either look at people through the lens of the problem or you can look at problems through the lens of people and we all have decided to start with people and by definition we start with people we don't start with the problems and we have all elevated our work to that end and you know for you and and young women young men coming along it's you know understand the issues you know i kind of kept my head down i worked hard like a lot of us but like a lot of us i also had luck somebody had to open the door for me and we then are opening the doors for those who are coming behind us the fight continues it's not over but what i tell young black women is you know having been in private industry as well as in public health is help those around you you know i understand competition but you can compete with compassion make sure that you are bringing folks along with you because there's not nearly enough of us in the room where it's happening and we need more of us and you know just one thing i would say despite all that rest more play the long game i needed to be a little less headstrong perhaps as a young person but understand that this is a long journey and make sure that you stay in contact with those around you nicole thank you for that question um linda i love that compete with compassion that is awesome and you know i think um a lot of young people look at women you know in sort of our positions and think oh gee that's what i want to do well let me tell you on a daily basis you know it's a lot that comes with with the job i mean um you know to whom much is given much is is respected demanded and required and you know it is a it is a full-time commitment um through your professional life your personal life when you take on a position to lead not only uh you know complex organizations but just lead on on incredibly important topics and to be a voice and sometimes a lone voice um for some of the things that that your organization stands for and what you believe in um you know i think it is a tremendous honor um i did not unlike linda and maybe others i did not come to this position of leading march of dimes because of a background in public health i really came to it because i went to business school and studied business and worked on wall street for a while and worked in corporate america for a while and and then but all along even when i was working on wall street i worked in an area called public finance which was the combination of my finance training and doing good for the public and so in my career i had made a decision early early on in my early 20s that whatever i did in my life i would have to not only do something that i felt was uh drew on the the things i was interested in around economics and in how communities work and how the economy works and how businesses work but that whatever i did would have to do good for others um that i knew i wasn't going to be able to live with myself it was if it was just about making money for others or myself that i would have to spend my talents doing something good for others and that eventually led me to even this this role in a non-profit organization leading a non-profit organization in fact this is the third nonprofit organization that i've been the president ceo of um in my career and i can tell you this is absolutely the most rewarding experience because i am a mother i am a black woman and to be able to take my role and and have it um apply to women and babies overall and especially focus on women and babies that look like me and my my little girls when they were little but they're big now uh it's just really you know an incredible honor and a duty and and and that's what drives me every day i think just aligning that personal passion with your professional pursuits uh it's always been something that i've cared deeply about and i've been more focused on whether or not i'm i'm doing that work successfully than how i'm advancing my career i always felt like at the end of the day god would put me in a place to do the most good for the most people and i think that's what has happened and i wish every day and i hope every day i'll continue to be able to to do that and provide that service to others so that's how i look at where i where i've been and where i am right right now awesome and you know i'll jump in nicole and just uh quickly uh agree with what has already been said and just say that um i am encouraged and i'm inspired by by young people my my hope is is that the young people will continue to grab the mantle and drive uh much needed continual transformation and change and and when you think um certainly about the number of african-americans that have left a a positive imprint on this world through the social and transformative change they have made over the history of this country um i am encouraged by young people so i i want to encourage you to um take that mantle and and what i will say is is for for me um it goes back to purpose passion and position uh like like linda uh you know i i i'm a chemical engineer so so the sciences and and having curiosity so i encourage people to continue to have curiosity uh because this is this is how we're going to solve a lot of these tough problems but everyone is is is born uh i believe with a divine purpose um and i think that you need to to examine yourself and and truly understand what is uniquely nicole here for because you have a unique uh purpose a god-given purpose circle it on that then the passion where do you have passion what actually motivates you and brings you life and then your purpose your passion and your position align it with your position look you can do anything you want to do i you know my mom's always said you can do anything and we can so find the position that aligns with your purpose and passion so i spent 30 years in the for-profit space working for some of the largest organizations uh in the world walmart exxon procter gamble and the like and it wasn't until my five-year-old daughter she's now 17. asked her mommy if her mommy was gonna die from diabetes uh that was the life change for me and that was a change that said where should i be having where should i be having an impact where am i going to live my imprint in the world and decided that i was not okay with the plight of what was happening with diabetes and and more importantly the plight of what was happening with diabetes for people of color in this country and i made the jump from for-profit into the non-profit space so i say all of that to say uh nicole purpose passion and position uh line it up and just uh keep carrying that mantle for us i just want to say one thing and that is find your voice and use it and it doesn't matter what age you're at if you find your voice your authentic voice and know who you are then you are empowered to do all the things that my fellow panelists just talked about and it doesn't matter what age and we can start by by equipping our young girls to have that self-confidence to know who they are and to be bold and also just to be courageous in terms of facing issues that that we are confronting and it doesn't matter at what age i remember in from elementary school to junior high to high school i was always fighting the fight i was always fighting for equity and in in undergrad and then in law school so i just want to say that uh all of us are seated here on the shoulders of other women and men that have have gone before us but we sit here today waiting to just propel those of you that are coming behind us to the next level to run faster than we run fast to disrupt even more than we've been disruptive and to really help to solve for a number of these issues that we're talking about today because they are solvable if there's a will we can do it we're taking again this moment in time to to have to fulfill each of our kingdom purposes and that is to use our unique gifts and talents and our treasure to do more for the people that look like us number one but also those that don't look like us and that's the piece that we're trying to to convey over and over again we don't have to be divided by tribe that's unnecessary this is the richest country in the world the united states of america has the ability to uh to create an equitable inclusive platform where all are welcomed and all voices can be heard thank you so much ladies that is that means so much to a young person like myself and i know many other women who are out there listening and i just want to in the few minutes that we have left with the congresswoman transition a little bit to our discussions about covet 19 and the effect that it's taking on the different communities that you all serve how can congress better engage with your patient populations for disseminating information about town halls vaccine information and overall health focused information you know we have a lot of folks out there who are hesitant to take the vaccine because of how quickly it was developed and they don't feel that they can trust it what is the best way for us to communicate with your constituencies to get the information out about different health issues well i would say this is one a great example of how to do this regular briefings talk about the data truthfully collect the data i mean we still are not collecting all of the data that we need so we don't have a complete picture so that is one of the things that that i know congresswoman kelly and her colleagues are concerned with is making sure we have the data but we also can take a page out of the congresswoman's book and really understand not only what the pandemic and the economic fallout means but what racial equity would mean for our communities if it were achieved i mean she can paint the picture for what life could look like what the lived experiences can look like and that's the goal we should all be working toward and if if the congresswoman and her colleagues can continue to to talk about here's what life would look like you know angela i love that this is this is not just for us and also this is not also not our problem to fix all by ourselves but this takes everybody so we all had that shared vision and communicated it with facts with evidence with truthfulness with with compassion then we all could be could at least be headed in the same direction and however we get there whatever vehicle we choose that's fine but we know where we're going and if we had that shared vision of equity imagine what that would do for us if i could just say that you know we're facing um a particular challenge um with respect to the vaccine and pregnant women because pregnant women were not initially involved in the clinical trials and when we look at clinical trials for any kind of vaccine or drug you know it's important that we can point to certain populations and those including the trials to know for sure or with some high degree of certainty that the vaccine is effective and works and is safe for those that might ultimately receive the vaccine in the case of pregnant women because pregnant women were not involved in the trials we definitively have not been able to say to pregnant women we've seen it it's been proved in the clinical trials that it is safe and effective so we have for a while now have been in a very difficult position us and acog and many others have been encouraging pregnant women to receive the vaccine when it's their time um we know based on how that these two vaccines the fires of the modern vaccine were developed um that there is a very low likelihood of any kind of any kind of challenges that pregnant women would receive if they um are able to access the vaccine but again we're we're using an old methodology of clinical trials not including pregnant women and of course there may have been very good reasons and have been very good reasons for pregnant women not being included but i can just say that we're very excited that fives are announced last week they would start including pregnant women and trials that will give us more ability congresswoman to be able to go to women and pregnant women and ease their minds and calm their nerves about whether or not it's safe to get the vaccine whether or not it will harm them or their unborn baby and and we just believe pregnant women should not have to be dealing with that in the midst of a global pandemic where we know women pregnant women are a much higher rate of con if they contract covid of having severe illness so here pregnant women are faced with either i could get covet and really have an even likelier chance of something you know some really really bad outcomes happening or get a vaccine that i really don't know and not sure if i can trust and that just really isn't you know unbearable sort of position for pregnant women to be in so we're glad to see more evidence come through hopefully soon that will be able to show pregnant women um you know that they can be protected in fact might will be doing a good thing for themselves and their babies if they do get the vaccine the last thing i'll just say is that you know we're going to have to do more to overcome the historic um distrust that many people of color rightfully have about the medical field about medicine itself we understand where these issues come from um but you know i i was on i had a discussion with andy young and former ambassador and young last week who said you know i've been vaccinated a whole for a whole lot of things in my life and i'm here at 89 years old doing fine and at some point we just have to accept that yes the past has often not treated us well but that should mean that we should disregard the science of today and listen to the people who look like us who look at these issues and be willing to go on their word to understand that what we're doing is protecting ourselves and our communities and that the the science is there the evidence is there and we can trust it for where it is today and we should encourage everyone in our communities to get the vaccine when it's their time because our life depends on it and we should not be at a disadvantage with respect to access the vaccine any more than any other person's country in fact we should be you know we should be able to be advantaged in this whole process because of the kind of disproportionate impact that covet 19 is having on us so you know we're hoping that just more and more of us can be out there championing this and making sure that more and more folks like us can get access to the vaccine when and if it's available for them and i just quickly asked stacey to your point our communities are being ravished by this and rightfully so there is uh the distrust that exists i mean for far too long our health has been ignored and even abused in the name of science so we we get that um but also this point about weighing the risk of taking the vaccine versus being infected by covet 19. again when you look at the data people with diabetes are six times likely to be hospitalized 12 times likely to die 40 of the deaths from covet 19 came from people with diabetes again you overlay on that that the disproportionate number of people living with diabetes are people of color that the numbers uh are are horrible and so to your point i think we all have an obligation to get the right fact science-based information out there in people's hands um yes the vaccine was was developed quicker than ever before but technology has also improved um you know testing uh did include uh people of color uh on these trials we had scientists all across the the country and the world of multiple races uh participating in developing of this vaccine uh there there were people of color on the review panel for the fda i mean so we've got to take all of the data that is out there and and use that to to make the right decisions i too support uh the vaccine i read a report where 35 of african americans just 35 saying that they would take the vaccine when a large majority of us in our communities are dying that's actually not okay so we've got to continue to get the data out there you can go to we have a covet 19 uh page on diabetes.org that has information but i agree we have to take a page out of congresswoman kelly's uh book and and all you know get out there town halls get into these communities people need to see people like us talking about this willing but the right data's got to be out there there's so much misinformation out there and that's the scary part so i am in line to get that vaccine as a person living with diabetes um you know we're still finding to get people living with type 1 diabetes also has to be prioritized but i'm going to be there based off the data and the science that i have seen just something i want to say i just looked at the chat just briefly but in my understanding is that a number of of states are pushing into black communities and working with black churches and black organizations to get the vaccines to people that need them and also i have not seen that that there's necessarily a requirement that you have insurance coverage so i just want to clarify that there is the opportunity and there is a push for everyone um to get vaccines but if i have misspoken i would say look at any of the websites that all any of our websites just to make sure that you get the correct information the second thing i just want to say is that we want to continue to push for a diverse clinical trials and for diverse researchers to divert to research diverse populations and so that as the story is being researched it's not told by one particular lens experience or viewpoint so i'm hoping that as the congressional black caucus is looking at doing some research on the impact of code 19 on the on the black community that there are researchers of color that are participating in that and and i would just say even when you're looking at um subsections whether it's people with disabilities or it's people with diabetes or whether it's women or mothers that um i think i would say for all of our panelists we stand ready to partner um with you in this effort because again this is a moment in time where we can affect change and it's important that we address a lot of these issues that are right before us they've always been there but now they're uncovered and we need to move forward and so i i really do hope that this is part of a continued movement towards equity and you just want another great point is that you should not be charged for the vaccine so i would just encourage people if they're being charged to make that public if you're on social media let folks know that you should not be charged um and one just in in the spirit of sort of the facts on our youtube channel there is a video about the vaccine and what it is and what it isn't so it really helps explain what happens when you get the vaccine and what what you can't expect so we're doing our part like you know all of you to try to educate so that from our perspective black women can make the best decisions for themselves and their families thank you so much ladies and and um thank you so much for pointing out that the vaccine will not be um there will not be a charge people um who do not have insurance will be able to receive the vaccine uh with with no need for an insurance or or any payments um in the last few minutes that we have if you ladies have very quickly any parting advice to the audience as a call to action um please share that with us um before we before we depart let uh let the congresswoman and the rest of you go on about your day i'll just real briefly um read our policy agenda read our pandemic guide on our website it has lots of resources but importantly know the economic and health data in your community so you know what equity looks like and when it's not happening and pay attention to what your elected officials are doing at the state and national level unfortunately they're not all like congresswoman robin kelly but um she gives you a great basis for a comparison and if they're not what their work what the work they're doing is not promoting equity let them know and then just for everyone on on this call and everyone listening remember to breathe and i would just say again easterseals.com we have ways to get engaged you can receive our grassroots alert action alerts to to notify your local congressperson if there's something that affects people with disabilities and we want you to be engaged and use your voice and your and your power to be able to affect change obviously voting is important in voting um uh with with those that are willing to do the right thing for um for all of our constituencies and not just for a few and finally i i would say uh just just quickly as well that um there are multiple levels to to these groundwater solutions um and to the point that was made use use your voice um to help drive the necessary change um and i'd also say particularly during this time take care of yourself um right now like right that that's one of the most important things that we can do your mental health your physical health everything that you can possibly uh uh do and then the final thing is i'll say that you know the great shirley chisholm um one of the quotes that that stuck with me and always sticks with me is that you don't make progress by being on the sidelines so we need everybody to get into the game and and in the fight thank you also i would just uh like to say you know first of all again thank you uh congressman kelly for this and always a pleasure to be with angela and linda and tracy um you know i i put two links in the chat or in the uh just on a couple things one is information that you can disseminate and pass on around pregnancy being pregnant having a newborn in the midst of coronavirus um and also just how to become more engaged i mean we are constantly recruiting more and more people to be advocates we have dozens of organizations that are part of what we call blanket change blanket change is all about advocating for policy change at the federal level and also at the state level for a lot of the policies and that will address some of the systemic challenges that we've been facing addressing some of these health health outcomes especially around the maternal infant health crisis but frankly some exchanges would go beyond just that alone and would help health outcomes overall um for example medicaid expansion extension of medicaid and things like that so um we would love to you know invite everyone as i know all organizations out here would love to invite more more people to be a part of this fight um your voice matters a lot we know we've seen the power of women the power of women's voice the power of black women um in this fight for our own health and for our own communities if we can't do it for ourselves no one's going to do it for us it is our responsibility to demand outcomes that will improve our lives and frankly i have i believe that if you solve things for black people um you're going to end up solving things for a whole lot of other people too um so we just have to come together as one and be in this fight together and you know i think that's one of the the joys of being on this call and being in partnership with so many other organizations is that we are in a fight even though we may have specific areas of health that we're focusing on it really it really stems from uh large systemic challenges in this country that if we work together we can solve them i think and i'm very confident about that thank you so much ladies for taking us here today i think um as i've seen in the chat this was informational for me and as well as the other folks who attended today we thank you for your hard work in all of the communities that you serve and we thank you for being here with us today with that we'd like to close congresswoman kelly would you like to give any parting words oh i think she might be frozen well with that i again want to thank all of you for being here with us today and um please let us know how we can continue to be helpful especially as we um there's a request to put your info in the chat if you can um and as i close um the congresswoman says thank you uh technical difficulties abound in this new world

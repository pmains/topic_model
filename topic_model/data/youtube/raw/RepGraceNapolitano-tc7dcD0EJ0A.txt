so very much i have a bill hopefully you'll look at it if you have some of the information and ask my colleagues to help get us pass it through so we can start something to begin the preventive efforts for the future of our children so that we hopefully won't have the tragedies we've had in the past we belong to the gun violence tennis force of which i'm a member and that part of it is mental health and we need to be ensuring that we don't stigmatize those that are truly mentally ill and blame them for things because they're the victims normally thank you uh members of the task force is mr dingle and yard estee pacha excuse me mccarthy barber pearl mudder price scott spear and thompson um the mental health task force as you well know has gotten some champions amongst them at meadow world peace los angeles on our test uh missing john three-time world boxing female champ jill diamond with american boxing federation and mark valens dancing star and we're looking for others so if you have anybody that you know that you think might be helping us raise the awareness reduce the stigma and come out and say we need to elevate this to a health standard that everybody else has for other illnesses we please please continue the work your tremendous help and i'm sure we will continue to be uh moving forward the uh uh there's supposed to be a photo but i don't know about the rain i think you have some alternatives we'll send an email so you can take a picture with those folks that are going to be with us uh you have a calendar of the events i won't go to that i won't waste your time on this uh i believe they've handed out the calendar yes so i won't belabor that so with that i thank you so very much for your attendance and uh let's make this the heck of a mental health fund thank you and god bless thank you so much congresswoman napolitano and anna actually for all your help in organizing the briefing at this time we'd like to recognize congressman murphy who's also been a tremendous leader as co-chair of the mental health caucus and on many issues that impact people with mental illness good morning and thank you for being here and thank your dedication to this important cause and it shouldn't have to be a cause but it is uh it is one that uh we are all joined together not just to raise awareness but really focus action to help treat and cure mental illness we spend about 140 billion dollars a year in dealing with mental illness in america and now then it comes up again in congress and people are in are energized and then they do something and then forget about it i oftentimes say that sometimes we delude ourselves into thinking because we did something we think we did the white thing and now again uh many issues on capitol hill where people are talking about issues of mental illness i know in my role as chairman of the subcommittee oversight investigation and interview commerce we've had a serious uh forum after newtown dealing with violence and mental illness we had another hearing dealing with hipaa and confusing hipaa laws and regulations and whether or not people think they can tell anybody if there's a problem uh we're going to be continue to do more and i've been many many in my district because i i want to not only break this statement but help us really focus on what are the science-based treatments that work what are we really doing here and where is this money being spent are we spending it well and wisely are we just spending it thinking because we're doing something we're doing the right thing so it's part of a mental health awareness day whether you're staff or whether you're professional work in this field it's a legitimate question to always be raising to saying what works how are we doing this how can we improve because because of mental health professionals i'm a psychologist myself because we've been asking these questions we have ended up coming up with some pretty substantially effective treatments on one of my jobs i'm also an officer in the navy and i work at walter reed national military medical center with ptsd and tbi patients and when you look historically what happened in the civil war in world war one and world war ii uh in vietnam and now we do have pretty effective treatments in dealing with ptsd and now new research showing us how to understand how tbi affects ptsd and where we have confusing symptoms this is some pretty sophisticated things we're doing and that's important because so often part of the stigma of people with mental illness is thinking no one can help me and then part of the stigma that society has is uh to say those people are strange they're kooky you listen to the derogatory terms on television comedy shows and talk shows on crime shows would they do that about any other illness speaking those kind of derogatory terms of cancer or diabetes or anything else and the answer is no you don't see uh comedy in late night tv making jokes about stage four cancer why would we do that about people who have mental illness but we do and so part of our fight is to help people understand there are we can diagnose these we can treat these we need to focus certainly on the federal level i want to focus to make sure every dollar we spend is working to help people get better not just helping to keep jobs in washington dc for getting out there i know when i go to visit mental health centers i ask them says if you were in charge what would you change and i'm excited and delighted when i hear people who are front line mental health workers saying well you know i shouldn't have to spend two hours on paperwork every time i open a case i should be working with this person i should be getting them help if they're homeless i should be getting this i know what i can do but i'm bound up by this federal paperwork okay how would you change it what do we need to do to be effective people are filled with ideas same thing goes with research when i look at the nimh budget of 1.1.5 1.6 billion and i age about 31 million and then how much really goes to deal for example with violence and mental illness we have a long way to go so i'm excited that you're all here uh that i hope this mental health awareness a month becomes one where we're really there helping people be aware what we can do that is right and effective so thank you so much thank you very much congressman murphy for your leadership in the house we really appreciate it and also we would like to recognize congressman tonko who's here and wonder if he would like to come up and say a few words he's been very supportive of mental health legislation so we appreciate having you here thank you good morning everyone and welcome to dc uh this mental health awareness day for our children um look one of my proudest moments in the new york state assembly where i served for 25 years was championing the efforts of mental health parity timothy's law which preceded federal parity and it was a long fight over a number of years but we would not give up i committed my energy my learning curve to make it happen and one of my proudest moments on the hill and new york the capitol i represent the capital region of new york but it's my fundamental belief that every individual every individual has the right should have the right and luxury of a nurturing loving childhood that's the premise that we should begin with too many of our children hurt too many of our programs have been cut in schools we need to advance the resource that will enable them to connect to programs we need to invest heavily in research you're looking at an individual that opposed sequestration at the very beginning opposed it when it was reauthorized and formalized and we'll continue to fight sequestration because it's a hidden attack on human services and we might really regret uh promoting sequestration um to the policy ends um as you know parody was a beginning to address uh fairness equitable treatment not step-childing mental health uh services uh mental illness mental health disorders deserve to be addressed head on like any healthcare situation but you know i found it interesting when we were promoting parity in new york i had the industry come in the opposing industry come in and tell me that you know they didn't want to be told what to do i said well look you have no problems paying for gallbladders they have no fundamental value but when it comes to the brain you walk away it makes no sense to me so we kept pushing for fundamental fairness when they still bail yank i said look you're willing to pay three million dollars a year for failed suicide attempts and you won't give people hope you won't bring hope to their doorsteps unacceptable so i think there's counter forces to a lot of work that we do we need to force that counter but we need to address that counterforce in heaven and show them the facts the figures of where research has been utilized is providing great opportunity where services are funded to the level that's appropriate people get reached it's about affordability accessibility and it's about being real about a budget we are who we think we are in the budgets we carve and if we don't think we have value if we don't think we have worthiness we'll reach the sequestration and say do mindless spotless cuts you know when you lobby the hill today don't ask me if i'm for mental health programs only because you know who's going to be against treating the mentally ill go the next mile and say will you put your neck on the line and support revenues that will be utilized for these services and to that i will pledge every ounce of my energy to do thank you so much push hard and push with the sensible approach that mental health services bring hope to countless families one out of every five of us is touched by illness or disorder of mental health proportion keep that in mind everybody all of us on the hill not you you know it keep it in mind it touches us very dearly and it touches our children i pledge revenues for your cause thank you so much we really appreciate your attendance and your very passionate statement so thank you and i had some opening remarks which i won't go into because i think they've been covered exceptionally well by congressional members which is a wonderful issue to have uh so we'll move right into our speakers we have a very distinguished panel of speakers today we're going to start this morning with our first speaker kana animoto she is the principal deputy administrator at samsa and will share with us innovative initiatives that samsa has invested in to help ensure the availability of effective mental health services and supports for youth and young

more about the impacts of mental health and mental illness on families individuals and communities across the country i'm going to talk to you a little bit about where samson is headed and what we're doing to help raise awareness of this incredibly important issue mr tanko mentioned that one out of five of us is affected directly that's in a given year one out of five adults and children has a a serious emotional disturbance mental health mental health problem or a subsidies problem however one half of us will have one of these issues in our lifetime so half of us will have a mental health condition in our lifetimes and virtually all of us all of us are affected directly because we love somebody who has a mental illness or mental health problem or substance abuse problems that this is something for every family in america um today at 10 a.m hhs secretary kathleen sebelius and samson administrator pam pride are holding a press briefing at the university of district of columbia community college around children's medical health awareness day we're going to highlight stories from young adults from across the nation receive services to address mental health problems and we're

secretary sebelius is going to announce the upcoming release of the report uh mental health surveillance among children united states 2005 2011 and this is really exciting because it's the first time the cdc has had the supplement children's mental health supplement to morbidity and mortality weekly report mmwr and dr ileana arias principal deputy director from the cdc will be joining them at

designs for children and youth with serious mental health conditions so what mr tanko said he's going to pledge the revenues to help pay the bills we're going to help states figure out the best way to

and we'll feature these young adults from around the country sharing their stories about social connectedness about resilience and about navigating the transitions into adulthood the virtual event is also going to feature a recorded message from danny lovato who will be providing a message of hope and encouragement to youth and young adults everywhere in january following the tragic events in newtown connecticut the president released a report now is the time which outlined a 23-point presidential initiative aimed at protecting children and communities by reducing gun violence and increasing access to mental health services within now is the time is a proposal a set of proposals for which hhs samson will be taking the lead included are 130 million dollars in the fiscal year 14 president's budget proposal including 55 for project aware which will be a state level grant to improve mental health awareness and increase mental health literacy and referrals to behavioral health services and support systems which will be 40 million dollars for state grants and 15 15 million dollars for mental health first aid youth these programs are going to be braided with funding from the department of education and the department of justice to increase also the use of multi-tier behavioral frameworks or pb positive behavioral interventions in schools sports pbis models as well as partnerships with the juvenile justice system and police locally so these are about city school police community family youth partnerships including mental health and substance abuse so that we can help schools prepare themselves to support families and young people as they emerge with mental health problems and make sure that those who need services and want services and supports have places to go as well as have a way to support one another so that families and young people can support each other this also includes a proposal for 25 million dollars for healthy transitions which will be support to states who want to fund innovative programs to provide services and supports to youth ages 16 to 25 with mental health and substance abuse problems and their families this will include some focus on peer-to-peer supports as well as innovative service models such as project those that are being tested in project raise and other places and 50 million dollars will be included is proposed for behavioral health workforce enhancement that includes a 35 million proposal which will be jointly administered between samsa and hersa to expand their mental and behavioral health education and training grant program there's 10 million dollars for our samsa pure professional workforce development program which will span mental health and substance abuse and will include training for peers prepared for youth peers for family peers and adult peers and five million dollars for the expansion of samhsa's minority fellowship program which will target professionals at the master's level who are interested in working with transition aged youth so another piece of the president's uh proposal now at the time the president charged secretary duncan from the department of education and secretary sebelius from hhs to launch a national dialogue around mental health because in order to change the conversation around mental illness and mental health in america we need to have communities everywhere talking about these important issues to identify local strategies to reduce the negative attitudes and help individuals and families who are in need of access to treatments the goal of the campaign is to provide youth and adults accurate information about the prevention and treatment of mental health conditions coupled with open spaces to tell their stories to ask for help to share their success and to support one another in these community conversations or for these community conversations sams is developing a toolkit which shares some technology from the deliberative democracy world on how to host a diverse discussions about common problems and help local communities come up with approaches to solve them the president strongly believes that communities have the answers to our biggest social problems so these community conversations will use trained neutral moderators and the development of the of the toolkit to frame the conversation present overall mental health issues facing young people and along and along with that issues to finding the supports and the financing for adequate prevention treatment and recovery supports communities communities and mayors from around the country have stepped up and said they are interested in hosting one of these conversations and foundations around the country are also interested in supporting them we hope that many communities will choose to use the tool kits and post these dialogues to identify problems to their solutions because as we know the best way to reduce negative attitudes about mental illness is to know someone who's struggled with the mental illness and to see that they are just like you and me they are part of your family they're they're the people that you love uh they they are as strong and awful as everybody else in the world and i think these conversations will help bring that out so in each conversation we'll have a substantial number of people who have lived experienced young people family members adults as well as the providers who work in the system to help provide that perspective in the communities we're also joining the white house in identifying public-private partnerships of organizations nationwide who want to make a commitment to stand up and speak up about mental health we have groups such as national associations of schools colleges universities faith leaders businesses medical providers as well as many behavioral health organizations who are in the room today these groups are committed to engaging in some sort of mental health awareness activity or discussion or hosting a dialogue on their own and finally hhs i will be launching a new website and doing a social and online media campaign using sort of a viral video effort to get people to tell their stories to talk about their challenges with mental illness and and then their success stories around mental health and having how they can host these conversations in their own community the office of the vice president the house of public engagement at the white house all of them are united in helping us have this conversation making sure that everyone becomes aware of the important issues around children's mental health and that we can have a more positive conversation and reduce those negative attitudes and get the supports that people really need answer thank you thank you very much it was a wonderful presentation we appreciate you being here on such a busy day for samsung hhs so thank you so much our second speaker is dylan zindahl dylan's here to talk with us about the value importance of programs for youth and young adult living with mental health conditions he will share how he has benefited from a program in savannah georgia and there's really nothing like hearing firsthand from a young person about the positive experiences they've had from effective services and support so please join me in welcoming done good morning good morning i'd like to thank the national federation of families for children's mental health by providing me the opportunity to participate in chinese mental health awareness day hi i'm dylan i'm 20 years old i began to feel different at the age of 13 that is when i noticed the lack of energy and the enthusiasm about my life i started to feel secluded from the rest of society i was later diagnosed with major depression and bipolar disorder part of my issues began from growing up in a home with an abusive father where i felt so long and hopeless throughout high school i struggled with my mental illness which included me being in a psychiatric hospital for a month upon being released from a psychiatric hospital i became a participant of intensive case management through savannah counseling services intensive care

that's going to be a tough act to follow nice job dylan you think you were doing this all the time that was great thank you so much i'm so glad you came our next speaker is dr tony mannarino dr mannarino we're very fortunate to have he's been here before he does a tremendous job is the director of the center for traumatic stress in children and adolescents and the vice chair of the department of psychiatry at allegheny general hospital in pittsburgh pennsylvania dr mannarino has extensive experience and expertise in effective community-based programs for youth and young adults and will share with us the value and importance of investing in these programs please join me in welcoming dr mattorino thank you so much good morning i'm truly honored to be here today in recognition of national children's mental health awareness day and particularly would like to thank congresswoman napolitano and congressman murphy and tonko for their really enthusiastic support for mental health on the hill i mean this is something that's been dear to my heart for over 30 years and to see that level of support is so meaningful and dylan i couldn't be more honored to follow you to talk on behalf of transitional age youth and to be inspired by what you've accomplished that's really wonderful and i wish you nothing but the best as you go forward in your life i would first like to tell you briefly about the national child traumatic stress network which is a program that means so much to me and my colleagues a program that's out actually housed within the substance abuse and mental health services administration it was launched in the year 2000 actually funded in 2001 right around the time of the september 11th terrorist attack so uh coincidentally that that occurred but it was timely in its launching um the mission of the nctsn is to enhance the quality and access to services for children and families across the u.s who have been affected by trauma as you can see by the map we have sites across the country and actually officially at this point in time we have programs in 44 states around the country and it's so gratifying to know that in the 11 and a half years since the ncts was started that we've actually grown from 17 programs to actually a total of 79 as of today we just had our all network conference in philadelphia last week which is just a wonderful opportunity for all of us to get together and share our experiences the network has over 10 000 partner organizations 400 000 professionals have been trained by groups associated with the network there are all kinds of online resources and other products that are available through the website of the national child traumatic stress network so it's been a remarkable network these last 11 and a half years and i can tell you in my career which has spanned over 30 years it's really been the most marvelous initiative with which i've ever been associated it provided an opportunity for collaboration among programs and colleagues around the country that did not exist before and we've been able to come together and really join our efforts to i think create something much better than we could have created on our own so i'd like to speak a little bit uh about this this very uh important age group transitional age group and i think it's it's so important that we we mentioned to start out with that at this important age that brain development isn't fully mature we like to think of youngsters or 16 to 20 as being fully mature but they're not you know we think about brain development really maturing in the early to mid 20s but there are lots of very difficult things that our children 16 to 20 are facing without uh really mature development you know also socially and emotionally they're not as mature as they they will be and we know the tremendous impact that the electronic media can have on kids in this particular age group when they're still vulnerable and still growing sadly and i say again very sadly as kids enter this transitional age a very large number have been affected by traumatic life events we know that by age 16 that age of the beginning of the transition that up to two-thirds of american children have been affected by traumatic life events two out of every three it's a large number and just to drill down a bit on those numbers you know 25 of all girls have been sexually assaulted by age 18. 10 to 15 percent of all boys have been sexually assaulted 20 to 25 of all our children growing up and families have witnessed domestic violence or intimate partner violence one out of four american children we of course know a lot about school and electronic media bullying we know that many of our kids in american society have to deal with traumatic losses and deaths and suicide so when we think about this this tough transitional age there are certain groups that are most vulnerable at least from my perspective by way of this transition i think about children with developmental disabilities children with autism and asperger's disorder we know that kids with developmental disabilities are more vulnerable to being traumatized and more vulnerable to being exposed to traumatic life events we don't read much about homeless youth but there are more than a few american children who are homeless on the streets of this country and of course we can't forget about um a very special population of lesbian gay bisexual transgender questioning youth lgbtq youth that are very much at risk for experiencing assault and other types of violence they are certainly at greater risk than the average american child to experiencing traumatic life events and this this slide just gives you a little bit of a flavor for the kinds of trauma that american children are exposed to and i think most notably you know child use and maltreatment domestic violence i mean there are many children and i was so proud of dylan for mentioning this who have grown up with abuse in their lives it's an extraordinary challenge to overcome an extraordinary challenge for kids growing up thinking that there must be something about me as contributing to where i am when the reality might be that maybe something bad happened to me or my family that i've had to overcome and so this just gives you a feel for some of the types of events that kids are exposed to many children in american society who have been exposed to trauma do demonstrate signs of post-traumatic stress disorder as representative murphy mentioned earlier the same type of ptsd that our soldiers experience when they return from iraq and afghanistan you know the sleep problems the hyper arousal the numbing of emotions the same kinds of issues our kids also experience depression and other anxiety disorders secondary to this kind of traumatic life event exposure what happens when kids don't get effective help when they aren't identified when kids are not identified we know that they grow into adulthood with a much increased likelihood of serious psychiatric difficulties including depression anxiety disorders and other suicidal behaviors we know that adults who were traumatized as children and did not get help overutilize the medical system as adults and the aces study the adverse child events study that was done a number of years ago demonstrated that if you've experienced four or more traumatic life events while you're growing up it even results in a shortened lifespan so we're talking about something very serious here for college age youth you have the the academic challenges of being in college the new freedoms that entail increased responsibilities concerns about drug and alcohol abuse on campus sexual assault on campus and although mental health services in recent years have been increasing on college campuses we know historically they've been rather limited for those youth who are not going to college of course the economy has not been great the last five years there's a lack of jobs for many youth in this transitional age group the possibility of isolation not being in school not not working many still living with home and the challenges and being with their family and of course we also have transitional age youth moving out of the system being emancipated from foster care and then the very important issue of for many youth they've been treated in the child and adolescent mental health system and they're transitioning to the adult mental health system and often lost between the cracks and something that we need to be concerned about and of course as well many of the serious adult psychiatric disorders do have their onset often in this 16 to 20 age group including bipolar disorder schizophrenia and personality disorders but i am here to tell you a message of hope most importantly i'm from the center for traumatic stress in children and adolescents in pittsburgh and we evaluate 400 new families every year and and the best message that i can leave you with this morning is that children get better when we identify who they are what they've been exposed to what their diagnoses are and get them effective treatment they get better thank you thank you very much what a wonderful message to leave us with a message of hope and i think the fact that young people get better is really a testament to what dylan shared with us that his life is really on the right track and has great promise so that's really exciting there is great hope our final speaker today before we open it up for questions is is joanne malloy joanne is here from new hampshire she is the clinical assistant professor at the institute on disability at the university of new hampshire miss malloy has extensive experience and expertise in the positive outcomes that can be achieved for youth and young adults when effective mental health services and sports are delivered with cross-systems collaboration something that's been a major focus for samsa so please join us in welcoming this morning good morning and thank you it's an honor to be here good morning dylan it's wonderful that you're up here i i don't know i couldn't have done it at your age so i'm truly honored to be here and have the opportunity to talk about our experiences in new hampshire and to share with you how we've worked across systems our group at the institute on disability at the university has been working for nearly 20 years with high school age youth across the state to implement a transition intervention that's much like what dylan talked about for young people with emotional and behavioral disorders this population challenges us in many ways first of all it's a difficult population to identify and define it may include many researchers have found that by talking to youth and families they don't like what we're offering and they don't feel like they belong so it's a difficult group to engage first of all as dr mannarino said a majority of our young person people with emotional behavioral disorders have been victims of trauma and have dismal outcomes as they move into adult life so youth who have emotional and behavioral disorders may be rich or poor or in between they live in dangerous neighborhoods or quiet rural communities they may or may not be identified as having an educational disability they often abuse drugs and alcohol they come from all types of cultural and ethnic backgrounds and again they are very difficult to engage in treatment studies show that between 30 to 60 percent of youth or adults in our justice system have a diagnosable mental illness there are disproportionate number of youth from culturally diverse backgrounds who are subjected to punishments such as suspensions detentions office discipline or even expelled further driving them away from the places and people who can most help them be successful the social emotional and financial costs are enormous the last comprehensive connection and opportunity to have we have to help these youth are while they're in school here we see every teacher is likely to have have at least a few children with an emotional behavioral disorder in his or her classroom teachers that i work with want to ensure success for every child in their classroom the teachers generally receive little or no training in emotional and behavioral disorders they receive little training about trauma and what it does to children and they receive little training in the science of human behavior school can be an incredibly powerful place and a source of strength and success for these youth and so i believe it's the primary place where we can intercept the difficult road that a lot of young people face it's a place where relationship skills can be developed where social supports can be built and where the child's personal growth can be fostered we need to value and support each child however by using positively focused interventions and building positive relationships instead of zero tolerance push-out policies we can work with even the most difficult child so as we see here see the number of children that might be in a typical classroom who have significant support needs and as dr mannarino talked about the environment has a great deal to do with whether your emotional behavioral disorder is exacerbated or supported and by pushing children out of school we're pushing them out of the environment where they can receive those supports that they need so school can be a place that exacerbates one's emotional behavioral disorder by having chaotic environment academic frustration teasing bullying and gangs segregation multiple school placements in other words you're leaving at the school every year multiple times during a year going into a new school going into another school this happens to a lot of youth because of their emotional behavioral disorder but school can also be a protective place a place where protective factors can be built as we see here by being organized positive supporting students positive relationships with adults and peers caring interactions so this is the world of positive behavioral interventions and supports that i've been working in for the past few years and what i began to realize and working with you that who have the highest need is that if we wait till they're 17 or 18 and they're really surfacing in our systems it's almost too late because when you look there's been a history of push out a history of bad interactions and so forth so this is the dropout prevention model that we adopted in new hampshire it is a public health triangle where we work with high schools to create positive interactions for all kids consistency predictability at the universal level we help the school screen students so they see students who are at risk early and and put into place evidence-based positive interventions at tier 2 to keep those students in the classroom learning with the highly qualified teachers and for those students who need more the students have significant issues both inside and outside of school we put into place an evidence-based practice called renew which is much like a sounds your experience dylan where you tell people what you need and we follow your lead so here is the renew conceptual framework and i i'll probably skip through some of these slides in the interest of time but it's very very consistent with samhsa promoted system of care values and principles as you can see here when we developed renew it's been a while now 17 years we looked to children's mental health for guidance family driven youth guided culturally competent based i am very much an inclusion person i feel that show all children and youth should be in our typical uh social networks and places where they can learn to be valued like anyone else and so we use the community-based value to drive our work we also focus on school to career transition what is a youth doing besides being a risk taker and so forth but trying to figure out who you're going to be as an adult what kind of family you want what kind of home you want what kind of job do you want it's not a happy person who sits around with nothing to do all day and so we want to encourage our young people with goals around being a nurse being a store owner being a hairdresser very typical aspirations and then there is the disability community has given us self-determination nothing about us without us the whole idea that the young person needs to learn how to make choices make decisions problem solve not avoid problems which a lot of youth we work with like to avoid problems even my own daughter likes to avoid problems but really attacking them and in a rational way and seeing success so that it breeds success and that's how we built this model now at our institute on disability in new hampshire we like to draw a lot we take up flip cha chart paper and we sit down with our youth and we take them through this series of questions now i have worked with my friends in mental health and this is very much a therapeutic interaction but we try not to make it look that way so we sit down with the youth and say tell me your story tell me who what you're good at and what you feel good about tell me about the people in your life uh tell me about your fears what you're worried about tell me about your dreams and then let's start breaking those dreams into smaller steps now when i said youth are not engaged this is a very engaging process here is a people map from a young woman we worked with about six beginning about six years ago and she presents all over the country now about her experience and she said you know when i did this map i realized i do have a lot of people in my life who i can count on i kind of think thought i didn't before so we put it on flip chart paper so it's real you'll notice the dad is in red in the lower corner she was feuding with dad at the time so this tells us a lot about her and also allows her to learn about herself and here is her dreams now she wanted to be a firefighter she wanted to be successful she wanted to be married with children live in a big new england house have a truck very normal aspirations but not easy for a young person who's having trouble even making friends so where is this young woman today she's the star of a film called who cares about kelsey and i have a few copies here for you she travels all over the country she is a challenging young woman i travel with her but she's making it happen she's not necessarily going to be a firefighter now her mentor has inspired her and she wants to be a guidance counselor and she started college courses to go with it when i met her she was way off track for graduation and she since finished and made it come true so what we do with our high school students is we track outcomes because what good is it if it's not working uh here is a cohort of reduced students in one high school we track their credits earned which is really important marker of whether you're making it towards a high school graduation or not we also track track uh what we call odrs in the field office discipline referrals how many times have you been sent to the office and the average went down for this cohort when you're not in the office hopefully you're in class doing your work we have also started to train our community mental health centers in new hampshire to implement this model and they've worked with over 180 youth in new hampshire providing this model as a clinical intervention we've done some clinical studies we've found vast improvement in functioning among youth by approaching them on a positive level and saying this is about you not about me how are we going to work together we again really use the system of care and pbis values they're very aligned and by not attacking the youth on a sense of saying you know you're not showing up for classes you're not doing this you're not doing that it's kind of okay we know it's not going well let's sit down and have a very real conversation about what's happening here we have been supported by initiatives funded both on the cms sides health and human services and the education side the u.s department of education has been a great supporter of pbis across the country we are working with samson now a samhsa funded system of care project in new hampshire that's allowing us to continue this work and i'm very excited to hear about new initiatives because hopefully that will blend this work in schools so that because i truly do believe school is a tremendous infrastructure for us to be able to use from preschool early childhood all the way through high school and hopefully college and i just want to end with a personal story last saturday my we attended a funeral kind of memorial service for a young man who grew up with my son who killed himself about two weeks ago and it really brought home to me how he was from an intact family a rural new hampshire town they had money he was white and yet something was missing for him and so this hits home for all of us we need to help and work with our children and youth and families to help each one figure out what it is that's missing where they're headed support them through the good times and bad times as kelsey says to me all the time you know when i say i don't want you to help me i don't really mean it so we have to get more sophisticated about engaging these youth so thank you very much for listening and for the opportunity to speak thank you very much for an excellent presentation um i do want to point out that we have leave behind packets hopefully everyone got a copy of these in there we have a list of the federal legislation pending in 113th congress that we're asking for support from congressional offices for um we do have time for a few questions uh actually would you like to come up um i just wanted to say that the member advocate photo the location has been changed to the congressional visitor center so we'll be now taking the photo in front of the lady liberty statue which is perfect for our issue for today um so again we'll be meeting at 12 noon and we do have um we will be sending out an email as well so 12 noon the cvc in front of the lady liberty statue thank you just to add to that give yourself plenty of time because you'll have to get through security um so great point thank you there's a lot of security there yes do we have any questions for the speakers before we just wrap up we have about three minutes um what yes any long-term options are provided once children no longer well you know we don't want to graduate youth to adult mental health services and so that is a problem definitely what we try to do while a youth is in high school is to build relationships with adults and others in their community that they can count on but i know that samson has begun to think that transitions should increase to age 26 we all realize through the developmental stages that emerging adults need support through those difficult years but it is a problem still because a lot of youth lose medicaid eligibility when they leave school or turn 19 whichever comes first um and and may not qualify under the adult system as well for support now hopefully uh expansion of insurance com uh coverage may help with that but it is a problem yeah and the only other thing i would say is there's two wonderful technical assistance centers for transition age youth and young adults that are actually supported by salsa and other federal agencies one is at the university of massachusetts medical school and the others at portland state and they have a lot of wonderful resources for young adults really up to age 28 because it is such an important transition time in the life of a young person and they have great information about programs that exist in communities clubhouse is specifically for using young adults and supported employment supported housing supported education and other programs so i would really encourage you to go to those sites they're a wonderful resource any other questions comments yes my question is for uh both joanna and tony uh everything you talked about was getting services uh earlier um in children's either their disease progression earlier in childhood half of individuals with a mental illness will have the first onset by the age of 14 so i think it really does compel us to try to do more by way of prevention and early intervention what do you think is the biggest barrier for kids getting those services for families trying to seek those services and how can the compendium of programs you talked about facilitate that well no doubt there are many factors that contribute to what you're describing but i can name two quickly and one would be access to services there just aren't enough services out there when children and families try to access services often there are long waiting lists the uh who pays for services and the complications related to insurers and and how many visits you get all of that are a tremendous barrier as well and we can't forget and with congressman murphy and uh congresswoman napolitano mentioned this morning there is still a tremendous stigma around mental health we should not kid ourselves to think that there is not there's a tremendous stigma and the more we can help people in american society come overcome that stigma the greater the likelihood they're going to come forward for services yeah i just want to say one of our partners the american academy of child adolescent psychiatry reminds us often that we have about 7 500 child psychiatrists in this country currently with a need at about 20 000. so i know as family organizations we routinely hear people have to wait three to six months for an appointment even with very urgent circumstances i will say the american academy of pediatrics has really stepped up is doing a far a really wonderful job with a mental health task force and other tools for their 63 000 members to make sure they're better equipped to address mental health in primary care and that's really important i don't know if we need to um vacate the room beyond 10 if we can keep going like okay let's let's go with another couple questions yes i'd like to nobody's mentioned about supporting parents but one of the major barriers beginning mental health treatment is that parents don't necessarily know how to use them why to use them and there's a lot of things that another peer another parent can do to help a family member not be isolated often we want to help the kid but we forget that that kid is part of a family whether it's a birth family a foster family or a transitional age youth it's a family of choice so getting that parent of care and support not clinical support peer support is one of the ways to really connect and deal with that absolutely great point actually both of our proposals are all three of our proposals project aware the workforce proposal as well as the healthy transitions all involve uh parent parent supports so the parents the children the young adults the schools the families the communities all partner around safe schools healthy students model currently and so that would be continued in project aware in healthy transitions we did articulate that there would be both the peer-to-peer supports as well as the parent appearance ports because that is for population not just those who are already in the child serving system but also those who are emerging with their first problems in that age between 14 to 24 and so for parents to make sure we were the initiative was unfortunately started by the issues around adam lanza and his mother who clearly had not been quite engaged with the system and we think perhaps if they had been if the mother his mother had known where to go who to talk to if there had been other parents neighbors friends who could have supported them things would have been different so that was clearly part of our healthy transitions proposal and our peer workforce includes it again i think i mentioned both youth and parents as peers uh one last we'll go with one last question yes settings that show the correlations between communications disorders and mental health issues incarcerated youth i'm wondering if in any of these programs if you also use the services of a speech-language pathologist other communication specialists as part of part of these programs yes i i think you're absolutely right as a matter of fact i have occupational therapist friends who say you know our ot's involved and so um and oftentimes young people once we see them they've gotten very good at covering that up you know covering some of those issues up once we have this conversation with the youth we do collect data on how they're doing in class and use behavior science to try to isolate where some of the issues are coming from and so then we may call in a specialist a special education person or a nurse or a specialist an occupational therapy or psychologist or whatever to help us identify good strategies to assist the student in the classroom and we do less of that in the job in the workplace but you're absolutely right we need those specialists we and we need it's a hot we need highly qualified individuals but we need to change the tenor of the conversation and the interactions so that's a very good point this is a follow-up i would say in all the advocacy efforts you know we know there's a shortage of many of the specialized instructional support personnel and that that could be part of the equation right absolutely absolutely well let's thank our presenters again this has been great and happy national children's mental awareness day and eat food

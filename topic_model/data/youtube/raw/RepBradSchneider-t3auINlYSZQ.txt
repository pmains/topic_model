Madam Speaker,
Yesterday marked one month since a gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School cut
short the lives of 17 students and teachers. These tragedies have become so common that
the response of this Congress is practically routine: thoughts and prayers are offered,
moments of silence held, and then we move on with no specific action on gun violence. Madam Speaker, that’s not enough. We need to hear the thousands of students
across the country who organized walkouts and events with a simple message for us: It’s
time to act. We need to be able to  look these students in the eye
and say we’re doing everything we can to protect you. But for far too long, this institution has
refused to that. We’re not considering legislation to pass
universal background checks. We have not debated restricting the sale of
military assault weapons, bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines. Or even lifting the ban preventing our government
from researching gun safety solutions. Yesterday, we did pass a bill of important
resources for school safety, including a bipartisan provision I introduced with Rep. Mike Bost
to help schools install panic buttons. That’s an important first step, but really
protecting for our children isn’t possible without concrete measures to reduce gun violence. I urge my colleagues to listen to the wisdom
of the young people in their district, and let’s all find the courage to pass sensible
gun safety laws that save lives.

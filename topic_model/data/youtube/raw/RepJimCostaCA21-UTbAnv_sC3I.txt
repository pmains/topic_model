i yield myself as much time as i may consume for the purpose of closing the gentleman's uh recognized in closing i want to thank ranking member turner for his leadership and for his support of our common alliance and our defense in these critical and dangerous times that we are living in i want to reflect on why i think this resolution is so important and it's an inflection point that chairman keating and so many of us feel with regards to global history as i said this is a test of our time as to whether or not democracies can be willing to stand together for the common values we share for the rule of law for a rules-based economy and for all the freedoms we cherish that we share in common simply stated this is a choice about good and evil for the first time in eight decades we have seen a full land invasion in europe instigated as a resulting in an unprecedented humanitarian crisis think about this the alliances that we've created post world war ii beginning with the marshall plan and then nato and the european union and everything that has followed since that has resulted in one of the largest peacetime periods in europe in over 1 000 years think about that and what we have also obviously learned the hard way is that these unconscionable crimes committed against the ukrainian people i think constitute a form of genocide i said in a speech several months ago that in my view after busha president putin should be considered a war criminal and all that have been involved in these horrific crimes that we've seen committed and we see daily hospitals schools apartment buildings innocent children and and citizens being attacked so the brave men and women of ukraine and their leadership president zielinski has reminded us once again that we who share the common values of democracies must stand together we are at the front lines in this fight for freedom and ukraine today is sadly paying the heavy price but they've demonstrated an importance to all of us of unity in face of putin's catastrophic and violent attack they have demonstrated why our support matters and it does and crucially they have proven that without a doubt as was said by my colleague and friend congressman hoyer that democratic values will prevail over an authoritarian ideology and that's why we must ensure that putin fails in his war of aggression finland and sweden historically and the sovereign decision to apply for nato membership creates an echo of transatlantic unity on this issue and on this resolution and represents strong bipartisan support here in congress for ukraine and i thank my colleagues on the other side chairman quito lee keating leads this nato resolution in response to the alliance our transatlantic alliance that have stood up to the aggression of russia in face of unprecedented unprovoked aggression and we have come together to do the right thing to my colleagues in the senate who will be taking up these articles of ascension shortly i urge you to demonstrate full support for finland and sweden to join nato alliance as to my colleagues in this chamber i urge your support as well this resolution this resolution so so conceived so that the united states government can speak with one voice one voice in the resolute support of our nordic allies and unwavering support for ukraine's fight for freedom and their democracy i hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill and i yield back mr speaker the balance of my time

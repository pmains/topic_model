  CREWS TO CALM EVERYONE DOWN IN  THE COAST GUARD ALSO  RESPONDED. THE SUPREME COURT  RULES THAT THE EPA CAN'T LIMIT  POWER PLANTS ABILITY TO FIGHT  CLIMATE CHANGE. REPRESENTATIVE  MIKE LEVIN JOINING US NOW WITH  MORE. REPRESENTATIVE. GOOD  MORNING.  >> GOOD MORNING. GOOD TO BE  WITH YOU.  >> SO TELL ME WHAT WAS YOUR  REACTION WHEN YOU SAW THE  RULING?  >> WELL, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.  YOU KNOW, ANYBODY THAT GREW UP  IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, WE  REMEMBER THAT THE ERA OF THE  SMOG ALERTS BEING A CONSTANT  AND WE'VE TAKEN A BOLD STEPS  IN CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO AIR  EMISSIONS AND THE EPA NOW  UNDER THIS DECISION IS BEING  SEVERELY LIMITED IN WHAT  THEY'RE ABLE TO DO. AND I  WOULD JUST REMIND EVERYBODY  THAT THE CREATION OF THE  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  AGENCY, ALONG WITH THE CLEAN  AIR ACT, THE CLEAN WATER ACT,  ALL THOSE WERE BROADLY  BIPARTISAN INITIATIVES.  RICHARD NIXON WAS PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES WHEN THE EPA  WAS CREATED. IN FACT, ONE  CALIFORNIA SHOT A WAIVER TO GO  EVEN FURTHER UNDER THE NEED  NOT CLEAN AIR RULES. RONALD  REAGAN WAS GOVERNOR. AND THEN  WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD WITH BOLD  COMPREHENSIVE POLICY THAT LED  TO CAP AND TRADE IN  CALIFORNIA, ARNOLD  SCHWARZENEGGER WAS GOVERNOR.  SO ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.  HAVE WE SEEN THE ENVIRONMENT  BECOMES POLARIZING PARTISAN  ISSUE. IT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE  CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER,  CLEANER BEACHES, SAFER PLANET  FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. I  THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN  ALL AGREE ON. AND I HOPE THAT  WE GET BACK TO SOME COMMON  SENSE IN AWAY FROM THE  STEERING DEVICE, A VERY  POLARIZING TIMES THAT WE'RE  IN. YOU MADE FIGHTING CLIMATE  CHANGE, ONE OF YOUR KEY  INITIATIVE. SO WHAT DOES THIS  RULING MEAN?  >> WELL, IT MEANS THAT WE'RE  GOING TO HAVE TO WORK EXTRA  HARD IN THE CONGRESS BECAUSE  IN EFFECT, WITH THE SUPREME  COURT HAS SAID IS THAT THE  LEGISLATION IN THIS CASE, THE  CLEAN AIR ACT WASN'T SPECIFIC  ENOUGH.  >> TO ALLOW THE EPA HAVE A A  >> REGULATION THAT WOULD  REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS  EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS.  KNOW I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH  THAT. BUT WHEN YOU RE BOTH THE  BEACON CURRENTS IN THE  DISSENT, YOU SEE THAT THE THE  KICK THE BALL BACK TO CONGRESS  AND SAY YOU HAVE TO BE MORE  PRESCRIPTIVE IN YOUR LANGUAGE.  SO WE'RE GOING TO EVERYTHING  WE CAN ON THAT FRONT. AND IN  ADDITION TO THAT, I JUST SENT  A LETTER TO THE EPA SAYING  THAT THEY NEEDED TO TAKE MUCH  STRONGER ACTIONS IN REGULATING  WHAT ARE CALLED CRITERIA. AIR  POLLUTANTS THAT LEAD TO STRONG  THINGS SOCKS AND NOX AND  PARTICULATE MATTER AND OZONE.  I THINGS THAT WE KNOW WE  REALLY MAKE AN IMPROVEMENT ON  AS WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. IF  WE JUST TAKE THOSE PROACTIVE  STEPS AND AT THE END OF THE  DAY THAT THE SUPREME COURT, I  WISH WOULD STAND UP FOR THE  AVERAGE PERSON IN THEIR HEALTH  AND SAFETY AS MUCH AS THEY  STOOD UP FOR THE FOSSIL FUEL  INDUSTRY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE  DECISION ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE  ENVIRONMENT, THOUGH, BECAUSE  OF THE THE SCOPE OF THE  RULING. IT REALLY COULD APPLY  TO OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE  TRYING TO PROTECT HEALTH AND  SAFETY ACROSS THE BOARD. SO I  SEE THIS, UNFORTUNATELY, AS  REAL GUT PUNCH FOR HEALTH AND  SAFETY FOR THE AVERAGE  AMERICAN.  >> SHOULDN'T. UNFORTUNATELY, A  LOT OF POLLUTION. WE DON'T SEE  IT WITH HIS HOW BIG OF PROBLEM  IS IT IS HERE IN SOUTHERN  CALIFORNIA AND SAN DIEGO. IT.  IT'S STILL A BIG PROBLEM. YOU  KNOW, AND IN CALIFORNIA WE  HAVE THE CALIFORNIA AIR  RESOURCES BOARD, WHICH HAS  OVERSIGHT OVER MOBILE SOURCE,  POLLUTION FROM VEHICLES. WE  HAVE OUR AIR DISTRICTS,  INCLUDING IN SAN DIEGO.  >> THEY REGULATE THE  STATIONARY SOURCE POLLUTION.  SO THINGS LIKE POWER PLANTS,  INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION, BUT IT'S  BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE  ANYBODY. THEY GREW UP HERE IN  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA KNOWS IT'S  A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN IT  USED TO BE. BUT ALSO KNOWS  THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO  AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO  ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION TO  MORE SUSTAINABLE SOURCES OF  ENERGY. WE'VE GOT TO BUILD  BUILDINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND  WE'VE GOT TO GENERATE  ELECTRICITY FROM CLEANER  SOURCES IN EFFECT, THAT IT WAS  TRYING TO DO. THEY WERE TRYING  TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO SHIFT  AWAY FROM TOWARDS CLEANER  SOURCES LIKE SOLAR WIND EVEN  NATURAL GAS. AND IN THERE  CLEAN POWER PLAN. AND  ULTIMATELY THE SUPREME COURT  SAID I KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO  STAND WITH THE AVERAGE PERSON  IN THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY.  WE'RE GOING TO STAND WITH THE  FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY AND  THAT'S A REAL SHAME PEOPLE  WATCHING RIGHT NOW. THEY WANT  TO DO SOMETHING.  >> TO HELP WITH CLIMATE  CHANGE, WHAT CAN THEY DO?  REPRESENTATIVE? WE'LL GET  INVOLVED. YOU KNOW, THIS  DEMOCRACY IS ONLY WHAT WE ALL  MAKE OF IT. AND THAT'S THE  BEAUTY OF OUR SYSTEM. SO IF  YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE  SEEING IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,  GET INVOLVED, MAKE YOUR OWN  POSITIONS KNOWN. AND THAT'S ON  ALL OF US TO DO. THAT'S WHY I  RAN FOR OFFICE AS AN  ENVIRONMENTAL ATTORNEY.  SOMEBODY INVOLVED IN THE CLEAN  ENERGY INDUSTRY, A FATHER OF 2  YOUNG CHILDREN. I WANTED THEM  TO HAVE A CLEANER FUTURE AND  THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO RUN.  SO EVERYBODY'S GOT TO DO WHAT  THEY CAN DO TO MAKE A  DIFFERENCE. BUT THIS ON ALL OF  U.

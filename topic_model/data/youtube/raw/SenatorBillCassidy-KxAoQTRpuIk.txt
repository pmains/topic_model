today is the 21st anniversary of the attacks of 9 11. and for those of us who are alive then we shall never forget where we were when we first heard of the attacks or the pictures that were shown over and over of smoke rising from those buildings and then their sudden collapse but before that of people jumping out of high rises to certain death but fleeing the flames that were coming behind them and the first responders going up those steps and then when we saw those buildings collapse we knew that their lives were lost too and at the end of the day those firemen raising a flag on the rubble of what what had been the world trade center and since brave men and women are volunteering in our service or in the clandestine services taking the war to our enemies in their lands to prevent enemies bringing war to our land to you all time heals and we hope that it is healed for you but we know that loss remains nonetheless to that end we will attempt to honor you by making sure that this never happens again remaining vigilant against any enemies of the american way of life we shall never forget you

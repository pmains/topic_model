Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support
for my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. Our men and women in uniform are not immune
from the epidemic of opioid addiction and abuse that is ravaging our country. In fact, the National Institute of Health
reports rates of prescription opioid misuse are higher among service members than among
civilians due to the use of these drugs to treat the symptoms of PTSD and chronic pain. Our brave service members have earned our
gratitude and deserve the highest-quality of care. We need to do all we can to ensure our military
doctors are equipped with the most up-to-date best practices to help fight back against
this disease. This amendment requires medical professionals
in the Department of Defense that prescribe opioids for pain management to undertake 12
hours of training every 3 years in order to prevent overprescribing and better identify
and treat misuse. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting
this commonsense amendment to ensure our active duty military get the medical care they deserve.

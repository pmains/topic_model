Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some of
the feedback I’ve heard from my constituents about the tax bill that has already passed
this House and is now under consideration in the Senate. More than 2,000 of my constituents have taken
the time to reach out to me and share their overwhelming opposition to this bill. I’ve heard from people like the 83-year-old
man in Lake Forest who will face “financial hardship” when he is no longer able to deduct
his medical expenses. Or the professor at Rosalind Franklin University
in North Chicago who emailed that she is worried about what the elimination of tuition waivers
will mean for her medical students. Or the man in Libertyville who fears that,
with the elimination of the State and Local Tax Deduction for property taxes, he’ll
face a higher annual tax bill and more than 10 percent hit to the value of his home. Mr. Speaker, we need tax reform, and I remain
committed to working across the aisle to achieve it. But this partisan proposal is not the way
I urge my colleagues to listen to their own constituents, abandon this fundamentally flawed
bill, and work in a bipartisan way to accomplish fair, responsible tax reform.

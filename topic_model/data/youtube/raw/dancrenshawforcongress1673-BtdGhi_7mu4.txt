meanwhile he got national attention days before the election because of an insensitive joke on Saturday Night Live now former Navy SEAL dan Crenshaw is heading to Washington as a freshman Republican in a now Democrat controlled house congressman elect Dan Crenshaw joins us now congratulations congressman elect well thank you very much it's great to be with you here I guess the SNL joke did not hurt your outcome no it didn't it didn't hurt I don't think it helped but you know we've been working hard for about a year now connecting with voters all over the district going from restaurant to restaurant table the table house to house and you know it's really been an incredible journey and it paid off last night we're pretty excited about it I bet you are so what first thing you want to do when you get now to an even more divided Washington given the Democrats controlling the house and the Republicans controlling the Senate right it's just it's one challenge after another right well you know we have issues in Houston that are pretty bipartisan one big one is a flood mitigation infrastructure I need to be able to work with the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that our infrastructure can take another hurricane Harvey like event that's pretty unique to Houston of course you know I wanted to look for ways to reduce healthcare costs in Houston there are some great innovative companies on the pharmaceutical side on the direct primary care side I can't see why on earth Democrats wouldn't want to push to expand these kind of innovative free market solutions to reducing health care costs so that will be a big one for me as well congressman elect I want to read a portion of your victory speech last night and I'm sorry things have been happening here so quickly this morning and changing that we don't have video of it yet so let me just read it you say this election and the next couple of years and hopefully the next 50 to 100 years is going to be about understanding what we all believe in together understanding the foundational values that keep us together and that used to be comedy it used to be sports let's separate politics from these things let's enjoy life together as a mirror that's what I'd like to get back to I think that a lot of people would like your utopian vision for getting back as Americans to enjoying life together but let's face it I mean it's more divided and rhetorically more heated than ever so what's your suggestion well you know what I was referring to is comedy sports doesn't the political rhetoric will probably remain divisive it will remain mean as ever I'm going to try to be part of the solution they're not part of the problem and by that I mean don't attack someone's core don't attack someone's intent if you disagree with them and we feel and especially the conservative side we feel as though every time we have a policy disagreement the left attacks who we are they attacked our intent as if we were bad people on the comedy side on the sports side you know my message to Hollywood my message to sports is just allow people to take a break from politics please don't politicize your comedy in a way that is just mean-spirited and that's what happened this weekend but it happens a lot more than just that you know I think the American people could use a break and congressman-elect do you have that message for the president do you think the president plays any role in that kind of heated rhetoric yeah I would always call for him to tone down the rhetoric sometimes and lower the temperature it would certainly help um yes it would certainly help and so congressman I mean when what do you think will be able to be accomplished well like I said I think there's a few things Democrats and Republicans can probably agree on infrastructure development especially here in Houston like I said before what about workforce training you know we have 7 million job openings right now it's a good problem to have but we don't necessarily have the workers right skill sets to enter into those jobs all right we have maybe too many young people going into four-year degrees graduating but not really having any skills to show for it but they do have a lot of debt there's a lot of workforce training programs out there maybe apprenticeship programs that we can start to expand and look at and look at ways to have public/private partnerships and get young people the skills they need to take on those jobs and earn higher wages and really make us a more productive nation okay and last just to bring this full SNL circle when we last spoke to you you said that you were not demanding an apology from Pete Davidson but you did have a suggestion for SNL and that was to kind of pool their money and give I think you were calling for a million dollars for veterans causes have you heard from Saturday Night Live the producer sent me an email apologized they didn't hear anything about that million dollars we're still waiting on that all right well congressman elect Dan Crenshaw thanks so much for joining us with your view of

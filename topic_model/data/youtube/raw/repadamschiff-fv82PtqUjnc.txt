. I THINK THAT IT'S A MISTAKE FOR  THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE TO  HAVE CUT THE DEALS THEY DID. I THINK IT WAS KEVIN McCARTHY  PUTTING HIMSELF ABOVE THE   OWN CONFERENCE  IN ORDER TO DO IT. BUT TIME WILL TELL. IT DOES, I THINK, POINT OUT THE  STRUCTURAL PROBLEM AND THAT IS  RIGHT NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE  FUNCTIONAL POLITICAL PARTY. WE NEED TWO FUNCTIONAL PARTIES  IN ORDER FOR A SYSTEM TO WORK -- AT LEAST TWO FUNCTIONAL PARTIES. WE ARE UNIFIED ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, IT'S  DISUNITY, CHAOS. SADLY, I THINK THERE'S MORE  WHERE THAT CAME FROM.  >> PRESUMABLY, MORE TO COME. LET'S SEE. WE SAW PRESIDENT BIDEN TODAY  HONOR THE PEOPLE WHO SAFEGUARDED OUR DEMOCRACY FROM ELECTION  WORKERS TO THE POLICE OFFICERS  WHO PROTECTED THE CAPITOL ON  JANUARY 6th. HOW POWERFUL IS IT, CONGRESSMAN, TO SEE THAT GROUP, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, WHO ROSE TO THE  MOMENT? >> YOU KNOW, IT REALLY IS SO  POWERFUL AND SO MOVING. AS YOU SAY, THE THREAT  CONTINUES. THOSE GEORGIA ELECTION WORKERS  WHO WERE HONORED TODAY ARE STILL THE SUBJECT OF PRESIDENTIAL LIES AND THREATS. WHAT HE PUT THEM THROUGH, WHAT  HE CONTINUES TO PUT THEM THROUGH IS UNCONSCIONABLE. THOSE OTHER FOLKS, LIKE RU  BOWERS WHO PUT THEIR VALUES,  THEIR OATH OF THE CONSTITUTION  ABOVE THEIR DEVOTION TO A PERSON OR A PARTY. THEY ARE SHINING EXAMPLES OF  POLITICAL COURAGE THAT OUGHT TO  BE EMULATED BY OTHERS. JUST TO SEE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SOMEONE LIKE RUSTY BOWERS AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE SPECTACLE IN  THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  WHERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT LACK  THAT DEVOTION TO THEIR OATH  HAVING SO MUCH TROUBLE GETTING  THE SUPPORT OF THEIR OWN PEO

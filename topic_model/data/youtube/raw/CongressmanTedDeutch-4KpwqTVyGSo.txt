2020 U.S. ELECTION AND THEN THAT THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO WITHHOLD  EVIDENCE OF HIS ALLEGED CRIME. >> IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH,  THERE'S MORE BREAKING NEWS. OVERNIGHT, A STUNNING LANDSLIDE  ELECTION VICTORY FOR ONE OF  PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BIGGEST  ALLIES. BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BORIS  JOHNSON. HIS CONSERVATIVE PARTY NOW HAS A COMMANDING MAJORITY. ITS LARGEST SINCE MARGARET  THATCHER. THE WIN GUARANTEES THE COUNTRY  WILL EXIT THE EUROPEAN UNION  VERY SOON. >>> FIRST, WE'RE GOING TO TALK  TO SOMEONE CENTRAL TO THIS  MORNING'S IMPEACHMENT VOTE ON  CAPITOL HILL AS WELL AS LAST  NIGHT'S MOVE TO DELAY THE  COMMITTEE VOTE. DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN TED  DEUTCH IS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. WE HEARD YOU SPEAKING SEVERAL  TIMES YESTERDAY, CONGRESSMAN. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH  US. WE THOUGHT THIS VOTE WAS GOING  TO HAPPEN LAST NIGHT IN THE  COMMITTEE. WE WERE ALL STAYING UP LATE. AND THEN THE CHAIRMAN JERRY  NADLER GAVELLED OUT, THE VOTE  WILL HAPPEN THIS MORNING. WHAT HAPPENED? >> WE WENT INTO THE DAY THINKING WE WERE GOING TO VOTE YESTERDAY  ALSO, BUT THE REPUBLICAN -- MY  REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES OFFERED  AMENDMENT AFTER AMENDMENT AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS WAS GOING TO GO WELL INTO THE NIGHT, AND THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL VOTE  MOST MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WILL  EVER CAST. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO  SEE IT. IT OUGHT TO TAKE PLACE IN THE  LIGHT OF DAY. AND WHAT WE HEARD OVER AND OVER  IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO RUSH. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IN THE  COMMITTEE. OF COURSE WE SHOULDN'T RUSH IT. SO WE DECIDED TO GO HOME, TAKE A BREAK AND COME BACK AND ACTUALLY HAVE THIS VOTE TODAY AFTER  EVERYONE HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY  TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY HEARD  OVER THE PAST TWO DAYS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S ABUSE OF POWER AND  THEN THE OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS THAT LED US TO THIS MOMENT TO  BEGIN WITH. >> YOU SAY TO THINK ABOUT  EVERYTHING THAT YOU HEARD. AND YOU NEED TO HAVE A VOTE IN  THE LIGHT OF DAY. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HEARD THAT  YOU FIND TO BE SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO WANT IT VOTED ON IN THE  LIGHT OF DAY? >> WELL, WHAT WAS CLEAR OVER THE COURSE OF THIS -- THESE HEARINGS IS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES ABUSED HIS POWER. HE SOLICITED FOREIGN  INTERFERENCE IN AMERICAN  ELECTIONS. THEREBY PUTTING ELECTIONS AT  RISK. HE WELCOMED RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN 2016, SOLICITED INTERFERENCE  FROM THE UKRAINIANS AND FROM THE CHINESE AND USED HIS OFFICE FOR  PERSONAL GAIN. LET'S REMEMBER, HE CONDITIONED  FOREIGN ASSISTANCE, MILITARY  ASSISTANCE, THAT AN ALLY  DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR THEIR WAR AGAINST RUSSIA AND THE WHITE  HOUSE MEETING THAT THE NEW  UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT DESPERATELY  NEEDED TO STAND UP TO PUTIN. HE SAID YOU CAN'T HAVE THOSE  UNLESS YOU FIRST ANNOUNCE AN  INVESTIGATION INTO MY POLITICAL  RIVAL. THAT'S ABUSE OF POWER. IT'S THE HIGHEST CRIME IN OUR  CONSTITUTION. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO GO  FORWARD. AND THEN THERE WAS THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, JOHN, WHO HAS  INSTRUCTED EVERYONE IN HIS  ADMISTRATINION TO REFUSE -- HE'S INSTRUCTED ALL OF THEM NOT TO  COOPERATE WITH THE CONGRESS IN  THIS IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY. WHEN YOU CUT THROUGH ALL THE  NOISE YESTERDAY, ALL OF THE  MISINFORMATION AND THE ATTEMPTS  TO SPIN -- THE FACT THAT  REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WOULDN'T  DEFEND THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS,  THEY CAN'T. AND WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO  PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTION AND TO  PROTECT OUR ELECTION. >> A FEW TIMES YESTERDAY AND FOR SOME OF THE FIRST TIMES WE DID  HEAR SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS ON  THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  TRY TO DEFEND THE REPUBLICANS'  ACTIONS. THEY WERE SUGGESTING THAT THEY  DID NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU JUST  ASSERTED, THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS CONDITIONING AID ON  INVESTIGATIONS OF JOE BIDEN. THERE WERE SOME TO SUGGEST THAT  MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THERE WERE  COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PROCESS,  ABOUT HOW, FIRST THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE  INVESTIGATED IT AND NOW THE  HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE YOU'RE ON IS HEARING IT. AND WE HEARD MORE OF THAT AFTER  THE CHAIR JERRY NADLER DID GAVEL OUT THE HEARING LAST NIGHT. THIS WAS RANKING MEMBER DOUG  COLLINS. >> I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO SAY. I'VE BEEN IN PUBLIC LIFE SINCE  2006, AND I'VE JUST WITNESSED  THE MOST BUSH LEAGUE STUNT I'VE  EVER WITNESSED IN MY  PROFESSIONAL LIFE. I'VE BEEN AROUND A LOT OF  POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE YOU  THINK. BUT IN THE MIDST OF IMPEACHMENT? >> I UNDERSTAND MOST MEMBERS  WANTED TO GO HOME. THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO HOME FOR  THE WEEKEND, BUT I'M CURIOUS WHY YOU THINK HE WAS SO UPSET BY  THAT MANEUVER. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S SO HARD  FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND IS ALL WE  CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM THE  RANKING MEMBER OVER THE COURSE  OF THE PAST WEEK IS THAT  EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE IN SUCH A  HURRY TO MOVE FORWARD. WHAT'S THE HURRY? WHY IS THE CLOCK DRIVING THIS. WELL, HERE WE ARE AFTER HAVING  SPENT 14 HOURS YESTERDAY AND THE NIGHT BEFORE WALKING THROUGH THE WAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT ABUSED  HIS POWER IN AN UNPRECEDENTED  AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL WAY. WE GOT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE  NIGHT. NO ONE THINKS THAT WE OUGHT TO  BE VOTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE  NIGHT. AND MY GUESS IS, AND LET'S  ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF WE HAD CAST  OUR VOTES AT MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT THAT THE RANKING MEMBER AND SO  MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES WOULD BE  ON TV THIS MORNING ASKING HOW WE COULD CAST A VOTE LIKE THAT IN  THE DEAD OF NIGHT WHEN NO ONE IS THERE TO WATCH. THAT'S WHAT'S SO CONFUSING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE HAD PLANNED BUT THERE'S NOTHING MORE  IMPORTANT, NOTHING MORE  CONSEQUENTIAL THAN TAKING THIS  IMPORTANT STEP AT A TIME WHEN  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE  WHETHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,  MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE  WILLING TO LIVE UP TO THEIR  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO DEFEND  THEIR PROTECTION OF THE  CONSTITUTION AND CAST THIS VOTE  TO DEFEND OUR ELECTIONS AND  DEFEND OUR CONSTITUTION. >> I'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE  QUESTIONS I'D LOVE TO FIT IN. I WANT TO LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE  NEXT WEEK. AS YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSE  CALENDAR, ON TUESDAY, THERE WILL BE A VOTE ON A SPENDING DEAL. ON WEDNESDAY, A VOTE TO IMPEACH  THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES. AND ON THURSDAY, A VOTE TO  APPROVE A TRADE DEAL. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR HOUSE  DEMOCRATS TO HAVE THIS  HMENT SANDWICH, IF YOU IMPEAC WILL, TO HAVE THESE OTHER VOTES  AROUND THIS MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT? >> SURE. WELL, POLITICALLY, THERE'S --  THESE ARGUMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER FROM MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES THAT WERE OBSESSED  WITH -- OBSESSED WITH  IMPEACHMENT AND UNABLE TO WORK  ON ALL THE ISSUES. 275 BILLS THAT MITCH McCONNELL  REFUSES TO BRING UP THAT WILL  HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, KEEP  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE, SECURE OUR LEVEES. JUST THIS WEEK, JUST YESTERDAY,  WE MOVED FORWARD ON LEGISLATION  THAT WILL FINALLY ALLOW MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE LOWER DRUG PRICES  FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. WE SENT THAT TO THE SENATE. THAT WILL BE UP TO MITCH  McCONNELL. AND NEXT WEEK WE'LL SHOW THE  THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN  DONE FINALLY THERE'S A DEAL ON  SPENDING SO THAT WE CAN TAKE  CARE OF THE BUDGET FOR THE FULL  YEAR AND THE USMCA AFTER WE GOT  SOMETHING THAT WAS PROPOSED BY  THE PRESIDENT THAT DIDN'T HAVE  TOUGH STANDARDS, THAT DIDN'T  TAKE CARE OF LABOR, THAT DIDN'TN THAT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE'RE GETTING THINGS DONE. >> YOU BROUGHT UP MITCH  McCONNELL. HE'S THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. AFTER YOU VOTE TO IMPEACH THE  PRESIDENT, AND IT LIKELY WILL  HAPPEN NEXT WEDNESDAY, THERE  WILL BE A SENATE TRIAL. THE SENATORS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE  JURORS IN THAT, IMPARTIAL JURORS IN THAT TRIAL. SENATOR McCONNELL LAST NIGHT  ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE'S WORKING  WITH THE WHITE HOUSE ON HOW TO  RUN THINGS. LISTEN TO THIS. >> EVERYTHING I DO, I'M  COORDINATING WITH WHITE HOUSE  COUNSEL. WE'LL BE WORKING THROUGH THIS  PROCESS HOPEFULLY IN A FAIRLY  SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IN TOTAL  COORDINATION WITH THE WHITE  HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE AND THE  PEOPLE WHO ARE REPRESENTING THE  ESIDENPRT IN THE SENATE. >> EVERY SENATOR WILL TAKE AN  OATH TO BE AN IMPARTIAL JUROR. SO WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT  HE'S ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE'S  WORKING WITH LAWYERS FOR THE  DEFENDANT HERE ON HOW TO RUN THE CASE. >> IT'S TERRIBLE TO HEAR MITCH  McCONNELL SAY THAT. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT  SURPRISING. HE SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED ABOUT  WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT,  DOING THE PRESIDENT'S BIDDING. THAT'S NOT THE ROLE THE SENATE  PLAYS. AND THERE ARE SENATORS -- AND  THIS IS WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT. MITCH McCONNELL UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE SENATORS, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN ALIKE, WHO VALUE THE  ORTHTHEY TOOK TO DEFEND THE  CONSTITUTION AND UNDERSTAND THE  SEPARATION OF POWERS. AND THEY'LL BE AS UPSET TO HEAR  MITCH McCONNELL SAY THAT AS THEY ARE THAT THE PRESIDENT  OBSTRUCTED CONGRESS AND REFUSED  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY,  REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH  CONGRESS ON AN IMPEACHMENT  INQUIRY. AND INSTRUCTED EVERYONE TO KEEP  QUIET, SILENCE THEM, REFUSE TO  ALLOW THEM TO TURN OVER  INFOR INFORMATION. THEY'LL UNDERSTAND THAT. WHEN THE TRIAL GOES FORWARD,  THERE ARE MEMBERS OF HIS OWN  PARTY THAT ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR THE INSTITUTION AND THE  SEPARATION OF POWERS. WE SHOULDN'T BEHAVE THAT WAY. HE KNOWS HE OWES HIS OBLIGATION  TO THE CONSTITUTION, NOT TO THE  WHITE HOUSE. BUT I HAVE FAITH IN THE -- THAT  THERE ARE SENATORS WHO  UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO STAND UP AT THIS MOMENT AND  TAKE THIS IMPORTANT ACTION TO  PROTECT OUR CONSTITUTION. THAT'S WHY WE'RE MOVING FORWARD  WITH IMPEACHMENT. >> CONGRESSMAN TED DEUTCH, NICE  TO SEE YOU IN THE DAYLIGHT. HAVE A NIGHT DAY. APPRECIATE IT. >>> A LBIG STEP FORWARD ON  IMPEACHMENT.

Matched by no one. >>> IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS, THE  HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WILL  VOTE ON TWO ARTICLES OF  IMPEACHMENT AGAINST PRESIDENT  TRUMP. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LAST  NIGHT, BUT THE COMMITTEE'S  DEMOCRATIC CHAIRMAN PULLED THE  PLUG AFTER 14 HOURS OF DEBATE. HERE'S WHY. >> WE SUSPECT THE WASRE SOME  STRATEGY TO TRY TO DRAG US INTO  THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SO THEY  COULD SAY, OH, YOU KNOW, THE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DID THIS IN  THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND SO  ON AND SO WE WANT TO DO IT IN  BROAD DAYLIGHT. FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. SO EVERYONE CAN SEE EXACTLY  WHAT'S GOING ON. >> JOINING US NOW, CNN CHIEF  POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT DANA  BASH AND CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS  ANALYST SUSAN GLASSER, A STAFF  WRITER AT "THE NEW YORKER." SUSAN, I JUST READ YOUR LATEST  DISPATCH FOR "THE NEW YORKER"  WHERE YOU DESCRIBE THE EVENTS OF LAST NIGHT AND SAY DEMOCRATS  EMPHASIZED THE HISTORIC GRAVITY  OF THE PROCESS AND THE  SERIOUSNESS OF TRUMP'S DEMAND  THAT A FOREIGN POWER INTERVENE  IN THE UPCOMING U.S. ELECTION. REPUBLICANS HAD HIGH DECIBEL  COMPLAINT. THERE WAS A LOT OF SHOUTING. NO ONE PERSUADED ANYONE. NOT A SINGLE MEANINGFUL  AMENDMENT PASSED. AS WE HEARD FROM CONGRESSMAN  RASKIN, IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN  AGAIN. THEY'RE RECONVENING IN A COUPLE  OF HOURS. ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THE  S SAME? WHAT IS THIS MORNING GOING TO  LOOK LIKE? >> YOU HEARD THE INCREDIBLE  OUTRAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN  COLLINS, THE REPUBLICAN RANKING  MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE, WHEN  THE CHAIRMAN GAVELLED IT TO A  CLOSE AFTER MANY, MANY HOURS  YESTERDAY. AND, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS -- I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT  REPUBLICANS, A, THEY CERTAINLY  SETTLED ON A VERY HIGH VOLTAGE  STRATEGY. THERE WAS A LOT OF YELLING. THERE WAS A LOT OF OUTRANG. BUT A LOT OF IT SEEMED TO BE ON  THEIR OWN BEHALF, MORE THAN EVEN ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO THEY WERE DEFENDING. IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY OVER MANY, MANY HOURS, MANY OF THE MOST  PASSIONATE SPEECHES FROM  REPUBLICANS WERE ABOUT THEIR OWN PREROGATIVES ON THE HOUSE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THEY WERE ABOUT THE RULES. THEY WERE ABOUT PROCESS. AND, YOU KNOW, SO YOU HAD THIS  CONGRESSMAN SCREAMING IN THE  MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, HOW DARE  YOU GAVEL THE HEARING CLOSED AT  11:30 AT NIGHT WHICH, YOU KNOW,  PROBABLY REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD THINK IS A FAIRLY REASONABLE  THING TO DO. BUT IN THE END, THERE'S A PRO  FORMA QUALITY TO THIS  IMPEACHMENT, RIGHT? WE HAVE A FEELING THAT WE KNOW  THE OUTCOME SO MUCH THAT IT  BECOMES HARD TO LISTEN TO TWO  SIDES TALKING PAST EACH OTHER  OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR HOURS. >> HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A  MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO WILL MISS THEIR FLIGHT HOME ON FRIDAY. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED, REALLY. THAT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR  WHY THEY WERE SO UPSET. HAVING THE VOTE LAST NIGHT OR  THIS MORNING, THERE'S NO  MATERIAL DIFFERENCE ESPECIALLY  OVER SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS  IMPEACHMENT ACCUSATIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT USED HIS POWER TO ASK  A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO  INFLUENCE THE U.S. ELECTION AND  THEN WITHHELD EVIDENCE IN THE  INVESTIGATION OF THE PROCESS. DANA, IT'S INEVITABLE THIS VOTE  IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  WILL APPROVE IT. AND NEXT WEEK THE FULL HOUSE  WILL VOTE TO IMPEACH THE  PRESIDENT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN  STRUCK BY OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS IS THERE IS TALK THERE MAY BE  SOME DEMOCRATIC DEFEIONS.CT SOME MAY VOTE AGAINST IT, AND  THERE MAY BE MORE. BUT A DEMOCRAT FROM PENNSYLVANIA CAME OUT OVER NIGHT AND SAID  HE'S A YES VOTE. HE'S FROM A DISTRICT THAT VOTED  FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE'S ONE OF THESE DEMOCRATS WHO  WON IN AN OFF YEAR. TO ME, I DON'T KNOW IF NANCY  PELOSI PLANNED THAT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR  IT, BUT THAT'S AN INDICATION,  YEAH THERE MAY BE SOME  DEFECTIONS BUT THERE'S NO WAVE  HERE OF MODERATES WHO ARE GOING  TO VOTE NO ON THIS. >> YEAH, YOU KNOW THE FIRST  PERSON TO RETWEET THAT, CONOR  LAMB'S REPUBLICAN OPPONENT. THAT'S GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW  THE POLITICS ARE PLAYING IN  THESE DISTRICTS WHERE DEMOCRATS  ARE MAKING THESE VERY TOUGH  DECISIONS CONSIDERING THE FACT  THEIR DISTRICTS WON, APPROVED  AND VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. AND IN SOME CASES OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. SO, YES, THIS IS -- THERE ARE  TIMES, AND YOU KNOW THIS, JOHN,  WHEN THE LEADERSHIP TWISTS ARMS  AND SAYS THIS IS A PARTY LINE  VOTE. THIS IS SHIRTS AND SKINS TIME. GET ON BOARD. IMPEACHMENT ISN'T ONE OF THEM. FIRST OF ALL, JUST ON THE  SUBSTANCE OF IT, IT'S A VOTE  YOUR CONSCIENCE, VERY MONUMENTAL VOTE. BUT SECOND OF ALL, JUST ON THE  PRACTICAL SIDE OF IT, NANCY  PELOSI WANTS THE DEMOCRATS TO  KEEP THEIR MAJORITY. IN ORDER TO KEEPHEIR T MAJORITY, IF THERE ARE SOME MODERATES WHO  FEEL THAT IF THEY VOTE YES ON  IMPEACHMENT, THEY COULD LOSE  THEIR SEATS OVER IT AND SHE  STILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO, YOU  KNOW, TO APPROVE IMPEACHMENT,  SHE'S GOING TO SET THEM FREE. >> AND IN THE ERA OF  HYPERPARTISANSHIP AND A  PRESIDENT WHO LOVES TO WATCH  TELEVISION, IN PARTICULAR, ONE  CHANNEL, WE'VE GOT A LOUD  MESSAGE FROM MITCH McCONNELL  LAST NIGHT TO THE PRESIDENT AND  TO THE NATION ABOUT POTENTIALLY  WHERE HIS OBJECTIVITY LIES GOING FORWARD AS THIS HEADS TOWARD THE SENATE. LET'S PLAY IT AGAIN. >> EVERYTHING I DO DURING THIS,  I'M COORDINATING WITH WHITE  HOUSE COUNSEL. WE'LL BE WORKING THROUGH THIS  PROCESS HOPEFULLY IN A FAIRLY  SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IN TOTAL  COORDINATION WITH THE WHITE  HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE AND THE  PEOPLE WHO ARE REPRESENTING THE  PEOPLE IN THE WELL OF THE  SENATE. >> NOW WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE  POTENTIALLY COULD BE SOME  REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO VOTE  ALONG WITH THE DEMOCRATS IN  AGREEING FOR IMPEACHMENT. WHAT DOES THAT MESSAGE SEND TO  THEM, AND IS THAT A BIT TOO MUCH OPTIMISM THERE GIVEN WHAT WE'VE  HEARD FROM MITCH McCONNELL? >> I READ WHAT MITCH McCONNELL  SAID A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. I'VE BEEN STUDYING HIM FOR MORE  THAN A FEW YEARS AND COVERING  HIM. ANID  READ WHAT HE DID TWO WAYS. NUMBER ONE, THERE'S BEEN A LOT  OF REPORTING, INCLUDING AT CNN  OVER THE PAST EK,WE THAT THERE  IS -- THAT THERE'S A GULF  BETWEEN McCONNELL AND THE WHITE  HOUSE ON HOW TO APPROACH THIS  TRIAL. IT SEEMS AS THE WEEK HAS COME TO A CLOSE, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS  COME AROUND TO McCONNELL'S POINT OF VIEW WHICH IS KEEP IT QUICK. FEW, IF NOT NO WITNESSES,  BECAUSE IT WILL DRAG ON, AND IT  COULD ACTUALLY HURT THE  PRESIDENT BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN  DEMOATS WOCRULD HAVE TO BE  ALLOWED TO CALL WITNESSES. AND ON THAT POINT, I REMEMBER  BACK IN 1998, IT IS A  DISCUSSION. IT IS A NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE  REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, BETWEEN  THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE AND THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT HOW THE TRIAL IS CONDUCTED. THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR THAT. AND MY READ OF THAT ISN'T THAT  McCONNELL IS SAYING, YOU KNOW,  I'M AGAINST IMPEACHMENT,  ALTHOUGH HE HAS SAID THAT  SEPARATELY. IN THIS CONTEXT, IT'S ABOUT THE  PROCESS AND STRUCTURE OF THE  TRIAL. >> LEAVE US ALONE WHITE HOUSE. I'VE GOT THIS. SUSAN, HOW DO YOU SEE THIS  PROGRESSING, OR WHEN THIS GOES  TO THE SENATE, WHAT'S THAT GOING TO LOOK LIKE TO YOU? >> WELL, I THINK DANA'S RIGHT. THIS IS THE NEGOTIATION THAT'S  HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT  WHILE YOU NEED 20 REPUBLICAN  SENATORS TO BREAK RANKS TO  POSSIBLY CONVICT PRESIDENT  TRUMP, WHICH NO ONE THINKS IS  POSSIBLE, AND MITCH McCONNELL  REITERATED THAT IN HIS  APPEARANCE LAST NIGHT ON "SEAN  HANNITY." THE RULES OF THE TRIAL COULD BE  SET BY A MAUJORITY AND THE  REPUBLICANS COULD ONLY LOSE A  FAR FEWER NUMBER OF VOTES THERE. THE REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN  MORE CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKE MITT ROMNEY HAVE, IN A WAY, A GREATER SAY POTENTIALLY OVER  THE CONTOURS AND SHAPE OF A  SENATE TRIAL THAN THEY DO OVER  THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME. AND SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT  TO REMEMBER, NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO, PRESIDENT TRUMP  SES TO SEMORT OF BE VEERING BACK AND FORTH LIKE HE'S OBVIOUSLY  VERY UNHAPPY THAT THIS  ESSENTIALLY BLACK MARK CAN NEVER BE ERASED IN HISTORY OF BEING  ONLY WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE  FOURTH PRESIDENT TO HAVE  ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST  HIM APPROVED BY THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HE SEES  THE POSSIBILITY OF VINDICATION  IN THE SENATE TRIAL. THE ISSUE FOR HIM IS THAT HE  WANTS TO CALL THE  WHISTLE-BLOWER. HE WANTS TO CALL HUNTER BIDEN  AND JOE BIDEN. THERE ARE MUCH MORE PLAUSIBLE  WITNESSES THAT THE PRESIDENT  HIMSELF HAS BEEN BLOCKING FROM  APPEARING. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THE KEY  WITNESSES HERE HAVE BEEN  ABSOLUTELY BARRED BY THE  PRESIDENT FROM APPEARING. HE HAS BEEN LESS COOPERATIVE  THAN NIXON. RICHARD NIXON. THAN BILL CLINTON. SO MIKE POMPEO AND MICK MULVANEY ARE THE MORE OBVIOUS PEOPLE TO  BE CALLED IN A SENATE TRIAL. >> AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR HOW THESE MEMBERS OF THE  SENATE REACT WHEN THEY HEAR FROM CONSTITUENTS AT HOME OVER THE  HOLIDAYS AS WELL. WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. SUSAN AND DANA, THANK YOU. >>> SO HOW ARE DEMOCRATIC  LEADERS FEELING AHEAD OF TODAY'S BIG IMPEACHMENT VOTE?

DEMOCRATS HAVE THE VOTES TO  ADVANCE THE ARTICLES OF  IMPEACHMENT WHICH WILL THEN GO  BEFORE THE FULL HOUSE NEXT WEEK. JOINING ME NOW IS DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN BEN RAY LUHON. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. WHAT A NIGHT IT WAS LEFT NIGHT. KIND OF A SHOCKER AT THE END OF  THE NIGHT. I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU WHAT  CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS HAD TO  SAY ABOUT IT A FEW MINUTES AGO. >> WE PROVED ALL DAY YESTERDAY  THE FACTS ARE JUST WRONG. THEY'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE  HISTORY. SOME OF HIS OWN MEMBERS  DEPARTMDIDN'T  KNOW THEY WERE GOING TO PUT IT  AT 10:00. THIS IS HOW SCARED OF THE OPTICS AND POLITICS OF THIS AND THEY  DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE. >> I'M SURE YOU'LL DISAGREE WITH WHAT HE SAID, BUT DID SPEAKER  PELOSI KNOW LAUGH NIGHT BEFORE  CONGRESSMAN NADLER SAID WE'RE  GOING TO VOTE THIS MORNING? >> I CAN'T ANSWER FOR THAT. I DON'T KNOW. IT WOULD SURPRISE ME IF THAT WAS THE CASE. >> DID YOU KNOW? >> I DID NOT KNOW. LAST NIGHT WHEN I TURNED ON TO  CATCH THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF  THIS, AND THE HEARING WAS  CONCLUDING AND THEN THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT THERE WAS A VOTE IN THE MORNING. THAT SHOULDN'T SHOCK EVERYBODY. IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT. IT'S TIME TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF REST, GET IN FRONT OF THE  COUNTRY AGAIN IN THE MORNING AS  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WHETHER  WE'RE IN COMMITTEE OR WE'RE  THERE TO VOTE. THAT'S OUR JOB. AND SO I WAS -- I'M SURPRISED A  LITTLE BIT BY THE REACTION OF MY COLLEAGUE MR. COLLINS. EVERYONE SHOULD JUST GET BACK  INTO THAT HEARING ROOM TODAY AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE CASTING THOSE  VOTES. AND THE ONE THING THAT CAUGHT MY INTEREST OF THE CLIP YOU JUST  PLAYED, BIANNA, WAS MR. COLLINS  WAS SUGGESTING THAT LAST NIGHT  THERE WAS NOT A CONVERSATION OF  FACTS. IN FACT, THAT'S WHAT OUR  DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES WERE  TALKING ABOUT. THERE WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT  THE CASE, ABOUT THE FACTS. AND MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAD MORE INTEREST IN DISTRACTING AND PUTTING ON A CIRCUS OF SORTS AS  OPPOSED TO HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FACTS OF THE CASE. AND ANSWERING THE SPLEIM  QUESTION, IS IT OKAY FOR THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  TO SHAKE DOWN THE PRESIDENT OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY, WITHHOLD  MILITARY AID FOR A PERSONAL,  POLITICAL FAVOR. AND THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION  IS SIMPLY NO. >> WELL, AS JOHN HAS BEEN  TALKING ABOUT AND REFERENCING  THIS MORNING, PERHAPS THAT WAS  PART OF THE REPUBLICAN STRATEGY  TO DISTRACT, TO BE ARGUMENTIVE  TO DEFEND THE PRESIDENT AND NOT  NECESSARILY THE ACTIONS BUT THE  PROCESS. DO YOU THINK THAT WORKS. DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE A  NUMBER OF AMERICANS AND PERHAPS  EVEN A NUMBER OF YOUR COLLEAGUES THAT SAY THIS IS TOO MUCH AND  TOO DAMAGING FOR THE COUNTRY. >> WELL, I THINK IT'S AN  ACCURATE ASSESSMENT THAT THAT IS THE GOAL AND THE STRATEGY OF OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, NAMELY  THOSE ON THE JUDICIARY  COMMITTEE. WE CONTINUE TO SEE MORE PEOPLE  ACROSS THE COUNTRY LEARNING MORE

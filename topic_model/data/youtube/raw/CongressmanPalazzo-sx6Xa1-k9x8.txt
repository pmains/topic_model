with me now to talk about this is congressman stephen palazzo he's a member of the house appropriations committee he is a member of the republican study committee and the values action team he represents the 4th congressional district of mississippi congressman welcome back to the program tony thank you for having me it's great to be back on let me first get your reaction to president biden's letter to these oil companies demanding that they produce more it you know it's the same uh rhetoric that this administration has been throwing out there against the oil and gas industry i'm probably the only member of congress that actually worked offshore i know there's other members have been involved in the oil and gas upstream but you know it's it's the oil and gas industry is one of the most patriotic uh the industries that we have uh the people that i've worked with they're god's here and americans and for him to just single out an industry the way that he does he he's not coming up with solutions he's not addressing the problems and as you know he wants to blame oil and gas he wants to blame ukraine he wants to blame trump and republicans for all the failures that he's caused and if you know if he was true to himself uh what's causing all the pain and suffering in america right now it's a direct result of his woke left liberal progressive policies that are destroying um our country well i i'm right next door uh my home state louisiana very much energy um minded i mean that's where we get the bulk of our our revenue and part of the problem this has long been the problem but it's been it's become increasingly an issue is our refining capacity remains low and and one of the major contributing factors to that is the cost of building new refineries because of the government restrictions and regulations absolutely it's not only the cost it's the permitting and there's not a lot of profit to be had in refineries so there's really not and again i mean you know i don't think we've built a refinery in america in over 40 years and most of the refineries that we do have are are somewhat fully operational and putting out as much output as they can i know they're going to increase output by the end of the year but if the president really wants to address the cost of gas a lien and the cost of energy well one stop your rhetoric against the oil and gas industry to cut the red tape lift the restrictions on offshore and onshore leasing and offer support for the industry so they may go in and put investments uh out there and capital outlays to help drive down the cost of energy in the future yeah i think uh the projection is by the end of june the refineries will be at 96 percent capacity and we're coming into the hurricane season and which uh oftentimes these uh refineries on the gulf coast have to be shut down if a storm is coming in so clearly those could be hiccups in the supply line but there was a ten-point plan put forward by the american petroleum institute that makes as you said the administration short on solutions they put forth some solutions one is cutting the red tape that ensnares these energy projects lifting the restrictions for on and offshore lease sales and offering support for new investments in production yeah i mean you have it right there i mean that i think that's only three out of the ten points but those are the most important points i mean we have over 400 years worth of fossil fuel energy for america and you know their their their rush to the green new deal their rush to the renewables i think they're going to make huge mistakes and and we're going to suffer uh not just in the short term but also in the long term this is you know this there's no accident uh this administration is going after the oil and gas industry because they want everybody driving electric vehicles they want to um you know get people out of combustion engines and and to actually you know they i think back in the day of barack obama he actually mentioned that eight nine dollar per gallon gas is that really a bad thing if we could you know free ourselves of our dependence on fossil fuels and i'm telling you from being in south mississippi i don't think renewables uh will will run the air conditioners we need in the summer months and the southern states yeah those windmills don't blow fast enough um i i want to i i don't have really have time to get into this but i i don't think these oil companies many of them that have very uh left-leaning policies supporting a lot of this woke stuff at the corporate level should be surprised when the politicians they elect push these socialist policies on them but that that's a conversation for another day i do you're a cpa you've got a background in finance what what do families need to be doing as we go into the turbulent times of this biden economy well they definitely need to be saving um and pension pennies because you know obviously there's a lot of traffic right now and i just think that's because people have been you know cooped up from covid for two years there seems to be a lot of traffic on interstate 10 people going to the beaches but unlike we've seen you know pre pandemic and when gasoline was two dollars a gallon and of course that was only two short years um and once the biden administration took over the price of gas has just been steadily increasing and increasing is just you know um you know we we have to address inflation in our country and you know we can do that now i would recommend this president first we got to you know address the supply chain issues let's look at quit paying people not to work that has driven up the payrolls and the cost of labor and most important we got to get energy down as energy goes up we all pay for that and families are paying now more than they ever have because of the failed fighting policy it is a driver for inflation uh congressman palazzo always great to see you thanks so much for taking time to join us today and thanks for fighting a good fight on capitol hill thank you sir all right

hi everybody I'm Jackie Rosen and I'm proud to represent the state of Nevada in the United States Senate I wanted to take a moment to share an exciting update from Washington I'm happy to report that my bipartisan building blocks of stem act has cleared a new milestone by passing the Senate now the building blocks of stem act will head to the House for consideration or it will hopefully be voted on and passed bringing this legislation one step closer to becoming law and our children equally as close to getting the education we know they deserve the gender gap in stem is depriving our country of talented minds it could be inventing the next breakthrough technology developing the next big startup or keeping our nation safe from cyberattacks but the good news is we're hard at work tearing down the barriers that are keeping our girls from furthering their careers in these important fields I'm so proud to have this opportunity to fight for greater access to science technology engineering and math education for our children and I want to thank my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle for supporting this important legislation including my bipartisan Coley senator Shelley Moore Capito access to some education gives our young students access to opportunities and career fields they might not otherwise pursue this is especially true for those in underrepresented communities in Nevada and across the country we're seeing a huge demand for stem workers as a former computer programmer I know just how important it is to prepare and train our next generation of workforce and I'm confident this bill this bill will help us get close to closing the gender gap in STEM education I'm proud of what this bill will do for our children and I'll continue to support legislation that will give our students in Nevada and across the country the tools that will prepare them for future careers thank you and stay tuned for future updates from Capitol Hill

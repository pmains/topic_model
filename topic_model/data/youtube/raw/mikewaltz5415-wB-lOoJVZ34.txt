michael wallace republican of florida and member of the house armed services committee uh what is your take do you think the speaker of the house should go on her trip to taiwan as planned you know dana i always hesitate to say i support speaker pelosi in anything but on this one i absolutely do she has to go she if she doesn't at this point with it now out publicly what message does that send to the taiwanese but what message does it send to the japanese the south koreans the australians our allies in the region that if we're not even willing to go and visit are we then going to stand for taiwan and defend them if z realizes his vision of unifying uh through military means if possible so i i think it's absolutely critical that she goes and it's just the principle of you know we don't get dictated to by the chinese communist party on what allies we visit or where our elected officials go period and joe biden needs to reinforce that in his call with z tomorrow do you have any reason to believe that she would be in danger if she goes to taiwan uh you know i i think the white house is looking at this the wrong direction or from the wrong perspective that we are escalatory it's the chinese communist party that's escalatory and i can't imagine uh that they would go so far as to put the speaker of the house the united states in danger i also wanted to ask you about this the chinese we know that they are you know they spy on our companies they try to infiltrate our government this actually there's a report from the senate that says that china targeted the federal reserve in an attempt to undermine american monetary policy jerome powell said this that we would be concerned with any supportable allegation of wrongdoing whatever the source in contrast we are deeply troubled but what we believe to be the report's unfair unsubstantiated and unverified insinuations about particular individual staff members but setting that second part aside although i know that's important to him and to his employees of course but the fact that there is a possibility that the chinese are trying to do this what do you make of it yeah look dan i go back to chris wray the fbi director and and that really historic press conference with the british head of intelligence ahead of mi5 that points to the fact that we the chinese communist party has unleashed a tsunami of espionage and collection and influence activities it's in wall street it's in hollywood it's in academia not only through the professors the students but their endowments it's certainly in our politics through a policy they call elite capture dana they are looking to secure and be able to manipulate not only our money supply through the through the fed but our uh all of our um our from our food supply to our pharmaceuticals uh you know all of our supply chains yeah because they seek to seek to influence us economically and win an economic war well before there's any type of military conflict this will be one economically uh here at home way before it will uh come to any kind of conflict in the taiwan strait and we as a country have to wake up uh to what's going on from buying up our farmland to influencing the fed to controlling all of these things yeah i wanted to drill in on that just a little bit because of course farmland super important uh to us to our food supply to our culture to our traditions for our history to the people that work in rural america and the chinese are buying up farmland all around the world but i didn't realize how aggressive they're trying to be in the united states including in the state of florida your take on that well and oh they just so happen to be dana right next to some of our most sensitive military sites but the bigger piece is what you pointed to i mean they've also bought up uh the nation's largest pork processing plant and it is a key part of their strategy it's called made in china 2025 to be able to manipulate key portions of our supply chains we've got to bring them back home if we can't get in the united states get them to an allied country and you're going to see a tremendous push on that when the republicans take back congress in november and i know that you just returned from ukraine you had a chance to see president zelinski love to have you back and as you continue to press for the american people to try to figure out a way to help them there thank you so much have a good day all right thanks dana

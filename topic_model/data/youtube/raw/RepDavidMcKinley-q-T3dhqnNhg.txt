thank the gentlelady cheer now recognizes mr mckinley for five minutes uh thank you madam chair uh and to uh mr shellenberger i'm gonna address my questions to you but i wanted you to know up front i just ordered your book this week i've heard some great graves about that so i wanted to see what you see what's in this so listen by point as we lead into the questions is the recent these recent extreme weather events across texas and midwest have highlighted this need to focus on great reliability and resilience but but keep in mind other areas of the country share these same concerns so this is not we want to take what we learned from texas and apply that elsewhere keep in mind one a 2020 national security council memo stated that secure on-site fuel supply specifically coal and nuclear are essential to the nation's critical energy infrastructure a 2018 report from the national energy and technology laboratory nettle without the resilience of coal the eastern u.s would have suffered widespread blackouts during the 2018 bomb cycle and iso new england said their most significant brit the most significant resilient challenge is fuel security and coal and nuclear power plants are needed to maintain reliability so trying to apply this lesson we've seen in texas and all these other reports i i want to go down because there is a there's a statement that has been there's a general consensus that we can't get to net zero in this country without having carbon uh carbon capture so my question to you mr schellenberger do you expect that we'll get carbon capture by 2030 in a commercial grade technology well thank you congressman for the questions you're you're absolutely spot on you must have fuel availability this is essential for any kind of disaster and resilience which is recovery from uh power outages and extreme events um you know if you're going to shut down all of our if we're going to shut down all of our nuclear plants which are 20 of our electricity and we better keep our coal plants around and i say this is somebody that has long advocated uh the transition from coal to natural gas and nuclear but nonetheless i've got a couple more questions to you on this thing sorry obviously you understand that 80 by 2030 and and 100 by 2035 so uh that the power that was generated that coal provided during the cold staff saved texas i think in your testimony you said the electricity the coal provided during the cold time saved texas from more widespread blackouts and and lowered fatalities uh i thank you for that so if we don't have carbon capture by 2030 and the democrats and and president biden are successful in decarbonizing our power grid by that could america it could be experiencing should we experience more plan to experience more blackouts and fatalities yeah i mean the risk of becoming overdependent on natural gas i think is very real that's what would be occurring if we phased out our nuclear and coal plants um so yes that would be a significant concern the alternative is much more expensive electricity the rtos the regional transportation organizations are during all these uh severe weathers are becoming increasingly more uh using coal uh during these start like mice in 2019 miso increased its use of coal by 50 pjm by 40 in 2018 uh coal increase in micelle by 51 the pga pgm by 40 so how are they going to respond if we don't if these coal fire power plants are shuttered and the nuclear plants are no longer available how is rto is going to respond well what they're saying is that they're going to they're encouraging a significant purchase of batteries but most people don't think that that's going to provide any significant quantity of seasonal storage so it just means so the battery story we're going to be relying on battery storage uh for our utilities but yet we're also trying to move over to electric vehicles by by 2035 we're trying to get to all our cars are being driven by other batteries so my question if if we've got these two competing forces the auto manufacturers trying to find that the critical ingredients uh the lithium cobalt a lead nickel that's needed in the battery and the utilities are trying to find out isn't that going to drive up the price of batteries in this country so for you you tell for car owners they're going to pay more for it or utilities are going to pay more for utility isn't that going to put competition between the two for the higher price said did we learn anything from ppe when we were competing for the plastics absolutely sir i mean i think most experts agree that significantly increasing electric vehicle and battery consumption would significantly impact materials demand and prices and of course if we do move either to fuel cell vehicles or electric vehicles we're talking about something close to a doubling of total electricity demand and that opens up a whole new can of worms so i thank you for that and yield back my time

joining me now congresswoman karen bass of california the lead author of the george floyd justice and policing act congresswoman bass thank you very much for coming back to the sunday show thank you for having me so i would love to have you respond to senator scott will things be wrapped up in a couple of weeks and what are these suggestions that he has put forth well i certainly think things do need to be wrapped up we've talked about these issues now for just about a year and so there's a number of key topics that are important i know to senator scott you know one of them is his bill the justice act which we felt did not go far enough and so you put the two pieces of legislation together and maybe ideas from other people it might be an opportunity to address some issues we didn't address the first time such as how you respond to people who are in a mental health crisis so there's a lot on the table and i am looking forward to wrapping this up soon well let's put up um the the provisions of the george floyd justice in in policing act so everyone can see one of the main sticking points is the um right there the first one overhauls qualified immunity for officers last week senator scott floated a suggestion that perhaps not having individual officers be open to lawsuit but maybe having it be the police department's themselves be open to to lawsuits by individuals is that an acceptable compromise to you well i'm not sure what's most important to me and to others is that we have to find a way to hold officers accountable to prevent these shootings from occurring and so you looked at derek chavin who just was looking at the cell phone camera not a care in the world because he felt he could respond he could do what he did with complete impunity he had numerous complaints against him and so what can we do to prevent this from happening and i do think that we need to look at training you know because i don't know the quality of the training but maybe it's time to say more emphasis needs to be put on de-escalation we need to look at other ways to address situations i know that when police officers are trained to shoot they're trained to shoot to kill not to wound so i think a lot needs to be examined in this time period and so in the negotiations with senator scott i mean really how are they going when i read the news reports in the news accounts of how things are going the picture is pretty rosy is that an accurate reflection of what's happening well i think it is but i do want to say that we have not started formal negotiations everything that's happened up until now has been relatively informal and so for negotiations to be formal we have to have the blessing of the leaders and hopefully that will come in the next few days ah that is actually a key distinction informal negotiations as opposed to formal so then where's speaker pelosi is she ready for these negotiations to begin oh i think so speaker pelosi has been supportive if not adamant from the beginning she was so horrified by george floyd's torture and murder that she definitely pushed us to move forward in the house and she'll be there in support through the negotiations and what signals have you gotten if any that the senate minority leader is willing to allow senator scott to move forward with formal negotiations well senator scott i do not believe is acting on his own he is acting with the approval and support of his leadership and so to me that is a tremendous advantage and also i know that senator lindsey graham is supporting tim scott and he's the ranking member on judiciary cory booker the lead in the senate and i know that dick durbin who is the chair of judiciary committee is supportive so i think that everything is set but we do need our leadership to formally announce the beginning of negotiations and again i hope that that's within days and then also our conversations with republicans in the house have been very strong pete stauper who is a former police officer from minnesota brian fitzpatrick from pennsylvania josh gothheimer from the problem solvers all of these folks have been working together and talking in and i do think that the will is there and certainly the verdict is an inspiration but you know jonathan i'm not going to relax until the sentence happens because the rare times there are guilty verdicts then i don't want to see a slap on the wrist i want to see maximum time spent behind bars in a town where negotiations rarely happen and when such a contentious issue there's such polar opposites when it comes to the parties hearing you that last answer actually makes me even more hopeful today than i've ever been that the george roy justice and policing act can actually become law congresswoman karen bass of california thank you very much for coming back to the sunday show thanks for having me on jonathan

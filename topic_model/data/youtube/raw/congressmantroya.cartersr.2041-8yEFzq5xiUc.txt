AND URGED STATE GOVERNORS TO TAKE SIMILAR ACTIONS. OUR NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE FIGHT FOR REFORM OF THE COUNTRY'S MARIJUANA LAWS. WE ARE JOINED BY CONGRESSMAN TROY CARTER, WHO REPRESENTS LOUISIANA'S SECOND DISTRICT. CONGRESSMAN, YOU ARE THE LEAD SPONSOR OF THE BIPARTISAN MARIJUANA MISDEMEANOR AND EXPUNGEMENT ACT WHICH SEEKS TO CLEAR THE RECORDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN PARDONED BY JOE BIDEN'S -- EXECUTIVE ORDER. WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S CRUCIAL TO TAKE THIS ONE STEP FURTHER TO CLEAR THE RECORDS OF THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED FOR SIMPLE MARIJUANA OFFENSES? >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, REVEREND AL, FOR HAVING US HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THE EXPUNGEMENT IS THE NATURAL NEXT STEP. HAVING A PARDON, OBVIOUSLY, IS HUGE. I APPLAUD THE PRESIDENTS FOR THIS ACTION. WE WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY THING. I'M VERY HAPPY AND PROUD AND HONORED THAT THE PRESIDENT IS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PARDONS. BUT THE NATURAL NEXT STEP IS THE EXPUNGEMENT. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE THESE CASES ON THEIR RECORD CAN'T ACCESS FEDERAL LOANS IN SOME CASES. CAN'T ACCESS JOBS IN SOME CASES. CAN'T ACCESS HOUSING IN MANY CASES. THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CLEAN START, PARTICULARLY GIVEN AND THAT IN SOME 38 STATES, MARIJUANA IN SOME SHAPE FORM OR FASHION HAS BEEN LEGALIZED. TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL SADDLED WITH THIS MARK, WHEN WE KNOW THAT THE PROSECUTIONS HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY HEAVIER IN COMMUNITIES OF BLACK AND BROWN, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT AND BALANCE THAT SCALES, IF YOU WILL, IN THE WAY OF TRUE JUSTICE. >> THE DECADES-LONG WAR ON DRUGS HAS LED TO AN EXPLOSION OF THE PRISON POPULATION. MOSTLY TARGETING BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES. FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON THURSDAY, ACTIVISTS LAWMAKERS SAID THAT THESE MARIJUANA PARDONS REPRESENT A STEP FORWARD, RACIAL EQUITY, WITH THIS EXECUTIVE ACTION. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID HE IS TRYING TO ADDRESS DECADES OF DISCRIMINATORY DRUG POLICIES THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT OR HARM TO PEOPLE OF COLOR. STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT DESPITE SIMILAR CONSUMPTION PATTERNS, BLACK AMERICANS ARE NEARLY FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY AS WHITES TO BE ARRESTED FOR MARIJUANA RELATED VIOLATIONS, THOUGH THEY HAVE THE SAME PATTERN OF USING AND POSSESSING MARIJUANA. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THIS, CONGRESSMAN? >> WE SEE THAT EVERY DAY, WE HAVE SEEN IT FOR YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY, WE STILL SEE THAT LEVEL OF DISPROPORTIONATE PROSECUTION, DISPROPORTIONATE ARREST, DISPROPORTIONATE CHALLENGES OR ARRESTING INDIVIDUALS, OR PROBABLE CAUSE. OFTENTIMES, THAT IS A USE THAT TURNS INTO SOMETHING THAT'S ESCALATED THAT ENDS UP BEING DANGEROUS AND DEADLY. SO WE KNOW THAT TAKING AWAY THESE TOOLS, IF YOU WILL, -- LET'S SAY ROGUE COPS, WHO ARE LOOKING FOR REASONS TO PICK A CERTAIN SEGMENT OUT TO CHALLENGE THEM OR ABUSE THEIR, WRITES WE ARE BALANCING THAT FIELD TO MAKE IT LEVEL. THIS IS ALL A PART OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THIS IS ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING HELD IN PRISONS FOR MISDEMEANORS OR BEING LABELED FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES FOR SOMETHING, AGAIN, THAT IS LEGAL. I UNDERSCORE THAT IT'S LEGAL. PEOPLE ARE MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUR COUNTRY LEGALLY SELLING CANNABIS. YET, PEOPLE IN MANY COMMUNITIES ARE STILL TREATED AS IF IT WERE A DRUG THAT WAS BEING PROSECUTED AT THE FULLEST EXTENT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ASKING THAT THERE IS A REVENUE REVISIT ASIAN ON THE SCHEDULE. WE KNOW THAT MARIJUANA, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IS ACTUALLY SCHEDULED IN THE SAME CLASS WITH HEROIN. HIGHER THAN FENTANYL. FENTANYL IS ABOUT AS HIGH A DRUG AS YOU CAN GET. HIGHER. >> LET ME SAY ONE POINT YOU TOUCHED ON. TEXAS GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT SAID ON THURSDAY THAT HE WON'T CONSIDER PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CALL FOR PARDON SIMPLE STATE POSITION OFFENSES. HIS APARTMENT -- BETTER O'ROURKE SAID HE WOULD. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SUPPORT FOR LEGAL MARIJUANA IS CURRENTLY AT A RECORD HIGH OF 68%. RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA USE IS CURRENTLY LEGAL IN 19 STATES AND IS DECRIMINALIZED IN 27. AS YOU'VE BEEN A PROPONENT OF MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION IN YOUR STATE OF LOUISIANA, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS STOPPING MORE STATES FROM LEGALIZING THIS SUBSTANCE? >> TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I'LL TELL YOU THAT I THINK A PART OF WHAT'S BEEN SLOWING THE PROCESS DOWN IS SOME ARE WAITING ON HOW THEY CAN MONETIZE IT. WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN WITH CASINO GAMBLING. WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN MANY CASES WHERE THE ENGINE TO SLOW DOWN AND ENTERPRISE UNTIL SOME HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CAPTURE OR MONETIZE IT, INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE MARKETPLACE TO DETERMINE IT. MANY STATES HAVE ALLOWED THE MARKETPLACE, I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO. I THINK WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING, WHY YOU FIND THIS SLOW ROLL INTO THESE THINGS, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF THE DISBELIEF IN THE EFFICACY OF THAT LEGISLATION. MANY TIMES IT'S BECAUSE OF AN EFFORT TO CONTROL AND THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF IT. >> CONGRESSMAN, WHILE I HAVE YOU, SENATOR JON KENNEDY, WHO REPRESENT YOUR STATE OF LOUISIANA, RECENTLY RELEASED A NEW AD CAMPAIGN, A CAMPAIGN AD, I SHOULD SAY, AS HE SEEKS REELECTION THIS MID TERM SEASON. IN IT, HE USES LANGUAGE THAT UNDERSCORES RHETORIC ON THE WAR ON DRUGS, SAYING, QUOTE, IF YOU HATE COPS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE COPS, NEXT TIME YOU GET IN TROUBLE, CALL A CRACK HEAD. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO AN AD LIKE THAT? >> I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT SENATOR KENNEDY CHOOSES TO BLOW THE DOG WHISTLE OF RACISM. LISTEN, WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE GOOD COPS AND THERE ARE BAD COPS. BUT THE SOMEHOW SUGGEST AND USE THIS DOG WHISTLE ATTACK, TO USE HURTFUL LANGUAGE ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT WE KNOW IS IN FACT AS MUCH AND ISSUE AS THE OPIOID CRISIS, WHEN PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED TO CRACK IN THE MID 80S, IT WAS, OH, LOCK THEM UP! BUT THEN WHEN IT BECAME AN ISSUE OF OPIOIDS, THEN WE RECOGNIZED, WAIT A MINUTE, THERE'S AN ILLNESS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. THE SAME THING IS APPLICABLE FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE ADDICTED TO CRACK COCAINE. WE NOW RECOGNIZE WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BY PROVIDING TREATMENT. ARREST PEOPLE WHO BREAK LAWS AND COMMIT CRIMES, PEOPLE ADDICTED TO DRUGS SHOULD GET TREATMENT. FIRST SENATOR KENNEDY TO TRY TO USE THIS AS A POLITICAL PLOY, IT'S UNFORTUNATE, UNNECESSARY, AND IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD TO UNIFY OUR COUNTRY OR MOVE IT FORWARD WITH RESOURCES WE HAVE TO PROTECT AND SERVE. >> CONGRESSMAN TROY CARTER, YOU SUCCEEDED A VERY EFFECTIVE CONGRESSMAN IN CEDRIC RICHMOND. IT'S GONNA BE HARD ONCE HE LEFT AND WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. HE SAID YOU HAVE TO SEE THE GUY COMING BEHIND ME. THE EARLY FORECAST HAS BEEN VERY POSITIVE.

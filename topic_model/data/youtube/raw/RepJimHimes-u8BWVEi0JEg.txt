a year so let's bring in representative Jim Heintz a Democrat from Connecticut a member of the House Intelligence Committee congressman thank you very much for joining us because of this new bomb video because of what's going on in Paris do we have any specific information of any threats here in the United States and the information about connections to these terrorists brothers us people who had traveled abroad what are we learning about our connection to anything happening there well Chris at this point there's no as other officials have said there's no specific threat to the United States but that of course does not mean that we don't remain enormously vigilant you know one of the things that we see in these situations is it from time to time there are copycat acts but to answer your question no at this point there is no specific and credible threat against targets in the United because the early word from us Intel was you know this these these brothers these actors this is a one office as a French thing then they wound up being on a US no-fly list that's why I'm asking it again are we sure that you don't have members of the United States who may be back here now who were somehow involved of this foreign training and loosely organized cell that we're seeing uncovered in Paris yeah yeah we're not sure you know in fact this is one of the things that makes terrorism so challenging of course we're not sure we can never be sure that there aren't people in our cities who are in some way shape or form related that her perhaps aren't related but we're inspired by anwar al-awlaki who seems to have at least in my opinion played some role in inspiring these guys so no unfortunately in this in this game one can never be sure but on the other hand you know from time to time you do get indications that there are possible attacks underway we're not in that mode but of course you cannot be sure that there aren't somebody who you know perhaps trained with these guys or maybe just simply never met these guys or has never been to Yemen or anywhere else but gets inspired and gets motivated by what in their twisted way they would consider the success of this act in Paris all right congressman I'm going to circle back to Terra but we have a responsibility to address something that's going to have an impact here domestically let's put up Speaker Boehner is on statement please about immigration all right there's going to be a bill that's coming as that's going to include amendments to stop the presidents unilateral actions on immigration and the speaker reminded the president that he himself had stated publicly many times in the past that he did not have the power to rewrite immigration law through executive action now as you know the president's response to that has been yes so pass a bill but that doesn't really work legally and it hasn't really worked politically what is your position in terms of whether or not executive action is the way to go there and if not what's the alternative well my position is it's a real shame that we find ourselves in a world where executive action was necessary to try to move our immigration system to to something much more sane and something we all would consider sort of more reflective of our values look the Senate 500 600 days ago passed a bill with very strong bipartisan support that had money for the border that had a mechanism for over a very lengthy period of time and with a lot of penalties for people who are here illegally to make themselves right with the law and it never came up in the house despite very strong bipartisan support Senate so calm you need to be here but Congress bar here in part because the president did something that is now allowing Speaker Boehner to focus on what he did instead of focusing on immigration because he has apparently high ground on having used executive action to do something that the President himself admitted he shouldn't be doing by executive action so the distraction has now become the entire situation well let's be clear about what the president said he couldn't do the president said he couldn't rewrite immigration law and technically and legally that is correct what the president has done after waiting well more than a year for something that had strong bipartisan support in the Senate the president has said this is an urgent problem and within the law I'm going to act with prosecutorial discretion you know which is a time-tested concept everywhere including within the Oval Office I'm going to act to try to make this situation better now it's pretty clear from anybody who has looked at the actual law behind the room that the president has to exercise his discretion that this was a legal exercise of that discretion now of course the Republicans don't agree with that so what they've offered up is something just I got to tell you I scratch my head on it you know it is just so far beyond what I think most Americans think is the right thing to do I mean for example Chris you know the president's doc authority this was the dreamers you know the kids who you know came here at age one or two or three and no no other country the Blackburn Amendment which is going to come before the house today would basically eliminate that so these six hundred thousand kids you know many of them are kids who are in college or in the military who have come forward and said fine I'll take your deal I will stay employed i will pay my taxes i will stay right with the law now all of a sudden the Blackburn amendment and on the floor of the house today would say oh sorry we were just kidding one and a half years from now you were going to be at risk even though you're working today or in the university today of having an armed individual show up at your door and and send you to a country you may never have been too well that's my that's why the merits of the debate can't be gotten too quickly enough and that's why this executive action now is being criticized as having been a distraction but let's leave that issue because again we need to see that debate play out so the American people can make decisions about where they are on it let's go back to the war on terror a couple of points of where we are in terms of awareness the State Department the White House they seem to be wrestling all right and that's putting it gently with how to define who is committing acts of terror they don't seem to want to say Islamic extremists or Islamists why why are you getting caught up in vernacular in a situation that seems very clear the people committing the acts of terror are Muslims how they pervert the faith that's all something else but why hide from that seems like PC run amok another distraction yeah look I why do you want to be a little careful about that the reason you want to be a little careful about that is number one the single biggest group of victims of Islamic terror around the world are in fact other Muslims and therefore Chris of course one of the very best allies we can have and by the way that we absolutely need to have is the support of Muslims the vast majority of Muslims and of course Muslim countries and Muslim leaders who regard these terrorists is absolutely appalling and who will be our allies so if we're not a little careful about the language we use and if we just condemn an entire religion if we in to condemn entire countries it's going to be very hard for us to then work with those people in an alliance against what is a tiny fraction of extremists in that why you got to be careful 1.6 1.62 billion Muslims a very small fraction a wind of perverting original religion to do something else but that doesn't make the terrorists not Muslims it makes them bad Muslims it makes them ignorant Muslims misinformed Muslims but when you hide from the term Islam you are feeding people's paranoia about Islam as well I think you're out wind up being you know you're defeating your own intentions well look you know I thought quote the other day somebody said you know when there's this many bad apples there is a problem in the orchard and I and and you know to some extent I think that that's right clearly there is some warped segment within Islam that is inspiring people to do this but you know and there's that makes no sense at all that sort of deny that fact and if it frankly look if I were a Muslim cleric if I were a Muslim leader I would be sitting back and thinking to myself my god what has happened in this little corner of my religion that has allowed people to hijack in this way that's I think soul-searching that needs to have and by the way we should demand of moderates and thoughtful Islamic leaders that they stand up and very clearly condemn this stuff and that they have that soul-searching but look when a guy like me or the president the United States demands that of another religion you know that it looks at moderates who maybe do contend this tough and say what that what the heck is wrong with you people that's not a constructive dialogue you know that it's going to you know urge both the Alliance we need and fighting these terrorists but also urged the sort of soul-searching that I do think needs to happen amongst the leadership within that within that religion congressman jim Himes thank you very much for coming on new day look forward to continuing the conversation thank you Chris

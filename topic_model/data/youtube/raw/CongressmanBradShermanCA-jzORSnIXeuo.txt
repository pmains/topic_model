as russia continues its attacks on ukraine the u.s is responding with continued support for the ukrainian people this means everything from supplying weapons to welcoming refugees here at home sherman oaks congressman brad sherman is providing his constituents with an update on the status of the war and america's efforts he is hosting a telephone town hall tonight with the current ambassador of ukraine to the u.s congressman sherman joins us live this morning to tell us more good morning congressman thank you for joining us thank you we've had a series of telephone town halls throughout the the whole coven period and this is going to be a particularly good town hall at 7 00 pm this evening because we do have really in her only appearance uh before people in california and her only congressional town hall ambassador mara karova who is the representative of the ukrainian government here in the united states and i think has done an outstanding job of presenting their case to the american people as you hold this town hall tonight congressman the atrocities coming out of ukraine as you well know are getting worse by the day against innocent civilians ukrainian president zielenski is calling on russia's calling russia's actions genocide and called for the west to do more military aid working with allies to shut off gas imports how far are you willing to go are you willing to go much further than congress has gone already well we need to be providing ukraine with the weapons they need to defend themselves and even to roll back some of the invasion uh we need to take tougher uh economic steps on russia there are a host of other oligarchs that still need to be sanctioned but we need to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies to evade those sanctions and uh we need to provide tanks and air defense systems to the ukrainian defense forces president zielinski called on the security council to oust russia from the security council and to enforce article one which is to keep the peace and says if they're not going to do that zelinski asked why the council exists in the first place do you agree with that well the united nations is a very imperfect organization but uh you cannot expel russia from the security council why well you would need a vote of the security council where russia has a veto and uh while the un is a very imperfect organization it's a place for good and bad actors to get together and discuss efforts if we only had an organization of democracies and perhaps we do need a worldwide organization we have nato we have relationships in asia perhaps there needs to be a second you win but there needs to be a place where all nations can discuss policy and the u.n uh fills that role as a technical matter uh you cannot under the un charter expel russia from the security council without russia's consent and that is not going to happen top usgs other hand i don't i don't i don't blame zilinski for select for suggesting it congressman top u.s general mark milley is warning that the way this war is escalating this could expand now into an international conflict another world war that we so fear and as a member yourself of the foreign affairs committee at what point should nato get involved blasto being heard near the polish border 50 miles away as we speak that's why we have a border between nato territory and non-nato territory we are obligated to defend nato territory as if it was our own uh ukraine is not a member of nato and uh we must avoid uh americans and russians shooting at each other because that could clearly get out of hand and i realize from a ukraine perspective the number one issue is reclaiming their territory from this russian invasion but from an american perspective while that is important of even greater importance is avoiding a thermonuclear war i do want to point out that people can dial into our town hall at 7 00 p.m or anytime between 7 00 and 8 15 and i'll hold up the phone number here hold it up a little higher hold it up a little higher so we can see it there you go zero five four eight um before our time is finished here i did want to ask you the us is preparing to welcome a hundred thousand refugees we aired a story this morning about the challenges of the asylum process what is your district doing to welcome these refugees and make sure their passage into our country is easy and they're not treated as criminals when they come well i think those who come will be those with family here in the united states and and but we should regard refugee acceptance either united states or the much larger number of refugees that germany poland and others are taking in europe as a very much a second best solution the goal here isn't to depopulate ukraine and have its people move elsewhere the purpose here is to restore an independent and hopefully prosperous ukraine and so we should welcome refugees some of them will be coming only on a temporary basis uh the vast majority of ukrainians want to live in ukraine congressman thank you so much for joining us this morning we wish you the very best of luck with your town hall tonight at 7 00 p.m dial the number right there on your screen we're promoting it yet again i happen to live in your district congressman sherman sherman oak so thank you very much for joining us this morning and we'll be in touch good people will have a chance to ask questions and i think it'll be an interesting wonderful so important thank you and we'll be right back everyone

every day in Congress I'm guided by Louisiana values not by those of Washington DC there's a reason the founder spoke of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness because it starts with defending and promoting a culture of life for me as a doctor this means prolonging life and relieving pain it violates this culture of life to inflict pain on the unborn that's why I'm pro-life and why I support pro-life legislation

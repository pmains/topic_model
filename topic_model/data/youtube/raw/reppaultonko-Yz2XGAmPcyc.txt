M. Speaker, we must act swiftly  and with boldness to renew America’s failing water systems. We know the heartache  of failing water systems all too well lead, PFAS, disruptive  water main breaks and unaffordable bills. Yesterday I introduced bold national drinking water legislation written with my friend and Energy & Commerce Committee  chair Frank Pallone to restore America’s most critical infrastructure and one of our most basic  responsibilities of government— our drinking water systems. The AQUA Act delivers on President Joe Biden’s promise to remove every lead service line in the country, including removing lead from the drinking water systems of some 400,000 schools and childcare centers. Our bill invests heavily in the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund to put resources in the hands of folks on the ground who know  what their communities need. And it delivers a financial lifeline to local water systems in return for a multi-year commitment that they will not shut off anyone’s  water because of financial hardship  during this devastating and prolonged pandemic.  Let’s rise to meet the moment Let's do our jobs. Let's build back the right way  so every American can use, and trust,  the water coming out of our taps.

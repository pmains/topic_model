if we're going to get our federal debt under control and actually pay back the 26 trillion dollars we owe to other nations and actually the american people we're gonna have to do something very important we're gonna have to actually embrace balanced budgets in washington and also put federal agencies on a zero-based budget plan my proposal is every year we examine a new federal agency zero out their budgets and rebuild it from the bottom up this way we can actually justify the spending in those agencies and get rid of some of the wasteful and outdated programs that have long existed the last thing we have to do is we are going to have to look at uh social security and medicare we're gonna have to maintain those programs for the current retirees so they can get the benefits they were promised while actually reforming them for young people like myself people under the age of 55 so that they can actually have a program that can work for them in the future while taking care of current retirees all with the plan of paying down our national debt [Music]

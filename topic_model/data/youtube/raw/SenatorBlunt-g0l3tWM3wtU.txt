Thank You chairman congressman Brent cliff it's good to have you here this job is gone vacant for too long it's a critically important job I'm glad you've been nominated I've read with great interest the letter in the record that was given to us from former attorney general Ashcroft he's been a good friend of mine for a long time I trust his judgment I know you worked with him as a US Attorney and also in a law firm that was formed after you both left the Justice Department and his view of you which he shared with me personally as well as in this letter is significant we've had a chance to visit about your work on the House Intelligence Committee and I particularly appreciated your last comment about the importance of being fully open and an oversight committee like this one being fully informed I would say that when we stood up this structure after 9/11 I certainly anticipated a much smaller coordinating opportunity rather than the bureaucratic size that we see today I hope when you have a chance to look at this that you'll look carefully at whether or not the structure as it's grown has really served the principal purpose of coordinating information or if in some way it may have created yet one more stovepipe of information I'd like you to comment on your views maybe it's a house Intel member of just the size of DNI itself and if that size is one you think is too big too small or just right senator thank you for the for the remarks and the association with former antenna Attorney General John Ashcroft who's a great American and but I like you come into this position if confirmed with some preconceived impressions based on discussions I've had on the oversight committee and as Senator Collins leaves the room I want to make sure you know one of the goals of the of the DNI if confirmed is to make sure that the odni and the DNI position are working exactly like Senator Collins and those who stood it up intended it and so I had a chance to visit with her about it like you I come in with the perspective that you have conversations that maybe indicate that there is too much bureaucracy and there's too much redundancy some redundancy is good but if there's 17 agencies they don't need to be doing the same thing 17 times or purchasing the same things and so it'll be one of my immediate priorities to assess how the odni is functioning again the goal of the odni is to make the IC better so that the IC can make you better and the president better and policy makers better and so I do think that I want it to be as efficient as possible but I'll be thoughtful and talk with the heads of the intelligence agencies and elements to find out where they think that some of these things may just be unnecessary redundancies and address those you know I think another question to ask and you don't have to comment on this but for you to ask is is this this agency has grown have we let the other agencies not have the attention or the staff they needed as the whole universe of intelligence US intelligence has grown so much of it has grown at this point that was to be the central clearinghouse the agency that coordinated information to be sure nobody was left out and I would look at that during the 19 years that we have the last 19 years we very much been focused on violent terrorist extremists as the the focus of so much of our intelligence efforts certainly that threat has not gone away but it's also equally a certain that great power competition has emerged in ways that we wouldn't have anticipated even a handful of years ago talk a little bit about rebalancing the resources you have to continue to keep an eye on the threats that we have so focused on for almost two decades now but also to rebalance into the great power competition that we see as a significant challenge for us today senator great question and I appreciate you asking because I've had that conversation with a lot of people about what I view as the greatest threat and the greatest threat actor and I view China as the greatest threat actor right now I mean look at where we are with respect to kovat 19 and the role to China plays the race to 5g cyber security issues all all roads lead to China there and so one of the priorities highest priorities that I'll have if confirmed as DNI is to make sure and again my background with with regard to you know violent extremists you know that is a generational challenge that we will continue to deal with we may forget about them but they don't forget about us but I agree with you in terms of making sure as we look at the national intelligence framework and whether we're committing enough resources to the rising power that is China when you look at the the initiatives that they have the Belton Road the made in China 2025 the all of the military civil fusion initiative where they literally want by law Chinese companies to collect intelligence these are all spokes of the same initiative and that's for China to supplant us as as the world's superpower and to be able to set standards around the world and we very clearly don't an authoritarian regime like the Chinese Communist Party setting standards in the world marketplace and so I look forward to sitting down with you if confirmed about how odni and the and the the other sixteen elements are dedicated to the rising threat that is China which I view as our greatest threat actor well certainly Russia is another great threat do you want to talk about that for just a second as I conclude my questions you bet different just because you know Russia we are concerned with Russia in terms of anytime you have a large nuclear stockpile and they are certainly dedicated to sowing seeds of discord we are most concerned with them with regard to election interference and making sure we have safe secure credible elections because that's what they have been focused on and and they've been as I said earlier they've been successful in sowing seeds of discord but not fortunately in changing votes or the outcome but between the two to be real clear I view China as the rising power whereas Russia you know has an economy about the same size as the economy of my home state of Texas so we need to be very concerned with them Vladimir Putin is a very bad actor and and so as as DNI if confirmed I will make sure that we balance appropriate where our resources are going with regard to both of those threats No thank you mr. Radcliffe congressman I look forward to supporting your nomination both here in the committee and on the floor and you're working with us as you get this job thank you

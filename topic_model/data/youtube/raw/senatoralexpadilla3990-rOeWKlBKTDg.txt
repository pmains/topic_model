IF THEY SWITCH TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THAT'S WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. WITH US NOW TO CONTINUE OUR  CONVERSATION IS CALIFORNIA  SENATOR ALEX PADILLA. ALSO THE FIRST LATINO TO BE A  SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF  CALIFORNIA. SENATOR, IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE  TO SEE YOU. AS WAS POINTED OUT, THE LATINO  VOTE SHIFTED TOWARD REPUBLICANS  IN 2020. EVEN THOUGH DEMOCRATS ARE STILL  HOLDING AN ADVANTAGE IN THE  LATINO VOTING AS A NATION, WHY  DO YOU THINK THIS SHIFT IS  OCCURRING? IS IT A SIGNIFICANT ONE? >> GOOD MORNING, JOSE. HAPPY HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH. I THINK THERE'S A FEW THINGS  THAT ARE GOING ON. ANYBODY WHO HAS TRAVELED TO THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN  LATINO MOVIES CAN UNDERSTAND  THAT THE COMMUNITY IS DIVERSE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MAYBE A  THIRD GENERATION, FOURTH  GENERATION IN SOUTH XAXAS, VERY  DIFFERENT THAN THE DYNAMICS OF  THE LATINO COMMUNITY IN SOUTH  FLORIDA. VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE DYNAMICS OF PUERTO RICANS AND DOMINICANS  IN NEW YORK OR VERY DIVERSE  LATINO COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE OLD ADAGE APPLIES TO  LATINO COMMUNITY AS WELL. THE ONE THING WE HAVE SEEN SHIFT IN RECENT YEARS IS MORE  AGGRESSIVE INVESTMENT BY THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY TO ENGAGE  LATINO VOTERS, NOT JUST THE LAST WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION AND  DEMOCRATS ARE DOING THE SAME. AND SO THE LATINO VOTE, LIKE ANY OTHER VOTER, SULULD NEVER BE  TAKEN FOR GRANTED. DEMOCRATS HAVE A BEAUTIFUL STORY TO TL.L. IF YOU LOOK A AT THE RESCUE PLA  PASSED WITHOUT A SINGLE  REPUBLICAN VOTE, THENFLATION  REDUCTION ACT, IN WHICH  COMMUNITIES ARE ON THE FRONT  LINE WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGING  CLIMATE AND THE DEVASTATION THAT HAS COME WITH THAT. THE STUDENT LOAN RELIEF THAT  PRESIDENT BIDEN JUST INITIATED,  TREMENDOUS AID FOR LATINO  VOTERS. SO DEMOCRATS HAVE A TREMENDOUS  STORY TO TELL. WE'RE OUT THERE TELLING IT. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BODE WELL  FOR US THIS NOVEMBER. >> I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO  THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT  WEWE'RE SEEING IN OUR BORDER. ROUGHLY 8,000 MIGRANTS ARE  CROSSING THE BORDER INTO THE  U.S. EVERY DAY. HERE'S SOME OF WHAT THE VICE  PRESIDENT HAD TO TELL WHEN SHE  WAS ASKED ABOUT THE GOVERNORS OF TEXAS SENDING MIGRANTS TO OTHER  STATES UNANNOUNCED. >> I THINK IT IS THE HEIGHT OF  IRRESPONSIBILITY, MUCH LESS  FRANKLY A DERELICTION OF DUTY. WHEN YOU'RE AN ELECTED LEADER,  TO PLAY THOSE KINDS OF GAMES  WITH HUMAN LIFE AND HUMAN  BEINGS. IF YOU THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM,  PART OF THE SOLUTION. >> SO SENATOR, WHAT IS THE  SOLUTION HERE? >> LET ME JUST ADD TO WHAT THE  VICE PRESIDENT SAID. IT'S ALSO SHAMESESS WHAT'S  HAPPENING. THE LATEST ESTIMATES, 12,000 PER MIGRANT THAT GOVERNOR RON  DeSANTIS PAID TO FLY FOLKS, FLY  ASYLUM SEEKERS OUT OF TEXAS ALL  THE WAY TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD. MONEY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AND  SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN  TEMPORARY HOUSING, EMERGENCY  FOOD, SHELTER, SOMETHING THAT  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO  INVEST MORE IN. HOW ABOUT A PHONE CALL HOME TO  CONNECT WITH LOVED ONES. THAT'S MORE OF A HUMANE  TREATMENT OF ASYLUM SEEKERS THAN WHAT THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS  ARE DEMONSTRATING. THE FIX, WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE  CAPACITY OF THE VERY DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT WERE STARVED  UNDER THE TRUMPDMDMINISTRATION  THAT ARE IN CHARGE OF THIS. WE HAVE TO FIX THE LEGAL  MIGRATION PATHWAYS THAT HAVEN'T  BEEN MODERNIZED IN MORE THAN00  YEARS. IT'S REAL SIMPLE. WATER FLOWS. IF YOU FIX THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE SEEKING TO COME TO THIS  COUNTRY TO WORK, TO STUDY, OR  ANYTHING ELSE, THAT TAKES  PRESSURE OFF THE REGULAR  MIGRATION FLOWS THAT WE HAVE  SEEN IN RECENT YEARS. >> SENATOR, IT'S ALWAYS A  PLEASURE TO SEE YOU.

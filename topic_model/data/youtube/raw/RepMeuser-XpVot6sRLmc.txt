joining us now with reaction is republican congressman from pennsylvania dan muser congressman welcome thank you for coming on today uh now again there are just some concerns about what might happen next in regards to chemical warfare possibly coming from russia uh your thoughts on these concerns and the reports that have surfaced well you know first off the research that takes place in the ukraine us is no involvement in i understand that some security has been provided advice things of that nature you know what emma this is just another propaganda uh maneuver on on the part of russia making uh something out uh that that really is nothing look the danger here is putin and the orders he's giving to his russian troops they're firing on nuclear plants uh they're taking over nuclear plants and they will go on the attack and these bio research facilities uh to make it as if um this is anyone's fault other than putin putin has has invaded the sovereign nation we must do everything possible to defeat him and the us should show some leadership which has been enormously lacking up to this point uh congressman your analysis your evaluation of how the white house has responded to the invasion so far you talk about uh possibly sending in more military equipment to ukraine has the u.s done enough no we haven't done enough we haven't prepared we haven't led we've responded we've reacted and you know i'd even go for an overreaction at least the weapons the lethal weapons that we're providing are now getting in so that's a good thing uh the aircraft fiasco where we had an agreement with poland and germany and the ukraine that fell apart which was just a clear sign of the level of disorganization and competence that's coming out of this white house look they need to get serious they need to have deliverables we need to have goals and the goal is for the ukraines to be victorious and for us to do all possible short of direct contact and emma just think about it what a world difference we're going to be if the ukraine comes out of this with victory as opposed to a an autocratic tyrant having having victory for the long term so this is a historical pivotal moment the u.s has got to step up as other countries frankly are ahead of us president biden expected to announce more sanctions on russia later this morning also revoking the most favored nation trade status is that a solid approach is that a step further oh you know what that's what uh kevin brady and republicans and myself we initiated in a bill last week that the democrats turned away from and joe biden said he was not going to support so now again about eight nine days later he's seeing that yes that that level of increased uh sanctions and all on this uh uh this putin's russia uh it is necessary yes it will help but we need to um listen to zelinski we need to work with our nato partners we need to simply need the highest level of weapons and support and sanctions and make putin's life an absolute living hell both in russia around the world and in the ukraine uh be because again we're just very simply at this pivotal moment and you know i mean the bible administration is just just you're frankly being an embarrassment and my democrat colleagues need to get on board with some of these bills and some some of these initiatives because i know they know what's right um and it's not about making excuses it's about solutions it's not about pointing fingers it's about being a responsible world power the us has traditionally been all right we'll leave it at that congressman dan mueser joining us on this friday congressman thank you very much

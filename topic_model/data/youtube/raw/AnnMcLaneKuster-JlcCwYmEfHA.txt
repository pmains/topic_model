hi I'm Ken Burns for more than 30 years I've been making films that tell some of America's many incredible stories the idea underpinning our greatest achievements has always been that America is at its strongest when everyone has an equal chance something that our current Congress is failing to provide I met any years ago and I knew right away that she had the qualities we need in our elected officials commitment to providing everyone with that equal chance compassion and the willingness to look past politics and bring people together from both sides of the aisle that's why I'm supporting Annie and will be casting my vote for her in November there have already been a flood of attacks targeting Annie but the great thing about New Hampshire is that a grassroots campaign is still more powerful than the money we're seeing from outside interests in the coming weeks I'm going to be doing everything I can to make sure annie is my next congresswoman and I need you to join me just visit custard for congress.com and you can make a contribution to her campaign and sign up to volunteer thanks so very much

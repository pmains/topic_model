i want to predict a little something about this campaign it's going to be there's going to be a lot of negative stuff not coming from me no negative ads from this campaign whatsoever no negative effort but i've come to realize in the last month that i represent a threat and that there are forces in this country that are going to be very upset about tonight the idea of somebody coming to washington who doesn't owe anybody who isn't in the pocket of anybody who's unpredictable who unpredictable that's another word for doing what you think is right and here's what's i think the heart of this campaign and it goes to the heart of what's wrong in washington today when i go to washington nobody will tell me how to vote except the people of maine

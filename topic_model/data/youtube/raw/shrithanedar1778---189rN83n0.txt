Louis Missouri so I left the state in 84 became I worked as a chemist for about six years and then I wanted to be on my own and I found a little business three-person business that did chemical testing chemical analysis they analyzed water for led they analyzed soil for chemicals and then I bought that company for $75,000 I got a loan from the bank I had 3,000 on my credit card so I put that in there so you can see ID my daddy didn't give me 14 million dollars and then I started the business or 3% business and I grew it and as I was growing the business in six years my boys were four and eight years old about grew the business for $150,000 annually revenue to about two million about grew jobs to about 20 and you know my wife the the Boyle boy's mother died she was suffering from mental illness and she died and I had to take care of the boys as a single father until I got remarried and so the boys were four and six year four and eight years old and I had to deal with my sorrow my grief I had to deal with theirs and but I'm proud of them they you know they grew up they graduate from Ross Business School at the University of Michigan and now they're entrepreneurs creating jobs yeah yes I do yes I do now I have a grandson who is 15 months old name is Kai ki and you know he's my after all the whole long day of campaigning I come to come home and I guess see his video or talk to him on skype yeah and it is such a relief he now it is like racing and so then the business kept growing and in by before the recession of as a ground to evaluation about 200 million 450 employees all in American not a single job outsourced and dental and then came the recession and in the recession many of my clients were smaller companies and they went belly-up and the bank Bank of America who got all these federal subsidiaries because they were too big to fail I had no trouble closing on my business and this sold some of the business close some of the down collected more money than I owed them and they keep the extra money as the late fees and penalties and they gave me a cardboard box and said mr. Canada if you take some of your personal stuff feel free to and I started so I put my children's pictures in my box and I'm walking out I see this award that I had 100 pruner of the year from Ernst & Young so I asked them and they let me take that thing and I said I'm going to win another one of these someday and I come home and we learned that in three weeks they're gonna foreclose on our home the same Bank because they owned everything that I own so I my wife and I all day we work hard to put our clothes and our personal stuff in the budget rental truck and leave our home for the last time and we start driving at 6 p.m. and we driving to Ann Arbor Michigan now and so we reach Ann Arbor at 3 a.m. put our stuff in a rental place next day I found a little rental space that used to be a lab and also had gone out of business in the recession I buy that this is in September of 2010 and then I grew their business and in 2016 I had 50 jobs have created in Ann Arbor Michigan I'll continue so now you're an NRI you pick up this little company and you start the oh yeah I I mean I started the company I was 55 years old and lon six years from 2010 to 2016 I never worked harder in my life because I had I didn't have much time left I felt I need to really get this thing done and so in 2016 I got that award under finger of the euro and you know I and my wife looked at each other and we said we did good for our family we achieved our American dream but you know what American Dream is fading all over America an American Dream is fading in Michigan more so than any other place and it at that point it made no sense for me to keep doing good for my family and I decided my wife and I decided to just sell the business so in in yeah in 26 and now the business was really doing great but in 2016 we sold the business then we took 1.5 million dollars and gave it to all of my 50 employees and the way I video yeah the way we did the title but the length of service so kidding so Katy who was my administrative assistant got the most money she walked away with one hundred and seven thousand dollars and then I took a little more money and put it into my campaign and announced my candidacy for governor no I was the fourth candidate to announce because yeah I announced mine can you receive June the 7th and by then already there were three other candidates yes and so in November they did a poll and I came in at 2% in the poll with an error margin of plus or minus four things have changed and then I started traveling everywhere I've gone to about 48 of the 83 counties I've met a lot of people we put made some ads and put it those on television because a big state and it's not possible to meet every person and I wanted to reach them out through television through social media we now have like 66 thousand followers on our Facebook how many 66,000 and that's more than any of the other candidates and and the recent poll came out and that put me 3 percent of a head of the other candidate so I am now in first place at least for this week I'm sure it'll make you remember even people are even texting me now like and you pronounce REE Sheree and and so what and more commercials are coming this week okay we are bringing out seven more I mean what why did you want to do this well like I said I want to give back you know uh as an immigrant I came here with a dream and this country of ours and this state of ours has given me so much the state has given me look when I lost everything I came to Ann Arbor and made it again yeah and nowhere else I could have done this and I feel that I have tremendous obligation you know I've been a US citizen since 1988 and this is my chance and I have said that I want to devote rest of my life to public service I saw what happened in Flint the state of Michigan poisoned his own citizens the governor tried to run the state like a business and this state is not a business really dealing with people's lives and and just does the whole Flint thing that's the whole you know feeding the big corporations not taking care of people all of that bothered me and I said I'm gonna set rest to spend the rest of my life Public Service fixing things I'm a problem-solver that's right and I see so many problems in Michigan and the politicians are only going to give us lip service they're not gonna do what needs to be done and I'm a doer and I'm gonna go there and you know make things happen I'm not just gonna go there grandstanding and talking but I'm gonna go work with people and find the good solutions think big and think about a future that's bigger and better than what we have today in Michigan we're talking with Sharief battler yeah who is running for the governor's chair I do want to say this in terms of people in the hoods yes yes yes what did even at your pinnacle you still took what you had and shared it with those who could not have done better yeah those are traits that people have been looking for what do people say to you as you shake hands with first thing when I go and shake my hand they say I said I'm sorry and they said I know I have the highest name ID now 65% and my competitor is more around 40 some percent so I have the highest name ID the only person that have a higher name ID is Bill Schuette who I'm gonna beat but you know people are hurting and you know Snyder can go talk about the numbers and all that but you know we pre recession we still haven't made up the jobs that we lost in the recession we're still about 300,000 jobs shy of it people are hurting and people are doing multiple jobs we don't have enough skills we you know 65,000 skilled jobs are unfilled you know Amazon did not even take all the goodies they gave them because Amazon said fix your education system you don't have enough skilled people our education is at the bottom the charter schools have in the for-profit charter school so nobody should be profiting from public school dollars we need to respect our teachers we need to pay them well we need to improve our education we need to have a a universal pre-k so that the young kids a one to four year old kids can learn early so that they can do better in the third grade and the 4th grade math you know you know we gotta give of the future to our children means we have to invest in them that's right it all starts with education I want to be the education governor I want to take this our education to the top and once we do that and we once we let people have skills vocational skills technical career skills then people can get good-paying jobs I want to bring the technical education vocational skills in the middle schools and in high schools and have apprenticeship programs and I want to expunge records and you know let people that have nonviolent offenders serve the society in another way you know not locking people up you know we just have we spend so much money in locking people up 2.5 billion dollars if we could invest some of that money and give them the skills then they can become the productive members of society and they don't have to go back into prison simply with crisis opioid crisis it is not a law enforcement is a compassion issue and it's a it's a you know counseling and we need to shut down those pill mills and the pharmaceutical companies that are pushing those medicine on us so this we need compassion you know this government need compassion you know that there's too much influence of big corporation the billion-dollar families on our politician on our government and that has corrupted our government and we need to free that and we need to free that by and someone who is not beholden to the corporation the special interest can do that and that's what I want to do Wow thank you for sharing some yes that was just my question I just want to know more about your book the blue suitcase yes you know I'm already know our state is last in transparency and ethics but you know I wrote this book with very honestly and transparently so you see everything about me in this I think the people of Michigan have a right to know who they're gonna elect as their next leader so you have a background blueprint haha  they think it pick up they don't have to ask the other person they didn't know for thyself yeah yeah and this is not a political book it's just a book about my story I'm just telling it like I'm gonna tell it to a friend sure and so so you know who I am you know how I have lived my life and you know that how I'll work you know that's what I will work I'm not much for photo ops and I'm not much for you know the publicity I'm more therefore to solve the problems I'm a problem solver you live you lived it all how do you get the book the book can be downloaded free of course from my website you can get an eCopy from the website at www.att.com/biz govern the governorship for Democratic Party sorry 2018 dot-com they can go there look at my positions I I have the most information on my website about then any other candidates so you can see my positions on you know just about everything education health care I'm want to bring Medicare for all I want to cover more people under health care I want to fix the education system and then I want to invest in small businesses I want to bring entrepreneurship I am a serial entrepreneur and I want to invest not in the big googles and the Amazons don't need our money and they don't have loyalty to our state we need to invest in the little businesses the small radio station or a printing press or a restaurant we need to get encourage P or everywhere young people including you know in inner cities you know we need to give people hope and it's not about just begging for jobs I want to make them inspired enough that they make their own future by starting small businesses and we'll give them micro loans and we'll have counseling and we'll have business incubators where they can bring their ideas and grow it into a business so we need to create that concept and our children are leaving after college and finding their American Dream elsewhere they need to stay right here and we're going to reduce their college debt if they stay Michigan work in Michigan if they stay in Michigan work or start a business and create jobs in Michigan the college debt will be forgiven even faster well I think the first thought that came to my mind when the Flint disaster started happening okay you know when I said I know as a scientist I could not bear to see that and as a scientist online Umbridge line five under the straits of mackinac and that's a ticking time bomb if that pipeline is 60 plus years old if it breaks it will ruin the our Great Lakes you can fix fine I will I can fix Flint we need to provide the residents of Flint who got exposed a free medical care because some of that I the scientists I understand the effect of lead not only physical health but mental health and some of the mental health effects may not even be known for another 10 years so we need to make a registry we need to make sure what monitors their health and give them the help that they need because the state did wrong to these people you can find all information all things Sharia at 3:00 2018 calm yes and you know I'm so so thankful to you John I am I know your legend and I saw such an honor to be on your shop haha I you bring a firstrow first idea yeah I think we've seen the gamin of political or people who want position in a lot of them are missing one main ingredient in that is compassion for the people absolutely and honesty and skillset he knows a problem-solving skill said that we need for to take our state from this status quo into the next level thank you very much yeah thanks Oh

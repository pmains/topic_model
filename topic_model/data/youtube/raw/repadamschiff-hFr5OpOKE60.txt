um out front now democratic congressman adam schiff he's on the house select committee investigating january 6. he's also the chairman of the house intelligence committee uh congressman chairman uh thank you for coming on i want to get your reaction first to this new reporting from evan perez about how far jeffrey clark that justice official went to help try and help donald trump push this massive election lie even going to these specialized chinese thermometers it is really staggering to see how close they came to subverting our elections our democracy and clark in particular if what's reported is correct he was not only proposing that the right top justice officials including the acting attorney general write to georgia elections well at georgia legislature and urge them to come back in a special session to discuss whether they should appoint a alternate set of electors and that there may have been five other letters to go out to five other states and when you consider that he might have been appointed by trump as attorney general he might have replaced rosen those letters would have gone out and who knows what those state legislators might have done as a result add all that together does jeffrey clark need to come testify before your committee before the select committee well i i think he's going to be a very important witness and i don't want to speak for the chairman we'll make those decisions together as a committee but i think we need to view january 6 in the right context which is there were efforts before the election to subvert the election by pushing out false claims of fraud there were obviously efforts after the election to try to overturn the results with the president intervening with state legislators with local electors local board members who would vote whether to certify uh their elections and then you have what was going on the justice department again at the president's instigation all of this is important in terms of what led us to january 6 and where we go forward as a nation well and in the immediate going forward we're hearing more about a former trump campaign official who's been talking up another protest at the capitol planned for next month this one in support of the alleged rioters the people who are charged with crimes for the insurrection who are still behind bars i want to play for you some of what he told steve bannon and i think that as we continue to raise the profile of these individuals it makes it harder and harder for the left's phony narrative about an insurrection to stick we have our next rally planned it's in the middle of september september 18th and it's going to be huge and what's going to define it is where it's going to take place we're going back to the capitol right where it started we're going to continue to raise the volume and push back against this phony narrative and demand justice for these political prisoners what is your reaction to hearing that well i have a few reactions so first of all uh this is very much uh in character for steve bannon and people that he associates with bannon after all famously said that what they needed to do was flood the zone with excrement except he used a different word uh as a way of confusing the public and this is exactly what's going on here in this effort to rewrite history to pretend that the insurrection didn't happen that it was a love fest between uh these people that gathered on january 6 and the police but it's important to realize that that voice we just heard um is not acting on its own on the very day that we had those four police officers before our committee testifying in a heartbreaking fashion about the trauma they endured that same day you had republican members of congress at the justice department out in front of the justice department making a similar argument that these insurrectionists these domestic terrorists were somehow political prisoners and the justice department should go easy on them so it's the alternate world that the former president would like people to live in uh and one completely at odds with the reality and one that's a continuing danger to the country yeah dismissing it isn't going to make it go away we know that now very distinctly from january 6th of course before you go uh mr chairman i'm seeing a report that the select committee has added former republican congressman denver rigelman as an adviser or someone who's familiar to folks who watch the show and watch cnn can you confirm that i can't confirm anything about the staff you know the committee will make its announcements uh in terms of any staffing that we bring on when the the chairman decides so i can't uh comment on that one way or another one thing we do know as is that denver rigelman he has spoken up very strongly about misinformation and the toxic nature of what it can do and has done um leading up to before and after january 6th um so his his opinion would be very interesting for the committee to have as some advice mr chairman thank you for your time thank you

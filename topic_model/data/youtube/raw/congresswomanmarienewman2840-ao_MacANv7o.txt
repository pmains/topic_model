and uh good to see everyone here tonight this is a very special evening although i wish it wasn't happening i wish we weren't saying goodbye to rich trump i i remember the first time i saw him speak i i thought about wow there's a lot of intensity there a lot of intention and yeah you scare me a little bit so i was very inspired to um join a picket line that day i had been on making many picket lines before that but he delivered his comments and what he uh intended to do for labor in such a way that made me feel like things were actually possible that it was possible to make change at an employer it was possible to make change at a plant and so specifically i joined a plant and their picket line and i didn't know anybody i just showed up because i thought wow this guy is someone that i will follow i will follow into fire and i did um at least long distance for a long time um and i have to tell you one other thing about um rich one of the things that i is immediately obvious and i frequently see this one in friends of mine that are in the military he is a servant leader true and true and through and through and i think that's the best kind of leader to be so i learned a lot from him and all of his work but mostly believe he really inspired the movement to be stronger and more vibrant in the last decade so we say goodbye to rich with heavy hearts but thank him for his amazing work and his ability to inspire

i'm joined now by colorado senator michael bennett he serves on both the intelligence and finance committees senator thanks so much for taking the time this morning thanks jim for having me i really appreciate it so we are watching here the slow annihilation as the pentagon describes the russian strategy of what was until a week ago for most of the country a peaceful country i i know you do not support u.s troops on the ground it's the position the byte administration as well no no-fly zone because both those things would put u.s forces into direct deadly conflict potentially with russian forces i wonder if ukraine falls if this progress continues will you still believe that well look jim this is a devastating attack on ukraine and we have to do everything we can right now to supply the ukrainians with lethal aid that they can use to try to fend off this criminal putin this tyrant putin and that's what we're going to do i think that i do my view is that we should not put u.s troops on the ground or in harm's way in ukraine and i think that's the bite administration's view as well but we have to do absolutely everything we can do as an international community to try to slow putin's progress and to punish him as as as hard as we can and to me it's gratifying to see the way the international community has mobilized to do that i just wonder if it's enough right i mean we heard sergey lavrov say today that this campaign is going to continue right no matter what the costs in effect and and it's cnn's reporting that yes russia has suffered losses perhaps three to five percent of their total forest but ukraine has suffered 10 percent losses and and it's a smaller force as you know the the direction lines are not good is the west doing enough yeah i think the direction lines are not good and while we should hope that the ukrainians are going to be able to stop this and i and i hope the ukrainians will be able to stop this and that putin will seek a political off-ramp of some kind that's not what we should expect because the numbers are just the numbers are what you just described them to be but this is an attack not just on ukraine it's attack on democracy it's an attack on the ability of humans to determine their their their futures and i don't think that we should be going to war with this with russia we've just spent 20 years fighting two wars in the middle east that by the way i think was a tragic mistake for the united states of america we shouldn't have done that this is not the same situation but i think that we have to be disciplined about this we have to offer the ukrainians all the aid we can we need to summon the world to push back on putin and and i think that's what we're trying to do but there is a degree and i'm not going to say that it's inevitable that putin's going to succeed here militarily i think it's inevitable that he has made a horrendous decision for himself for the world and for humanity the united states has to stand up for democracy and for the ukrainian people is this though perhaps a 1939 moment in that are we confident that putin stops at ukraine if he doesn't believe ukraine is a country that's somehow part of the greater russian empire he feels the same way about belarus which he's already subjugated he doesn't believe the baltic republics should be independent why should we believe he stops here well i don't think we should believe that and i think we should reserve the right to change our position if he goes beyond ukraine i you know my mom and her parents were polish jews who barely survived the holocaust in warsaw they and an aunt were the only ones that got out i can tell you that nobody in my family including myself is assuming anything about what this lunatic is going to do when you saw him the other night on television talking about you know throwing of all people vladimir lenin over the side saying lenin gave away ukraine and and sort of making himself into a peter the great figure reestablishing the russian empire we should be very clear-eyed about what is possible here so i think we need to stand up the way we are we need to lead the rest of the world we need to be pleased that germany and switzerland and others have come in in ways that i think a lot of people didn't expect and we're gonna have to do what's necessary and and again this is a battle the president is right about this we are living in an era speaking of 1939 when what's on offer here is totalitarianism versus democracy and whether you whether you think about what putin is doing in russia today or what china is doing with their state-sponsored capitalism they believe democracies law when they looked at january 6 what they said is america can't lead democracy is ruined and what we have to do in this moment is show them that we're here to fight for the people of ukraine and the right of human beings to determine their future senator bennett until a week ago a former american president a former american secretary of state many on right-wing media regardless of what they're saying now until a week ago they were defending praising even vladimir putin by doing so were they emboldening him were they in effect aiding and abetting of course of course of course and it's tragic and outrageous you know some have said that it's treasonous you know i people can make their own judgments about that but when the russian television is playing the words of cable television hosts in america to support what putin is doing when a former president of the united states is championing this kind of outrageous behavior it's pathetic yeah and by the way i think senator michael bennett i'd say this is an opportunity the other thing is this is an opportunity for people in this country to say it's time for us to put our divisions aside to unify and and to begin to work together because our internal divisions are a threat to democracy as well yeah well russia celebrates them we know very publicly senator michael bennett thanks so much for joining us thank you jim

dangerous thing that is happening there is this inability to look at mandatory spending and attack you know tackle that problem in a responsible way and if we keep passing that down to the next generation without you know trying to solve that problem it just gets worse and what we're doing is squeezing with sequestration discretionary which when you look at our military our homeland security our national security efforts is the number one thing under the constitution that we're supposed to be dealing with and yet i think it's causing some real problems from a national security standpoint it's going to get more dangerous if we can't take on some of these mandatory programs and reform them to save them for future generations and at the same time you can always squeeze this discretionary so much i mean i got briefed by the coast guard and the navy and they're telling me they can't they can't continue their interdiction efforts they're scaling back their interdiction efforts in latin america we're all the director coming out from colombia venezuela and you want to you want to extend that border to central america you don't have to deal with it right here that's just one example of many that you hear about that really puts us in a bad spot and again it's the number one duty under the constitution

Thank You senator next to Sarah white Thank You mr. chairman and thank you very much for all of your help and assistance particularly with this concept that I've worked on for almost a decade the question of bonding and we've talked around this issue repeatedly this afternoon but I think it's clear that the model that the country has used in transportation for years and years and years the gas tax is one that has profound limits and I've been very appreciative the comments I heard senator Enzi senator Coburn and others talking about how they're willing to build on it and I think at the same time like all of us understand there are going to be any rallies outside our office with this kind of economy saying please raise the gas tax so what we've got to do is we've got to find politically acceptable ways to generate additional revenue for the infrastructure that we all know needs to go forward I thought we had pretty good approach in the recovery act with Build America Bonds does a bipartisan approach a hundred and eighty-one billion dollars worth of build america bonds were sold 30 times more than anyone projected a number of my colleagues had concerns about that so i went back to the drawing board and particularly with Senator Hoeven what we have done is come up with a new approach tax credit bonds that have been back by the laborers an important union group and also by Doug holtz-eakin and I would just ask mr. chairman if Doug holtz-eakin statement on behalf of trips bonds could be made a part of the record no problem of that about objection and the only other point that I want to make is that this approach that now has support of labor folks and people like Doug holtz-eakin using tax credit bonds where the tax credit is based on the more market rather than government and uses the state's so it's not run from Washington DC I hope can be part of the effort as we look ahead I chairman Baucus a spot on that we are going to have to find a way to deal with this issue in terms of the big challenge I think what we've seen from the last five years is well targeted bonds particularly ones that use tax credits that have been able to unite conservatives and progressives can be part of that solutions Chairman I thank you as well for making the trip spawns a part of your mark this afternoon Thank You senator rockefeller

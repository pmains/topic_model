agency the GAO looked at 171 different goals only forty-six percent have been achieved forty-nine percent have not we can't go through all 171 topics so we try and break it down for you this way the department has made substantial progress in improving maritime security that's a good great for protecting our seaports there is moderate progress in immigration enforcement aviation Surface Transportation Security and protecting critical infrastructure like our bridges our tunnels and our highways there is modest progress in border security and immigration services as well but look here these are problem areas where the government is failing there's only limited progress in emergency preparedness and response like after a terror attack or a disaster and it has failed in keeping up with science and technology does this concern you well the report card has DHS officials boiling mad in fact check this out the Department continues to believe that they used a flawed methodology in preparing its report which resulted in many of the assessments not fully reflecting the department's progress Democratic congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi is the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee yeah I guess as a Democrat we need to be clear about this because you just heard what the gentleman said from DHS he says look we don't trust the report the last thing you want to do is gloat about something like this right but it does seem at least the way we've looked at the GAO before and the stuff that they've put out that it would be fair right you wouldn't think that they have an agenda set here right well that's correct Rick there are agency that look over our shoulders we ask them to look at certain things and report back to us and in this instance that's what they've done but as a viewer I'm sitting at home wondering how do you make sure that this is there any reason to believe the GAO would want to put out a report that in any way this merch is a reputation of the people who are trying to keep our country safe oh no there's no reason for that I trust the GAO they are professionals they do that job they bring us the facts and as members of Congress we are supposed to receive it and make legislation from it well if that's case and and and here's what you know you have to ask when you look at this report how about we spend billions and billions of dollars on this shouldn't Americans should we as Americans look at this and say what do we what are you giving what are we giving you our tax money for if you can't get the job done well I think Jo indicate that for the fact past four years on one area at maritime security that we really succeeded in the Department continues to be plagued with vacancies continue to be plagued with programs that start and stop in the middle of the stream so clearly they have given us this report card to say to members of Congress and the department here's what you need to do to guarantee that America will be safe and I think as legislators we have to take this report and move forward and correct those items they've outlined well I'll tell you what you probably should do as a legislator is contact the guys DHS and say what's going on here we want a full report from you guys I'm sure you've probably tried to do that right what's been the response well the response is just what you saw earlier in your your clip denial but our interest is get to the bottom to make it correct we will go forward we had a hearing yesterday with secretary short all will have hearings in the future I can guarantee that this report along with other information will be used by our committee to make America safe this information is absolutely vital to keeping the homeland secure so you're alarmed by this and I imagine you would be after anyone looks at this report you'd be alarm although the White House is going to say to you by the way we haven't been hit in six years so we must be doing something right to that you got 10 seconds to respond what would you say well just that is no reason to say that we've succeeded we have a lot to work on we look at this report will take this report and move forward congressman Bennie Thompson we thank you sir take time talk to us thank you

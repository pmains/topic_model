the the basic principle here is really pretty simple consumers and employees fighting for fundamental rights against giant corporations deserve their day in court people who are victims of injustice deserve to choose where they bring their claims the forum shouldn't be dictated to them and so prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts where giant corporations dictate the forum to potential victims of their practices makes perfectly good sense and basic fairness that's the principle here alternative dispute resolution in arbitration may be a good thing in all kinds of business disputes all kinds of disagreements garden variety disagreements between businesses or others but where there are contracts as there was in concepcion between a giant corporation and a consumer the consumer should have that right to a day in court and here at t promised that people would receive cell phones with no charge consumers then found they were charged 30 plus dollars characterized as a sales tax and the consumer said we think that violates the contract and a t said the only way you can bring your dispute is in arbitration and individually not as a class not in court which in effect stacked the deck powerfully in at's favor it barred the courthouse door which is a denial of basic justice and fairness and so the measure that we're supporting restores that fairness and balance to institutions that are supposed to deal with these disputes and guarantees that people will have a level playing field corporations that take advantage of people should be held accountable in 11 playing field in a courtroom where the victims of injustice choose to bring their claims in that form

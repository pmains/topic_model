let's welcome to the show congresswoman Kat cannick from house law enforcement caucus and Joe gamaldi from the Fraternal Order of Police so first you Congressman Lori Lightfoot is now out she now claims racism sexism so does the New York Times op-ed writer Charles blow exit polls indicate the majority of African-Americans and minorities said no to her more than 8 out of 10 Chicago voters voted to ouster get rid of her as mayor so what do you make of this racism and sexism argument well when you've got no facts left in the bank that's what you do is you pull the race card and it's clear that she doesn't care about the fact that over 2200 people in Chicago have been murdered under her watch and she's busy dancing in the streets so of course any sane individual would oust that person because that's not a leader that is a political figurehead who will do anything and say anything for votes people are sick and tired of the nonsense from her office from her press conferences where she's saying Karen sit down shut up and when she doesn't like things that go hurt they don't go her way she claims racism or sexism people are over it they want results and they want to turn Chicago around to what the kind of sort of saying Joe Americans are fed up with violent crime this has not happened to a city mayor in 40 years in Chicago her approval ratings plunge as homicides in Chicago they hit their highest number 25 years it's the most of all U.S cities last year nearly 700 there was a murder just an hour and a half into the new year here Joe yeah let's be clear Lori Lightfoot loves because she absolutely sucked at her job there's no other reason I mean voters were telling you what mattered to them in the polling it said 50 believe that Public Safety was the number one issue 63 said they didn't even feel safe in their own City so it's not shocking that she got absolutely trounced because she was the poster child for the revolving door criminal justice system in supporting those policies while I might add the west side of Chicago was experiencing a murder rate that Rivals the most violent city in the world Tijuana Mexico so let this be a lesson to all politicians that support this crap we are not going to stand for this anymore and they're going to vote you out your job's on the line now so maybe you'll actually listen to us and the message is clear we want Safe Streets for everyone so to what the con Joe just said congresswoman you know Chicago has the second most fortunate Fortune 500 companies but congresswoman that number is shrinking three have left as crime went up taxes went up following Citadel and caterpillar reports that crime is up to like double digits since you took office Illinois has much higher crime than its neighbor Indiana so how can how can she in the New York Times say racism here because that's all they have is these wild ridiculous headlines it's like the New York Times uh posing the question of whether someone should call the cops on someone breaking into their car for fear they'd be called a racist this is insane as Joe pointed out so beautifully people are scared to leave their homes no parent in their right mind wants to send their kids to school in essentially what is a war zone I wouldn't want my kids walking down the street when drive-bys are happening on the regular nobody does and for these companies that are Fortune 500 companies they have their employees and their employees families to think about so it's no surprise that in in the midst of rising crime and all the regulatory issues that they're continuing to burden these companies with that people and companies are fleeing these these places like Chicago yeah totally mismanaged so Joe the what the congresswoman just said the former Chicago Public School CEO Paul vallas he's got a tough on crime conservative platform he finished number one he wants to add more police officers to patrol Chicago and Joe what's really interesting all this comes right after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis went to that suburb outside Chicago to slam far left week on crime policies watch this as you see massive increases in crime in places like Los Angeles Seattle Chicago San Francisco Philadelphia Florida has a 50-year low and our crime rate so how could that possibly be if it's going up in these other areas how could it be lower for us as a relative matter and it's not rocket science it's a difference in priorities it's a difference in leadership and it's enacting good policies that are actually designed to protect the public safety and we've done that so Joe Lori life put out San Francisco recalls far left D.A Chester Boudin the court fight is on to get rid of far left Circuit County Attorney Kim Gardner for not Prosecuting crimes in St Louis she's backed by George Soros does it seem that Democrats have now are at the breaking point on crime Joe well I think it's been made very clear to everyone that the community is sick and tired of the revolving door criminal justice system this failed social experiment that has ruined our urban communities and you see Governor DeSantis and representative kamik standing out and being strong leaders on this issue of Law and Order because that is what the public wants as Governor DeSantis says this is not rocket science we need to hold criminals accountable for their actions and we can actually make an impact on crime and another idea is maybe we just you know support police officers because we're out there doing our jobs every single day and the rest of the criminal justice system is letting us down by letting these dirtbags out over and over again to Joe's Point Let's watch voters and DA's now in Portland Oregon they're now upset about weak on crime policies watch this from Fox digital Portland is a hollowed-out shell of what it used to be businesses are fleeing and people are leaving for greener pastures voters need to wake up and vote differently if you make over 250 000 you're one of the most heavily taxed people in the country for what I mean I think people are looking around and wondering what services they're getting in return when they see lawlessness crime and Decay Public Safety is failing in Multnomah County and that's not a shocking statement it's a complete disaster what we know is that businesses are leaving Portland people are leaving Portland and visitors aren't coming to Portland congresswoman what can Congress do about this new data coming in just about only half half of U.S U.S homicides are solved that was that's down from 90 percent in the 60s this is directly related to what's going on in U.S cities the majority of U.S crimes happen in U.S cities right so what can Congress do about this well first and foremost we're seeing a mass Exodus out of the profession of law enforcement because you have people in these blue cities and states that say they back the blue but then they turn around and do the complete opposite and it's very demoralizing for our men and women in uniform to lock these criminals up and then they turn around the next day they're back out on the street so you have people retiring you have people not choosing to recruit and go into the profession we have got to actually support them we need to put our money where our mouth is give them the resources they need and have their backs for real Congress and Joe gamaldi thanks for joining us

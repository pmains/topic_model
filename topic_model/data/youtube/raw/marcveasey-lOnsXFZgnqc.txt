today we are here to shine a light on yet another one of the harmful and irresponsible policies designed by the Trump administration these block grants are just the latest in a slew of attempts by his administration to gut the Affordable Care Act and the numerous coverage expansions that has been offered to millions of Americans of all ages and all backgrounds who were unable to gain coverage before yet another broken promise from this president and April 8th 2015 then candidate Trump tweeted I was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security Medicare and Medicaid unquote he even said that these programs were part of what makes America great well mr. president you were right Medicaid is a pillar of our society for administration that seeks to make America great our President far too frequently doubts the capabilities and grit of our fellow neighbors but as this administration stands proudly behind this illegal policy I have no doubt that it will be rejected by this chamber in our courts and rejected by the American people yet again

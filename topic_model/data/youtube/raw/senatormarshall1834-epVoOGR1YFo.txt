uh senator marshall well thank you chairman and my first question is going to be from mr atkins and it has to do with a pax benef a tax benefit that i believe both the oil and gas industry and the coal industry benefit from called the percentage depletion allowance one of the prerequisites here is that coal is a very cheap product and there's so many opportunities for it and it's my understanding in the infrastructure bill that's coming before us that we're considering that we would lose this percentage depletion allowance when i think about tax benefits that the different energies receive um i i think about the oil and gas industry coal industry if it was 1x you know probably the wind energy receives um seven times that and solar maybe 70 times that from from a benefit from the federal government and i always preface this by saying look i want to leave this environment cleaner healthier and safer than i found it as do all of us in the room but i can't drive the cost of energy up so much that uh that a working family can no longer to put gas in their car or to uh pay their electricity bill is that is it am i making some reasonable assumptions there when you think about tax benefits to the different industries that really coal this may be the last thing standing that coal gets yeah i think you know all industries like to play on an even playing field and i'm afraid you know as we've gone on over time that playing field keeps changing uh obviously today the the thumb on the scale is obviously weighted toward renewables it's it's being taken off of uh any of the fossil fuels um and i and i think the way we've tried to approach it obviously we are in favor of all incentives that can be given for any form of production in this country i don't care whether it's wind solar coal fossil fuel they all create jobs they're all critical to our national strategic interests and they should all be fostered what we've tried to do is to sort of take away from the equation uh you know the notion that somehow carbon is bad carbon is not bad there are issues obviously when you combine a carbon with an oxygen molecule and you have co2 and we understand that so we're trying to basically move beyond that thesis and really step outside into something modestly transformational where we say all right let's look at the carbon inside of something that is today in disfavor frankly and see if we can turn i hate to use this phrase sort of a diamond in the rough so you know coal is a diamond is basically coal that's done well under pressure so uh essentially that's what we're trying to do yeah coal gives us a pretty big bang for the buck when it comes to energy there's no doubt about that as well

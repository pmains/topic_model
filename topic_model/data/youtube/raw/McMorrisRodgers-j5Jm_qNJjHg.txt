this is one by that utilizes a bill from my colleague mrs mcnorris rogers 3917 most of the language of that bill is in this amendment it's known as the malden act which stands for making aid for local disasters equal now so the bill would create a 30-day deadline for the approval of disaster declaration requests if no response is received then a major disaster would be declared fema would also be required to work with local officials and emergency managers to better prepare for disasters and recovery in the long term in the event of disaster declarations denied female would be required to ensure states are still properly assigning disaster case workers to be available for rural communities the 30-day deadline will not impact the vast majority of disasters according to the congressional research service most disaster declaration requests about wildfires receive responses within 21 days and even faster it's been a very good record for all other types of disasters the average is 13 days but in some cases where approval drags on longer the bill will be a life saving it will give state and local officials assurance that they will receive a response in a timely fashion we've known other cases where it's in some in some it's taken even years to get a declaration they've had it hanging out there and so we think with people people's lives on the line people's uh livelihoods and getting their lives back order in order it would be kind of nice in order to have a declaration that could be pending actually decided because in most cases that data should be well enough available to make a determination so i urge my colleagues on both sides to allow us to address the gaps in these disaster programs that affect all rural america especially even if they don't necessarily apply to cities and heavily populated areas which do generally are able to get a faster assessment with bigger numbers to begin with the dixie fire in my own district is that right at 960 000 acres which is 1500 square miles on the 24th when the federal government approved the disaster deck for declaration of the fire it was already at 735 or about three-fourths of that number the response would be nice if it was more agile more attentive and and what and listen more to what the locals are having input on and i think we get to better conclusions that would not actually be more costly but just more effective and better better serving of all all constituents in that are at this time of great need so i'm proud to help carry this amendment and i think it's certainly worthy of the consideration of the committee and just just look at it in the context not of trying to undermine the rest of the bill or this or that but really who we're serving here on those that are in dire need and getting a quick response of of an ask for a disaster declaration it should be pretty easy in most cases to make that assessment and see if it reaches the numbers and give them a thumbs up or thumbs down that's what people are asking for so i appreciate the time mr chairman and the attention of the committee and i'll yield back

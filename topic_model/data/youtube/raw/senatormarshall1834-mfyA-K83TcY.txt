that investigation and real accountability for fauci came a step closer this week as a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation to create a 911 style commission into the origin and handling of the pandemic earlier we spoke to republican senator roger marshall of kansas who's spearheading the effort take a look senator great to see you we've been calling uh for exactly this for months on this show i was so encouraged to see the announcement that this was actually moving forward i'd love to know how you got to this point how did this get going um and if you could also look ahead and tell us where you think this will go in terms of actually happening and getting to the bottom of the origins of the pandemic yeah well steve good evening to you and thanks for having me on we appreciate you following the story you've been inspiring uh me to keep working hard as well but we thought that to have success at any type of a commission or hearing we needed bipartisan support this commission needs to be a 9-1-1 style commission that's really apolitical so we needed partners across the aisle and senator feinstein and senator gillibrand have joined us now uh in this search as well and of course senator joni ernst on our side of the aisle has been a great leader in this as well to figure out the origins of covenant and del then to look out to the response of the united states as well and you know where it goes next is we hope we we can get this as an amendment on the ndaa the national defense authorization act here uh in in three or four weeks and hopefully it'll pass the senate and the house will agree to do it as well that's really interesting so if it's part of that big bill that's the most that's described as must-pass legislation isn't it um that means this could really happen uh this year yes sir you're right uh the ndaa has been passed i believe over 60 years in a row it's what authorizes the funding for our military it is a must-pass piece of legislation so we plan on offering this as an amendment to that bill and it does have a path forward and i'd like to think that we'll get leadership on the house side to support it as well and surely our president will sign off on it as well is everyone here involved in this ready to really get to the bottom of of the role of the nih the niaid dr fauci and so on we've been talking about that and focusing on that and when do you think if all goes as planned in terms of the votes at the end of this year president signing this legislation when can we expect to have actual hearings and witnesses and documents in the public eye all that to happen when do you think that will be right i think it will be a matter of months and not weeks we have to come up with ten names to appoint to the commission the republicans will appoint five and the democrats will appoint five we're hopefully that they'll all be apolitical people that they'll be experts in their specific areas and can take these deep deep dives uh there's a lot of information out there that needs to be declassified and they'll have the power to subpoena and that's so important we need to get peter dasic and people from eco health in front of a grand jury style investigation here and and figure out exactly what they knew we need to start looking at all their dna sequences and i think that we'll find the grandfather of copa19 somewhere buried in ecohealth's lab system well honestly i can't this is really the most encouraging news um pretty much all year on this whole question of getting to the truth about the origins so i'm really really excited to hear the news thank you for your role in making it happen and pushing it forward and thank you for being with us tonight you bet steve thanks for having us keep covering the story you're doing a great job we will

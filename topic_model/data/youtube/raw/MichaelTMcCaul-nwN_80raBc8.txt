our investigation into compassionate use reform took us to Washington DC last fall where Texas congressman Michael McCall is working on a new piece of legislation that would reform the compassionate use system in part by allowing patients to buy experimental drugs not yet approved by the FDA that bill is still waiting in committee but today McCall issued this statement in response to andrea's recognition he said Andrea Sloan was a fighter her entire life because of her efforts to obtain cancer treatments through compassionate use this critical issue is now at the forefront of the public's attention her gallant efforts single-handedly advanced the cause of making potentially life-saving treatments available for future patients he said I commend the governor's commission for women for honoring andrea's important story it is now up to those of us in the policy arena to carry her torch forward

um thank you for being here i want to hear today about innovation um as you know this is our second day of hearings with the ceos of big pharma companies and we've heard so much important information about the very real costs of research and development r d mr bradway what was amgen's total revenue in 2017 oh gosh uh approximately 22 billion dollars okay so it was 23.7 billion um how about 2018 uh i don't have that to hand but again it would be 24. that's okay i have it handy 22.8 billion 2019 23.4 billion this totals up because i know it's hard to do math on the fly to 69.9 billion dollars um thank you mr broadway over those three years that we're talking about 2017 to 2018 how much of its own revenue did amgen invest in that really important research and development work uh approximately 10 billion dollars okay um so r d taking you at your word here was about 10 billion great that's that's a big number um investing in r d dwarfs some of your other expenses is that right it's one of your largest expenses that's correct um how much did um amgen spend on lobbying over that same three-year period oh i i don't have the exact number but it's approximately 10 million dollars a year that's correct 32.5 22 million dollars on lobbying how much on um how much should amgens pay for the salaries of the top five the top five executives over this two-year period oh goodness uh for the it's about i would guess um six and a half million per year so 13 million dollars would be my guess 13 million would you like to revise take a look right here sir you sorry you asked salary i gave you an answer to the question about salaries oh i'm sorry let me rephrase how much did amgen spend on compensation for the top five executives i think that's the number you've written on the board thank you could you say that number please for the committee yes 100 you've i'll assume that your number's correct it's 124 million okay wonderful um and then my final question is how much did amgen spend on stock buybacks in that same two period same two year period sorry two year or three year period right here three year period sorry three year period i i don't know the number of time i had but that includes the period where tax reform was implemented so i would guess it's on the order of 30 billion dollars right around this number can you say it for the committee i'm not a witness sir so i can't testify as to your as to your profits i need you to state the number the number that you have written is 28.6 billion dollars thank you um amgen so this you spent double more than double almost triple on stock buybacks over the three years as you did on r d is my math correct 10 billion is roughly one-third of 28.6 billion yes but what you haven't included there is the capital that we allocated to acquire the search and development externally which would be about 19 in that period okay um you make an anti-inflammatory drug called embryo which is used to treat conditions like arthritis mr bradway did amgen do the research that led to the creation of embroil um no not the original discovery first of all we've done billions of dollars of work it's just a yes or no did you do the research that led to the creation of emerald um congressman i stand by my answer um the emerald that you use the patients used today did we do the research and development work associated with it absolutely quite a bit of it did you yourself run or oversee the trials of the drug did any executive and amgen help invent this breakthrough drug uh no i i did not i was not involved in breakthrough development of the drug or the discovery of the drug in fact emerald was invented at an academic medical center and its discovery was funded largely by taxpayers amgen later acquired the biotech company who manufactured emerald amgen did not directly pay for the discovery of emerald correct no that's incorrect your statement is wrong edible was discovered by scientists at a biotechnology company called genentech okay what i'd like to do now mr broadway is i'd like for you to please explain to the american public why you and four other executives deserve to pay yourselves tens of million dollars each year i've got an empty white board ready to take down your justifications right but recognize that that's a considerable sum of money i would of course uh point out that i don't have any direct input to my compensation that's uh derived by the board and it's forward to a vote of the shareholders um we've overwhelmingly supported the compensation package for me and the other name executive order claiming my time sir um do you not know why you're getting hundreds of millions of dollars tens of millions of dollars a year what is the justification i'd like to show the american people yeah our our compensation is consistent with uh competitive positions mr broadway we're claiming my time the other guy gets paid too much too isn't a justification i'd like to hear what you do to deserve 124 million dollars in salary you and your top five executives over three year period well uh more than 90 gentlelady's time has expired the gentleman may respond to her question more than 90 of my compensation is based on performance measures that include how our shares perform relative to the market uh and our compensation program is aligned with that of our owners our share owners uh and so a large part of my compensation reflects the fact that we've been creating value for our share owners by advancing innovative medicines like those that we uh uh call the marketplace today i wish you would focus on creating value for sick patients mr bradway not just your shareholders i yield back

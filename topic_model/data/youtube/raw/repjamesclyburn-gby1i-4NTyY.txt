thank you very much mr speaker and i thank the gentleman the chairman for healing me these five minutes mr speaker i um listen to my colleague on the other side i uh still think about the night of june 17th 2015 when about nine o'clock in the evening i received a phone call informing me that something had happened at mother emanuel amy church in charleston south carolina a church that i know very well the members i know or very well much to my dismay i learned later in the evening that a bible study that was taking place at that church had welcomed in a stranger i grew up in the past nights and i grew up learning that would be fine there in the book of hebrew the 11th chapter faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things unseen these people were practicing their faith a faith that taught them to welcome in a stranger a stranger came to their door and they welcomed into their bible study they sat down he sat with them for an hour and then the further practice of their faith as they completed their bible study they rose to pray and with bowed heads only to open their eyes to the sound of gunfire the stranger they had welcomed in opened fire and killed nine of them one of whom was the pastor and former intern of mine now we later found out that the gentleman who perpetrated this crime was a white supremacist that studied the history of that church and because it was the most historic african-american church in south carolina he target that church and his worshipers however he should not have had the gun and the reason he had the gun is because when he went to purchase it when the three days expired as current law allows they had not been able to verify the information he had given them and therefore could not complete the background check but under the law they had to sell him the gun after the three days only to find out several days later that the wrong information have been put into the record now i ask and i sincerely believe that this gentleman's sophistication he knew he was not to have the gun did he give the wrong information intentionally i think so and when they found the era it was too late nine souls had terrorists now the gentleman said that he is lucky that the gun didn't go off and these laws would not have prevented that this law would have prevented that gentleman from getting a gun now i don't know why the other side continues to misrepresent what we're trying to do here all we're saying is if at the end of the three days you ought to move to 10 days and if the 10 days expire you can ask for an expedited search and if that expires you still have 10 days the maximum is 30 days nobody is keeping a gun away it's everybody to be able to wait 30 days gentleman's time is expired the gentleman has yielded 30 additional seconds ask the other side is the weight of 30 days worth the death of nine unsuspecting souls that alone ought to instruct them on legislation like this one all you bet gentlemen

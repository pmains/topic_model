well I think this is going to be the granddaddy of debt creation if this bill passed and we don't have the details we have some of their suggestions we wouldn't have the details on how they're going to pay for this in my opinion it's going to be just like the 2001 and 2003 and frankly the 1981 tax packages created great debt and did not advantage the middle class but didn't advantage the upper tiers of our society the way President Trump says it should be able to work in a bipartisan fashion in fact the last great tax reform significant tax reform was in 1986 some 30 years ago when Republicans and Democrats worked together when O'Neal and speaker speaker O'Neill and President Reagan worked together when Rostenkowski a Democrat and packwood a Republican worked together that's the way we ought to do it we're not going to get tax reform without that unfortunately I think we're about to see a budget on the floor next week which will go the same route they went with the Affordable Care Act on a partisan basis trying to get jam it through the Senate with 51 votes obviously in the house you can jam it through but you're not going to get Democrats to support a bill that is not fair to the middle class is not paid for and does not reflect a bipartisan agreement on what want to be benefited and and who ought to be paying but this mean that you'll explicitly ask House Democrats to vote against it well what you say vote against it there is no it yet there's some broad outline but there's no bill there are no specifics there's been no no hearings on a bill and no markup so it would be premature for me to say we're gonna ask members to vote against it because there is no it but certainly we're gonna send the message and Ritchie Neal of Massachusetts who's our ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee has made it very clear that a it's got to advantage the middle class be it's got to not balloon the deficit and be balanced and paid for and see it's got to be a bipartisan product you keep saying that it has to be a bipartisan product so I are you saying that Democrats should participate in the process if so who on the other side will you be approaching well-written when you say will be we've already approached a ranking member a Richard Neal of Massachusetts ranking member of Ways and Means Committee has made it very clear to chairman Brady that he is prepared to work together in fact he was down at the White House with other leaders from the Senate in the house who deal with tax policy and that I think is what president Trump said there's no reason why we can't work in a bipartisan fashion there may be no reason but it hasn't been done it hasn't been pursued we were not invited to the meetings we were not invited to the rollout and in fact we have not agreed to any of these provisions but Democrats are willing to do so just as we said we were willing to work on reforms to the affordable care act but they pursued every time a partisan effort not a bipartisan effort that John McCain was right that is not constructive that's not what has resulted in the best for the American people working in the bipartisan fashion does do that congressman how effective do you think the government has been turning to another issue on Puerto Rico's relief efforts I know that you've been tweeting about them we have a humanitarian disaster in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands these are Americans who are on islands it's easier on the mainland of Texas it's easier on the mainland of the Florida or and it was even easier in the mainland in Louisiana tough but general Honore was just on another program with me saying that we've been too late with too little I think he's right but we need to deploy all of the resources necessary I don't know what those are but and we had general Buchanan general Kim have been asked to coordinate these efforts in the islands they need to have all the resources necessary to get the job done and to save lives we're losing lives in put in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as we speak so that I am asking and demain that we deploy any and all resources that the experts people on the ground the Puerto Rican and vio Virgin Island officials as well as our own military leadership they have the resources the Corps of Engineers listed number of troops they ought to be deployed we have a 1/10 of the numbers that we've deployed subsequent to Katrina in Louisiana we need to get the abraham lincoln aircraft carrier which was deployed to florida redeployed down to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to have that air power and capability of having a base ie the aircraft carry on which to deploy into the interior of the country to save lives right and it's no wonder that you believe that this has been actually put behind given all of the distractions that are happening right now in in domestic politics at least today though it was a good very bright day in terms that the House Majority Whip Steve Scalise just returned to the job for the first time very emotional of return how difficult do you believe his job will be at a time when Republicans seem so fragmented well I think the Republican leadership has a very difficult job and I think that's been shown not just this year but over the last six to seven years where they've been unable to pass major pieces of legislation because their party has been so deeply divided and when we have passed major pieces of legislation that we needed to pass it was done with the substantial Democratic help so when they came across the aisle we did in fact cooperate and we did reach consensus and we did reach solutions to some very tough issues which the Republicans couldn't do they're in charge of the Senate they're in charge of the house they have the presidency but they've been unable to govern effectively except in a bipartisan fashion and we were urged them to do so on this issue and any issue that comes down the pike including tax reform on the issue of Steve Scalise we were all very happy to see him return he was severely injured and as leader Pelosi said and leader McCarthy an attack on Steve Steve Scalise was now on Steve Scalise as a person that was on Steve Scalise the congressman the Republican leader that kind of attack is an attack on all of us it's an attack on democracy it's a resort to violence where we ought to resort to peaceful discussion and democratic processes to resolve our differences I would urge that anybody left or right that thinks about resorting to violence understand they are not helping their cause and they're undermining our democracy we were very pleased to see Steve Scalise come back still obviously rehabilitating himself in the very severe injuries they received but displaying a great deal of courage and grace for sure thank you so much congressman for joining us today Democratic congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland thank you very much time now to go to a Bloomberg exclusive we take it

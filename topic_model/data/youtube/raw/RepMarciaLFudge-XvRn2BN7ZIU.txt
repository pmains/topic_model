first I'd like to ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from the bakery and confectionery Union and industrial international pension fund which proposes a long-term low-interest loan solution as it has been discussed here thank you I just want to say two things it's interesting that people who have worked thirty years whether it be a pension or Social Security or Medicare we always have a problem with trying to find a way to find a solution for these people if we make them a promise we ought to keep it I think sometimes we forget as members that our real job here is to take care of the people we serve it's not to save money just to take care of the people who sent us here and so I would suggest very strongly that instead of spending five billion dollars on a wall we put it into the pension fund let's put it into PBGC I think it's important that we do that because it is more important to me to take care of the people who work for this country than it is to build an unnecessary wall matter I yield back

joining us now kansas senator roger marshall happy new year senator marshall uh thanks for coming on i am told get your take on this that uh chuck schumer wants to have a lot of votes in the early new year you want to vote on buildback better he wants to vote on filibuster i guess he wants to vote on anything aoc tells him to vote on what's your take on this schumer has threatened these votes before unsuccessfully yeah larry happy new year to you and all your listeners as well i think that the democrats are pretty desperate right now they had a very bad into the to the last year and they're trying to get beyond that they're trying to find some type of victory i'd love to congratulate you that we've killed buildback better we'll probably talk about that some more i think he's using the votes as threats uh and we'll see where we go but right now he doesn't have the votes on either one of them the filibuster issue think about this describe the word hypocrisy and that would be our democrat friends just four years ago they 28 democrats signed a letter that they were against ending the filibuster the biggest difference between then and now is republicans controlled all three branches of the government and now they control it so they want to get rid of the filibuster i think america is going to see the hypocrisy well i agree with you um cinema center cinema is probably even harder line on messing with the filibuster than senator manchin but i think center mansion is okay because ted cruz let a lot of the nominations go through i think that was the hang up there i don't think any does any do you hear any groundswell for this you know election reform democratic nationalizing federalizing elections i mean that's what the filibuster is all about isn't it exactly they think that they would have to get rid of the filibuster so they could pass uh some type of new election law on a 50-vote basis but listen that is a law that's a a solution in search of a problem it's unconstitutional to federalize the elections look republicans are for making it easier to vote and harder to cheat some of the states have modernized their election laws i think they've done a good job i think they've made it easier to vote and harder to cheat in those states no one yet has showed me a big problem with any of the state laws just uh we're always short of time especially new year's but last part here senator i'm the buildback better i mean why we got we got it done we got it stopped last year that was wonderful you're right it's still alive but honestly you think mansion's gonna give up you think cinema is gonna give up you think hassan and some of the other moderates who are hiding behind mansion are gonna i mean tell me your honest opinion where's this thing going to go and is there going to be a vote this month well there may be a vote but i doubt it i don't think it's going to go anywhere i still think joe manchin is going to represent the people of west virginia who did not send them here to build a radical socialized government right i think that he's from a more conservative state and i want to draw your attention to an op-ed in the washington post this past weekend that basically challenged joe manchin's integrity i've known joe manchin for five years he's always been a man of his word a man of integrity and if the progressives continue to push him they're going to push him right out of the democrat party and into the republican party who wrote that uh center you know yeah i do uh congresswoman jayapal who i have respect for but she's certainly leading that progressive no no i'm rooting for her because you are so right that kind of attitude will push him right into the gop and you're going to welcome him right you're going to welcome him with open arms he's like i said a man of integrity uh he's really is he's a conservative in so many ways uh the democrat party has left joe manchin you betcha thank you sir we appreciate it much more to come

I'm working with Marcia Blackburn of Tennessee and we introduced an AG Innovation Bill to once again acknowledge and help Wyoming AG producers who are innovating in the manner in which we produce agricultural products we're feeding the nation and we're trying to feed the world but when we have to encounter barriers with the federal government constantly the challenges that you face need to be addressed we're here to help with that and we hope that working with you we can solve the problems that you face making American agriculture stronger and better than it's ever been thanks

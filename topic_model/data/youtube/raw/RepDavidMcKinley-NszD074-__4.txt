mission mr. Chairman I here I have an amendment at the desk the clerk will designate the amendment it in house report number 112-88 canli of West Virginia pursuant to House Resolution 788 the gentleman from West Virginia mr. McKinley and a member opposed each will control five minutes the chair now recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia mr. chairman this amendment will prohibit the EPA from retro actively invalidating permits after they've been issued on January 13 2011 the EPA took an unprecedented action by retro actively revoking a lawfully issued section 404 permit for the Spruce number-one bind surface mine in Logan County West Virginia this it permit had been issued for years earlier after an extensive 10-year environmental review including 1,600 page environmental impact statement in which the EPA fully participated and agreed to all the terms and conditions included in the authorized permit but this amendment is intended to address far more than coal mines if the EPA can retroactively Lee revoke a water permit for this industry they could do the same to any other manufacturer refinery municipality farm or other government agency imagine an entrepreneur contemplating making it an investment requiring an EPA permit but then stopping once they learn that they could first the EPA could first grant the permit allow the business to proceed and then invalidating the permit crushing the investment we're imagine a lending institution contemplating whether or not to loan money to someone subject to an EPA regulation should any of us be critical of them for being reluctant once they to become aware that their loan could go into default once the EPA retro actively revokes the permit on which the loan was granted all of us in Congress should be concerned about the chilling effect these actions by the EPA have had and will have if they continue this threat to the creation of jobs by exceeding their statutory authority at a time when our country is facing economic uncertainty and our families are struggling to make ends meet I'm appalled by this continued assault on American businesses and families that the EPA is taken our job creators need a consistent and predictable regulatory program that will protect jobs we have create new ones so that we need an environmentally responsible manner remember this amendment is not just for coal mining but rather it addresses virtually every business in America which requires certainty in the regulatory environment I urge your support and I reserve the balance of my time thank you the gentleman from West Virginia reserves what purpose gentleman from New Jersey seek recognition Mr Speaker I would ask the time in opposition to mr. McKinley's amendment jenna is recognized for five minutes I yield myself such time john adams mr. speaker this amendment would take away the EPA's authority under the Clean Water Act to retro actively deny permits to fill streams and wetlands in order to protect drinking water supplies recreational waters and fish and wildlife habitat now EPA has used this authority to veto permits after they were issued responsibly only three times in ten years I should say three times in 40 years all of these were extremely rare cases and these vetoes were necessary to protect critical water resources in 1981 EPA revoked a permit for a solid waste landfill because it was leaking toxics into Biscayne Bay in 1989 after objecting to a permit before it was issued it overturned a permit to destroy 1,200 acres of floodplain wetlands in Georgia and in 2010 which mr. McKinley mentions EPA denied a permit for one of the largest mountain top removal mine in Appalachia that would have buried more than six miles of West Virginia streams and polluted downstream waters with mining waste causing permanent damage to ecosystems and streams the Vita was not a surprise and I stressed that EPA consistently expressed his concerns about water quality impacts of this mine beginning from 2002 through 2006 when the Corps issued the permit now let me stress that this was an extremely rare action taken by EPA and the first time it was used it used the Clean Water Act to overturn an approved mining permit but surface mining in the steep slopes of Appalachia has disrupted the biological integrity of an area about the size of Delaware buried approximately 2,000 miles of streams

Thank You mr. Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all members be given five days to revise and extend their remarks objection also mr. speaker I'd like to enter into the record a statement on tonight CBC special order from the Honorable Eddie Bernice Johnson some Texas without objection Thank You mr. speaker I want to begin by whelping welcoming our new members by thanking congresswoman Marcia fudge for her leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus through in the 113th Congress thanks to your dedication tireless work this caucus is better positioned to address two diverse challenges of African Americans communities thank you very much I also want to thank the new CBC chair the Honorable congressman gk butterfield of North Carolina I'm confident you will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an America that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the Honorable congresswoman Robin Kelly for joining me in leading the CBC special orders this year I am truly honored to take this take on this new role and I look forward to working with you as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus mr. speaker 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in Selma Alabama to begin a long arduous March to Montgomery in support of fundamental truth that every American regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on March seventh nineteen sixty five six hundred men and women set out from Selma following the death of 26 year old Jimmie Lee Jackson a deacon from Marion Alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a non-violent demonstration dares was a peaceful nonviolent March but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive in Montgomery but on March 25th after a 12-day journey they did arrive since that since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 summer became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only two percent of the city's eligible african-american voters have been able to register the impact of selma to montgomery march was profound as dr. King said Selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the Voting Rights Act of 1965 band discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchise african-american voters throughout this country and yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african-americans can only dream of where we are nearly six years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african-americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this percents the economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains of african-american communities are made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african-american communities where we were where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like Head Start and Pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of African Americans to get ahead that is why I strongly support President Obama's new bold initiative for free access to community colleges so to do efforts to dismantle social safety nets programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as Americans the Congressional Black Caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for African American children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the CBC also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in American corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation we're empowered the communities of African Americans and they will benefit from the full equality and live the American dream there is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this nation and justices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights but we will find no answers in apathy no comfort in complacency as we have as we always have we will continue the march for progress for freedom and for justice and equality for all and mr. speaker it is my honor and privilege now that I yield to the distinguished gentlelady from Illinois miss Robin Kelly

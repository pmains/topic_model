the war in ukraine is hitting close to home as president biden recently warned u.s businesses to ready themselves for a russian cyber attack for more on this let's welcome senator mike rounds of south dakota he and more than 20 other senators sent a letter on sunday evening to the u.s homeland security secretary raising concerns about u.s readiness against cyber threats amid the russian invasion of ukraine and uh senator thanks for joining us prior to the invasion that the body administration um was very transparent or or forthcoming about intelligence that it was receiving more so than maybe we've ever seen in the past and as we now know everything that they were sharing with us came to pass so if they tell us that they're preparing cyber attacks they must have some pretty good evidence you probably know more than we do about it what can you tell us russia uses third party players sometimes uh what they'll do is they'll make a deal with a third party criminals that otherwise would be doing ransomware attacks and so forth and in this particular case the areas that they'll probably take a look at energy uh communications financial services uh they like the idea of being able to send a message to the american people uh what we're also finding out though is that our energy sector and uh our communication sector our financial sectors are probably the ones that have uh the most time to prepare and have done the best job of hardening their systems but nonetheless the the russians are frustrated uh they understand that you know they're not doing well in ukraine and they're frustrated by the fact that we are getting a lot of weapons systems into ukraine they would love to send a message to the american people that this is going to impact us as well we have to be prepared for that senator this is one uh aspect of what we're seeing um people are starting to point out that it's it's a difficult position to take if if you're petrified of a nuclear war and yet you're still probably uh your security is better your intelligence is better your surveillance your reconnaissance even your nuclear arsenal is probably better just knowing that russia is armed should we take that as a reason to completely not stay out of it but but to not perhaps do as many things as as we would be doing if we were just trying to uh to help ukraine win i mean we're not we're not all in i don't know whether we should be uh and if you do you know no one wants a a nuclear confrontation but does that put us in a box that we shouldn't be in i think there's two things that we've got to remember first of all we are dealing with the nuclear power and and you can't you know you you can't walk away from that fact and and that limits what we would normally do but second of all we want to make sure that our nato allies are with us and we are a lot stronger when we have nato uh joining with us and that they know that we're going to be with them and that this is in their backyard so anything that we do we want to make sure that we keep that coalition together that's really important but you are correct we can't be just always on the defensive and we've got to make sure that mr putin understands that his actions will be met and that and that we're not going to simply walk away and that what he has done is is is absolutely wrong in the eyes of the rest of the world and uh you know there's a certain amount of humanity here that steps into this the american people don't like what they're seeing but they also don't want to see us commit uh young men and women from our country into this fight but we don't have a nato agreement with ukraine but we have that sense of humanity that says that what's going on here is wrong we want to do everything we can to help and it puts us in in a rather interesting position because we know that what putin is doing is absolutely wrong how do we contend with it what's the best long-term plan to make sure that he does not succeed that means number one keeping our nato allies together uh putting every single sanction that we possibly can on him making sure the russian people know that this is his fault and nobody else's and that we're not gonna walk away from ukraine the other piece of this is is ukraine is actually making it really very very difficult for putin to get any inroads there and we're going to continue to supply those weapons systems to them and give them as much support as we possibly can senator north dakota obviously a bigger energy player in the united states and south dakota but is it is there what's impeded uh energy production people have pointed out we were energy dependent there's fewer rigs operating uh now than three four years ago what happened why what what do we need to do there and what would a marshall plan i don't know if you saw us talking about jamie dimon suggesting a marshall plan to help europe with their energy needs because they're you know over a barrel and that obviously has gives putin a lot of leverage what needs to be done just tell the oil companies to get on the stick or or can the government remove obstacles we should be removing obstacles and we do need stability in our energy policy are there obstacles yes there are let me let me give you an example you know you hear this thing about 9 000 leases available right now on federal lands but they don't tell you the rest of the story is that you can't you have to do more than just have a lease you've actually got permission to do the drilling which means that you've got to have that second permit only about 4 500 to the 9 000 according to the information we've got have actually been authorized but even then once you get that lease and you get the permission to do so you still got to put in the pipelines to get the natural gas out of the petroleum up and those have been extremely difficult to come by since the biden administration came in look we should be doing and all of the above when it comes to energy policy we should be doing conservation measures but we should not be slowing down the production of natural gas or of oil of petroleum products we should be independently wealthy when it comes to to oil products and natural gas and we should be sharing that with our european allies we should make it easy for them not to have to do business with russia but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't continue to do all sorts of energy and yeah the bottom line is is we're going to be using petroleum products for more than another decade the last time i checked i didn't have a magic carpet so i'm going to have to use something that uses petroleum or i'm going to have to produce electricity using some other product and until we're ready to engage fully in nuclear and until we're ready to really engage in in long-term solar projects that in some cases may very well mean satellites that actually distribute solar energy back to us this is not gonna we're never gonna get away in the next decade we should face that senator i i don't disagree with you at all and i think especially in the immediate term we need to deal with this the question is if you were to put together a marshall project or something like it what do the incentives need to look like is it simply a matter of changing the permitting for drilling is that enough given the pricing pressures that these companies and even just the business models that that the majors have taken on most businesses want stability look at the dakota the xl pipeline is a good example who in the world in in canada is gonna is gonna start drilling and making arrangements to bring uh natural gas or petroleum products into the united states if every four years you have a change in the product and your pipeline gets shut down simply isn't going to happen you've got to have a long-term plan that provides stability and that recognizes the need for all sorts of energy production you can make it as clean as you possibly can you can't you don't walk away from the environmental concerns but you don't ignore and you don't shut down your own economy like in south dakota right now gas is over a dollar a gallon more this year than what it was last year that's going to hurt our economy that's going to slow it down it means that we don't have the resources then in order to address other issues that we want to address it means that our economy is not as strong as it would have been otherwise and so when you talk about a marshall plan or anything like that part of it is stability part of it is is recognizing that you can't just say all right we're going to go totally renewables but let's face the fact nuclear should be a part of our future we should be doing the modular systems right now but don't walk away from a proven energy asset that we've got in the united states and in our our friends to the north and canada in terms of huge reserves that should be accessible we should simply do it as clean as anybody else in the entire world right it's difficult too because it doesn't matter administrations come and go but this pressure is going to remain uh in in people point out it's almost like you know i don't want to bring up iran but if you're a foreign country trying to deal with the united states and uh you know you got one administration yeah let's do it another administration comes in now we're canceling yeah another one comes in yeah we're doing it so there's no long term and you need long-term visibility if you're an oil executive and you just don't have it right now and i don't see how you know you're not going to be able to fix this we're not going to be able to fix this near term we need to get back to stability making arrangements that respect what what a lot of people are talking about right now you have to have energy there there's no question about that energy as clean as anybody in the world can right right but these other natures aren't they're not we're going to have to deal with them right all right senator mike uh so how much energy comes out of south dakota versus agriculture well agriculture can produce energy ethanol is an item that you can put into absolutely i mean we're talking about billions of gallons about north dakota coming out right now they do they do make a little bit they produce a little bit more but we love both dakotas we do we love both north and south they're good competition for us i speak for all of us thanks senator get back to work thanks for you thanks

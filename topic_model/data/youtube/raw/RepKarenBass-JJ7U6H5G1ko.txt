so a few of the things that were accomplished this year uh one was the child tax credit and that provided tax cuts for more than 70 000 families in just our district alone 400 million dollars for housing and services for people experiencing homelessness once in a generation investment in the in the infrastructure now do you remember how many times trump declared infrastructure week it was like at least once every other month but never accomplished one thing so this was a historic piece of legislation uh the infrastructure package and i'm proud to say that within that infrastructure package my legislation that allows federal funds to be used and prioritized for people that live in the area so we see these big infrastructure packages uh being passed and projects being uh developed in our areas but the people that live in the very neighborhoods where unemployment is high cannot be prioritized in terms of hiring and so we were able to pass legislation so that you can prioritize people that live in the neighborhoods we pass for the second time the george floyd justice and policing act out of the house and you know i was in charge of that and so unfortunately we weren't able to get it passed out of the senate but it was an accomplishment from uh from the house we also passed immigration reform out of the house we looked at a lot of ways to address some of the root causes of our problems like homelessness for example by passing child welfare reform laws you know two categories of people who are unhoused are former foster youth who have aged out of the system and all that means is that we cut them off from benefits when they turn 18 or 21 and people who are formally incarcerated two areas where i have worked on passing legislation for um a long time and so i am very happy that we were able to get uh those things done but let me just also because i'm looking in the queue and there's a number of people that are asking questions about the unhoused uh in our area and i will tell you that from my point of view having 40 000 people who are unhoused on the streets living in tents in the second largest city in the country i think that is an absolute crisis it is a public health a public safety and a humanitarian crisis that needs to be addressed immediately and frankly i'm really worried about this because soon the benefits the safety net that was provided by um the rescue the legislation that we've passed not bbb that didn't pass but the other pieces of legislation are going to run out soon and we have tens of thousands of people in los angeles who are on the verge of homelessness at any moment and when those supports go away i'm worried that there might be even more people that are unhoused and i think at some point we have to stop dealing with this problem in a tepid way and we need to deal with this problem as though we have had a major natural disaster like an earthquake when you have an earthquake you don't sit around and take your time dealing with things you understand the urgency and you remove all barriers and just get it done and so within the bills that uh were passed uh we had 115 million dollars for project home key project home key is the uh interim and permanent support supportive housing for individuals experiencing homelessness and project room key allowed the city to rent out entire hotels and my concern of course is what happens when all of that goes away we also provided support to landlords because we know that most of the people who own property most of the renters live in buildings that are owned by mom and pop um owners my father for example was an example of that my father bought a triplex uh on crescent heights and he bought that to move his to make sure that his mother had a safe place to live and so that triplex it was three units his mother lived in one and he rented out two well you know my father uh unfortunately is is gone but if he were here now and living in in covet and his tenants can't pay the rent anymore we have to make sure the tenants aren't put out on the street but we also have to make sure that he could pay his mortgage so we needed to have uh resources for uh landlords and that was directed at mom and pop landlords not corporate landlords and so we were able to get a number of things done the other area that you know i work on child welfare we worked with a number of foster youth who told us that they were being left behind because of covid and they needed to have a specific support and so we were able to put resources for former foster youth in the rescue bills so why don't we go to uh questions you know uh daryl from mar vista's asking a question he wants to know what are the odds that the senate acts next year on important issues like voting rights you know i can't tell you today what the secret is that the president needs to have but we have got to force a vote on this issue personally i think we absolutely need to get rid of the filibuster but even if we got rid of the filibuster today and you have joe manchin and christian cinema saying they still won't vote for it it doesn't help us but we absolutely need to figure out how we can force folks to not restrict our democracy you know i i work on foreign policy and um when when other countries do this when other countries uh restrict voting we sanction them we cut foreign aid and here it is we're doing the same thing i'm also upset with this parliamentarian because it's like you know the minority party hires the parliamentarian but yet between her and joe manchin it's the two of them that keep uh that keep blocking things uh greg from mar vista has a question if he could ask answers ask his question absolutely let's get greg up live greg you're live please go ahead yes my question is in relation to small businesses mom and pops like myself it seems to me that we are not really in any discussion the ppp were loans that were given out to companies corporations nonprofits that were forgiven yet we were only allowed to have access to loans that we have to pay back so my question is is there any thoughts being given to how to help the small the really small business person you know you know what greg it hurts my heart to hear your question because you know when we were passing these bills the only businesses we really had in mind and i'm telling you we i i know there's some other weeds that only care about big businesses but that's not where we were coming from at all the whole point was to make sure that people like you were left whole and and so if there are specific issues you're having please call my office at 323-965-1422-323-965-1422 because one thing i can say is that we do have an administration now that will return phone calls i'm telling you under four years with trump they were actually ordered not to return the calls of democrats and so we couldn't even if you called my office and asked for help with the administration we wouldn't have been able to help you but we can now so if you call my office maybe we can put you in touch with the right person from the small business administration because i i promise you when we worked on the bills and when we passed the bills we had you in mind and and so one of the things that i'm also concerned about is how much theft fraud and abuse it's funny because usually when those terms are are used waste brought in a br abuse they're only talking about poor people and we know that there was just grand theft over these funds with people doing all sorts of things and my colleague mr clyburn is chairing a committee that is actually doing the oversight and they're looking for examples of where you know there were problems of course looking for positive examples as well uh but i please call my office and maybe there's something that we could do for you most specifically we can go to our first poll question all right excellent let's take that first quick poll right back to your questions so you'll vote on the keypad on your phone to respond to this poll we want to know if you are interested in getting future updates from the office of congresswoman karen bass please press one right now on the keypad on your phone so again if you are interested in getting future updates from the office of congresswoman karen vass please press one i'll leave that open right now everyone go ahead and vote right now we have hundreds already went in saying that by pressing one that yes they want to continue receiving updates from the office of congresswoman karen bass and i'll turn this back to you congresswoman um thank you thank you very much thank you for participating in the poll you know the last time we did this oh good everybody likes the updates okay we'll keep doing them um the last time we did this we asked if you were interested in a physical town hall but that was before omnichrome or however you pronounce it um and so hopefully we'll ask that question sometime next year now george from westwood was asking what is happening at the federal level to end the homelessness crisis you know i hate telling people from l.a this because you don't it's not good news you know the homelessness issue that we are dealing with here is not it's not it's not really dealt with all over the country so many of my colleagues you know kind of look at us in the big cities and don't quite understand what we're going through and they can't even comprehend the level of the problem here i mean you realize we have more people on house than a lot of counties entire counties don't have populations of forty and and the the population in la is 40 000 in just the city 20 000 more um and and so the magnitude of the problem is so massive here and that's why i believe we really need to consider it like a man-made disaster that you go into crisis mode and say we're not just going to go through the routine to have this done i mean you know to deal with this so in hud housing and urban development the chair of the i mean the secretary of hud marcia fudge who happens to be a good friend of mine and colleague and neighbor she heads up a national task force on homelessness and i've been talking to her a lot about this problem because i'm trying to look at what can we do now in hud now that we are back in charge because again for four years we couldn't even talk to hud what can we do now to expedite the the pro you know the dealing with the issue here so for example i'm trying to push for flexibility with vouchers so we're not so restricted where vouchers can be used um and then looking at homeland security the secretary there mike mayorkas to ask well can fema help looking at hhs health and human services with our javier bacera our former former member of congress former attorney general uh what can they do uh to help provide mental health treatment and substance abuse so i'm trying to take full advantage of the fact that being in dc allows me access to all of these federal agencies and the cabinet and the white house to raise alarm about what we're dealing with here but i just can't express to you enough the frustration from the last four years where really it wasn't until january of this year and actually it was later because if you remember the president had a lot of trouble with the transition and a lot of trouble getting his nominees confirmed and so um the agency started late but since i'm there and since i have access to all of these people i'm trying to work with them right now to say what can we what changes can we bring about right now and uh horatio from windsor hills is asking how would a person be able to apply for one of those well-paid infrastructure jobs that are coming to la metro metro metro definitely go on the website and look at metro because there is specific recruitment uh there and i'm sorry it seems as though you're having a lot of feedback um on the call i'm not sure if that is is in general how about um if walter edwards from the eighth district has a question great yeah let's get walter walter your life go ahead okay thank you uh hello karen bass uh congresswoman um thank god you know we feel your service you know all you do for our community i am from los angeles and i have a question uh because i speak on faith and i go to west end in this church god in and i'd say you're gonna be the mayor of los angeles so karen bass the mayor of los angeles so my question is under the war on drugs los angeles california has allowed us to get cannabis licenses but under the social equity program and i just want to know what your take is on that if you have any idea on that uh thinking about coming to los angeles and being the mayor here well uh first of all thank you thank you very much i i really uh appreciate your comments uh and your support i do have to say though that this particular call is a call that is paid for with taxpayer dollars and it is in my official capacity as a member of congress and and so i can't get into a political discussion now but let me just say in terms of the war on drugs look i believe that one of the reasons why we have 40 000 people on the street today is because of very bad policies from the 90s and those policies start with the war on drugs i view addiction as a health issue and unfortunately what has happened in our county over the last i would say 10 or 15 years is the dismantling of a layer of services that we used to have we used to have residential drug treatment programs where you could be an addict on the street for years enroll in a program live there for a year and graduate to another program so that you really had two years to recover and those programs were run by people who were in recovery well unfortunately when the affordable care act was passed it tried to upgrade that system and in the course of upgrading it many of the programs actually closed because they were loaded with a lot of additional requirements and so that is something that we really need to fight for again because we don't really have a a system that's adequate we have a system we don't have a system that's adequate on mental health nor do we have a system on substance abuse and those are two major categories of the people who are unhoused so it's one thing to say you want to get people off the street but if you don't take care of the reason why they were on the street to begin with it's only going to be temporary so i've been working on this issue for many many years but the last 10 years were very very difficult because i knew the system was going to collapse and i couldn't do anything about it because remember when the republicans were in control of everything all they wanted to do was destroy the affordable care act so they didn't want to fix any of the problems with the affordable care act and you know anytime you have a massive piece of legislation like the affordable care act after you pass it you have to spend five or ten years fine tuning it fixing it because you can't pass a major piece of legislation like that and and have and be able to predict every unintended consequence so now that we actually have an administration and that we are in charge what i'm doing now is instead of trying to legislate everything i'm just trying to work directly with the administration because about the obvious reasons of why it's so hard to pass legislation but uh but now i'm hoping that the administration might be able to fix it i'm worried though that the sentiment of our city is getting to be very angry and hopeless and when those kind of uh atmospheres take over people tend to politicians tend to pass very very very bad policies and i believe that the the answer to drug addiction is drug treatment and not incarceration um and so i i'm worried that the pendulum is getting ready to swing back again to incarcerating a health problem and i don't want to see that happen because it doesn't work i mean that's that's that's the bottom line it just doesn't work uh eric from um uh one of the neighborhoods a little bit outside of the district is asking a question all right perfect yes um eric you are live right now please go ahead with your question thank you for taking my question i i i agree with a couple of earlier uh earlier callers and questioners i'm deeply shocked by the level of anti-democratic sentiment and it's being expressed around the united states today along with uh obvious and overt attempts at voter suppression and so i don't want to be redundant but could i ask you to say a little bit more about strategies that you can that that you find to be most effective pushing back against what i can only call authoritarian sentiment um oh you you just couldn't have said it better um one of the things that one of the ways i talk about it and you know you can be the judge as to whether or not it's effective because i focus on foreign policy you know i'm just shocked at what is going on in this country because when other countries do what is taking place in the united states right now voter suppression changing the rules setting up the basis to uh overturn elections gerrymandering so that the people who are elected don't reflect the populations all of those things when other countries do those things we sanction them and we cut their foreign assistance and i'm supposed to as a member of congress focused on foreign policy i'm supposed to go around the world shaking my finger at people telling them the best ways to do their to organize their democracy and we have the situation that we do so it is the hype of hypocrisy from my point of view and i think that you know what i have found is so important is really talking to people about it and uh and pointing out how extreme this is because you know if you look at totalitarian regimes around the world they don't happen overnight they slowly happen they slowly happen and that is the direction that we are headed in this country now and we need to do everything we can to uh prevent this from going on which is why i think it's so important that the task force the select committee the chairman benny thompson uh is in charge of gets to the bottom of it um we need to wrap up the call now we're about to approach an hour let me just say a few things number one at the end of the year i definitely want to thank the very very very hard working staff uh in the capitol and also in los angeles they do work that they often don't get credit for because i get all the credit but be clear that the office functions and your case work is handled and your calls are answered not because of me but because of the staff of the 37th district so i want to thank them for all of their work uh this year uh they had more than 400 cases that means constituents calling up and having different problems and so some of the issues that they had to deal with was the backlog of passports because nobody was really traveling last year and everybody decided they were going to go all over the world this year there was just incredible pressure to assist constituents with passport issues immigration issues of some left over from last year where people were stranded when travel was cut down but a lot of immigration uh related issues the small business administration like the caller that call that uh spoke a few minutes ago and then i think our number one case complaint by everybody is the us postal service so if anybody that is listening if you want to sign up for our email newsletter and telephone town halls you can do that at bass dot house dot gov slash sign up bass dot house dot gov slash sign up um you can stay informed and stay involved you can find me of course on all of the various social media platforms facebook oh oh we're supposed to say meta now um twitter and instagram uh rep karen bass rep karen bass i look forward to next year and hopefully seeing you all in person don't give up

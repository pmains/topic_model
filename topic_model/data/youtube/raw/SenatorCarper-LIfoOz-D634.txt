political science professor emeritus at the university of delaware who mentored many folks including judge stark and me jim soules was personally hero to many of us in delaware and i know he's smiling down on his hearing today len stark like jim and myself as a fellow university of delaware graduate of fighting blue hen at u of d judge lynn stark double majored as an undergraduate in political science and economics who while simultaneously also getting his earnings master's degree and during college lin proved himself to be an exceptional student and person earning a full scholarship as a eugene dupont memorial distinguished scholar not long after graduation lynn was selected to be a rhodes scholar he studied at oxford university and authored numerous academic and scholar publications including a book on british politics which he wrote in his spare time between classes at oxford after oxford then went on to earn his law degree at yale law school where he served as editor senior editor of the yale law journal and then began his career in public service as an assistant u.s attorney for delaware where from 2002 until until 2007 he handled wide variety of federal criminal and civil matters before his current position as a district judge len served as a magistrate judge in the u.s district court of delaware it was this role that prepared him i think quite well to serve as a district court judge only four years after serving as a district judge in 2014 lynn was appointed the position of chief judge which he held up until i think june of this year during his 14 years on the bench in delaware judge stark has presided over 6 000 civil and criminal cases including 2 400 patent cases and 93 trials including 63 patent trials patent law is of particular importance to the federal circuit and judge stark's experience and expertise in these matters makes him uniquely qualified for this judgeship finally mr chairman colleagues he i want to remind our colleagues here today that in 2010 judge stark was confirmed by the full senate by unanimous consent judge stark is known as a consensus builder who works divine principle compromises fact of judge stark's approximately 2100 written opinions only two percent have ever been reversed or affirmed with criticism in the years since judge stark's last confirmation by this committee judge stark has served in delaware and the nation with integrity and with distinction he has the heart of a servant and temperament to be an outstanding judge on the u.s circuit court of appeals of the federal circuit and i look forward to swift confirmation so we can hopefully confirm judge stark without delay let me just say as a recovering governor i had the opportunity to nominate dozens scores of men and women to serve on the judiciary of the state of delaware and i always look for people who had the heart of a servant people who understand the the idea that you're supposed to treat people with dignity and respect in the in the courtroom look for people really bright and they really knew the law or able to make tough decisions uh nobody meets that uh that's uh those descriptive that description better than lynn stark and i'm honored and proud to be here in front of his uh family and with him and with all of you thank you so much thanks senator carpenter's high praise and i turn now to your colleague senator coons thank you chairman durbin ranking member grassley good morning i want to congratulate all of today's nominees i am especially pleased to join my senior senator in introducing a nominee i've literally known for decades a fellow delawarean a talented and seasoned jurist someone who has the experience the intellect intellect and the temperament to continue his service as an outstanding federal judge today he is nominated to serve on the federal circuit this is judge len stark of whom both senator carper and i are speaking um i've known him and his wife beth for many years and they are a classic delaware story they met um their first day as freshmen at the university of delaware um and as they say the rest is history as senator carper has shared dr jim soles known to all of us as a legend in the political science department played some small role in inspiring len towards service he is supported today as he is always by his wonderful family brennan and jamie and lucy beth and lyndon danielle and others you may introduce your honor he also is joined today by his clerks his tremendous experience as a trial judge in the district of delaware makes him spectacularly qualified for this particular nomination and role his 14-year career as a federal jurist began as a magistrate in 2007 and 2010 he became a district court judge being confirmed unanimously by the senate and he served as chief judge since 2014. he served um as the presiding judge over 6 000 criminal and civil trials including 2400 patent cases the district of delaware is literally one of the busiest patent courts in the country um and he has been reversed as you heard in just two percent of the 2100 written opinions he's delivered um and frankly he's already shown that he will hit the ground running as a federal circuit court judge having sat by designation 54 times already on the third circuit and the federal circuit his academic and professional credentials before joining the federal judiciary confirm uh why president biden sought his service on this important and prestigious position he's not just a proud fighting blue hen a ud graduate where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science with honors and a bachelor of science with sanction and economics but he had a minor in women's studies and his master's degree was in european medieval and early modern history just a reminder of the broad and searching intellect he has brought to his service on the bench as a rhodes scholar he studied at oxford where he earned a doctorate philosophy in british politics and then graduated from a law school some of us have heard of yale law school in 1996. he clerked for judge stapleton on the third circuit practiced with scat and arps for a number of years and then entered public service as an assistant u.s attorney where he delivered excellent service in the support of the us attorney um i am confident he will bring the same sort of open-mindedness keen legal mind outstanding character and sterling work ethic to the circuit court that he's brought to his practice and to the district of delaware bench i strongly support him and i join my senior senator in urging all of our colleagues to take up and swiftly confirm this outstanding nominee thank you mr chairman thank you senator coons

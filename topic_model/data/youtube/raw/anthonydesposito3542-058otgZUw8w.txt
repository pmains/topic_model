what doctor now three weeks into this I know I mute the mic Thanks okay morning all right good morning how are you yep morning good morning so you know I do as we'll be coming in shortly but this is our third week of our virtual speaker series house and I can't believe we're three weeks in already it's pretty crazy when you think about it right oh yeah so I just want to thank for the council member Anthony Esposito for joining us today and our director of social studies in Oceanside Mitchell Mitchell Bickman for kind of being a guest commentator so we thought would be a nice combo to have the two of them on together so we're excited for today and just for our viewers out there remember you can post it Doc's when you get in here and you know some fun with it I'm dr. Gazzola assistant principals at Oceanside high school I'm with my partner in crime dr. Glen Rogers and uh mr. big man councilman please would keep this really informal in the sense that uh you know we're you know most of our homes I think counseling you are in your office probably as a central worker so you know thank you for going to work every day and try to keep our communities safe but let's just you know keep it light have some fun and stuff of that nature so hey Vincent thanks for showing up I know you hear every day we like to give you a shout out every single time you come on and we see your brother Joe Joe how we do in my bed so councilman he just maybe tell us a little bit about your position where it kind of fits in in the political world I guess you would say where is that you do maybe who you represent stuff like that sure so I guess you know the government that we have here in the United States is sort of broken into a few layers especially on Long Island in Nassau County and the town of hempstead there's multiple layers so it kind of starts on a very local level which I guess would be or your local villages then goes to the town level county state federal level but once you kind of get into the town and the state level the representation of constituents is kind of the same we represent just about the same amount of people so in the town of hempstead there are six council people each represent a different district and then there's a supervisor so there's seven people on the board all with an equal vote it's a little bit different than the county where there's a legislature that can vote and then the county executive has veto power over that legislature the Tanner hampster doesn't have that we all have equal votes to represent our district so each council person represents approximately 130 to 145 thousand people the Tana Hempstead on a whole has about 775 780 thousand people with the largest Township in the United States bigger than I think for states at this point so it's it's a huge Township we have 25 departments that operate each and every day we mean maintain 1200 miles of roadway and obviously we've seen over the last couple weeks in a situation like this a lot of people depend on their government for to keep them healthy and safe that's great so what would you say is your like primary focus or mission or purpose in doing what you do you know it's definitely important position and we would love to kind of like what you know what drives that position so I guess in in town government you know obviously one of the things that's most important is to maintain services at the best cost for the taxpayer I think you know we all agree that here in Nassau County taxes are always an issue so in the town of hempstead we do our best to maintain the services that we provide and increase those services all while you know having conservative view on the on the main line over the last two years and be proud to say that we've actually cut taxes in the town of hempstead so that's been something that we're very happy with but really when it comes down to in town governing is I think what's most important is making sure that the people that you represent are well taken care of it's I really pride myself and my office works very hard in making ourselves accessible whether it's you know through social media Facebook Twitter Instagram I even signed up for a ticked-off account the other day so we're going to see how that goes but myself accessible you know all hours of the day and really deal with constituent issues here you know I want to make sure that nothing is you know many people call and say oh this isn't important and it could be a stop sign or a pothole filled all that stuff's important because I always I was always taught that if someone's calling your office whatever they're calling about may not be important to everyone else but to them it's the most important thing at the time so I think our goal here is to really make sure that we maintain those services and provide the best possible constituent affairs as we possibly can and that's whether someone calls this office and maybe it's not something that the town deals with but we will then serve at that point as their liaison between state government or county government or federal government to make sure that whatever their answer or whatever their concerns gets answered so what would you say what do you think is the most interesting part of the job you know you yeah so I think you know I have to say I have a little bit of a unique situation and that before I became a member of the Town Board I was an NYPD detective and that was another job that to be honest with you I I love going to work every day because it was something that every day was different you got to really take on challenges that you probably wouldn't as being a kid that grew up in Island Park so I think in government in politics it's very similar and that des is is very alike you kind of wake up each and every day with somewhere different to go different people to meet and have different challenges to face and I think that I always say whenever I speak to classes or whenever I go and speak to students anywhere you know one of the things that I think really prepared me for a career in government and politics was the police department because in the police departments you know you've worked with people who came from different economic backgrounds different race different religions definitely different political views and at the end of the day you know my life depended on them and their life depended on me and you really learn the ability to work with others that may not be similar to you and I think that I take the lessons that I've learned being an NYPD detective and I bring it to the work that I do here at Hampstead every day sorry so I didn't know that that you were an NYPD detective that's interesting boy there I mean back as far as like you know elementary school were you ever in any you know kind of student any other like government positions like student government student council like did you ever have an inkling at a young age the strength of yours or an interest so I was obviously born and raised in Island Park I went to Haggerty Elementary School Lincoln Orange middle school and I went to shaman at high school but I was the president of student council in Lincoln arms and I don't know you know my teachers at the time we probably would have said that maybe this was something that was in the future I never really thought it but I I did serve as president of the student council Oh what other can we just continue at that well so what what kind of skills are characteristics did you possess as a as a young as a student that kind of might have been a hint that this could have been a career opportunity for you like you know did your teachers tell you where did you know in middle school in high school that you had a knack for you know leadership for their skills or characteristics that you possess they that allowed you to take on this role and be successful in your career I think it certainly depended on the teacher I know I always you know growing up was one of those people who kind of um you know tried to find solutions to problems and really in government that's kind of you know what what you do you yeah that's what you do each and every day even if people don't agree with the solution that you find you know you have to yeah you're basically a problem solver each and every day whether it's you know on a more you know global level that it's a tan light issue or something very small that could be specific to three houses in Oceanside whatever it is that you're doing you're trying to find solutions to problems and trying to get people to come together to work together you know to really make our communities better that's great thank you for sharing that mr. Brickman you heard that problem solvers solution Aires is what he would say right yeah yeah that's something that we focus on in the schools councilman Seto has been in a number of times talk to our students and we're always grateful when he comes in shares his expertise one of the things that that's really interesting for our students right now is that there's always been a fine each generation so we would say that a lot of us on this call 911 was one of the key events that define our generation and possibly the previous generation maybe our parents would be that of Vietnam World War two was going back further so right now for a lot of our students when they look back this Colgan 19 is going to be a defining historical event for them so a lot of them are journaling right now and creating video accounts of their time their experiences I'm enrolling this back now to to government some of our students have expressed interest in you know saying more than ever asking questions like what is the government doing what is their role in all this or their opportunity is probably not at the moment for our students to do any type of job shadowing with you or internships with you because of something that you know they've expressed interest possibly more zone now than ever before council may be near it the key might be frozen I froze the councilman it's really something mr. Brickman yeah it's a good question mr. Bateman so Wally's frozen Mitch your your drive-thru soul studies you do a lot of work with you know history and politics and government what are some opportunities you back I'm here I heard you guys the whole time okay so did you hear mr. big moons question that I didn't hear I only heard you okay Mitch if you could asking yeah yep sure so just I'll skip to the question part students more so getting now them time and maybe have you know found some interest in looking into government themselves so is there a opportunities for internships or jobs on with your office not not now and you need to see but possibly down the road absolutely anybody that wants to come hang out with me right now I'll take them but no internships you know something that I'm always interested in you know whether it's you know the schools that I've attended or anywhere in my district if if there's anyone interested there's really here in the town of hempstead there's you know I I kind of run it's a it's very parallel to like my old world in the police department there's really a job for anyone so if anyone's interested in in government and it may not be the administration part of government it could be another aspect of government whether it's our controller or our budget director who handles the six hundred million dollar budget or our Highway department who maintains twelve hundred miles of roadway and make sure our streets are plowed or our sanitation department who in this time you know we've seen that the are essential because if we don't pick up garbage everyday this health crisis becomes a public health hazard so there's so many opportunities and honestly anybody listening or anybody any of your students that would love to be involved here happy to have them thank you I say what are the what what's the process for these different positions whether it's sanitation or maybe application dependent just for some so the Tad's of Homestead operates we have our own Civil Service Department which kind of follows the same rules and regulations as the county and the state civil service so there are many positions throughout the town of hempstead in many of our departments that are civil service once you get to the sort of the administrative portion which is either directors or commissioners or deputy commissioners those are appointments by the town board very often there are people who have sort of come up the ranks and learned how it is to operate a huge sanitation department or you know someone in the parks department who has kind of moved up the ranks and is now we just appointed a new commissioner who's someone who's spent his career in the parks department and now he leads the parks department workforce you know of almost a hundred parks you know the town Hampstead has almost 100 parks in our park system so there are so many opportunities you know our jobs are always listed on our website but like I said if most a lot of the positions are civil service which tests are related there's promotional opportunities that involve a tests and then our upper administration usually falls into appointments by the Town Board cool so your path to your to your see what happened you do some schooling you know you ain't doing the police force you know boys your path to your seat and is that a similar path is that the one has to follow to to get to your seat let's talk about that a little bit so I think that the pet that took was probably not very similar to most people in government of politics so I like I said born and raised in Island Park I went to elementary and middle school in Island Park and then I went to shaman on high school I graduated there in 2000 so I guess for a lot of the elected officials and maybe Nassau and Long Island I guess I'm on the younger side after shaman odd I went to Hofstra University I graduated there in 2004 and then I worked briefly in the private sector actually for a non-profit doing fundraising and then in late 2005 I was called to the NYPD you know where I went into the police academy and then I was a promoted detective in 2009 so from 2009 to 2016 I was a detective in Brooklyn and 73rd precinct detective squad and then in January February of 2016 I was asked to join the Town Board so I guess it's a little bit of a different path you know I have to say that I'm probably standing a foot-post in Brownsville Brooklyn in 2006 I never thought that 10 years later I'd be sitting as a member of the Hampstead town board so I think it is a little bit different but I think really what it comes down to is you know always and I encourage anybody that's listening you know that get involved in your community if government politics is something that you're interested in getting involved is important that I see might be ambrósio set flour on here you know there's two people who are really involved in their community whether it's the Kiwanis or the school board for me I was you know I served as chief of the fire department from 2009 to 2016 just always involved in my community and I think that's kind of where it starts I mean my parents were involved in the community whether it's our local church at Sacred Heart my dad served as deputy mayor in the village of Island Park for like you know probably two decades so you know it's kind of something that I grew up in but I always say anyone who's interested in government and politics I think there's like a stigma that you gotta go to school go to law school and then you can get into politics and I think that there are so many different routes and I always say that you know getting into government and politics whatever go to school - whatever it makes you happy whether it's accounting or law or you know whatever it is that you want to study don't think that you can only study one thing and get into government politics because you really can you know study what makes you happy and that's what you should because government and politics aren't always around forever so you want to make sure that you have something to lean back on and something that makes you happy for the rest of your life are there any activities or events courses that you didn't take advantage of over the years like high school college that you wish you had sometimes I wish it's kind of like a double-edge award because there's um I always think to myself that I wish I would have taken advantage of going away to college I went to Hofstra and commuted so that you know sometimes I mean I think to myself you know I wish I would have went away but then on the other end I probably wouldn't have been involved or as involved in my community especially the fire department I wouldn't have been able to give the time that I gave to the fire department and probably wouldn't have you know reach the ranks that I've reached if I had gone away so there you know I sometimes wish that I had I had taken the trip to go away to college what about in Chaminade what were you involved in any um I know they have you know robust program anything that you were involved in there that was helpful or that you weren't involved in that you wish you were I guess I you know I liked athletics I do wish I was on the Speech and Debate team because everyone tells me I do like this far on so I probably could have picked up some tips there so that's one thing that I I wish I was more involved in and and just I think overall in the you know in the school I was involved in in after-school activities but I think just getting involved in really the the global aspect of the school more I wish I did it was something that I really embraced after I left there right we have that at the high school Speech and Debate we do we are we're a nationally ranked Model UN World Interest club that students can take advantage of that opportunity counseling huge spoke about volunteerism and giving back which you have had a number of different both formal positions and informal volunteerism do you focus on the organizations or other opportunities that kind of template partners with or the night you can recommend that some students can get involved in if they're interested in you know helping out their their communities sure well I know tomorrow you have Rob Schulman on right yes so that I actually sit on the board of limb kind so that's you know something that I know he's always looking for volunteers and it's a great organization but at least on the town level one of the places that is near and dear to my heart is camp anchor it is a camp down in Lido Beach for special needs kids and adults and we have hundreds of volunteers there who you know some have started there as a volunteer and then eventually start working there but it's a place that you know if you ask anyone who has volunteered there who or have worked there it's a place that's really changed their lives forever and we also have for those animal lovers we have an animal shelter in Wantagh that we're always looking for volunteers whether it's you know individuals who may want to become a vet one day or a behaviorist an animal behaviorist or just somebody who likes dogs and likes to take them for a walk I mean there's stickers as well what's here opportunities down in there as well so council it does have to go in about five minutes he has a one o'clock 1:05 meeting so I do want to wrap up Shortland and thank councilman for giving them giving us this time but thanks one tumour questions but one question is really we talked about the past their seat and different people take different paths and we have success we have successful people in our scene and not so successful what does it take to once you're in deceit to be successful what type of skills are important for for students or people looking to go into career field government policies where is it they need to work on and be good at newer to be successful definitely patience you know you definitely need patience you need the ability and willingness to compromise I think that especially here the town of hempstead you know it's a very diverse tab and the board represents different people and I think that you have to be willing to work with those representatives whether they are of the same political beliefs of you with of you is or not to make sure you do what's right so I think making sure you can compromise making sure you have patience and unfortunately you know social media and instant access has done so much for our world and we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing now if we didn't have the ability of you know social media and people logging on here but there's also a downside to social media there's many people who say you know very very nasty and vile things because they're sitting behind a keyboard so I think one of the things that unfortunately you need in in this business is thick-skinned and you need to have a family who understands that people are going to say some not so nice things about you and you kind of have to have the ability to kind of shrug it off your shoulders because it said but there's a lot of people out there I think you know every vote that you make you're making some people happy and you're making others unhappy so you have to realize that you're not going to make everyone happy and you have to have you know the hope that you can kind of bring people together for the best interest of everybody that we serve you know you know you're not always victorious at that but you got to try your best okay and just for our students what kind of advice and recommendations or suggestions would you have for the are middle level high school students you know pursuing life after high school right just overall like what kind of advice alright my nation would you provide them to help them kind of like find their path so I think it kind of goes back to what I was saying before you know you should really go to college and study and and be a part of things that make you happy that things that you really want to do I mean what's that oh oh who is frozen I think it's the council man yes I think he's a wife I just know that that create over there okay so if counseling comes in finish the comment but I know he does have to go I just want to give two quick shout out so once a mistake low or a counselor she's do with this all the time dr. Wiseman leader he's at the high school and most of doctors you Yanis thank you for being with us she does her book reads every morning it's a it's a great great time if you get a chance to check it out counselors you want to finish your thought or do you have to run no listened I just want to say thank you all for having me you know I hope that everyone who's listening or watches this stays healthy realized that these are definitely trying times but we'll all get through this as long as we stick together and as things progress if if you need someone to jump on here again I'm happy to join you and if anybody's listening or watches this has any concerns with what's going on or just general government and in general you know my office we're still Manning the phones here you can corn six equal to three to four - I'm on all the social media applications so you can hit me up there and just stay safe stay healthy and thank you ewing the great education in oceanside even in these trying times job well done you councilman can I also just let you know the middle school students the high school students even our elementary school students are home and I know that many of them have reached out asking if there's anything they could do to help so if you have any ideas a ways in which our students can help you whether it's a social media message or you know collecting a certain item if there's anything that you can think of we have you know a thousand kids at the middle school in 2000 at the high school that are willing to help so you know just give us let nature I know if there's anything you could think of that our students could do to help you absolutely I will do and and the same goes for you guys and the students if the students that can think of anything that I can do to help us get through this let me know great thanks just a reminder tomorrow we have a rather showman from the Lincoln foundation you're working pretty extensively with our project edge students at the elementary level he used a prosthetist which is a interesting and great career Wednesday we have two physical therapists coming on Thursday we have you know we had our teachers on Thursday we're gonna have a focus on mental health providers within the school so got social workers psychologists and the counselor and Friday with aerospace mechanical engineer coming on so that should all be so consoling a good luck in your press conference guys be good

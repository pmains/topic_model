good seed ball you got to chant a chance to visit over at the state capital for the first time in a while tell us the purpose of the visit who you got to meet with well is very good at visit today with our state leadership i met the Speaker of the House with that governor lieutenant governor and lawmakers and local as well and primarily to talk about the border security bill that i have it is a important bill for the state of texas and i want to make sure that the needs of the state are taken care of in this legislation so we talked a lot about whether it be additional in dps additional work Patrol agents the role the National Guard the reimbursed of the National Guard and quite frankly the technology and assets that we can put down there to secure the border so we had a very very open and honest discussion that I think a meeting in the minds of principle we can move forward and produce a really good bill from states actually in light of that bill and what governor Abbott said during his state of the state that he along with lieutenant governor is indicated they'd like to see the National Guard stay at least long enough for dps to be solid there along the border does it will your bill help the effort that Texas is doing even from an economic standpoint because I've hey dollars right into this well and that's precisely what we talked about i moved to build out of committee i still have time to amend that bill so what i want to do is address the concerns of the governor and lieutenant governor raised in terms of what Texas needs to get the job done and as you discuss they have talked about every more dps so we talked about but perhaps moral agents and the high threat areas and also a way to reimburse through a grant program the law enforcement piece to this so without they're very productive meetings in dem looking forward to moving onward and upward on this I think again this is going to be a heavy Texas citric bill where do you think your bill is headed I know that it deals with a lot of Technology you talked about that before using some of the assets that are no longer needed in theaters like Afghanistan do you feel promise with your bill OSI mean we've been recodified the program between DoD and DHS we have five of those blimps or air stats down there now 15 more on their way when I was in Afghanistan they said that's our border security because it's a smart effective border once you have a hundred percent visibility you can see what's happening on the ground you can better and more effectively respond to it so that peace is already underway but it is provided for in the bill in addition these predators have radar technology to see 200 miles per aircraft I think is a very smart way to secure the border with immigration the president's plan now we have this judge's decision in Brownsville that with the 26 states that said we do not want to see this immigration policy the executive action go through do you think that that's going to be the end of it or clearly this is going to be appealed do you think this is a temporary halt of the president's immigration plan well it's temporary but it has stopped the executive action for being implemented and so in that sense it's permanent but short-term they'll be on emergency appeal to the Fifth Circuit and most likely court and so you know I applaud that you know like the judicial branch has stepped in and validate what we've been saying all along that he overreached the he need he should have gone through Congress and not unilaterally had done this and so it's good to see the other branch of government agreeing with us on that and putting this to a temporary halt and so it validates what the president quite frankly said 22 times and that was he didn't have a constitutional authority to do this when you go back from the recess the Senate will be taking up what the House passed right this is the bill that links the budget for the Department of Homeland Security together with the president's immigration plan trying to undo that plan to be able to fund Department of Homeland Security where do you see that headed and should anybody be concerned about funds not getting to Department of Homeland Security ya know those are two issues one I think what we did its job we passed our it funds the Department of Homeland Security and the Senate needs to act and I think these eight Democrats who are holding up the measure from even being debated on the Senate floor all we're asking for is a full and fair debate on the Senate floor but they are holding this measure up from even going to the floor of the Senate for debate so we'll see how that plays out with respect to the department itself I believe that we shouldn't play politics with a national security agency as important as this one particularly in the high-threat environment that we find ourselves in I think the shutdown the department would be highly here responsible again at a time we're seeing Isis getting worse not better when we're seeing the peristyle tax that occurred that could occurred here in the United States and I want to talk more about the the so-called Islamic state here with you in a moment but just in terms of the bill itself that was passed in the house do you wish that maybe it had been separated that the the two were not linked together well i think you know we were we represent the American people the house bleep oh I think we were really of advocating for what the American people thought that is yeah you need to do something about this we made a very strong statement against the president's executive action for and racine I think the court course have now agreed with us and I think now it's the constitutionality of that really should play out the courts and I think the courts will determine that eventually what's going on with Isis right now from your vantage point with what you can share with us with the so-called Islamic state is the president and the administration doing everything it can to stem this threat no I don't think they are like this is the biggest threat to the homeland the foreign fighters had gone over there there are 50,000 Isis fighters and growing every day the foreign fighters are gone up from 15 to 20,000 since the airstrikes have begun and 5,000 Western passports hundreds of Americans have traveled to the region and some have come back and so I'm very concerned that we're not doing enough the best thing we can do to protect the homeland as made the threat over there right now I see a policy of containment rather than a policy to defeat and destroy Isis I think but you're not suggesting that we would have boots on the ground but more could be done on the ground I think they're worth a Jordanian pilot with that horrific movie video we saw being lit on flames that you know I think the Arab nations have a role player it's their backyard it seems to me it's that their region of the world and they have to be a part of this solution including a Ground Force I mean Jordan wants to put a Ground Force there I think turkey has that kind of ground force Egypt there are a lot of the Arab nations that could do this that under American leadership we could get it done but we don't have that leadership as strong as we need it right now and I'll give you a good example we met with the White House Council on the authorized use of military force now I applaud them for coming to us for that authorization good i will not support a measure that weakens their ability and the military's capability to go and what they present it to us the the four major national security chairman and the majority leader was a plan that essentially eviscerates the current authority they have under the 2001 of a umf so we will debate that a muscle on Foreign Affairs we hopefully will pass a bipartisan authorized use of military force but it has to be one that authorizes victory at the end of the game and is not one that ties the generals hands and actually leads to a path that would not defeat Isis congressman McCaul we appreciate you taking time especially during the recess to visit with us when we hope to have you back soon thanks a lot of people okay and we're back with more capital tied after the break you

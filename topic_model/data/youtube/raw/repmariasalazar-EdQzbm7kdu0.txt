the federal government surpassing the 31 point at three eight trillion debt limit this morning forcing the treasury Department to use quote Extraordinary Measures to avoid default here's what the White House has to say about this the debt ceiling fight watch there will not be any negotiations over the debt ceiling that we will not do that it is their constitutional Duty you think about how Congress has has dealt with the debt ceiling for the past several decades it is their responsibility their constitutional responsibility to act joining me right now here from the world economic Forum in Davos is Florida congresswoman Maria Salazar Werner great to see you Congressman thank you wonderful to see you in person for being here and you're here from Washington you got a pretty good group of uh DC lawmakers here what are you trying to achieve by being here well in in particular I'm trying to achieve to tell everyone that America is still leading and not following well we have the American exceptionalism and that we're going to defend them the Europeans from becoming another Ukraine because that is the number one uh interest in can we still lead with 31.4 trillion dollars in debt this Reckless spending borrowing five trillion dollars just in the last two years wonderful wonderful question of course of course we cannot we need to be energy independent we need to lower inflation right now 40 percent of the American family is in trouble they don't save so my idea and you just gave me the opportunity to talk about is that we need to reform immigration yeah if we reform and we have a solid immigration overhaul we're going to be able to make the economy grow we're going to be able to seal the border and if you want to talk about it I would love to explain to you what up what what I'm putting forward why hasn't it happened yet 5 million plus illegal migrants Crossing into America on Joe Biden's watch one million others getting away we don't know their intentions they evaded apprehension deadly fentanyl Killing American citizens where's the policy no there's none and the by and I want everyone to understand that the Biden Administration or the Democratic party does not have or does not dare to introduce in Congress and immigration reform overhauling everything the legal and the and the legal immigration Senator Joe manchin was sitting in that seat yesterday he said there will be no immigration reform until we secure the border and we are and the dignity act which is the bill that I introduce and I'm going to reintroduce has the strongest listen to me well has the strongest border security measures in the history of Congress because I believe that a Latina that Hispanic you know the bulk of the people that are coming in are coming from Central America escaping economic problems but we're introducing something that will tell them stop no more no more fentanyl no more terrorists no more sex child sex traffickers but then at the when once we seal that with all the technology out there that it's available all right anything then we do two things we reform our legal immigration so we can allow those people that want to come in and help the economy and then we look back and then we give dignity to those who not citizenship dignity to those who are helping the American economy it's absolutely disgusting that the drug cartels are running the entree into America they are taking home billions of dollars it's our fault yeah that's right it's our fault they're running it they're deciding who comes in and who doesn't and at what price oh yeah they're making billions of dollars a week well but someone has to put an end to that right and what can that be technology can you do it being now in the majority in the house well I am going to definitely introduce legislation by part of citizenship because there's this is the way America works with bipartisan proposals so I am going to do that and I certainly hope that my party will understand we are not going to grow as a country if we do not have the hands everyone that I've spoken with over here conservative American entrepreneurs they all tell me Maria we need hands we need people we cannot grow and then if you need someone that is the molecular expert on biology whatever it is then we need to give him a Visa so he can come in well look we already have a structure in place we issue 1 million visas a year and these illegals are coming and jumping ahead of the line yes Maria and we do not want that anymore I'm going to repeat it the Hispanic Community largest minority in the country does not agree with open borders you know why because the child sex traffickers wind up in our neighborhoods yeah that's right and uh these people are getting raped on the way here by the way the U.S Conference of Mayors meeting behind closed doors yesterday on this to discuss the ongoing border a crisis Democrat D.C mayor Muriel Bowser dodged a question from Fox business's Hillary Vaughn watch this the president has done a good job so far handling the crisis at the border I think that everybody has to work harder and it's not the mayor's job to change immigration policies but it is our job to deal with it when it's at our door and so we call on everybody and from the Congress to the president to make sure that we have a national immigration policy that's fair predictable and that works for our country National immigration policy correct she does she doesn't want to uh attack on my orchest be impeached no I I I I think he's doing a very bad job when it comes to controlling the border is not so difficult the technology is out there my law My my what I'm proposing includes it we can seal the Border in 30 days do you know what it takes political willingness yeah I mean You released a discussion draft of uh your bill the Americas act it would create an expanding and permanent trade partnership of Western hemisphere countries why do you think this works it also counters you say China's growing control over global manufacturing of course that's another bill that I'm introducing with Senator Cassidy fantastic you know what it says to Central American Latin America you behave well you clean up your corruption act you do not deal with criminal uh organized crime uh you become energy high order I don't know my government the Latin American governments the people that speak the Spanish need to understand that the United States is out there to help them and we can join the usmda which is the gold standard of trade agreements sure we can join them if we behave accordingly and that way people will stay home because no one wants to cross the border people want to stay in their town they don't these people want to come to America they want freedom in America but they're coming in and there's all these resources that they're getting for free how kind of a cost is that on Americans that is amnesty every time that some of the members of Mike caucus my congressional conference I mean my GOP conference they tell me Maria what you're what you're proposing this dignity Act is amnesty and I said no you're completely wrong amnesty is what they have now that they're using the illegals are using the roads the hospitals on the schools for free the dignity act tells them okay come out I'm going to give you a dignified life you're going to live in dignity not citizenship but you're going to have to pay retribution and then no federal programs is it an unlimited number of people that can come in under this dignity act I mean when does it no no no no no wait wait people that came in already five years or more five years old if you've been here for more than five years you have you don't have a criminal record you're not a gang member you have been paying taxes you're working and you're picking up jalapeno peppers in Southern California or tomatoes in Miami or in Florida then we're going to give you the dignity Visa or the dignity permit so you can live in a dignified life in the United States I'm not going to give you citizenship because you know where you want it yeah because you don't let me tell you just give you just give me for your audience what is Broad and is very um very intelligent eighty percent of the seventy percent of those people who Ronald Reagan gave the path to citizenship chose not to pick it seventy percent of Mexican Americans in 1986 did not decide to become United States citizens they wanted to remain uh in dignity all right Congressman we're gonna be watching this and I certainly hope that you invite me more often because you're one of the Italian ones thank you you know I I miss this job thank you so much

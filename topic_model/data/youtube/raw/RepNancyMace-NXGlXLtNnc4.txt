congressman thank you so much for being with us um i think i want to ask you two questions at the same time if i may what made you vote against this bill and are you surprised that 13 republicans decide to vote for this bill well this bill this 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill isn't true infrastructure like if we're going to do infrastructure let's do infrastructure less than 10 of it 110 billion goes to quote surface transportation and of that 70 billion is public mass transit leaving nearly 40 billion or three or four percent uh to go to roads and bridges traditional things that americans you know really desperately need in their communities and so it was there are 42 new taxes in the infrastructure legislation as well and these are these things i can't support um and when they had this bill come over to the house not a single republican on the transportation committee was allowed to amend the legislation at all so truly for me this was really hyper partisan not a bipartisan bill and the other thing that this that this vote did last night was it was a layup lays the groundwork for passing buildback better once democrats get the congressional budget office score and how much is it going to cost in a few weeks around thanksgiving and and this is they're talking quote transformational change whatever that is right we know it's not good for the american people

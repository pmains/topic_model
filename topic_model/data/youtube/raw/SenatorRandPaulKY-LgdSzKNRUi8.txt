let's bring in Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee good morning to you good morning thanks for having me you're welcome what do you make of all this new information well to me I think it amounts to sort of illegally eavesdropping on someone for political purposes people say oh it's not against the law to unmask someone well actually it is if it's for political purposes so that's what needs to be investigated what I want to know is what possible national security reason would there be to unmask Flynn they've listened to the conversation they obviously know who it is because they probably recognize his voice or he introduces himself and he talks to the Russian ambassador and so they probably talk about a wide range of issues between Russia the United States I haven't seen the transcript of this but the question is what could they possibly think - it was Flynn saying oh we're gonna do something that was illegal or that would threaten our national security and why was everybody in the Obama administration listening to the phone call and finding out and knowing that it was general Klim now the fact that Joe Biden did was very important judgment but I think it was also an abuse of power and this is precisely what they were accusing Trump of during the impeachment they said oh you use the power of government to go after a political opponent that's exactly what Biden did here in a partisan way he went after a political opponent a high-ranking official of a new administration of the opposite party so I think it's a devastating abuse of a power so senator I just don't know how it works maybe you could tell me if I want to unmask somebody and I was in the Obama White House of the Trump White House what do I have to give you a reason in that paperwork to formally get it or because of my rank of because of my position do I just get that I believe that all you have to do is sign but I also believe that the instructions on how it's supposed to be used say that it needs to be for a national security reason it's supposed to be there to protect Americans because realize there was no warrant they did not go to a judge and say we want to listen to general Flynn they went to a secret probably the foreign intelligence court to say we want to listen to the Russian ambassador I'm fine with that but a lot of ordinary people talked to the Russian ambassador I've to the restaurant ambassador half of the Senate has talked to them that doesn't mean just because someone is spying on the Russian ambassador maybe that's fine doesn't mean you can listen and then take parts of the phone call that are private and reveal them and do something with them that's what they did to Flynn so I think it was an illegal it was an illegal eavesdropping and I think it was done for political purposes which makes it even worse sure well if you've talked to the Russian ambassador I'm sure you thought well I wonder who's got my name under a redaction somewhere senator you know you mentioned Joe Biden you're talking about you know what could have happened back then a couple of days ago he was over on ABC and George Stephanopoulos asked him about Flynn and the former vice president gave two answers in less than one minute watch this so what did you know about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn and was there anything improper done I know nothing about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn I do want to press that you say you didn't know anything about it but you were reported to be in a January 5th 2017 meeting where you and the president were briefed on the FBI's plan to question Oh Michael Michael Flynn I thought you asked me whether or not I had anything to do with him being prosecuted okay I'm sorry I was aware that there was that there that had asked for an investigation but that's all I know about it well that's all he knew on Tuesday senator what's interesting is now that you look at things on that particular day when he was in the Oval Office that was the same day the chief of staff McDonough had requested the and apparently got the unmasking of mr. Flynn that's also the same day that Sally Yates was going to tell the president about the phone call but the president said hey I got to tell you about a phone call he already knew are we starting to connect some of these dots well you know Steve I think when Joe Biden comes on Fox & Friends the next time and you ask him about the unmasking that probably explain why this was all appropriate a good question for Stephanopoulos he should have asked did you unmask him before this came out and then we would have known whether he was gonna lie are not about the unmasking because I have a feeling he would have dissembled nice way of saying lied about the unmasking too until he was caught but this is a big thing the entire inner circle was listening this phone call not for national security reasons they were listening to it because they wanted to do anything they could do to damage the incoming administration they were also doing it because they were desperate because they did not have any evidence of Russian collusion so they were trying so hard to find something because they've gotten the ball rolling on this and I think if we were to declassify any meetings about crossfire hurricane you'd find that President Obama was in those and leading those and I think if you were to ask any of these people under oath was President Obama aware of the I'm asking did he approve of the unmasking of general Bern I think you'll find this goes to the very top and this is really scary that they were using the entire enormous ly powerful apparatus of our intelligence community to use it against a political opponent that's why I'm fighting in the FISA Court or in the FISA reform today to say that Americans and political campaigns should not get caught up in this we should exempt Americans and not use the secret court on Americans or political campaigns so the I want to go back and see I wanted so the activity you know okay thanks the Acting DNI Rick Cornell he has declined the invitation to testify about the unmasking in front of Congress he does say he's going to continue to be transparent why did he decline that invitation well I think what's most important is to ask you know or to actually compliment him for bringing sunlight to this had he not declassified has will never known it and I think the big thing about classification is it's not about secrets there was any secret revealed that would hurt our enemies know the secret that was revealed was that there was a cup all of Obama appointees abusing their power but this is what happens his classification is used to cover your tracks not necessarily to protect secrets and I think there's a way to declassify a lot of stuff we've never had a president who came in who had people around him motivated to do it because that president had been abused by the intelligence community so this is a real chance for reform because I think if you ask most of you should we let this secret court investigate political campaigns again the only way we prevent this from ever happening again is a no American political campaign should be investigated by a secret court if you want to investigate Trump campaign or the Biden campaign you go to a real judge in a constitutional court and you get a real warrant a constitutional warrant but you shouldn't be able to do it in secret but we haven't putting the pieces together yet as you know and as Senator Grassley even said right now what we have is the name so we don't have the reason why they wanted the unmasking we can't fathom white why the UN Ambassador the US ambassador to the United Nations would need seven requests we don't understand why the US ambassador to Italy needs to be on this and had four separate requests well except for George papadopolis does George papadopolis says the guy that questioned me was Joseph Mifsud Joseph Mifsud was in Italy so is this the beginning of maybe an International CIA effort but we just don't know yet but which is interesting Center listen to this go back to 2017 and I'm gonna get you to answer that but I want you to go back to 2017 with me and listen to these officials being questioned you didn't say one way or another whether even there's an investigation underway correct I don't especially in a public forum we never confirm or deny a pending investigation did either of you ever requests the unmasking of mr. Trump his associates or any member of Congress yes in one case I did that I can specific all but I can't discuss it any further than that do you recall any u.s. ambassadors asking that names be unmasked I don't I don't know maybe it's ringing a vague bell but I'm not I could not answer with any confidence centers having heard what you heard and now what you know what do you think now well you know we know James clapper has a history of lying to Congress I don't trust him first of all but I would think that as you were talking about you know the the reforms or the way we would try to fix this what we could do is not only if you have to sign your name to do an unmasking maybe you should have to have a stated reason there's X information in the phone call and we think by knowing that person's name it will help with this national security problem a paragraph explaining your reasoning I think that we ought to do and if we instituted that in fact I think that's such a great idea it is my idea but I think what we should do is maybe maybe I will send a letter to the DNI Rick Grinnell this morning and suggests that we reform the process by making people not only sign when they're unmasking but also this should have to have a stated national security reason why all right senator let me ask you a little bit about the corona virus crisis right now nobody knows more about this than you do you were personally impacted you had coronavirus you have since recovered you know thousands of people die every week they continue to we were just talking to Ron De Santis the governor of Florida where they have had a targeted smart strategy and reopening the economy down there in the Sunshine State the president was appearing on mornings with Maria over on Fox Business in the last half-hour and he said that some of his critics want to keep the economy closed in various parts of the country to damage him politically before the election listen to the president on that topic moments ago do you think your critics want you to keep it closed going into the election yeah I do I do I think it's a it's a political thing in addition I think you're putting money business ahead of lives no no I think if the people that want to see the right thing happened they agree with me we have to get our country open you know it was up to some people let's keep it closed for a long time okay a long time and watch the United States go down the tubes not going to happen never going to happen on my watch of course it is a public safety issue but is it also political senator well give you an example in my state we have a Democratic governor whose this week that he's not planning on allowing childcare to open until there's a vaccine or a cure well really that would mean we might not have daycare ever again and working parents couldn't go back to work that is a ridiculous statement I think what we've learned so far from looking at this is one size fits all response my government is wrong New York was then did have a significant pandemic in Kentucky we had very little and we've had been very lucky many of the rural states have had very little of this they shouldn't be treated the same as New York well we also need to learn that this flu this is this virus affects ages quite differently we've known this almost since the beginning children have a virtually zero mortality rate above eighty has a significant mortality rate particularly in nursing homes we shouldn't treat them all the same and say everybody needs to stay locked up forever in fact I think Sweden is actually doing the right thing in the sense that they kept their kids in school now we kept our kids out for a half a semester we would be foolish not to get them in in the fall it's devastating to the community to the economy because parents can't work but it's also devastating to those kids particularly the poor kids who don't have a great ability to be taught at home alright thank you so much for being with us senator thank you

I've said consistently I won't vote for legislation that increases the the debt a national debt I want for vote for legislation that fails to rein in the the growth of health health care costs and I'm not interested in voting for for legislation that does not extend coverage to people who don't have it I'm very much encouraged that at least one Republican senator Olympia Snowe of of Maine has joined a number of Democrats in reporting the the bill out of the Finance Committee to the to the full the full Senate and I spoken her her continued involvement in this process is is is very important to make sure that that our approach stays centered stays balanced and that we remain nothing fiscally responsible we want to make sure that that we create a large purchasing pull back large purchasing pools in almost every states to to work to the benefit of consumers to the extent that that we still have problems with competition we have problems with affordability in certain states we want to make sure that they have a menu of options from which to choose to further rein in their growth of health care costs not a choice that we would dictate for the states but a variety of choices that they could make for themselves to make make certain that competition helps consumers there we hold the feet of the insurance companies to the fire and that we end up with with more than more than one choice for for consumers and four states the legislation that we've reported out of the Finance Committee reduces federal deficits by about 80 billion dollars over the next 10 years in by a roughly 400 800 billion additional dollars over the second ten years it's important as we go forward that we preserve in this legislation the the cost controls that are inherited in the bill that we don't let those slip away

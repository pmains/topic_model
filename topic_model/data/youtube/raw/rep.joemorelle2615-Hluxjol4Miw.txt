Connick civil-rights activist and leader in the Rochester community who passed away on December 14th Connie dedicated her life to the pursuit of equality and racial justice and her commitment to breaking down barriers was truly awe-inspiring Connie Mitchell was the first African American woman elected to office in Monroe County winning a seat on the Board of Supervisors in 1961 Connie was a role model in the fight for equality whose contributions helped to open the door of opportunity for so many people in our community I join all of Rochester in mourning her passing and extend my prayers and deepest sympathies to the entire Mitchell family Thank You mr. speaker gentleman yields back for what purpose does the gentlelady from California seek recognition

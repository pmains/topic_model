the victories that mean the most are fought for together no one thought that a group of workers and community advocates could take on the biggest corporations in texas that a young organizer could win a seat on the city council or that our big dreams and bold ideas could turn into transformational policies but we fought and we won so that everyday people could have a seat at the decision-making table so that workers can make a living wage so families could afford to stay in their home and reproductive rights could be protected together we've made real progressive change in texas but our biggest challenges are still ahead right wing officials who don't care if we freeze or get sick or if we're discriminated against they only cater to the powerful they think we can't win they're wrong i'm greg gassar and i believe that working families from bayer to hayes to comal to travis county deserve a progressive leader who will always fight and deliver for reproductive rights good jobs medicare for all and a better texas that's why i'm running for congress because this is our fight our future [Music]

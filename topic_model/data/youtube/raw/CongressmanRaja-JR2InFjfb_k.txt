form joining me right now is Illinois Congressman Raja Christian worthy a democratic member of the House intelligence and oversight and reform committees welcome sir thank you for joining me I know you just wrapped up an event so I appreciate your time with us here on this Sunday and it's because you are sir on this intelligence committee so you have a sense of the security concerns in America what do you know about this increased chatter and how concerned are you about political violence as we approach these midterms in 30 days I'm very concerned actually uh here in Chicago there's a professor named Robert Pape who has done extensive research on this very Topic at the University of Chicago and what he found was for instance uh in the hours before Donald Trump took to truth social to heavily criticize the FBI for searching for those classified documents at Mar-A-Lago the words Civil War had appeared roughly 500 times an hour which is sounds like a lot to me but after he said what he did it then soared to 6 000 times per hour peaking at 15 000 times per hour Alex and so unfortunately what he has also found is roughly 10 percent of American adults believe that political violence is an acceptable tool to bring Donald Trump back into the presidency so this is very disturbing I I'm actually trying to get my head around 500 times an hour to 15 000 times an hour that's shocking and frankly very scary um as we look now at what's happening this week with the January 6 committee next and potentially final hearing that's going to happen on Thursday here's what former 1-6 committee investigator Denver rigelman told my colleague Jonathan Cape Bart just a short time ago here it is they were marching to the tune of one drummer and that drummer was Donald Trump who really was the person who said this election was overthrown and by December 19th after his tweet we see sort of a full court press you know into January 6th do you see a link between all of these Civil War chatter increasing after Mar-A-Lago the drum beat from Donald Trump up to January 6. I mean is all of this in many ways at the feet of the former president or is there a greater force at work um I I think both um I think that Donald Trump is certainly fomenting this rhetoric of political violence uh through the words that he uses which um are really dog whistles in many cases and just in in many cases and then in other cases overt calls to uh you know basically uh for instance attacked the FBI or to go after the FBI but there's also an underlying strain unfortunately of people who believe that political violence is an acceptable tool I think we have to do three things Alex we have to first of all hold people accountable the insurrectionists uh on January 6th and those who committed crimes related to January 6. secondly we have to hold accountable anybody who uh you know basically foments this rhetoric whether they're a candidate or a current office holder we have to hold them accountable at The Ballot Box on November 8th 30 days from today and then the third and final point is I think for the rest of us we have to basically call out political violence rhetoric for what it is and say that it's completely unacceptable in our discourse whether you're a Democrat Republican or otherwise Amen to all of that let's talk about the committee which is preparing to release its final report how critical is the timing of all this ahead of the midterms I mean how much impact do you think the committee's revelations will have on the way people vote well you know I've been knocking on a lot of doors Alex and when I knock on doors I admit I meet a lot of people I also meet a lot of dogs by the way uh in this congressional district but uh with the people um really interesting is that the the topic of you know protecting and saving our democracy is among their top issues that they're concerned about along with you know reducing crime and gun violence protecting reproductive freedom fighting inflation and so forth and so uh when they think about protecting democracy and preserving it they think of January 6th uh the day that we stared into the abyss and so um they want to know uh how are we going to hold people accountable associated with January 6 and they want to absolutely run away from any notion that Donald Trump promulgates about pardoning the January 6 insurrectionist or anything of the like so this report will be really important in kind of laying the definitive wreck record as to what happened on January 6 and what are the next steps from here quickly sir as we look at the midterms there are some of the more controversial Republican house members they seem to be in safe drift districts however this one caught my eye that being the Third District of uh Colorado in which a poll shows Lauren bobert leading her opponent 47 to 45 that's within the margin of error you have another seven percent still undecided do you expect voters May finally be holding some members of Congress accountable for what could arguably be their controversial words and actions I don't know I need to pull out my crystal ball Alex uh and I need to find out how the Bears are going to do today as well but um I think that you know with regard to Lauren bobert the fact that seven percent of voters might be undecided with regard to the incumbent has to be a worrisome sign for her um all that being said um I think that um Mr Frisch and others are going to probably be campaigning on pocketbook issues um that we're all always talking about but they should also be talking about democracy and how do we preserve and protect and save our democracy how do we buttress um what you know voters want you know that I'm hearing every day which is you know just return to normalcy and not uh engage in the rhetoric that Miss bobert constantly engages in um and and talk in terms of election denial or uh relitigating 2020 or uh talking about how January 6 was ordinary political discourse that's that's stuff that voters are I find very upset about yeah absolutely Illinois Congressman Roger Christian worthy thank you so much for spending some time I know you have your track shoes on because you're going out about your business there in your District in Illinois so thank you so much

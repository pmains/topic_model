Thank You chairman basta and ranking member Brownlee for this first ever member day today and for giving me the opportunity to testify on behalf of veterans issues for my constituents in Ohio's 15th district before I talk about the priorities of Ohio's 15th district I want to recognize my three colleagues and their great ideas that they've just discussed and I urge the committee to take those issues up because all the issues discussed so far today will help our nation's veterans not just in their districts but all around the country so thank you to my colleagues for their good ideas my district includes the Chillicothe VA Medical Center in Chillicothe Ohio and through my visits with veterans there and their care providers I've been given some unique insight into their needs and moving forward Congress must urge the VA to serve as a facilitator for veterans all the way through their life cycle including transitioning between military and civilian life in that vein I want to highlight a few issues for the committee today first we face a devastating mental health crisis in this country one that has particularly affected our veteran community when veterans returned home many struggle with visible physical wounds and many also struggle with invisible wounds they suffer from wounds that are overlooked they include post-traumatic stress traumatic brain injury and depression the VA has an important role to play in disrupting the tragic link between trinit traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress drug abuse homelessness and worst of all suicide for that reason I've introduced HR 20 to 25 the veteran dog therapy Act I won't dig too deeply into it because this committee passed that bill in 2004 in the 2014 Congress I want to thank you for that I want to urge you to take that bill up again because anybody that's ever owned a pet knows that dog therapy works and we need to get more veterans access to it furthermore post-traumatic stress is forget contributor to homelessness mr. Schneider just talked about veterans homelessness and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that 39,000 471 veterans are homeless on any given night I want the committee to pay particular attention to veterans who are ineligible for the VA - program because unfortunately there are a lot of people who are ineligible because of their the way their service ended maybe they had a other than honorable discharge maybe they never served you know in they were in the reserve forces their entire career and don't have veterans status and those special populations are especially hard and we need to look at that for that reason I've introduced HR 20 to 22 the housing our military service members act this legislation to dracs to the Housing and Urban Development to direct funds towards programs that are proven to be effective at reducing homelessness for former service members of the Armed Forces and requires HUD to conduct a study on veterans who are ineligible for the HUD Vash program I urge members of this committee to consider ways the VA can serve vulnerable populations of veterans even those with dishonorable discharges that have served this country I don't want to change the characterization of their discharges I don't want to minimize what might have happened what they may have done but just because you had a dishonorable discharge does not mean you should be forced to be homeless the rest of your life and we need to serve those people they're a very vulnerable population finally the VA serves as an important conduit between veterans and hiring opportunities this committee has been all over that as an employer of veterans the VA can still improve what they've done I've introduced HR 26:48 the veterans transition improvement currently the wounded warrior federal Leave Act does not apply to veterans employed in the frontline medical positions such as doctors nurses optometrists dentists and podiatrists practicing at the VA this means they must accrue leave over the time that they seek treatment for service-connected disabilities HR 2648 would allow those veterans to access their right their leave right away in line with their counterparts in other federal agencies in conclusion as a service member or myself and a veteran I know that we have to help our veterans navigate mental health housing and employment needs when they come home and the VA is an important partner and this committee is an important partner I urged the members of this committee to address those issues and hopefully we can work collaboratively to make our veteran community stronger and serve our veterans thank you for this opportunity appreciate your your day and I'm sorry I went way over I yield back

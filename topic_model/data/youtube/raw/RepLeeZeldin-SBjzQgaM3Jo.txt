mr. mr. Zeldin of New York well thank you mr. chairman I don't know if one of the the gentleman who said this isn't a ransom and that we owed the money would be interested in answering his question says who for decades for decades this was a disputed claim I know why and I know us to know about our counterclaims so when did we when did we first admit that this money was owed and that they deny us anything I don't think we've ever said that they don't owe us anything and there have been work that we've done on whether hostages on whether the hosel was taken at the Embassy have the right to sue the Iranian government what do they arrive but there's no dispute that four hundred million dollars of the Shahs money's was sitting in a ender American control since the 1970s and in fact most of the calculations I've seen would indicate that we've paying less interest that could have been earned in other investments so I know side notes that go from 400 million to 1.1 billion sounds like reclaiming my time the rate of return on that is yet a few things there so first off we received money from the Iranians for a purchase that they cancelled so we were spending a lot of money to build pre serious weapon systems that they cancelled further me with the gentleman it was a lot of let me just use my point it's my time then believe we cancelled then in February of 1979 it was restructured the debt that they were owed then they take our embassy and 15 days after they take our embassy the Iranians say that they do not owe any foreign obligations to anyone then for decades for decades we dispute this claim while having our own counterclaim so they asked for four hundred dollars we're asking for eight hundred and seventeen million dollars in the counterclaim because they were supposed to protect the weapon systems that we had given them in addition to that there was four hundred million dollars of claims of United States citizens in US courts against Iran judgments against the Iranians that were subrogated as part of that 400 million so we have a disputed claim for decades with regards to what Iran we're asking for the United States but the same exact time we're asking for 870 million dollars because they failed to protect the weapon systems they took our embassy they said that they didn't know when horn obligations they owe four hundred million dollars to the United States for claims of United States citizens so we put everything on balance comes back to the question why is the net that we owe them 400 million US citizens I believe have collected two and a half billion dollars in settlements from Iran I support efforts for more to be paid and you can say that there was a tactical advantage in the various lawsuits and claims for us to continue to hold Iran's money but this if you look at this money in isolation it's my understanding that we cancelled the contract and if we hadn't we should because the weapons that we had agreed to give the Shah should never have been in the hands of the supreme leader who took over afterwards actually the timeline is that the Iranians fell behind in their payments and in February of 1979 the entire deal was restructured but again so the whole thing that causes issue was in the Iranians falling behind in their payments but again you have four hundred million dollars singing and accounts to pay claims yeah for normally in dollars singing account the Iranians have claims against United States the United States has claims against the wrong both sides are disputing it I'm so what happened with our 817 million-dollar claim against the Iranians I believe that is is still pending and in whether it's Iran or any of our a payout State Department uniformly opposes the suits against sovereign and that is it if we look at this issue by itself but we first if we didn't we can't look at the money was going to say that you can never settle anything until you sell four hundred million dollars that was sitting in that account was not not there for one claim that four hundred million dollars was not sitting in that account to settle one claimed it was to pay claims and for the tribunal so yes the Iranians had claims against the United States but also the United States had claims against the audience part of that had to do with subrogated names of hundreds of millions of dollars four hundred million actually that the Iranians owed the United States I yield back the balance of my time it was a gentleman isolation

first time jimmy yells back miss fudge five minutes thank you very much mr chairman and i thank you both for being here uh certainly i really very much appreciate the discussion you were having about veterans and just want to bring to your attention that today at noon there is going to be a briefing in canon 340 about veteran food insecurity so if anyone sitting here today would like to attend certainly it is open to you let me just say that i thank the witnesses for the work they do i thank you very much for how dedicated you are to eradicating hunger and please do understand that what i am about to say does not have anything to do with you is not directed to you or any other person who has testified about snap or food insecurity this is our 10th hearing 10 on snap or food insecurity it has in fact become an exercise in futility it is a waste of our time if we are not going to do something about it we can talk and talk and talk i have no idea what the outcome is or what we're even looking to do what i do know is that hunger is not a game it is not something that we play with it is life and death for far too many americans we know the statistics we have the data we know the problem i don't know why we keep asking you we know the problem we know about hungry veterans we know about hungry seniors and hungry kids when are we going to stop talking and do something we can talk forever and never change one person's life so the next hearing i want to go to about snap is how we're going to make it better i want hearing more this enough let's do what the american people sent us here to do we need to take care of our poor we need to take care of our children we need to take care of our veterans it is time to stop talking i yield back thanks

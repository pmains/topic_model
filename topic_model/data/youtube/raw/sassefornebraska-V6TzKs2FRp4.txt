[Applause] that's it the way to cure the incredible ineffectiveness and dysfunction of both parties in Washington we move the capital to Nebraska where they can experience family conservative values living within a budget and pulling together not pulling apart my name is Ben Sasse moving the u.s. capital to Nebraska is the end of the story let's start at the beginning I was blessed to be born in Plainview and raised right here in Fremont I actually grew up in that house right there and every morning in the summer at 5:00 a.m. I'd ride my bike to Ronan Parke that's where the detasseling bus picked up and we'd head out to the fields the pastor preached the word here every Sunday morning still does I dreamed a plan for the Huskers and got into Memorial Stadium by selling pop at home games I played sports there at Fremont junior high I was bummed that t/o never called with a football scholarship but mom was at least glad I got recruited to wrestle at Harvard [Music] so now the small-town conservative Nebraska kid gets a fancy education and joins a firm that turns around failing companies but then I tried turning around the biggest failing organization of all the US government I serve President Bush as Assistant Secretary of Health and I saw firsthand what a messed up ego-driven place Washington really is and I learned how little an assistant secretary anything could fix after that I needed to get back home to Nebraska Midland University was going bankrupt and asked me to become president turn it around Melissa and I jumped at the chance me now I'm never leaving if we're doing something that's difficult and we come and complain to our dad he'll simply tell us builds character yeah and if we wanted a self-propelled mower but our dad would never get one of the builds character he says so that's pretty much his motto our Nebraska team turned Midland around balanced budgets fastest-growing school in the Midwest new sports teams record enrollment so what is this have to do with America with moving the capital from DC to the plains the problem is they're all wrong both parties last time Republicans were in charge we spent through the roof then President Obama came in and blew the doors off the greatest country on Earth is slipping away becoming a socialist mess like Europe the problem with the Republican establishment isn't that they're bad folks it's that most of them don't get that we're losing our country they just don't worry about the nation's decline like you and I do look Obama care is arguably the worst law in our history but it's been four years since it was passed and Republicans still haven't offered an alternative of course we need to repeal it but we also need to tell people what we'll do next we need to show Americans were the party of conservative solutions that's the only way we win I'm one of the few itseems who read and studied Obama cares 2,300 pages and then I hit the road crusading against it it's worse than you think we've let it get this way I can't find anyone else who will tell us the blunt truth that's why I'm running and it seems that experience turning around broken institutions is exactly what's needed right now so let's move the capital to Nebraska and leave the lobbyists and the influence peddlers back east we can force Nebraska's conservative values decency and common sense into that building can the others in this race do that I don't think so I wouldn't run their establishment and it's the establishment that's the problem this election must be about saving our country from the establishment dismantling Obama's failed socialist policies and disrupting the current system where the first priority of every politician is just to keep their own job then we can fight the real conservative battles protecting our values traditional marriage right to life the Second Amendment stopping the rampant borrowing and spending even taking on the Supreme Court if that's what it takes we have to choose the strongest most conservative Nebraska voice to send to Washington if you think an establishment insider is going to fix that place then I'm not your guy but if you want someone who knows the true meaning of We the People then I'd sure appreciate your support [Music]

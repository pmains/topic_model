half a million people who started looking for work again freshman Republican congressman Bill heisting of Michigan is on the Financial Services Committee and he joins me now congressman thanks so much for being on the program hey my pleasure thanks Luke let's get your initial reaction to the job number eight point three percent unemployment it's the fifth straight month of declining unemployment third straight month over 200,000 jobs added we just had Mark Zandi on who is a con amidst from the cane campaign he said that this is evidence that the stimulus is working you see this as part of the stimulus working or is this have nothing to do with Washington a couple of things and I'm not as convinced that it's because of Washington rather despite Washington that we've seen a lot of this and it states like mine back in Michigan with Governor Snyder who have really changed the atmosphere there and certainly my family's actually in construction I'm a small business owner dealing with ready mix concrete and sand and gravel and we've seen a slight uptick but I'm telling you Luke that that cliff that we went off back a few years ago is dramatic so it's going to take some time to come back on that and if you dig into the numbers there's another line that the Department of Labor releases which are those people that have either that voluntarily remove themselves from that search or are underemployed and we still see that as way too high that's more like thirteen fourteen fifteen percent rather than this eight percent so it's it's positive it's good steps forward but certainly not enough yet Congress had I would say somewhat of a bipartisan victory yesterday at least in the house that you guys passed down jobs bill albeit on a smaller scale but if you see numbers such as this you know eight point three percent it seems to be moving in the right direction you've obviously been an outspoken critic of the president would this perhaps inspire you guys you think in the house to try to come together and more bipartisan way zorz are we looking what happened yesterday is a one and done deal simply to try and change the narrative that as Eric Cantor said yesterday you guys needed a win well I hope it's not a one and done because frankly I'm not here for my party or Eric Cantor I'm not here for the President or his party I'm here for the people of the second District of Michigan and the American people and we put a tremendous number of things on the table everything from what we believe are positive energy exploration ideas and keystone and others to smaller things like this coming out of financial services and you know quite honestly this is the Republican idea the Republican plan we're seeing the holdup really in the Senate so now I think this was positive yesterday some some smaller steps but we need those small steps because there's no magic bullet I want to talk to you a little bit about the transportation bill this is something that has sort of ping-pong between the House and Senate on Capitol Hill listen to Harry Reid and John Boehner yesterday we've had enough of this the American people have had enough of this so I hope the speaker will spare the American people yet another unnecessary battle and passed the sentence bipartisan transportation jobs bill without the way we're going to continue to have conversations with members about about a longer term approach which frankly most of our members month but at this point in time the plan is to bring up the Senate bill you remember of the House GOP caucus as you know there's been a lot of disagreement about the size and scope of the legislation there do you think that you is a house GOP member if you're opposed opposed to the speaker's bill are you guys risking not having your imprint on this legislation by having so much infighting Speaker Boehner it was that a threat from him do you feel I don't feel it was a threat but I can tell you there's a lot of us that are trying to get to yes on this we think that once again the Senate sort of has a very narrow short view we'd rather see a longer term solution to this but I think ultimately the American people are looking at it and saying hey guys we've got to start spending money differently one spend less to spend it smarter and that I think is what people are really looking for I for me personally I would like to see more of that decision-making back at the state level to to ensure that those projects that are moving forward have the support of the local local governments and local businesses as you know that the transportation bill is not passed by mar 31st the federal government would not be able to collect the federal gas tax on gasoline and diesel would that be good for the federal government not to be able to collect that tax well certainly we've got to have this system isn't going to just be able to fall off the cliff like that so what we have to see is a transition a ramp down and a different way of doing it so I don't think that that's actually going to happen I think you're going to see something passed that's going to ensure that we don't have that happen because there are legitimate national needs for that whether it's our harbors whether it's interstate transportation via the highways and those kinds of things what people are looking for us making sure that there's no more bridges to nowhere no more beehive museums jammed into a transportation bill and those are the types of things that we need to make sure our do you support the federal gas tax oh sure I think there's a portion of it but here's the question how do we how do we deal with it and how do we collect it my preference would be to have it collected at the state level and that instead of it all of it getting shipped back to Washington DC where we have to have this battle that's whether it's been it's gone up from the the high 80s 88 cents to 90 cents 292 sense to ninety-four cents and we call those victories somehow rather than having all that power reside in Washington DC I would rather have it stay in the states and then have the state send a portion to Washington a penny or two or whatever that might be too then really truly work on those national initiatives that should be there and are there its constitutional that we have the the federal government involved in making sure that we're promoting interstate and intrastate trade bill Huizenga for Michigan we thank you so much for joining us this morning take care I appreciate a little treat how will Wall Street react to the new jobs numbers the MA

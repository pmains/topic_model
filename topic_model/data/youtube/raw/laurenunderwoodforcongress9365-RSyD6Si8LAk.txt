- She's fresh, she's smart, she's determined, and she speaks for so many people who've been waiting on the sidelines and now wanna get involved and make a different in this country. And she's the right
person in this district for a lotta reason,
not the least of which, is her own background in healthcare, on a personal basis and
a professional basis. And the fact that the
incumbent congressman has gone lockstep through
everyone one of these votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That is the driving
issue in this election. The people in Oswego and Kendall county and the six or seven other
counties in this district wanna know where you stand when it comes to the cost,
affordability, and availability of healthcare for them and their families. That is the driving issue. Other things are important, it is the number one issue. So we gotta make sure we
continue to deliver that message. We couldn't have a better messenger, we couldn't have a better candidate than the next congressman
from this district, Lauren Underwood. Take it away, Lauren! (audience cheers) - Good afternoon everyone! (audience applause) I'm so glad to be here with you. I'm Lauren Underwood, running for Congress here in the Illinois 14th district. I wanna first start off, in thanking our senator, Senator Durbin for coming here to Oswego and not just the community, he came to the neighborhood. He came where we will win this seat. It is in communities just like this, by knocking doors and
engaging with our neighbors all across these seven
counties in our community. We have rural, exurban, suburban, all coming together to form this wonderful opportunity
we have here in the 14th, and no community is too small, no community will be overlooked. We're gonna be on the doors, making the calls,
connecting with everyone. Because that's how you win.

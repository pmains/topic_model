Thank You mr. speaker today the House voted to end taxpayer support for abortion a majority of Americans believe abortion is wrong and they do not wish to see their tax dollars pay for this gruesome procedure that ends the life of another human being this legislation permanently puts into law a long-standing policy that has been renewed by Congress every year and it will reassure Americans that the hard-earned money they pay to the government will never be used to fund abortion this is necessary because the affordable care act a law that has been unaffordable for so many Americans actually paid subsidies for healthcare plans that include abortion this is unacceptable a child and a mother's womb is a blessing and Americans expect their tax dollars will never be used to pay to end the life of an innocent child today's legislation will protect taxpayers and most importantly our society's most vulnerable the unborn I yield back

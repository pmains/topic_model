i hope you're taking good care of yourselves my name is lauren underwood and i'm a registered nurse and public health expert it's my honor to represent illinois 14th district in congress i ran for congress in 2018 because i knew it was time to step forward and fight for my community's values and today i'm the youngest black woman ever elected to congress my generation and the next will not stand idly by while our fundamental american values are under attack we will lead the way to a more perfect union i grew up in naperville and let me tell you northern illinois communities are tight-knit when someone in our neighborhood faces an illness we deliver a meal train when our neighbor goes out of town for the week we grab their mail we may differ in our political beliefs but our neighbor is not our enemy those are northern illinois values this summer i saw my predominantly white community embrace the cause of equality and justice high school students led marches and rallies across our community they stated unequivocally that black lives matter those my friends are northern illinois values today our country is facing an unprecedented health crisis for people of color the coronavirus pandemic has only underscored what we've long known to be true black and latinx americans are three times more likely to be diagnosed with covid and twice as likely to die from the virus as compared to white americans the coronavirus pandemic in the navajo nation led to more deaths per capita than any other state harassment and hate crimes against asian americans are surging the disparities laid bare by the coronavirus are a symptom of another insidious and deadly threat to public health systemic racism as a nurse as a black woman and as a member of congress i am here to say that this is unacceptable three months into my first term in congress i partnered with my colleague from north carolina alma adams to establish the black maternal health caucus i'm committed to leveraging my health care expertise to save mom's lives in illinois women who look like me are six times more likely to die from a pregnancy related condition as white women the majority of those deaths are preventable and that disparity is not a reflection of race or education black women with college degrees are more likely to die of a pregnancy-related condition than a white woman who didn't complete high school the truth is these maternal outcomes are another horrifying manifestation of systemic racism we cannot normalize these deaths of moms which early data shows are growing as a result of the pandemic i'm here to say we can solve these issues and we can save lives the single most effective thing that we can do to save moms lives is ensure that all americans have access to high quality affordable health care and let's be clear democrats are fighting for health care we're fighting to save moms lives and i'm proud to say that our future vice president and my fellow black maternal health caucus member senator kamala harris has been with us every step of the way in 2020 in the united states of america moms should not die in childbirth our communities of color should not rank on the global list of coronavirus epicenters we can do better and i believe we will do better when we have joe biden and kamala harris in the white house my friends let us march on till victory is won thank you

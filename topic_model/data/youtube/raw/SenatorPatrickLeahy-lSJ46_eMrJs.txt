i want to join others who thank you for the extraordinary service you you both shown to this country you you came to your role at a very challenging times admiral mullen i appreciate also the personal relationship and your your trip to vermont you and mrs ballen when you joined marcel and myself up there to uh meet with our troops when they were deploying secretary gates i've told you before what i'll say here publicly i've enjoyed our friendship of must be about 30 years now and i i sat down by saying there's one issue we do not agree on that's the war in afghanistan i think like most americans certainly most vermonters i talk with an increasing number of members of congress i think we have to dramatically accelerate our withdrawal troops from that country i supported going into afghanistan for the purpose of getting osama bin laden after 9 11 and the subcommittee and and all of us here on the appropriations committee have been strongly supportive of that but i did not support the invasion of iraq which distracted us from that goal iraq had nothing to do with 9 11 we're paying for this cost for years to come we borrowed the money to go into that war as some extraordinary thing in a war to borrow the money and continue to borrow the money same time we gave a tax cut for anybody who makes as much as a member of congress so what we said was we'll let our children our grandchildren pay for these two wars i don't think we can continue to sacrifice so many lives and spending billions of dollars a week in a war with no end i think we have to identify achievable goals in afghanistan i think we have to reduce our military footprint there and then we look at pakistan just this morning we see word that our putative ally arrested five people on the suspicion that they helped the united states to get osama bin laden after publicly saying of course they wanted us to get osama bin laden they arrested people who helped us get him now we could overlook the problems probably in pakistan if afghan government any better but we have president karzai who can't seem to make up his mind if he's on our side of the taliban we support them with tax dollars but at the same time we say we've got to privatize medicare eviscerate education funding shred social safety net here in this country stop all the money that we might have to make our industries more competitive uh it's not a christian our military who's ex and i've visited there they're they're performing extraordinarily well and they're very difficult things but how long how long do we support governments that lie to us when do we say enough is enough secretary gates i'll start with you well first of all i would say based on 27 years in cia and four and a half years in this job most governments lie to each other that's the way business gets done do they alter arrest and we ought to arrest the people that help us sometimes when they say they're allies sometimes and sometimes they send people to spy on us and they're our close allies so and we give you the real world that we deal with but i would tell you this uh first of all this is not a world a war without end the lisbon summit has made clear that the transfer to afghan security responsibility and leadership will be complete not later than the end of 2014 troops will be coming down during that period the cost of these wars is coming down dramatically the cost of these wars will drop between 11 fy 11 and 12 by 40 billion dollars and between 12 and 13 probably by several tens of billions of dollars more and i ask the question first of all i think the prospects of having a more stable afghanistan in terms of a country that can defend itself i'm not talking about a vermont democracy here but a country that can defend neither am i mr secretary and you know that i know but what i'm talking about is we are not in the business of nation building what we are trying to do is build the afghan national security forces to the point where they have the ability to defend that country and so that the taliban and al qaeda cannot reconstitute themselves in that country and i think we are making considerable headway in that respect so i think that i know people are frustrated the country's been a war for 10 years i know people are tired but people also have to think in terms of stability and in terms of the potential for reconstitution what's the cost of failure do you want to add to that admin what i would talk about uh i think in this center and you know i've talked about this many times is pakistan and we are uh in the midst and have been of trying to in the middle of this war with uh threats that they have in their territory trying to build a relationship uh that was badly broken when we left the last time when we terminated our relationship with them uh in the in the late 80s and early 90s and and we are back and it's actually my belief that if we if we were to do that again it may not be five years or ten years but we'll be back in a much more difficult situation and so seeking to to support stability in that part of the world uh to the degree that these two countries can evolve uh is i think uh a goal that uh we must continue to pursue or uh the danger associated with a country that's got a nuclear arsenal uh that is uh an exit that lives next to a country that that they view as an existential threat it's just a matter of time before we're back so i don't i don't push back on the challenge associated with it some of the criticism is more than warranted nobody's worked that harder than me very frankly with the leadership uh and uh it's a it's a conscious decision i think that we have to make and if we walk away from it it's my view it'll be a much more dangerous place a decade from now and we'll be back

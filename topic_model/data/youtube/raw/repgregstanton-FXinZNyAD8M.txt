very much madam chair it's been 18 years since this committee last had a hearing on tribal transportation needs it is long overdue so I want to thank you so much for holding the hearing granting the request of congressman Davidson I that we have a hearing focus on tribal infrastructure and transportation needs it's important that we hear directly from tribal leaders on their needs and priorities for reauthorization of the surface transportation bill transportation infrastructure is critical for our tribal communities including the 22 tribal nations in my state of Arizona a modern transportation network that fosters economic opportunity helps tribal members reach their jobs AIDS emergency personnel connects vast distances between tribal communities and transports children to and from school the transportation infrastructure needs of our tribal nations are great many of the roads and bridges are a barrier to greater economic opportunities at our tribal communities because they need significant improvement or repair this past summer I had the opportunity to visit the Navajo Nation and see firsthand the significant transportation infrastructure challenges the nation is facing the Navajo Nation has more than 11,000 200 miles of roads over 27,000 square miles making the nation first out of all BIA BIA regions for road miles the vast majority of these roads 86% are unpaved unpaved roads create numerous challenges especially in adverse weather conditions for members of the Navajo Nation whether getting to school or work racks accessing critical services like health care at current funding levels the nation estimates it would take approximately a hundred and sixteen years and seven point nine billion dollars to meet their current transportation infrastructure needs let me repeat that a hundred and sixteen years that's unacceptable to everyone here like the Navajo Nation the Salt River pima-maricopa Indian community is also experiencing significant infrastructure challenges years ago the community was on the outer edges of Phoenix but now it is bordered by our rapidly growing community's impact impacting traffic throughout Salt River hundreds of thousands of vehicles travel through the Salt River community each day placing great strain on the tribes ability to maintain and keep these roads safe the federal government has a trust responsibility to tribal nations which includes providing the resources necessary to ensure the transportation needs in native a communities are addressed yet despite this trust responsibility Salt River receives only a tiny fraction of the federal funds it needs for maintenance and construction while the fast act took important steps to help address the significant transportation needs and disparities and tribal communities across the country more work must be done we have an opportunity in the upcoming reauthorization bill to build on the progress and the fast Act and make sure tribes do receive the resources needed to address these urgent needs madam chair I asked unanimous consent to include in the record letters from the inner tribal Association of Arizona the Navajo Nation solver rapini Indian community and the Gila River Indian community into the record to discuss in more detail their individual needs so ordered these letters highlight the transportation infrastructure challenges and priorities of the tribes in Arizona for reauthorization one of the recommendations I have heard from tribes in Arizona and others across the country is the need for an office of self-governance at the Department of Transportation to oversee and implement the tribal transportation self-governance program mr. Garcia you addressed this earlier I made the same question then for miss Clark I wanted you to opportunity address this issue you mentioned the importance of establishing an office of self-governance within a department transportation I couldn't agree more in the proposed rule for tribal transportation self-governance program the Department stated that it does not foreclose the possibility of establishing an office of self-governance at the department at some point in the future the Department stated also believes that a tribal self-governance advisory committee may provide important information to the department as it implements the program miss Clark could you explain why establishing an office of self-governance and a tribal Advisory Committee are so important to the tribes for this new program yes it is important to the program's because it's establishing a new self-governance way of working with tribes directly with the USDOT in tribes and if half of those just all of a sudden when the June comes and wants to enter into a contract then USDOT needs to be off and running and right now it's not and so that would be very helpful and the advisory could help guide the self-governance they come at a time but I will be submitting a question as it relates to funding challenges at our tribal nations face that may not be directly proportional to what state city and counties face as relates to matching funds for federal programs and I'd like to get an answer on the record for that thank you very much I yield back

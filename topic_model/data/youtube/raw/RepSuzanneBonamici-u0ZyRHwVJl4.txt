Thank You miss Bonamici you recognized for five minutes Thank You chair caster thank you to all of our witnesses we know that the climate crisis will disproportionately affect the health and well-being of low-income communities people of color children and older adults we have a responsibility to take action to address that I'm miss mccarthy during your tenure at the Environmental Protection Agency the social cost of carbon was a foundation of important environmental regulations including the clean power plan we had many conversations about that in the Science Space and Technology Committee over the years the social cost of carbon has been used to express the dollar value or cost of climate damage caused by one ton of carbon dioxide in it actually to reflects the socio-economic and ecosystem damages from emissions and helps us translate through the long-term consequences into present value unfortunately in 2017 president Trump signed an executive order disbanding the interagency working group on the social cost of carbon I'm concerned that the absence of that analysis is being used to justify a rationalized harmful and regulatory decisions and I know the Natural Resources Defense Council released a report titled bitter pill the high health costs of climate change and that report recommended examining how the social cost of carbon could be updated so beyond reinstating the interagency working group how should Congress incentivize the reinstatement of an accurate social cost of carbon and how can we support federal agencies and better quantifying the health damages in a renewed social cost of carbon analysis well thank first of all thank you for the question we all know that the challenge of federal agencies is to look at all of the costs and benefits of the actions that it takes clearly the social cost of carbon was established to allow us to understand the full breadth of consequences of the carbon emissions that are fueling climate change and how we can reduce those and account for those in decision-making in your right this administration is is just has decided to move away from looking at the full cost but I would also caution you to think about they're fundamentally stop looking at climate change period not just the the full breadth of social consequences with our changing climate and to me that is like a bank statement we only look at you know deposits and not withdrawals and I think that it's it's we need to go back and take a look at this I do know that people outside of the government continue to look at updates on the social cost of carbon because I think we seriously underestimated those costs and so we I think there will be many people fully prepared to both challenge rules that don't consider climate change every step of the way including actions and accounting for the broad social cost thank god I see is one of those right I appreciate the panel today helping to highlight that that issue I want to get to mr. Rodriguez quickly your testimony you shared those powerful stories thank you so much of the the farm workers who felt pressure to keep working in harmful conditions and as a member of the education and Labor Committee I'm certainly pleased to support congresswoman choose bill to adopt a final standard on the Prevention of occupational exposure to excessive heat what additional steps can Congress take to safeguard outdoor workers from heat related illnesses and death and provide workers with appropriate remedies in the in the event their rights are violated for B yes okay sorry well thank you again for the question you know congresswoman Judy Chu my understanding at least has already introduced legislation here in Congress right I'm proud to co-sponsor that yeah Oh fantastic so you know we're very hopeful that really that there's gonna be support for that legislation and I was mentioning earlier that in negotiations this past year around the immigration bill for farmworkers h HB 50:38 we were actually there sitting down with the agricultural industry with the leaders throughout the nation and we discussed this particular issue with him and I think all of them voluntarily agreed that this is an issue that we don't have to really look further than what's already transpired and what's taking place and we included that actually in the legislation so we we're of the mind that the agricultural indices really recognized the importance of this and we should all come together at this particular point with congresswoman Judy and your bill and to be able to really pass that legislation and I hope so I represent a district in Oregon your neighbor to the north from California and I know how important our agriculture community is and the workers absolutely need to have that protection one more quick question for mrs. McCarthy harmful algal blooms you mentioned we know that's a problem across the country coastal communities as well as great lakes rivers streams the EPA lacks an authorization or adequate appropriations to respond to that so what resources does the EPA need to adequately respond to the health threats posed by algal blooms particularly in terms of access to safe and clean drinking water it needs a couple of things one is it needs resources to be able to continue to track and make these harmful algal blooms better visible to people so transparency is going to be important but we do the EPA does have some authority here unfortunately the the waters of the US are that's not what it's called anymore but anyways whatever was just finalized which looks at what waters are protected it really has cut the legs out of the ability to be able to look at at some of the waters and streams and wetlands that are important to protect that would eliminate some of the sources of contamination that are causing harmful algal blooms and let's just very quickly remind ourselves that this isn't just about keeping water swimmable and fishable this is directly about drinking water those harmful algal blooms created the cyano toxins that shut down an entire city of toledo for a four-day stretch and and we need to remind ourselves that the these are issues that are bad for our economies but fundamentally threaten our drinking why they did I see my time is long expired I yield back my apologies thank you

mr. president I did a mathematical calculation a couple of years ago and it resulted in some in an interesting conclusion the Senate is a rural body 18 members of the United States Senate represent a majority of Americans that means eighty two percent or eighty two out of a hundred senators represent smaller states more rural communities and I want to talk today about a disastrous development that is headed for our rural communities that we have the capability to fix and is one that we should sooner rather than later I'm talking about federal funding for federally qualified health centers which expired on October 1st 70% of the funding for the FQHCs expired on October 1st 100% of the National Health Service Corps funding expired on October 1st these are vital programs that serve rural America and provide incredibly important health care services they're an overlooked part of our national health care system in part because they are traditionally in rural and Outback locations in Maine we have 20 centers we have 20 centers and 70 facilities scattered all over our state and they are providing services every day to over 200,000 people this is a vital part of our health care system and yet the funding expired at the end of September and so far nothing has been done how important is it 1,700 employees at these facilities a local economic effect of over 300 million dollars a year eight million dollars in state and local tax revenues thirty two million dollars in federal tax revenues they provide 16 million dollars worth of uncompensated care that goes to Maine people who need the help they're efficient they've saved Medicaid over hundred million dollars in Maine 257 million dollars is the estimate for what they have saved the overall health care system again 1700 jobs a thousand more jobs located in their communities but this isn't only about economics and economic development and jobs it's about health care one in six people in Maine get their health care from FQHCs two hundred and ten thousand people they accept everybody that comes in the door I've been to them all over the state they use a sliding fee scale for people that are low income who don't have insurance and they provide all manner of services they have it depends on the center different different centers have different services they have medical behavioral health dental substance abuse treatment and support case management optometry podiatry ob/gyn prescription assistance outreach and enrollment pharmacy radiology school-based health care services these are the healthcare providers for rural America and it's not only man it's across the country ten thousand sites across the United States twenty-six million patients at risk well what's the big deal the big deal is people are going to lose their health care services we estimate that in Maine we're going to lose about 400 clinicians administrative and support staff will have to be laid off at the beginning of the year unless we solve this problem in the immediate future at least 25 of these sites will be forced to close and we believe that there will be almost 30,000 Maine residents who will lose their access to their health care system most of the health care FQHCs a federally qualified health centers are getting by on their funding from last year so the the shortfall of the of the expiration of the fund hasn't hit them yet but it will begin to hit them on January 1st and that's what we have to respond to it also is already having an effect just by creating uncertainty I got a impassioned letter from the leader of one of our centers in Maine about the fact that they had been very diligently recruiting a dentist to come to their community dentists are very hard to come by in rural America they had one that was ready to come and then suddenly they heard about the the uncertainty surrounding the funding and it may or may not come through and that dentist is now reconsidering their decision to come to this Maine community that's a tragedy that's a tragedy for the people of that town where these services are literally not available so what does it matter it matters because we're talking about people losing their healthcare services this has never been a partisan issue I don't think there's a heck of a lot of debate around here about the importance of FQHCs and that we need to get them refunded in fact the presiding officer and Senator Stabenow have sponsored a bill the chyme Act that would resolve this issue we just need to get it on the floor and get it done we proved today by the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act that we can take major issues bring them to the floor and move them forward especially those that aren't particularly controversial but my concern is even though there doesn't seem to be controversy it's just not happening and now our centers are having to make plans for layoffs for closures and for closing their doors to the people that need the care this is something we can do mr. president this is something that we can resolve it's within our power all the the the legislation is ready to go and we should get this done if we we're leaving today for the Thanksgiving holiday but if we leave at the end of the year and haven't done this it will be a tragedy for rural America will be a betrayal of rural America it will be a betrayal of our constituents and all of us have been to these centers and seen the care that they provide the caring that they provide the passion that the people bring to the services in their communities and how much they mean to their communities this is one of the best federal programs ever created and it's always been supported on a bipartisan basis and so I urge my colleagues today to prepare ourselves to get this done as soon as we possibly can when we get back after Thanksgiving we have so much to be thankful for and I want my people in Maine to realize that they can be thankful for those health centers that make so much that are literally a lifeline in their communities that mean so much to them and I believe this is something we can and should and will do Thank You mr. president and thank you for being a leader on this issue and with that I will yield the floor and suggest the absence of a core

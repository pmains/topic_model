a long time ago when when i was a congressman actually i remember having people from other states complain to me that getting through delaware on a lot of weekends a lot of friday afternoons especially in the summer a lot of holiday weekends was a disaster and they complained bitterly about having to wait in line for 5 10 15 20 even 30 minutes when i became governor i said boy i sure wish there's something we could do about this and what we did is we introduced easy pass so that people who didn't want to stop and go through toll booths to have to you know pay money and get changed could have an easy easy pass tag on their car and go through not at highway speed but you know at five or ten miles an hour and avoid some of the hassle it helped but as traffic volumes built over time and we have anywhere from 110 to 140 000 vehicles that go through the toll plazas between delaware and uh and maryland and uh but he still get we got huge backups and back at certain time i was governor i started working on this and when i got to the uh the senate worked on it some more finally we're able to to get some money from the stimulus package that we enacted two years ago and with that money we invested about 30 million dollars to move the to modernize the plaza to go to highway speed ez pass two lanes each way and to be able to increase the number of uh non-highway speeds he passed a toll booth so yeah the idea would be to expedite the movement of traffic having worked on this result language is thrilled to be able to work with the federal uh government uh to work with the administration the obama administration to work with my colleagues in the delegation chris coons and john carney tim ted kaufman before that and to work with the governor jack mccall and our friends at delda it was a great team effort and there's going to be a lot of winners no losers on this one we created the stimulus fund a couple of years ago really to help get the economy moving again at the depths of this terrible recession that we were in and the idea behind highway speed easy passes the idea behind creating those jobs with about 300 jobs were created for over a period of about a year this construction project the idea wasn't just create make work jobs the idea was to say we want to create jobs that serve a good public purpose aside from providing employment opportunities for those 300 people for that year and among the public purposes that are served now at the toll plaza this new construction this new project now completed is one we don't have people sitting there for 5 10 15 20 30 minutes wasting their time to pay us money to go through our state so in terms of saving time for people there's a lot of that that will happen second we're not wasting the kind of fuel that we did before a lot of that fuel almost two-thirds of it comes from overseas and we end up sending our hard-earned money to a lot of unstable undemocratic nations around the world money which when we buy their oil they use that money in some cases to try to hurt us not very smart third thing that flows from this is we clean up our air we don't have diesel trucks sitting there forever putting out emissions that blow into our state and file the air we don't have cars or vans or trucks doing that either the last thing that's uh that flows from this is public safety we don't have a lot of cars darting in and out trying to get from one lane to the other which is shorter which can i get through more quickly trying to get in front of somebody else uh on the fourth of july our weekend the governor and i were there uh friday before the weekend to kick it off and the the hot cars were moving both ways north south no backups that was on friday morning friday afternoon new traffic got heavy no backups saturday all day saturday no backups sunday no backups monday fourth of july no backups it was a thing of beauty

we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw all right welcome back everybody i wanted to have on lila rose uh she's the founder of live action uh she's a pretty incredible activist when it comes to the pro-life issue boy i'm just going to read a little bit of her biography as i introduce her it it really is impressive she's really become the face i think of of the pro-life movement and um she started back when she was 15. after she discovered a book several years earlier with photos of children who had been killed by abortion and she made her life mission to really inform other young people about what what this practice really is and what it really does uh she founded live action in um i want to say 2006 but let's just uh have her speak and she can answer that question for me lila thanks so much for being on thanks for having me dan so when did you form live action sure well it depends what we mean by it but i started as a teenager so 2006 and then we were officially incorporated in 2009 so we were kind of a local youth education group in san jose california and then when i was at college at ucla that's when i got some legal assistance and we became officially a 501c3 okay when did you really take off i mean um had you or me you know granted i've really only been super involved in politics since i ran for politics um but it does seem to me like like live action and and you as a real real strong figurehead for this movement really took off in the last few years yeah so i think the first sort of ignition point was when i started doing investigative reporting of abortion facilities so as you've seen yourself firsthand most media groups are really biased and they're in on the abortion issue they're really pro-abortion so when i was actually a college student that's when i started doing undercover investigative reporting of abortion facilities in los angeles and actually of my school's health administration and then that sort of gave me my first national exposure i started doing you know some national tv interviews about my investigative findings i exposed abortion facilities covering up child sexual abuse of little girls i mean this is one of the many um horrible aspects of the abortion industry it obviously kills babies but it also harms women and is very dishonest and corrupt so that was the first onset and then over the last 10 years you know we've just grown and grown and live action is now the leading the digital leader for the global human rights movement of the pro-life movement so we've been i think really growing we've basically doubled in size in the last two years so i think i think that's a good impression that you have that we've really there's been yet another big ignition point for us in just the last few years with our influence and and really our you know the reach that we have with our content yeah and i like the the angle that you take it's about love it's about life um it's about putting young women in front as the spokesperson for for this movement which obviously makes a lot more sense i mean look i i don't i don't give in to this notion that men can't talk about this i think that's nonsense um but that but you also have to acknowledge that it needs the message does need to come from somebody like you and um by somebody like me you i just mean like a young woman um you know i i'm always i'm always telling the second amendment movement uh you need to learn from lila rose this is this is how you be an activist right it's about optimism and positivity and empowerment and like empowering young women to make the right decisions and this the reason i say the second amendment community specifically is because um i don't want to make this isn't a gun conversation but the point is is that like you know a young woman might need to defend herself and this is about empowerment and the last thing you need if you're going to persuade uh voters is for a bunch of guys basically in in call of duty outfits like marching around talking about tyranny you know it's just like like hey guys like i get it i'm with you but a terrible way to make your point and you saw this and frankly you saw that that evolution in in the pro-life movement as well where it did used to be a little dark and gloomy i think and a little bit angry yeah that's just not what you see from the march for life anymore it's like a really high energy optimistic fun young group of people yeah and that is i mean it's cool because that is the movement i mean we have we have over 5 million combined people following our our content just on a daily basis and then we do a reach beyond that but they're mostly young women i mean that's what's really cool about our growing movement is despite you know the the lies that are being told by the establishment i mean there's so much corruption and and the abortion industry really has so much power with all of these institutions and with the media and entertainment media and all this but despite that it's really young women who are leading the charge i mean a lot of pro-life organizations are led by women um and then a live-action ambassador team our activists they're largely women so that's not to say men don't have a role we need we need men i'm glad i'm so glad you're such a stalwart on this because you know these are these are children who have fathers and half the babies who are killed by abortion are little boys it's not just a woman's issue it's a human issue um so we need representation really from everybody yeah and i definitely think that's right what what are you what are you most worried about right now as the bite administration uh takes form and begins implementing its policies and and how do you think we got to this point because and i want to frame that in saying like it's more extreme than it has been yeah it's it's you're right on that so there's two things that are most concerning to me about the biden administration one is more sort of um it's more of an intangible but it's really also has long-term deep cultural impact and the other is political so the first one i'll talk on the political is that's more straightforward it's the hyde amendment and biden you know for decades was saying that as a politician that he supported the hyde amendment this is the the federal law that prohibits taxpayer funds from directly paying for abortions um so i'm in the state of california we're very far left abortions directly paid for are directly paid for even late term abortions in the state you know children are being killed with taxpayer money and that's state money though it's not federal money so this would open the coffers you know the cash flow would just go out into the abortion industry planned parenthood would profit tremendously and it would they estimate it would mean hundreds of thousands of more deaths of children every single year because the reality is when a woman's in a really scared place and she's feeling overwhelmed she's feeling pressured she's like what can i do i just want to get out of this situation because she's experiencing an unexpected pregnancy a quick fix is really tempting um but the reality is abortion is not i mean it might seem like a quick fix in the moment but it has a lifetime of pain and regret because you've just killed a child maybe you're you're not really focusing on that fact in the moment because you're so you're feeling so upset but it's a it's a devastating effect long term for the woman um that being said the height amendment means oh the government just pays for it so there won't even be a question like of money do i have enough money for this or anything women will just be encouraged oh it's free it's you know um it's not like pregnancy care is free for them federally but abortion will be free for you federally and so the it just tips the scales for death it tips the skills for the violence of abortion and it's so it was just so gross and disappointing to me as a woman to see biden who says he for women and you know he's a progressive and he's he's been for the hyde amendment again for decades even under when he was on you know vice president with obama and then last year because of pressure from pro-abortion planned parenthood and their allies he wanted their campaign dollars so it was really i mean cynical calculation he's like okay i guess i have to go for their legislation to try to get rid of this and promise to do that when i'm president so that's the one political thing that could be the most devastating in my opinion is his um just complete sellout to the abortion industry i mean he is extraordinarily um extreme i mean any abortion is extreme it kills a baby but he is 100 in line with planned parenthood and their policy subject proposals yeah and the democrat party in all all in all has gotten much more extreme where we can't even get them to agree that a born a live bill is something we can pass in congress i mean we i think we introduced it like a bazillion times uh the last two years just just to demonstrate really because we knew we couldn't get it anywhere but just to demonstrate like how extreme this is on the left and you know and to frame the question of you know how we got here one thing i keep hearing and i don't have the the data to support this and maybe maybe you do is is um is that gen z is is a more pro-life generation at least compared to millennials and maybe gen x i mean is that true what are you seeing in trends on public opinion on abortion and then what how do you well let's start there and then i have another data oriented question but but what are you seeing in trends yeah yeah so it's really fascinating when we do polling and we look at other polling that's done so when you just ask people like you know do you support roe v wade um the majority of young people both millennials and gen z um the large majority are like sure yes i mean it's it's you know it's the status quo you know again there's been so much pro positive marketing about it um selena gomez wearing the 1973 necklace um miley cyrus licking the abortionist healthcare cake i mean they're really um and it's so deceptive it's so that's why i just find it um so offensive against a woman they never say what abortion is right they just call it health care i mean biden won't even actually say the word abortion anymore he just says women's healthcare so they won't even call it what it is it's a dismemberment i mean anybody who actually looks at what an abortion is looks at the diagrams of it or watches we have content that shows you the medical you know animations of what it is they're horrified because you can see this is a human being i mean you can see the humanity of this little tiny growing boy or girl and um disturbs anybody left or right democrat or republican so the only way to really support it is to block out the reality and that's what's being done but here's the good news when you get more specific when you say in polling for example roe v wade permits abortion through all nine months do you support that then you see uh 20 up to 30 shift to say actually i don't support that um when you ask people in polling young people millennials and gen z when you ask them do you support abortion bans after the heart beacon can be detected a majority support that it's incredible and a heartbeat can be detected at three in a heartbeat happens at three and a half weeks can be detected by six or seven weeks so they're basically is that a majority all abortions is that a majority of young people or majority just in the general population young people okay so when they're get so what my point here is when they're given facts i mean this is a recent poll from the polling company just this last month in january when young people gen z and millennials are given actually the facts of what they are choosing to support or not support with with abortion then they actually tend very pro-life but when you just say oh do you support a woman's right to choose or you know do you support roe v wade um i they're they they say yes i'm pro-choice you know it sounds great but when you describe what that is it changes instantly it changes the opinion so our job live action is education because you know we're it's a hugely uphill battle because you know the school system's pro-abortion and they use the euphemisms you know the false language of empowerment and choice um you know the democratic party most celebrities and entertainment media media is very much deceptive about when talking about abortion but when you cut past those lies and and the apathy that comes with it and you actually talk about what abortion does to that baby how it's harmful to a woman then we see people more identify in gen z and millennials is pro-life and there's a civics conversation to be had here about what it means if if roe v wade were actually overturned and you know that's that's that's a huge educational um i think fault line there because what people think is well if you overturn roe v wade abortion's just illegal and of course that's not true at all literally nothing would happen if we overturned roe v wade right now the only thing that would happen is states would have the freedom which i mean constitutionally let's be honest they already do okay roe v wade is a deeply i think illegal and unconstitutional decision just forget forget the fact that it's about abortion i mean the problem with roe v wade just on a legal basis is that it uses the fourth amendment to make its case for abortion so the fourth amendment is is a basically a privacy amendment says you know the government has no right to enter your home without due process without a warrant et cetera um now which is a really good amendment to have i think especially in the age of coronavirus when they want to come and bang down the door when you're having thanksgiving dinner with your family fourth amendment protects you from that crap um it does not protect abortion like no one in their right mind would look at that and interpret the penumbra of the of the legal language uh in the fourth amendment to to say that uh you can have an abortion as well and just on a basic i'm getting a little political philosophy here but this point is important because because the counter arguments against the pro-life movement are always well well if you're in favor of the death penalty then how can you be pro-life right and i'm like well easily actually because we're talking about innocent life and the entire point of government is to prevent the infringement of rights from person a against person b okay that's that's a really important point to acknowledge as a purpose of government and this is this is this is clear in our declaration of independence when it says that the purpose of government is to protect your life liberty and property and so but what about capital punishment well that the government's job is to prevent infringement of rights so so purportedly the person who's who's who's who's um being you know i guess executed infringed on somebody else's rights in a pretty severe way they're usually like a mass murderer or something terrible um it's the government's job to enforce that this is not the same thing as abortion and we can't allow them i think to to gain that ground just on a on a political philosophy basis on a civics question and so you overturn roe v wade it does nothing it just puts the power back in the hands of the states and i don't think people even know that like they have no idea that that's true and um and that that the reality is is that yeah you would just have that fight at the state level yeah yeah i mean that's exactly right and by the way when a lot of death penalty opponents and i'm i'm personally opposed to the death penalty so you can i mean a lot of people are anti-abortion again are also against the death penalty but you can be for the death penalty as a matter of justice and opinion and also very pro-life so you know it can go both ways but what i what i rarely see is the people that criticize pro-lifers may who might be supporting the death penalty or against it i mean there's the diversity the pro-life movement is extremely diverse ideologically which is awesome left and right all different kinds of people um but a lot of those death penalty opponents are pro-abortions so they would withhold the death penalty from a um you know a mass murderer but they would give the death penalty to a child with no due process of course an innocent child simply because they were not seen as wanted enough and i think that is really cuts to the heart of the the the dishonesty quite frankly um maybe it's not intentional dishonesty for some people they just haven't thought about it but it's ultimately a dishonest position and again that's why education is so key because when people actually have the facts about you know fetal development and the violence of abortion what it actually does to that baby that beautifully developing baby a lot of people do change um and one other thing you know i mentioned earlier there's two things that concern me about biden and i know height amendment's a big one but the other big one is kind of some of the things you were you were talking about dan and what we've been talking about so far is you know this the lies that the abortion um side is telling about about abortion they don't even use the word abortion you know biden made this statement last week on january 22nd the anniversary of roe v wade 1973 supreme court case decision like you mentioned and again row basically restricts the states from having abortion limits like you say so that's what it is it's basically saying texas you cannot protect children in your state you know um florida you cannot protect children in your state if you're a state that wants to protect kids you're not allowed to i mean it's really like you say completely um just a horrific law even pro-choice advocates have said it's poorly decided um law and it should it just was a poorly decided case but what i'm concerned about is joe biden says our president now says that he's this catholic they use the language of spirituality they talk about jesus they talk about saints they talk about scripture and he says he's also you know for women's choice or women's health meaning abortion and i think that is one of my biggest concerns is people allowing him to get away with that allowing him to get away with this lie where he's this religious man he's you know filmed in church praying to god and jesus christ the god he claims to serve says let the little ones come unto me um he says it would be better for you to be thrown into the the ocean and with a millstone around your neck than to bring any harm you know have any one of these little ones stumble i mean jesus was always about the little one and so to support the law not protecting the little one when the law protects you and i we're the big strong ones but now the law is not allowed to protect the little one um that is what makes me the most concerned about just that horrific hypocrisy which by the way is not being called out i mean you know this you you've borne this yourself um in you know even your short time in congress just the total attacks of a lot of media groups the dishonesty and they're not calling him out most people do not call him out on the hypocrisy how have you been seen them spin the uh born alive bill yeah that one um that this is just it's it's just disturbing because what it does as you know you've championed it the born alive bill it's very simple it's so basic it provides medical attention and ensures medical attention for a baby that survives an abortion attempt so this is a baby that shouldn't be you know shouldn't have been attempted to be murdered in the first place the fact that the law allows them in the first place is wrong um but what the left has done or what a lot of pro-abortion politicians has done is said well there's no such thing as a born alive infant after an abortion they say it doesn't exist and we say it does actually the cdc says that there have been dozens of these children and actually here's an example of one of you know one of my friends claire caldwell she survived an abortion attempt my friend gianna justin we actually have examples they've testified before congress but it doesn't matter when the meet when a lot of media groups support you if you just lie so they just they just kind of move past it and they're just like oh guys you don't even need this because this isn't a thing is that just what they say basically that's that's one of the points and then the second point is this is really a backdoor attempt to ban all abortions and by the way we should ban all abortions because they're they're acts of murder but the law you know the born alive bill is about born alive infants it's not talking about children you know that are not survivors of abortion so am i happy with that i mean as an activist no i'm not because we need complete legal protection i mean sometimes i i i appreciate when congress when you guys do anything that supports human life you know i it'll get cheers from from our side but i say go big or go home you know we we we need complete legal protection for these kids we need to stop we need to stop playing the game you know that some babies should be protected some shouldn't there's justification to murder a kid at any point um and i just think as long as we play the game it's going to be futile because the reality is as you've seen yourself dan they're never going to agree they're never going to moderate right that's an interesting thing our side is offering moderation they're not going to moderate so it's okay so this is an interesting kind of path to go down because um and this this by the way is like the exact it's it's the same conversation on any topic right between like me and and the activists because because i do have to live in the reality of politics and incrementalism and and just trying to move the ball forward and so um and like you said you're going to cheer if we move the ball forward and so it is it is beneficial to sort of brainstorm i think and strategize on how we could move the ball forward knowing full well that look on a moral basis like you said like there's no difference and i say this all the time there's no difference between the value of a human life at 12 weeks versus the human the value of a human life at 11 weeks now what's interesting is in going back to the polling for years and years and years like 60 between 60 and 70 of americans are not in favor of abortion past 12 weeks okay but then that reverses if you go first trimester okay so and this is similar and so this this matches the laws in europe people don't realize this either the super liberals in europe are like almost exclusively in almost every country banabor like france sweden they banned abortion at about 12 weeks and it's very hard to get an abortion past that so now is that a moral compromise maybe is it a political compromise definitely um and it's because of that public opinion polling you know and so does that is that is that worth arguing at least like from from the activist community and from from my position to say like just to move the ball forward now again it doesn't even seem like we're close to there because we can't even get our board a live bill through but i think it's pretty important just as we educate people to say like look between six like almost 70 percent of americans think that abortion should be illegal after 12 weeks so vote republican and that's what we'll do we will make this illegal after 12 weeks and then at least we'll get that done you know at least there and then and then and then get the next battle from that in the next battle from that and the democrats will say they'll argue and rightfully so you're just opening the door to banning abortion completely it's like yeah maybe but the slippery slope argument frankly is a is a logical fallacy just by its very nature because it it it starts from this premise that you can't have the next argument when the next argument comes but you know that's a separate point but i don't know what do you think about everything i just said yeah i think the question i would have is do we care about justice or are we just um conniving you know uh politicians who are just gonna like do what is going to you know get us the vote um i think that people's opinions do change but they change when they see leadership and they change when they see persuade you know a reason to change why would anyone change on abortion if the people who are convicted and convinced that this is a human life as science shows us and they they deserve life like you and i do but we're okay with killing them and their hearts are beating you know when they're when they're here with us in the womb of their mothers and we're okay with killing them i mean why would you as an abortion advocate ever change your mind if the people who say they're pro-life are okay with killing babies in the first trimester simply because they're little simply because they're less developed so i think it sends a terrible message to the very people we need to persuade and it's also not the role of democracy this is another huge point a democracy does not have the right to decide whether or not another group of people innocent people get to live or die that's not that's not the right um the right of a people to decide that another group of people who are innocent get to live or die um a democracy is accountable to higher moral realities um like our declaration of independence says higher moral rights that we all human rights that we all have so if we as a democracy accept this compromise that you know our our politicians and the people that are supporting them we accept this compromise that just because it's not popular right now we're going to we're going to violate the the human rights of a whole group of innocent people just because it's not popular to stand for them we're going to allow the violation of their very lives um why what kind of a country are we fighting for now you know we've completely lost our our moral compass so but that doesn't mean you're against but you're not against like some of the state laws that have that have that have sought you know heartbeat bills right and i mean you're not against that like you cheer it of course i'm but but obviously we want the next step of course but but it's not like you're against that yeah i mean obviously if the law was completely protecting a child and then they say oh before the heartbeat you can kill him i would be opposing that but any law that protects more kids i'm going to support it right because right now none of you know virtually none of them are protected right um you can go you know as long as you travel you're willing to travel you can get an abortion through all nine months in the united states i'm going to support any law that protects any child right and i guess yeah no i don't think i don't i get you can't see ground i mean you can't you can't agree with the with the premise that um you know somehow a child's life is actually not valuable just because it doesn't have a heartbeat yet but in a week it will and i totally get that like you you cannot see because it's it's it's you can't see it because of moral reasons and you can't see it because it's not even intellectually consistent right because there's no intellectual there's no intellectual reason i never use i try not to use i certainly don't use biblical arguments so i try to use very humanist arguments um when making the case against abortion um so i totally get that you know but you know people just aren't there and part of leadership is sort of delivering news to people and information to people at a rate they can handle and that's part of persuasion as well right you've gotta you've gotta take them one step at a time it's like hey guys look america just by and large doesn't even think we should have abortions past 12 weeks so let's just like nip that one in the bud right away you know we're not even there yet i mean let's win that one and then and then it's like hey guys like look so we so we do have we do agree that we value life past 12 weeks now let's start asking the question why wouldn't we also value it at 11 weeks like does this make any logical sense that we wouldn't value it at 11 weeks when we supposedly value it at 12 weeks and then people are like huh that's true right it just it just happens yeah i i just think it i think it's not it doesn't work that way in reality i mean look at the last 48 years dan um you know we haven't gotten closer we haven't gotten legally to our goal of complete legal protection and it's because i think we've been playing too much in the middle um you know when you have two political extremes you can call them extremes two sides of the of the field right and one side says kill babies through all nine months and the other side says no no don't kill baby ever right um if this side is constantly walking over to this side and saying hey guys come play over here like come play and this guy these guys are like no all we do is we move the goal post closer to abortion that's all we've done and we're losing but we've already lost so much i mean we gotta argue about the strategy of it i guess all day long because i i could i have this conversation with the activist community on every single topic um and so that so i find it fascinating i think yeah but i think with this topic we're not talking about like i mean we're talking about life and death for human beings who are completely dependent so there's a there is a and not just life and death in the sense of oh they they need more money for you know for health care so that they don't die from poor health care or whatever we're talking about somebody's trying to kill them an abortionist is being paid money to kill them and you know they could live or die today depending on what a politician may choose to do so i understand what you're saying about leadership i think it's a good point that leaders need to understand where their people are at but leaders also have to make the tough calls even when it might seem unpopular and that i think is what will win respect and ultimately well that would be nice if we could die the thing is we can't even make the tough calls you know i mean again this gets back to like the conversation of just the basic civics of it and the basic reality of you know where we're at as leaders it's not like i have a choice of making a tough call i have no choice whatsoever you know i mean it's it's um i don't have the power we're not we're not majorities and we have we have a supreme court decision that must be overturned in order to even make those tough calls and for it to be overturned we have to persuade many many many more people and so we really are in a culture war more so than a legal war if it was just a legal war then it really would be as simple as saying yeah just just just take the tough vote but frankly that's not that hard i mean i i i really don't believe it's that hard for many republican politicians to take the so-called tough vote um i think the the pro-life movement is we believe it's strong enough and we believe we have the the top cover to go ahead and do that it's it really is a that's not even the question unfortunately the question is how do you get this specific decision overturned or at least altered in some way um so so that states can even have the debate yeah i mean here's the deal i think that the court does take cues from the culture um i think that the law is a teacher i think you would agree with that and so if we keep playing the game the intellectually dishonest game because it is intellectually dishonest to say i'll only protect the child at 12 weeks i won't protect the child at 11 weeks if we keep you know basically acting enacting the lie that these are not human beings when science is crystal clear and reason is crystal clear that we are we are never going to win the culture dan and that's my big concern it's not just an activist you know who's impatient it's about the reality of how do you win a culture you win a culture or you you you lead a culture to justice when you speak truth and if the politicians and sort of the lobbyists have sort of you know chummied up and bought this sort of it's not just so much about um you know meeting them halfway or anything it's about actually speaking the lie of these children are not going to be protected because there's some difference there's some sort of meaningful difference between a child at 11 weeks and a child at 12 weeks then we are going to we're going to lose the culture and that's what i try to tell politicians is be bold be brave it might cost you in the short term but it's going to win the game it's going to win the win the victory in the long run that's the only way to do it i guess keep playing the middle of the field we're never going to win i don't think they're playing the middle i and i don't think they think they're going to lose in the short term either you know i think that's i think i think that's i think that's where we're i think they just think it's useless because like i i i look if you're if you're at the state if you're at the state level i'm not at the state level so i don't even get to have this choice again like we're at the federal level we're arguing about born alive bills which is insane but at the state level and especially more more um more red states you know what you tend to see at the at the best the best we see is you're not seeing bans on abortions because they know they can't even bother right so they could introduce it so they don't think they're losing in the short term like i think you're misreading political incentives here that is not the problem they are not scared of of pro-choice activists coming to their office they don't even care they really don't i mean especially these reps who just represent super red districts that's not their issue their issue if they're if they're if they're not introducing it it's because they know it just gets shut down by the courts because of roe v wade right or they know it's just it's just not gonna pass so there's no point so so you know part of being a politician and part of being a leader is understanding what we can get through and i and i and i have to disagree that we we lose the culture war because we can we can still introduce this and say look this is the step this is the first step and of course we we still believe that we have to get to the next step and the next step and the next step um and i don't i just i really just so i think the only thing we disagree on is the art of persuasion i think that's i think that's fundamentally we disagree a little bit on just the civics question as well but but mostly i think we disagree on the art of persuasion like i i think you do have to persuade the public incrementally whether we like it or not i don't like it as much as you don't like it but i also think it's fundamentally true and just given my position and somebody who has to like talk to a wide variety of people and get elected by a wide variety of people i understand that i understand that dynamic very well um and um i you know either way either way it's because this is the last thing i'll say in response to something you said was like you said we've been doing it this way for 50 years and i just totally disagree with that um the way we've been doing it before somebody like you showed up was again it was the dark and gloomy activism it was not good like it was it was very extreme and it wasn't it was so unpersuasive i do think that the way you know your new generation of of pro-life movement is is working this issue is so much better but it just started it really like that this kind of optimistic like you know like the voice of young women like talking of love and of life and all of this that just started and that's the problem like and so unfortunately it's going to take more time because we're behind the power curve but i'm extremely optimistic about where we can go from here well i'm glad to hear that william wilberforce you know he was the one responsible with some other activists for helping abolish the slave trade as you know in great britain and he repeatedly introduced the same legislation over and over again he had to do that he had to do that to build the necessary momentum he didn't build he didn't introduce half half-baked measures he didn't introduce oh only abolish the slave trade for children or only abolish the slave trade for women or only abolish the trade for disabled slaves or whatever he introduced the same legislation complete abolition so if we look at successful social reform movements historically they do not introduce half measures they say we want complete protection of this group of people because to say that only some of them deserve protection is to already seed your entire moral high ground it's already to concede your entire case and so that's where you know i think we do disagree on the heart of persuasion i i would i would just challenge you guys like imagine if instead of born alive i mean we're debating about a baby who survived an abortion attempt you won't even give them care i mean it's crazy right what have you just said no no killing babies well yeah i mean we're if we're in the if we're freaking out if we're in the majority we can easily do there is legislation that does it again it just nobody even notices it that's my point i just don't think people understand this i think the and i think in the majority we can force that debate in the minority we can't again this is the federal level so at the state level i mean i don't i don't disagree with you it's like yeah like why not um i i don't disagree with you at the at the state level it did but it just it depends a lot more on the political idea listen activists are always saying if you guys were just stronger then like things would happen and i like i i wish that were true it's like go fight more and i'm like okay well what do you mean by that you know it's like i wish that were true i wish it was just that easy but it's just not you know what i mean like there's there's there's basic laws of civics that sort of prevent some of these things from happening and i think in the ways that people want i would also point out that abolishing slavery in the united states did happen in a very different way than you're suggesting so you thought that was the great in britain but in the united states it had to start with a declaration of independence that says that all men are created equal then abolitionists had to use that through years and years and years to even create an abolitionist movement like look here's the here's what we're trying to live up to in the declaration of independence and then they had to fight you know when new states the fight the battle of whether new states would even have slavery or not and so it really was these like half measures that eventually led to the abolition of slavery um and i you know this is a this is a great i don't think these conversations happen enough by the way between like somebody like you and me about like just the strategy because like we totally agree on the outcome yeah um but but there's a but there's and i think i should have this conversation with more activists on different topics as well just to figure out like what's the actual right strategy to to get to the point that we both want to get to well and i'll say one other quick thing i think you're clearly a fighter dan i mean you're that's built into your your bones but here's the here's the reality i think even in the pro-life movement we have been too quick to sort of run to these sort of interesting you know maybe overly strategic measures like born alive infant protection act we think surely everybody will agree with that no they don't um and so what we do is we we take the conversation to these you know this group of these poor children you know the the the small group of children they do exist they do matter who are surviving abortion attempts and we make the conversation about these kids which these kids deserve a conversation but we could have been having a conversation about all the kids about them and the children who were you know being torn apart limb from torso in utero by an abortion at 20 weeks by a suction abortion at 11 weeks so that's my that's my concern is like what conversations are we having and what what are we communicating to the people on the fence because you're saying we got to lead the people in the fence we don't want to be too crazy with them but people are reasonable you know i think most people are reasonable and i have seen you know my persuasion work at live action when you actually tell people the case you know for life you share about human development in the womb you talk about what an abortion does to that baby you talk about this idea that you know if you are a single cell embryo if you're a unique individual human life at just the beginning um and you just need time and nourishment to grow there's not like one point where you suddenly become a human right you're human all the way through most people are like yeah i get that you know they're not and then you need to kind of walk through the hard cases with them right because they still have these sort of like hang-ups about like rape or incest you have to talk through that but i think that's what i'm you know concerned about with the strategy that we've had historically of these half measures is the conversation is the wrong conversation and as long as we're having the wrong conversations nationally and you know in our in our personal you know communities then we're never gonna i don't i think it'll be very difficult for us to see the success we're looking for so that's where you know law as a teacher the laws that we propose are teachers right and the conversation have around them i mean look at aoc your colleague right she went she went for it she's like the green new deal yeah and she got mocked and she got made fun of but she's really being successful in her contingent she's winning supporters to her side younger people because she's unafraid to ask for everything right and i think we should we can i just think there's a lot we can learn from that yeah that's fair i i've been i definitely see the point but to me it just seems more like there's there's two sides to it legal and rhetorical and i think you're absolutely right on the rhetorical side we need to be constantly making those arguments um and uh people aren't dumb people people see that the connection between the two and if if our legal arguments don't match what we say is true like you know the law is not actually realistic on you know what is reality it's it's kind of it's like living in the pseudo-reality based on sort of political calculations i think that's where i think people notice that and i think that's why people love some of the kind of the very far left stuff that's happening because they're not afraid to say they want the legal to match their rhetoric as you say and yeah some people you know hate that but other people especially younger people are like that's honesty that there's integrity in that yeah yeah it is unfortunate especially when you're talking about the green new deal now to be fair the green new you're right in a sense again rhetorically the green new deal did create a ton of space for all this radicalism um but when it comes down to the brass tax what's actually being put on the floor to be voted on is it's still bad for a lot of reasons but it ain't it ain't no green new deal right so it's um you know we could make that argument both ways i do want to talk about okay so like the what the debate should be and we've sort of we've sort of hit it various times throughout this conversation and i told you before we started recording like i kind of wanted to play devil's advocate and just like watch you hit all the points that that are constantly thrown at the pro-life movement um and again we've already hit some of them but like but so let's talk about the conversation that you want to have and that should be debated in the halls of congress and state legislatures because again i don't disagree with any of that i think it would be very healthy i just don't think it's as easy to just spark that like make that debate happen as people realize we have no power in the minority to do that but in any case totally get it that's what should be happening on a national level because you're right people yeah because because i do this i go to high schools a lot that's my favorite things to do i love to like just have kids ask questions and um the abortion issue comes up a lot and so i've gotten pretty good at understanding like how to talk this issue um with kids and the first thing i think you got to realize is is um we can't use biblical justification because it's not a source of authority to a lot of these kids and uh you know it just doesn't matter to them so i use it i use humanist arguments um i talk about the um well just the way like like simple questions like okay let me get this straight if you you talk about your baby when you want the baby but it's not a baby when you don't want the baby you know how does that work right and so there's basic questions like that i think make people think and so um maybe we'll run through some of these arguments so that people have the tool because i want listeners to have the tools to make the right argument so i guess what's the um maybe we'll start off i'm gonna know how i want to run this discussion let me start off with this what's the hardest question you have uh you have to answer is it the is it the exceptions is it the rape and incest one that would seem to me to be the hardest one to answer yeah i think i mean for the way i see hardest is subjective it's based on like what is the biggest hang up for the individual person who's asking me because what's hardest for them is is going to be the thing i care most about to sort of undo the the confusion that they might have um i mean honestly i don't find any of them hard in the sense that when you actually think about it logically and also from a position of love like what is you know love is love is based on reality what is good for people and when you look at you know a rape survivor for example you know you mentioned rape and incest um you know rape's horrific and we need to be advocating and fighting for rape survivors and incest survivors um an abortion advocate would say well part of their healing is an abortion and um i you know first off we don't even give a death penalty to rapists i don't you know i'm sure you know this federally it's against the law federal law to kill a rapist um for the government to put a rapist to death why do we give the death penalty to a child who's conceived in rape are they are they the responsible for the crime and their their dad isn't even getting that you know their biological fathers and getting that that penalty but beyond that you know abortion what is an abortion it is an act of violence against a baby it is an act of violence against a woman i mean the act of abortion is is ultimately you know i see it as a kind of medical rape you're actually going you're violating a woman's body a healthy pregnancy to destroy that baby so it is an added trauma to the initial trauma of the rape and it doesn't take away the trauma of the rape i think this is one of the most insincere parts of the sort of pro-rape apologist abortion activists i'm not saying people who are confused concerned about this are insincere but some abortion activists are like just give her an abortion you know how dare you withhold an abortion it's like an abortion is not going to heal her trauma right and abortion doesn't take away the the memory of that rape it actually just adds another trauma to the rape so you know for the for the sake of the woman and of course for justice for the child um abortion in a position the situation of rape is not justified it's not it's not loving or helpful for them for the survivor either yeah it's i think it's definitely one of the harder questions because it's it's because it's so easy to imagine how traumatizing that is for you know i mean i'm a man but like i can easily imagine how traumatizing that is for somebody i love and like if they just you know it's a reminder if they remain pregnant whether it's a reminder every single day that this that this happened that it's not somebody they wanted it to happen with um that's it's extremely devastating i i just you know i i think the only i think look i mean one of the ways i i talk about that one is let's say look when we're at an agreement that abortions of convenience are at zero weeks and basically illegal then we should have the conversation about about these exceptions but but you're not even you're not even agreeing with me that we should have no abortions of convenience you know so that's that's usually that's usually the tool i use um just uh rhetorically speaking what has happened is you know that the challenge with that is you know the abortion advocates know that those cases are so devastating and so they've weaponized them yes you know you know rape and incest is weaponized to defend all abortions and i think that's part of the issue like if we're like yeah you know i agree rapist you know rape is uniquely horrible absolutely but if we're like yeah that baby i get why it's more okay to like end the life of that baby versus another baby then we actually again we're giving them we're giving the abortion advocates their you know their their ammo we're basically letting them again use those cases to justify all the other abortions because that's what they've done for 50 years so um i i hear you on that and i think it's absolutely devastating but i also look at the studies i mean there's a study that you know the very few studies that have been done on this because again the most in the most in the world of sort of health care supposedly are so pro-abortion they won't bother to research this but of survivors who actually you know survivors of rape who got pregnant who had their baby the vast majority of them say that they do not regret it that they're you know very you know grateful that they were able to have this child i mean ultimately they're they they they bond with the child they become attached um of the women that have abortions after rape the vast majority of them say that they actually regret it uh because they know i mean again we have to live in reality the trauma of that rape is not undone by an abortion right it adds to the trauma maybe not in the moment there's that feeling of relief in the moment but as time goes by it's like wait a minute there was a baby and now i'm responsible for killing that baby so i think we have to really get inside the mind of a survivor and realize that it's a lot more complex than the abortion advocates would make it it i mean it definitely is um okay so that's the hardest i think that's the hardest question but let's let's talk through some of the other ones um and you know so how do you respond when you know somebody's like well look because you you can ask people questions you walk them through that right and you'll and you usually say well i mean once a in a third trimester do you do you agree with abortions and they'll say no and you then you'll say okay well then and why do you agree with an abortion at one month and they'll say well it's it's just a because it's different it's like a clump of cells it's not really it's not really a baby yet right yeah i mean you i think you can keep moving them backwards and just say well what about when the baby is um you know just two months and they already have their brain waves are already firing their neurons are already firing um you know what about at three and a half weeks when their heart is already beating you can kind of use um the gestation of the baby and the fetal development markers or the embryonic development markers be like would you be okay if the heart's beating would be okay if you're in there and eventually you'll find they'll be like yeah that doesn't sound good you know any of um indication of the baby's humanity right makes the the the person advocating for aborting them uncomfortable right and you can find indications of humanity you know throughout the entire life of a human because they're human so i i i think you know you can you can kind of have that conversation with someone about when is it okay versus when is it not but i go back to the logical um case for life which is this um is the pre-born child or is the single cell embryo a human life um is it ever okay to kill an innocent human life yeah is it ever okay to kill and usually people say no it's not okay to ever kill an innocent human human life human being or just human and if you can get somebody to start with the the premise that it's never okay to kill an innocent human it's never okay then as long as you can show them and you can show them pretty simply with science and reason that a single cell embryo is an individual unique human then you can help them see why it's never okay no matter how small or undeveloped they are to intentionally end their life so that's usually where we start and that gets to the body argument right like well it's just my body and so when somebody says it's just my body um that implies that they disagree with the premise that it's a separate human life and then you're showing them that i think is is important because it's like well if we found life on mars but it was a single it was a single cell organism would you still consider that finding life on mars it's like well yeah so well and i just i just find that my body my choice argument i mean i i have to laugh sometimes because it just you hear it so many times and you're just like it's not just her body like you know any pregnant woman knows it's not just her body anymore there's another body inside her you know when i was pregnant with my son did i have male you know body parts in me as he was developing like you know yes i i had i i don't have a you know i don't have male organs i have a child with no organs inside of me so there's obviously another body and you know the science is crystal clear it's a unique distinct individual human life an individual human body even if even at a few cells it just needs that time to grow so you know i'm i actually for my body my choice stand like to the point where i believe that we should have a level of autonomy especially as women like you know my body is sacred and you know don't mess with me like i i totally i totally um you know i'm with that sort of idea but when you start to just be blatantly dishonest and be like okay a pregnant woman is no long is now just a pregnant you know pregnant woman is now only still one body the woman's body and not not a child's body it's just it's just not it's just not real it's not scientifically accurate right and i think that's a strong it's a strong argument that um that again we've been equipped with as a pro-life movement later on since since roe v wade simply because we have the the science to prove it you know you you can you can visualize um um infants in just a much different way than we could before and i think that's i think that's a pretty important part of it and i think another so another another form of argumentation just gets to value and and this this this is another way to sort of argue i think the you know the why is week one less valuable than week three and challenge people to make like a real argument like a really intellectual argument as to why that value system is different why the val why is why is month eight so much less valuable than once the baby is born like what is a good reason for saying that you know because you're all just it's a clump of cells fine but you're just a clump of cells you're just like a prettier clump of cells than the big one yeah um so you know what it and because because there it's really hard to make it's really hard to answer that question that i just posed but i don't know how do people try or do we even get to that point in these debates yeah i mean people try everything and i think one other thing i'll say i do think lies the power of a lie is when it's repeated so many times your whole life long you know and i think that's what's happened with the abortion issue like my body my choice it's not a baby yet it's a clump of cells like we know these things are not true um we know there's another body we know that it's actually yes it's a clump of cells but it's a you know human clump of cells that's unique in individual human life like you and i um but when you just hear the lie over and over again and then you're fearful i think that's the other thing they're fearful that the pro-life position is somehow going to destroy women right and as long as you're fearful and as long as the lies are being told again and again i get why people buy them right i get why people you know fear is a powerful um powerful force so you know on the value thing that you mentioned you know why is an eight month old more valuable than a seven month old i also say like a baby is much less developed than an adult man right but we actually see the baby as because they're more vulnerable as more sort of worthy of our protection and care right yeah like babies yeah so actually the smaller you are the more you should be cared for the more dependent you are actually the more you deserve care so i would say like because they're so dependent on that mom not only does the mom you know should should try to eat healthy and care for herself but actually the other piece of it other people should care for the mom and that's why like we're big advocates for mothers because you know part of being pro-life is recognizing that there's this very innate and important bond between mothers and kids that starts you know from the moment of fertilization they're actually dependent on their mom's body so that means like how you know how we treat pregnant women matters tremendously because it's our responsibility to care for her because she's caring for somebody else yeah those are all good what else um before we before we end what other questions do you get that you have had to find answers to that that are that are persuasive that are on it's good or do we really cover them all we've covered yeah another another big one if we want to do one more yeah all kinds but okay let's do one more the um we need abortions because it's medically necessary oh yeah that's a good yeah thanks for bringing that up they use they use that one um a lot and it's again it's so crazy because that's used as justification for all abortions as you know yeah limits on abortion but what i say to that one is like look medically speaking you don't have to have an abortion you might have to have now because look that's a tough question right and i do say look you save the life of the mother if there's a real problem but you don't have to have an abortion now you might have to have a a um a premature delivery okay and that might res but you should try to save the baby's life right is my point you know it's like let's at least try to protect life on all levels i don't think you should sacrifice the mother i definitely don't think that and a lot of but man i tell you what a lot of people think that's what we mean you know it's a good we got to clarify that that is not what we mean yes so it's very rare too that this would even happen it's extremely rare but you can um work to care for both i mean you should treat them both as patients that's what doctors have done historically and now we have you know the best medical technology in human history so all the more reason to try to save both um and by the way this idea that we should pit mother against child i mean think about a newborn you know like if there's like a pack of wolves chasing you you don't throw your newborn to the wolves like you know spare the spare the adults bear the woman or spare the father the mother of the father and let them you know eat your newborn so you can escape them i mean i think we sort of done this weird inverse with pregnancy where it's like you know we should do whatever we can and take it out on the baby if there's any inconvenience to the mom no i think maternal health care needs to be improved i think we need to 100 advocate for the mom you know i'm a mom i know what pregnancy is like and i've you know had friends with really high risk pregnancies so i understand like you know how important the health care aspect is but you can care for both and like you said dan and abortion is the intentional killing of a baby like you can deliver that baby early and if that baby dies um because of that early delivery the the intention was not to kill that baby in an abortion procedure you go in there and you destroy the baby before delivery that's that is how an abortion procedure is designed and that's why there are thousands of ob gyns who have said abortion is actually not medically necessary in the extremely rare cases where you might have to do an early delivery you still try to save the baby right your goal is save baby in an abortion the goal is deliver a dead baby and i think that's where the distinction is key and we have to be careful too because abortion advocates have gotten really you know crafty with this and they're like oh it actually is an abortion if the baby dies in an early delivery that actually was an abortion even though you tried to save the baby and you're like actually no that's not an abortion if you're trying to save the baby so it also goes down to these very you know very rare very unique situations but the goal is the doctor should be fighting for both i think that needs to be the bottom line for any medical professional right right and okay so the last thing i want to end up with actually is um like other options because the other argument is look um this lady's life is going to be ruined if um she has a baby right now she can't really afford to take care of it so are you going to take care of it mr mr pro-life guy um you know like what how how is this supposed to happen i mean you know so because part of it's you know we call it convenience but look i get it like there's people's lives were really thrown into disarray if they had a baby right now and they're not going to provide a good life for that baby um fair enough so let's say that's the case like this child's life will be really really bad if they're actually brought into the world and so that's the excuse they use to have an abortion but like you know as it turns out we have these other options like adoption and um you know one thing i'm looking for is how do we make adoption in the united states just a better process and just more prevalent there's so many parents out there especially because that's millennials we're having kids too late um and you know it's it's problems with problems with infertility you know how do we how do we get on this how do we make adoption better is this something live action looks into or advocates for yes yeah i think it's a great point and i think adoption definitely is very sort of um there's so many different agencies and different um you know price tags attached to it and challenges attached to it i will say one of the reasons it is so difficult to adopt a newborn is because there's the scarcity i mean there are thousands upon thousands some say estimate up to two million couples looking to adopt infants and they can't because there just aren't infants to adopt so what does that go to the abortion rate the fact that these babies are being aborted instead so i do think you know we need more advocacy for adoption we need to make the the systems as you know great as possible but we also need to encourage moms you know encourage birth moms encourage women who are facing unplanned pregnancies and that's that's really hard to do when abortion's legal right and she's being told she's actually you know being empowered by having an abortion right and she wasn't expecting to get pregnant it's just going to be a lot more of a go-to for some women to say oh i'm just going to go get an abortion then i'm going to go through my 9 months of pregnancy and have this baby so that's where the law matters you know making abortion you know restricting abortion getting rid of it matters and then also educating and supporting those those women and girls to say listen you know this is a human life and there are people who support you and want to care for you and help you out and you know want to walk with you through all your entire pregnancy and there are amazing families because there are there are amazing families i know many personally who are dying to adopt but there's no babies like it it's so difficult to find i know a courageous birth mother who will who will give that baby a shot at life so i think the first key is to to undo the myth that there isn't a hope for that child right and to help encourage you know would-be adoptive mothers that listen there's amazing options and you can pick your family you know you can pick you can have an open adoption you can do it any which way that you're comfortable with um so i think that's that's part of it but part of it is just availability of abortion when abortion is just handed out it's so easy it's marketed as such a great thing even though it's such a horrific thing um that's one of the reasons that it's such a struggle to to have more adoption in our country and i also think it goes back to deeper things too dan you kind of mentioned it like millennials having kids later i think it also just has to do with like our behaviors as people like us seeing sex as cheap and sort of just whatever like you know sex is not really about commitment it's not about love it's not about you know children it's about sort of just a you know pleasure or sort of just my momentary connection with this other person and i think that's also really damaging because as long as we see sex as sort of cheap or just sort of like you know you know something you might do when you're dating and not about family and love and sacrifice then you're gonna have a lot of unwanted babies right you're gonna have children that are seen and i put that in air quotes because you know every child is wanted by someone and definitely wanted by god but you're going to see you know more abortions as long as people don't treat sex with i think the the the sacredness and beauty that it deserves you know it's seen as cheap unfortunately and and women are treated cheaply which is another you know social problem we could talk about yeah and you're right i mean all of these all these different issues kind of lead into where we're at today and we've got to battle back a lot of different fronts to i think um get us get us get our society back on the right track um that was a great conversation just overall i think i think people hopefully learned a lot and i hope you enjoyed my push back on this the general political strategy but i think it's really important to have those conversations and frankly it's fascinating as well um when we're all trying to get to the to the same outcome and i'm like i said because of people like you i'm optimistic about the pro-life movement uh and i think we all should be and we should all keep um fighting the fight so thank you lila rose so much for being on thanks dan and i'm i'm here to cheer you on a thousand percent when you introduce protect everyone protect each one the the protect every life bill so those bills are out there like i you know that's what i try to tell you um but happy too they're kind of they lose they lose their they lose their steam when you have all these other sort of middling measures you know so that's where fair enough the more focus they get i'll take that i'll take that i think um i think you have a point i do think you have a point on that so um that's why we that's why we have these conversations yeah so um lila rose thank you so much for being on and uh keep fighting the fight thanks lila thanks dan all right

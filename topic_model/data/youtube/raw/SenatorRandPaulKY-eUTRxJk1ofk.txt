senator from Kentucky mr. president I rise in support of my amendment to pay for this economic stimulus package by removing less important spending from elsewhere in the budget I would ask every American if you were faced with a personal crisis and how to spend extra money and you had to spend extra money on food and medicine money that you had to borrow from a relative wouldn't you prioritize your resources and immediately stop loaning money to friends overseas for their children to go to for example Space Camp wouldn't you stop funding clown colleges in Argentina if you had a true emergency like this pandemic wouldn't you stop building roads and gas stations in Pakistan if you had a true emergency like this corona pandemic wouldn't you immediately stop spending money studying why drunk people fall down more than sober people I asked my colleagues to stop wasting money in this time of crisis stop being a rubber stamp for wasteful spending do your jobs and prioritize our precious resources it is our job and our responsibility to conserve these resources why is this important why shouldn't we just print or borrow the money instead of making cuts in things like foreign aid because next time maybe in the not-too-distant future our children may not even be able to borrow their way out of a crisis our dollar will be devalued our economy ruined all because we will have been profligate fools with our resources all because we refused to do what we were elected to do which is to prioritize the truly vital such as coronavirus relief and medical research over the extraneous such as spending money on clown colleges gas stations and roads in Afghanistan - my fellow Americans remain hopeful remain kind remain faithful and above all remain resilient in the world's history pandemics of the norm not the exception it is only recently in the modern era of antibiotics and vaccines that pandemics have become less frequent ever since vaccines eradicated polio and smallpox modern man has become accustomed to the idea that life is relatively safe that a long life is to be expected consequently any rear up ssin of diseases beyond our control paralyzes us with fear people have forgotten what is like to experience the annual dread of recurring in infectious disease my parents remember vividly the polio pandemics of the 1950s in one of the last great outbreaks of polio before the vaccine almost sixty thousand people contracted polio and over 3,100 died Jonas Salk was greeted as a conquering hero for developing the first widespread polio vaccine but that was nearly 70 years ago in the early 18th century dr. zebediah Boylston showed great courage and introducing inoculation for smallpox within a generation smallpox was on the wane and ultimately defeated when Edward Jenner discovered how to vaccinate using the mild or cow pox this latest pandemic already has heroes some known but most of these heroes are unknown doctors and nurses on the frontlines the innovators among us are already putting forth potential treatments possible cures a half-dozen antiviral medications are in the final stages of study researchers believe that an old drug developed for malaria may help reports indicate that scientists will likely set a speed record in developing a vaccine now is not the time for malaise now is the time for optimism by summer there is a very good chance we will be in the recovery phrase now is not the time to give in several generations have grown unfamiliar they've grown up unfamiliar with the devastation of pandemics and even now when it's impossible to look the other way the young and healthy rationalized their relative safety psychologically it's easier for the young and healthy to view mortality as something that happens to the old and unhealthy Corona coronavirus scares us because it kills not only old and infirm but the young and vibrant although much less frequently one of the coronaviruses first victims was a 32 year old previously held the ophthalmologist in Wuhan the question is not how serious is the pandemic or whether we should act but whether there is a plan of action that can preserve our economy and lead to a quick rebound I don't think anyone will ever know for certain whether grinding the US economy to a halt was necessary likewise no one can really know the Converse what would have happened had we not attempted to slow the viruses spread it is useful though to remember that just ten years ago we suffered the swine flu pandemic and the swine flu is no walk in the park it is estimated that about 60 million Americans were infected and over 12,000 people died now experts have said that the corona virus is much more lethal than the swine flu likely true but worldwide deaths from the swine flu were estimated to be between a hundred and fifty thousand and five hundred and seventy five thousand when calm returns it will be helpful to examine how our response is differed between the swine flu in the corona virus at one time we were completely helpless before the ravages of natural disasters such as infectious diseases but our history is one of great innovation and perseverance we will survive this pandemic what government does to mitigate the calamity should be short-lived temporary and causes little distortion to the free-market economy as possible the history of pandemics indicates a strong likelihood that the peak of infections and mortality could pass in a few weeks to a few months Congress should remain calm and try not to explode the debt in our response the public should know that Congress has already enacted reforms that will free up millions of industrial masks to be used by our doctors and nurses thoughtful sequestration and quarantine II is in place and helping and in addition I have introduced legislation to allow our university labs and advanced private labs to be able to develop additional testing for coronavirus and possible cures by removing red tape at the FDA I do worry though that as we go further into debt we may reach a point where our debt is so large that we are unable to manage the next pandemic we should never forget fiscal responsibility even in a crisis we should pay for any new federal funding by taking that money from areas of the budget where it is not being wisely used my amendment does just that my Amendment says that if you want to apply for money from the government through the child tax credit program this is money that the government gives to people that you have to be a legitimate person you have to have a social security number we've been talking about this reform for a decade now and we never seem to be able to get it passed it has nothing to do with not liking immigrants it has to do with saying taxpayer monies shouldn't go to non people you should have to be a person to get taxpayer money just says you have to have a social security number people estimate this would save twenty six billion dollars that goes a long way towards paying for this bill I think we should also end the war in Afghanistan we're spending fifty billion dollars a year on that warm and it's mostly not to fight war it's to build stuff for them it's to build infrastructure for them we got a lot of problems with infrastructure in our own country without spending fifty billion dollars a year in Afghanistan if we have a true emergency now it's our job to prioritize to take that money from where it's not being spent wisely to spend it on something that we need at the moment my bill also allows the President to look throughout the budget and transfer money from any other ways for areas if you look at our budget it's loaded with waste nobody ever calls the waste and we have an emergency and they say let's just borrow more money instead what we should do is we should actually take money that's unwisely spent and move it over to account for this emergency what I'm offering is a very reasonable proposal we simply pay for this emergency bill by taking money from other areas of waste in the budget Thank You mr. president

well there's hardly a day goes by here in this city when there isn't a violent crime and if you look at this year already there have been 99 carjackings and the number of cars stolen is double what it was this time a year ago and it's not just car theft violent crime is up 25 percent year over year here in Washington DC and this is a an issue that cries out for a solution and I think that anybody who as the leader said works here lives here visits here would like to have a community that is safe and this isn't just unique to Washington D.C from cities across this country from New York to Seattle you see particularly a lot of our populated areas around the country are experiencing the same wave of crime as a result of soft on crime policies and so this is this has got to stop we have a constitutional Authority legislative Authority here over the District of Columbia and we're going to exercise that this week as the leader pointed out out the resolution that will be on the floor here very soon tomorrow is one that I think will enjoy broad bipartisan support because the Democrats have recognized what we all know and what the American people know and that is that you can't have continue to have policies where politicians put or basically put politics ahead of Public Safety where you've got prosecutors who are not putting people away and in an environment that is permissive and encourages this type of criminal activity in a lot of our major cities across this country so we're going to make that statement tomorrow and again I believe it will be a big bipartisan vote and it should be because the message needs to be sent clearly to the American people that you know policy makers here in Washington DC that their elected officials get this and understand how important it is that there be a strong response to the wave of crime that's been experienced across this country three and that we intend to do something about it starting with Washington D.C

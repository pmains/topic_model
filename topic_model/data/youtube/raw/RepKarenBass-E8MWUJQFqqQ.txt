the breach at the capitol is raising giant security questions today and there's also new pressure on law enforcement to bring more of the writers to justice the fbi yesterday posting this notice encouraging people to send in photos or videos of people involved in the capital insurrection my next guest tweeted out found one you see it right there with a photo of president trump democratic congresswoman karen bess joins me now live congresswoman it is good to see you and i hope you are safe and well after the harrowing experience of yesterday uh you tweet the photo of the president there you also tweeted and i can ask our control room to put them up on the screen a string i believe it numbered up to 10 at the end of people involved in this you're saying okay fbi you want help arrest this man arrest this man and you go on and on arrest all the people in these pictures as it went on um what have you been told about how this happened you're supposed to be in one of the most secure buildings in the world i was here in town in 1998 when gunman killed two capitol police office bursting into that building first of all thank you for raising the issue i think that that there has to be an absolute thorough investigation the only information i have is anecdotal from talking to members of the capitol police and others that were around at the time and basically they just described as being overwhelmed the question is why were they overwhelmed everyone knew this was going to happen why weren't they tracking social media why frankly why weren't the protesters rioters terrorists why weren't they infiltrated why wasn't there undercover police officers that were there this is the kind of thing that happens with other types of street protests so i think there needs to be a thorough investigation and some of your colleagues and some activists around the country remember what happened back in june and i think we may have some photos of this one there were black lives matters protesters here in washington and the capital was very well protected uh by rio police and other law enforcement in riot gear um any explanation as to why that didn't happen well you know i mean i think it's just an example of the double standard uh you know obviously black lives matter's protesters were perceived as very threatening and for some reason these weren't john you know you can't even come into the capitol with a purse without it being screened how can you break into the capitol and walk around with flagpoles and you see the capitol police right there they were completely overwhelmed why did that happen why didn't they erect the barriers around the capital that are present now the fences i think a lot of this needs to be investigated but it is so demoralizing though for people in particular african-americans and other people of color who know if you could even imagine if tens of thousands of young old african-americans uh attacked the capitol like that what would have happened you know i mean it brings back memories of the uh the boy a written house in uh kenosha wisconsin who shot three people walked with his gun in front of the police officers they gave him something to drink and sent them sent him home two of them were killed so we are just sick and tired of seeing the same type of double standard and that's why i hope there's public i hope there's public accountability and transparency and discussion about what happened uh because it's not just the members yeah the vice president united states the vice president like the united states 535 members of congress in that building plus the staff who don't get enough credit all the people who work so hard for our public servants democrats and republicans alike let me turn your attention to another question there are 13 days left of the trump presidency uh soon to be senate majority leader currently the minority leader chuck schumer today said the president must go he doesn't want to wait 13 days he wants the cabinet to assemble declare the president unfit by the using the 25th amendment and remove him and he says if not the congress should impeach the president again one of your colleagues ilhan omar and a number of other house democrats have said let's do that other house democrats have written a letter to the vice president saying bring the cabinet in mr vice president get rid of the president united states with 13 days left do you think democrats should lead an effort either through pressuring the cabinet or filing new articles of impeachment to force this president out or do you just hold your breath and wait 13 days well i frankly don't think that the only thing you do is hold your breath and and wait but let me just say that i would love to see the president leave be kicked out of the white house today with the 25th amendment and that's exactly what should happen however i don't believe that's going to happen at all because i think the president has become a cult leader and i think members of his cabinet are participants right along with him so why would we expect them to have an act to be courageous now when they have stood by been complicit and even promoted his behavior for the last four years i thought former attorney general barr had a lot of nerve talking about how the president has disrespected his office what has barr done over the last couple of years when he's been the attorney general in terms of impeachment we know what would happen with impeachment do you expect the people who voted against certifying the election yesterday in the senate to vote to impeach him today i don't think that that would stand would make any sense but i do think and i am deeply concerned about how our country manages over the next 13 days congresswoman grateful for your time this should be a time we're talking about the incoming administration's agenda and how it will fair in congress we will get back to those conversations in the days ahead congresswoman karen best grateful for your time thank you very much

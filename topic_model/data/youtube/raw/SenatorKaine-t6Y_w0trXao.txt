Thank You mr. chair important hearing thank you all for being here I want to ask about gaps of a different kind I want to talk to you about discipline one of the requirements in essa was that state would have to describe how the state will support local educational agencies receiving assistance to improve school conditions for student learning including including through reducing quote the overuse of discipline practices that remove students from the classroom often discipline practices have been utilized in ways that are highly discriminatory especially against minority students and kids then absorb that lesson and they were they think they're gonna get in trouble more likely than their peers and it affects their learning I would hope you might each take a minute if you would and tell me in your in your states just what you are trying to do to review and utilize that on school discipline to make sure that we are not penalizing historically underserved students and then maybe mr. Jeffries you could talk about it from the perspective of a national perspective you think deal we in the states are doing enough to reduce disparate uses of discipline thank you I'm very proud of the work that we've done in South Carolina in my first year of office we held a task force to look at our student discipline templates the training of resource officers and to really address the issue of the pipeline to prison and I think we have adequately made some changes and then this past year our General Assembly also passed new legislation on disrupting schools to clarify that we are working now to get those into regulation I'm very I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made and again we also in our essa plan from our stakeholders heard that parents wanted to know about student climate and that's why we have included that as one of our indicators where students will be telling us how they feel about the safety inside their schools so we're looking forward to that information being on our report card great thank you Miss bunting again I can echo much of what what has been said but I'll add to it that we are very concerned about some of the discipline portion figures that we have analyzed we do watch data very closely in Delaware and then we have full conversations and expect actions to reduce gaps or to to remove the disparities but I think our efforts this year and I'm very proud as I mentioned of our staffs moving forward with such training as aces for adverse childhood experiences and understanding what an impact that would make in a classroom and for trying such things as responsive classroom techniques and compassionate schools so we're working at it from the understanding perspective as well and offering alternatives that are not ones that involve suspension and expulsion at times we can't teach students if they're not there with us absolutely mr. Bumstead yeah so in Nebraska we've had I think really serious conversations about how to do this and we actually had a couple instances where we were enforcing the prior even in the before essa past the prior law and how that was addressed and I wasn't I wasn't in a position necessarily we'd get a bat in into a battle with a particular School District and I said what's layout of plans is gonna make a particular difference for for your students let's think about trauma-informed let's think about culturally responsive practices within your schools and I've walked hallways in some of our schools where kids are outside the classroom for something as simple as you know crinkling a water bottle or something like this and I'm going this is this is absurd we need to be ensuring that our students in our classrooms that the discipline should not be removing their opportunity to learn it should be a conversation about creating that climate and culture that's appropriate and so our efforts have really turned to that that approach different than the traditional compliance bang somebody over the head with their numbers but more about what are our strategies are gonna really make a difference and then track the numbers on the accountability excellent in mr. Jeffries address it from the national level and things that that we should pay attention to as we're exercising oversight over the do ease efforts in this regard thank you sooner we think it's critical for Congress to again demand the data you know folks are very well intentioned throughout the country they're really trying to do the right thing but the proof is in the pudding and we continue to see throughout this country particularly with low-income kids and even more so particularly low-income kids of color we continue to see disproportional and discipline disproportionate suspensions disproportionate explosions for the same types of activities that white students upper-income students are receiving different sort of reactions to we've gotten reports even recently of african-american students in certain school districts being sent home because they didn't have a belt on and there was a certain uniform policy these sort of practices Frank fundamentally contravene the equity mandates of s that we absolutely need more of the trauma-informed and restorative justice justice practices the absolute last resort for any school district particularly a school district that receives title one funds should be to send a baby home right so if a child makes a mistake kids are gonna make mistakes I have two kids I could never imagine my kids no can you sit and say I'm a kid don't get me started I say I'm gonna kick you out the house right you didn't do your homework you didn't do what me or your mom asked you'd do we're gonna kick you out the house go outside and it will figure out what we're gonna let you back in so the idea that we would kick babies out and send them back into the community is simply ridiculous and in fact we just saw a study of a kid who wasn't home and who actually was murdered on the way back home and so particularly when we have kids coming from communities filled with difficulty and trauma and the school is there always say to get away from that so clearly we need Congress to demand data to make sure that schools and states are doing the right thing well thank you for that mr. Chariman I think I'll ask a follow-up for the record as well about some of the best practices that you mentioned from legislation compassion in schools to some of the programs that you mentioned and get some best practices from you they might be helpful for the committee thank you thanks senator Kaine senator Murray

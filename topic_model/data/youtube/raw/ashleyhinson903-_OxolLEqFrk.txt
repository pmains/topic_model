you this um and i'll start with you congresswoman henson um when you look back on this first year is it what you expected it to be i mean how you know you you get here everybody's got an idea of what they think washington's going to be what congress is going to be how is it like or dislike what you expected it to be when you were first sworn in well i can say that uh it was full of unexpected surprises in the last year but one thing has been consistent and that's that you've got strong conservative women standing up to nancy pelosi every single day and we are taking speaker pelosi to task and that has been a lot of our work in the last year is holding this administration accountable for its big spending big government priorities so i think the most important thing we can do heading into this last few months of our first term in congress i hope there will be several more for for all of us but uh we have to make sure we fire nancy pelosi and take back the house so we can really get a lot of these priorities for the american people across the finish line congresswoman maclean i remember going up to capitol hill to the hotel where they kind of house you all and it was weird um because they had you kind of they didn't have the same opening events that normally greet a freshman class because of covid have you guys been able to overcome that and and develop the bonds and the relationships that normally would greet a freshman class well this is my first uh run in politics so i really don't know what it's supposed to look like i'm sure it's a lot it's a lot different but one of the things that i think has been a real a really good bonding experience is because of covid we've really been able to bond as a freshman class and i would say in smaller groups maybe um you know more dinners and whatnot but it's really bonded us together because quite frankly nobody not a lot of other people were there um and i would also say that our senior colleagues that have been extremely warm and welcome welcoming and cognizant to the fact that we haven't had a traditional freshman year so they have even extended the hand i think more than they would normally do just because they are cognizant of what we're going through congresswoman henson before you joined congress you were part of the media as a reporter now you're being covered by reporters do you feel like the coverage of you is fair how has it been being on the opposite side yeah well it depends on the day lindsay but what i would say is that i have tried to operate in my office in a way that i would expect as a journalist right i'm operating as a citizen legislator that has that background and so for me it's about using those skills to hold administration folks accountable asking those really important questions i go out and take those questions myself because i think that transparency and accessibility is really important i'm doing my 15th in person town hall this week um in the district so i've been out taking those tough questions from voters i take them from the media every week i do a weekly press call and you know what i think is that people deserve to have that kind of transparency and accessibility from their policymakers in washington dc and that should go on both sides of the aisle because clearly that's how we really start the process of of cleaning up washington a little sunshine goes a long way in my opinion congressman maclean you were in the private sector before joining congress what has it been like for you have you been able to bring some of that or has there been just so much red tape uh that it's frustrating or have you been able to implement that um it's a little frustrating i mean i mean look you could never run a business let alone your household like the government runs i mean we haven't even passed the budget from last year we just continued to kick the can down the road um and if i had a dollar for everyone that said oh you know politics isn't business and and you're right it's not business that doesn't mean that it shouldn't run like a business we need to get back to some common sense um little things like how about we talk about the budget you know we've gone back and we've been there for a year and we've talked about really a lot of progressive um ideas which the american population and the american people don't want how about we just get the mandatory things done first like the budget you know it's not it's really not that big of a stretch yeah it seems pretty uh realistic i want to get both your take four legs only 30 seconds each as sean mentioned you were a group of historic women republican women being elected to congress there's a push for more women now what is your advice to those running or those thinking about running congressman hinson i'll start with you 30 seconds yeah well strong women are making congress run and i would say that we have a great story to tell as conservative women the two reasons i stopped to run where their names are backs and jacks and i drive my minivan all over the district i would say to any conservative woman looking to step up and run you can do it make it work because our next generation truly depends on what we're doing for you

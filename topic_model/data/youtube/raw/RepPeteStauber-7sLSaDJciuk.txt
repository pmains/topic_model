good evening everyone and welcome to congressman pete sauber telephone town hall we are glad that you joined us tonight you will have the opportunity to hear about many issues that are important to Minnesota's eight congressional districts as well as what congressman Sabra has been working on in Washington DC you will also be able to speak directly with congressman's daughter to ask a question if you would like to ask congressman Sauber a question please press star 3 at any time during the call we look forward to thoughtful and respectful dialogue again press star 3 to ask a question at any time thank you good evening everyone this is congressman Pete Stauber and I am so glad that you all could join me for this telephone town hall I will start this call with a brief overview of recent legislation action and then open up the floor for you to ask questions as you heard Kelsey say please press star 3 if you would like to ask a question I want to begin by wishing you all a belated Happy New Year as we head further into 2020 I am reminded that it has been just over one year since I swore the oath of office I'm proud to report that over the course of this past year great work has been accomplished on behalf of Minnesota's eighth congressional district and I am looking forward to an even more productive year ahead 2020 is already off to a great start as just this afternoon President Trump signed the bipartisan US Mexico Canada trade agreement into law as you all know a great portion of Minnesota's economy is dependent on trade with Mexico and Canada so I supported this modernized trade deal since it was the first negotiated over a year ago by President Trump and proudly voted to pass it through the house last December the u.s. MCA will level the playing field for American workers expand markets generate 60 billion dollars in economic growth and create a hundred and seventy six thousand new jobs with many of those jobs coming to Minnesota I had the honor of joining the president at the White House for this historic moment and I look forward to seeing farmers workers and families across our district benefit from this 21st century trade deal for years to come again a reminder to please press star 3 to ask a question thanks to pro-growth policies of this administration our nation is currently experiencing the greatest economic economy in decades with record employment and rising wages we call it the blue-collar boom however in order to completely unleash the economic engine right here Minnesota's eighth District we need to ensure that all of our economic drivers are fully supportive you know in Northeast Minnesota mining is a huge part of our economy and now we have an exciting opportunity to expand this proud tradition with copper nickel mining and that's why I am incredibly disappointed that there were not one but two attempts to halt the responsible development of these god-given natural resources this past month a few weeks back we received the news that the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled too needlessly delay the polyMet project I found this news especially frustrating given the fact that polyMet has already passed 15 years of environmental reviews and permitting and in that time families across the district have been patiently waiting for the economic prosperity promised by this project not long after the polyMet announcement a Twin Cities based member of Congress with an anti mining agenda introduced legislation that would reinstate a mineral withdrawal in the Superior National Forest once again attempting to place this mineral rich area off-limits and robbed thousands of Minnesotans of their livelihoods it is incredibly insulting that the needs of people living the Northland continue to be disregarded by unelected judges and twin cities based members of Congress our jobs our communities and our livelihoods depend on the ability to responsibly source these resources so this Friday I will host a public event to give all of you the chance to demonstrate support for copper nickel mining if you are interested in standing alongside local miners union members business owners teachers and families in support of copper nickel mining then joined me this Friday January 31st at the Carpenters Union Hall in Virginia Minnesota at 2:00 p.m. again please join us this Friday January 31st at the Carpenters Union Hall in Virginia Minnesota 2:00 p.m. I want to take another moment to remind you to press star 3 to ask a question if we are to unleash the economic engine in our region it is also imperative that we improve critical infrastructure from our roads and bridges to our pipelines as a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee I will continue to fight for the replacement of Lion three pipeline this project will create thousands of jobs for hardworking union members bring billions of dollars in investment to the state and help safely deliver low-cost energy to our homes last week I had the honor of joining various industry leaders in Duluth to advocate for this project and sign the pipe based on the strong bipartisan support I see for this replacement pipeline I am hopeful that we can get it into the ground yet this year again please press star 3 to ask a question another issue that will remain a top priority of mine going forward is lowering the cost of health care and prescription drugs Minnesotans absolutely need affordable health care but unfortunately in recent years health care has become less affordable and the cost of prescription drugs have skyrocketed one pressing health care related issue that has been brought to my attention this past year is the rising cost of insulin these high costs often forced families and seniors to make the difficult choice between buying this critical medication or putting food on the table as more and more individuals across the nation die from rationing their insulin I believe that members of Congress have a moral obligation to act at the end of the year I introduced an amendment to the lower the to the lower drug cost now Act which would have dramatically lowered the cost of insulin for patients unfortunately politics got in the way of my amendment but I have not get given up and I will not give up just this week I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues in introducing the insulin affordability data collection Act which would help identify different opportunities to address the high costs of insulin but ultimately we need to ensure healthcare costs are dramatically lowered across the board whether it's defending critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid or fighting for individuals with pre-existing conditions I promise each and every one of you that I am 100% committed to this issue a reminder one more reminder to press star three to ask a question as your representative in Congress I am excited that constituent service remains a central function of our office whether it's helping veterans or seniors secure the benefits they deserve coordinating a tour of our United States Capitol for families visiting Washington DC or flying a flag over the United States Capitol to commemorate an important event or helping individuals navigate the difficulties of a federal agency my staff and I are here to serve you if you need assistance then I encourage you to call my office at two one eight four eight one sixty three ninety six again two and eight four eight one sixty three ninety six I also want to let you all know that every week I send out a newsletter to update my constituents on the work that I am doing on their behalf if you are not yet signed up to receive my newsletter please visit Stauber dot house.gov again if you want to sign up for my newsletter please visit Stauber dot house.gov i'm so honored and humbled to have the opportunity to represent you in Congress with that being said if you want to ask a question please press star three and we will get started with the questions thanks everybody all right thank you again for joining congressman Pete Stoppers telephone town hall don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up first we have a question from Lori from okay she has a question at robocalls Laurie you are now live on the coast hi thanks for taking my call I'm Laurie and I live in Coke a and I have this question we have several elderly people in our family as most people do and they are getting so many robo calls along with the rest of us and I know what happens all over we have everybody on a Do Not Call list and yet we still are getting these calls what can we do in the future and what has what's being taken place so that these calls stop yeah Laura that my folks are elderly I get that my folks get those calls and so do i and it's very very frustrating but I just want to let you know that last year I co-sponsored and helped pass it's called the trace at tra CED act which really strengthens our protections for consumers against these type of robo calls and matter of fact it's Lau right now so my concern is now we have to look into that enforcement mechanism but Laurie to your point it's really you know unacceptable throughout the day and the evening we get these calls and I mean I even get them periodically when I'm sitting at the desk here in our office so and and it can be a struggle for those our seniors that have to you know maybe not have the phone next to them and get up and find it's a some type of Robo call but I just want you to know that and that issue is is really one of many many bipartisan issues Laurie that that we're working in Congress to you know to to stop allowing that to happen so a very good question I appreciate it okay thank you Laurie for that question and so up next we have a question from an from Duluth and has a question about impeachment and you are now live on the call yes I was wondering how you feel about the impeachment of the president so and thanks for the call that's obviously it's very timely because the impeachment is not on the Senate but I would say that nobody is above the law nobody and I take the impeachment of a sitting president extremely serious I'll go back to last year when the leader of the House Speaker Pelosi said there will never and should never be impeachment unless that it's overwhelming compelling and bipartisan and she failed all three of those and I will say this that that in fact the vote on the House floor was actually a bipartisan vote not to impeach there was a member of New Jersey that that actually switched parties due to the impeachment and of course our own Colin Peterson and District seven voted against it and like Colin said this is hopelessly partisan and right now we're seeing that in the Senate I think the first day of questioning is happening we know that the facts are the facts we know that the transcript did not show any quid pro quo and we know that President Trump and President zalenski have both said there was no pressure a third fact the Ukraine did not know the aid was frozen that's the third fact the fourth fact aid was released with out Ukraine having to take any action and I think the bottom line here and is Pelosi that learned she have completely failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing and is up to the Senate I believe to reject this political sham this was the first time in the history of this country it was a partisan vote to impeach thanks for the question in okay thank you and I'm just a reminder to press star three to enter a question in the queue and so up next we have a question from Timothy from Barnum Timothy has a question on insulin Timothy Timothy you are now live on the call hello Pete the first thing I want to do is tell you I'm a retired detective from the cocaine's Lee's Department and we cross paths years ago I follow the job he's done and I'm and I'm pretty proud of the job you've done for our district my question is on the insulin I'm a type 2 diabetic I take two different types of insulin and a 30-day supply my out of pocket on it is over $1500 I simply on a fixed income can't afford that Tim thank you thanks for the question extremely important and there's a couple things I'll say that in the on hr3 i have an insulin amendment and this this will go to the the Medicare Part D and what it's what my amendment said that if you are a senior and you are Medicare eligible and you have to purchase insulin that because insulin is the most rebate able drug there is right now the rebates go to a middleman they're called the PBM the pharmacy benefit managers my amendment said that that rebate will now go to the consumer meaning you Tim so instead of when you purchase it you get the rebate just like every other purchase we make the consumer gets a rebate and the rebate currently is going to the PBM the pharmacy benefit manager the middleman and that's unacceptable and the speaker policy didn't even allow this to go on the floor for a debate this would have in most cases reduced the cost of that insulin 75% just upon initial signing into law and you know because of that you know I'm still fighting for the the all drugs including insulin to be more affordable and just today I introduced a bill with my colleague Angie Craig from Minneapolis area that will help data collection regarding insulin cost to make this the life-saving medication more affordable you know to us in the Northland and it will also say that what you're saying that it's extremely important Tim that we we get together and this to me to me this is really a nonpartisan or bipartisan work that we can do I will also say that under the I co-sponsored a legislation it's HR 19 and it establishes a max out-of-pocket up $3,100 a cap and that's for Medicare Part D that means no matter what no matter what the cost of your medication is the max anyone on Medicare will pay is $3,100 out of their pocket and HR 19 every aspect of HR 19 Tim came out of Energy and Commerce in a bipartisan fashion that's that's impressive unfortunately it did not pass the house because of politics and and that's the frustrating thing and so I can assure you Tim that I want to make sure that we continue to push this narrative and make sure that you're insulin is affordable and that you or anybody else will never have to ration it thanks for the question Tim and thank by the way thanks for your service thank you Tim and thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber Estela town hall again don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue so up next we have a question from Lisa from or she has a question on the listing the gray wolf Lisa you are now live on the thank you and I'd like to say too I really appreciate what you're doing for our district mr. Stuber and thank you for supporting line three yes thank you Lisa it's a preface it really a privilege to serve thanks for the comments what I would like is an update on how close we are to delisting the gray wolf and bringing management back to the States yeah back to the DNR so the delisting of the gray wolf as as you may know in 2012 the Obama administration rightfully stated that the the gray wolf has recuperated and they canned the gray wolf can now be taken off the endangered species list unfortunately there was a group that went to court and a judge in Washington DC ruled that the Obama administration was wrong to delist them and we know through statistics that the gray wolf has has come back and so myself I introduced a bill with seventh District Congressman Collin Peterson you know to work with the president Trump and his administration to delist the gray wolf and put that management back with the Minnesota DNR III know that the Minnesota DNR is fully capable of handling it but we know through statistics that the gray wolf has in fact come back and I think that's uh it's it's important that I also let you know that I introduced an amendment to the appropriations bill which codifies the delisting of the gray wolf on the heels of the Fish and Wildlife Services announcement they're going to delist it on the administrative side I I do I do believe that and and rightfully put it back into the hands of the Minnesota DNR you know I've got our office is called by farmers who had and ranchers that have had their a livestock eaten their dogs harmed even in the city of Duluth in fact and of course a big game hunters a Minnesota deer hunters Association fully supports it and and those of us who who are in the woods you know for those two weeks in November really we know that the gray wolves are extremely populated in in in Minnesota and other parts of the northern part of the country so Lisa I'm going to continue to work on D list in the gray wolf I think it's the right thing to do and I do think the about Obama administration made the right call in 2012 to delist them okay thank you Lisa and thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber Stella town hall again don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue and so up next we have Charles from big big for Charles you are now live on the call yes congressman solver I just wanted to ask if there is any way that we could still support your meeting this Friday for the nickel and copper mining is there a way we can support you in that even though we're not able to be there well I think that I'm yes obviously there's a couple ways to support to the support of Charles's is every opportunity that that we have to talk to our good friends and neighbors that that may not be interested in the subject I mean this is important we know that mining is our past or present or future and and one of the things that I always believe that the truth of facts and the science will lead us to good decisions and that's what we want here and I had I was sitting on the House floor Charles and a colleague of mine pointed up the gallery and say that guy's a friend of mine he's from New York and he doesn't want mining to happen in the Boundary Waters I said you tell your friend there will be no mining in the Boundary Waters there will be no mining in the buffer zone but per the 78 lot gives us the opportunity to mine those minerals outside and that was the agreement and so there's some type of misinformation out there that says we're mining in the Boundary Waters my colleague from Illinois talk to me about this he says oh he said when I told him there was going to be no mining in the Boundary Waters he he said oh I thought it was going to be inside the Boundary Waters because he comes up there with his family every year I said absolutely not so number one if you can't make it on Friday that of course that's fine but just let's let's have that good civil discussion in our communities about the importance of this not only is this copper nickel find the biggest copper nickel deposit that they found yet in the world it gives us us us an opportunity to mine these minerals which is going to help with their computers and their cell phones and our satellites and our national defense our defensive systems and we can do it and also alternative sources of energy we can line it safely using great labor standards and following every single rule the science the facts and the truth so I think Charles I think it's just have that have that discussion with their friends and neighbors that may be a you know add versed to it or they have been given maybe misinformation like I have in DC just in the last three weeks a couple people I don't want mining in the Boundary Waters I said mining will never happen in the Boundary Waters so I Charlie I think stay in the fight with us and I think it's really worth it because we have the opportunity in northeastern Minnesota to do something extremely special not only for a region economically it's an economic driver it's about unleashing the economic engine and keeping our you know the jobs in the economy going it's like bringing the Superbowl up there every year so I just want to remind people that the event is this Friday at 2 o'clock at the at the Carpenters Union Hall in Virginia so let your friends and neighbors know if you can make it Charles let your friends and neighbors know and then I also want to remind you that if you do have a question press star 3 and it will get to you the best we can but again if you can those of you can make it Friday January 31st this Friday at the Carpenters Union Hall in Virginia 2 p.m. so Carol thanks for the call from the wonderful city of Big Fork all right up next we have a question from Dan from cook on polyMet dan you are now live on the home thank you Thank You Pete for taking the call say this is Dan Worcester from cook and I was wondering polyMet and the DNR went through 14 or 15 years of permitting and environmental review only met I think bent around 400 million dollars doing this yep the DNR issues the permits and everything once gives one judge the qualifications or the right to revoke those permits well Dan that a great because it's a great pleasure and fits right now Road the industry area and can you hear me yeah right now let's see it's going to go to an administrative law judge and after 15 years of extensive permitting and public hearings and what have you and what we talk about is is a you know I think that the courts are are you know part of it but I really think that at some point the loyal opposition uses the courts and weapon eise's the courts against the process in hopes that that that a judge will rule an administrative law judge will rule and it really accepts a really really dangerous precedent dan when you can go to court and demand that administrative law judge look at that because there could be other projects around the entire state and if you have folks that don't support the project after it's been through the environmental process and if somebody could just take it to court and demand an administrative law hearing I think it sets a dangerous precedent and you'll see many business owners and the Chamber of Commerce they're really concerned about this and so Dan I think that as I said earlier as I said the Charles just stay positive use the science the truth and the facts on this let the science dictate you know I talk about our families our future our communities these are these are jobs we deserve to have good paying jobs in Northeast of Minnesota we are blessed with these natural resources and we will mine them safely keep the environment pristine and I think that the loyal opposition they're scare tactics and and and fear-mongering in there and I think this just we have the ability to do some good things thanks for the call then all right thank you Dan and thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber stela town hall again don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue and so up next we have a question from Liz from Herman town her question is on Medicare and Social Security Liz you are now live on the call high representative Sadler I recently read a Forbes magazine that the Republicans at the GOP is seriously looking at cutting making cuts in both Medicare and Social Security I mean we've paid into that our whole working lives it's not like it's you know free money there so I guess I want to know what your plan is to protect us from that thank you very much and I'm from Lindstrom not Oh from Lindstrom okay Lindstrom okay I thought it was Herman - okay so Liz you bring up a great point and and Social Security and Medicare will be protected and I will not allow some of these proposals coming from some Democrat leadership I will not allow them to take your current Medicare away you said something you paid into it for years it's something that this our government promised promises made promises kept and I will not allow your current Medicare to be taken from you with some of these proposals that are coming from certain people running for president can you imagine the entire country on that program and I think that it's concerning and I know that we could do better and we have put some things forward and you know working through some of the things some of the proposals on both sides you know I really really believe that that we can do things and then I mean this problem this concern has been around for a long time but I want to be able to tell you that I want to protect Social Security and Medicare because what you said you said you've earned it you paid into it and it wasn't free and I agree with that I want to make sure that that you understand that I will never vote to cut these programs thank you for your question Liz okay Thank You Liz before we go on to the next question you're going to have a quick announcement from congressman solder on the census yeah you know the I want to take a quick moment to discuss the importance of United States Census and remind everyone to respond to the survey you know our US Constitution mandates a census to ensure we have an accurate count of our citizens nationwide this is crucial to ensure Congress and the federal government can accurately administer services the state of Minnesota has a lot at stake the fifteen and a half billion dollars in federal funds that support Minnesota schools hospitals agriculture first responders our roads businesses and households all are allocated using the census data so the US Census and I want to let you know also that the US Census is hiring these part-time positions are available in every county and pay up to twenty seven dollars an hour if you would like to apply I want you to please visit 2020 census gov flash jobs once again that's 2020 census gov slash jobs and I think it's important that census is it is critically important that we that everybody is counted I remember talking to somebody whose father lives in rural part of Minnesota and says you know my father deserves to be counted and I looked at her I said I too want your father to ensure that he is counted to he matters in our census so important sense is coming up and it'll dictate a lot of fun so okay up next we have a question from guy from Brainerd guys question is on bipartisanship guy you are now live on the call Thank You Thank You congressman you know I found it very encouraging that a stronghold like the eighth District which for my whole life has been inaccessible to anyone but the Democratic Party was taken from them and I congratulate you on that however I'm trying to find out how you think it is possible to engage in bipartisan bipartisan ISM with what is essentially a criminal enterprise the Democratic Party and I don't think you have to look past Elon omar keith Ellison 70% vote totals in the state of Minnesota for both of them it's you know Joe Stalin used to say it doesn't matter who votes it matters who counts the votes and I think we've seen an election in the after election not only in Minnesota but around the country including the last election that there's an awful lot of shenanigans going around and this idea that we can somehow make peace with a party gone as mad as the Democrats have and a party that seems to not be willing to engage in the fight like the Republican Party is I'm as worried about the Republican senators in the impeachment as I am about anything else and what I would like to see is someone like yourself grow a few punches and let people understand that people we elect to Congress to drain the swamp intend to do so I'd love to hear you talk about that yeah first up you know I do want to tell you guy that that there is there's common ground that exists in Washington I want to talk about when I was what I was running for for this office I said I'm not only going to reach across the aisle but I'm going to get up walk over and build relations across the aisle and I'm one of 48 members in the problem-solvers caucus and that's 24 Republicans and 24 Democrats and we were a guy we work together across the aisle they're good meetings in fact the problem solvers caucus was the reason was was one of the big reasons the government came out of the shutdown last year and I think it's important that we recognize that our commonalities far we are differences and I can have and I think we should have that civil of you know argument using civility without compromising our principles and I think that is a healthy way I can have I have built good relations across the aisle having good discussions and and and you know through you know I'm not doing any and I'm not you know reducing our principles in any way shape or form it's an opportunity for me to educate many of these calls a questions on the calls I've worked through the problem-solvers caucus and and I believe guy I believe in people in that government I believe in people and not any political party and and here's I love the game of hockey here's just a example I want to give to you guy on the other listeners her Brooks is a great great hockey coach unfortunately he passed too early but great hockey coach he said the name on the front of the jersey means more than the name on the back can you imagine the mountains we could move had we had all were USA shirts everyone had a USA shirt No Name no number no party label on the back and we went and in moved mountains in this country I believe in the people and the the divisiveness in Washington is there you see it on the news every single night but I see in some respects a different DC because I'm finding common ground in between the in between the guardrails guy and I don't have to compromise any of our principles to be effective and I think that I think we're doing a good work my you know my work and my my votes and my legislation they speak for themselves and you know and I think that just like I say earlier guy common common grounds exists and and without having left our principles we're getting a lot of stuff done and I'm very proud of our office so great question great question okay thank you guy and thank you again for joining the cella town hall tonight again just reminder to press star 3 if you have a question and so up next we have a question from a Krista from Hibbing her question is on human trafficking Krista you are now live on the call good evening congressman Stauber we celebrated huge when we heard you're running for re-election so there's banana bread up here and Hibbing for you anytime you want it I noticed you've been working on human trafficking and I work at Delta Airlines when I can work and I know that's a big thing that we deal with in the airlines but up here on the range I'm starting to get more and more concerned I was glad to see that you're you're looking into the human trafficking being an international district because of our border I'm starting to now see more and more news feeds about fraudulent money coming across the border drugs coming across northern border there was actually frog that besides president money tangible items as well that are what can get done in Washington to protect our northern states in our northern districts because the tighter itself gets the more the north is going to be utilized and we want to be ahead of it yeah Krista you're exactly right you know we have we talked about having our southern border secured we also have a northern border that you rightfully point out that that needs to be secured and you know for all the reasons you mentioned I do want to talk about the human trafficking and and just tell you that that you know 23 years as a police officer I've seen firsthand the horrifying reality and human trafficking happens every single day in the Northland and let me tell you northern Minnesota is proportionately higher we know that human trafficking it's a modern-day form of slavery and you know those traffickers treat their victims like possessions and it is absolutely wrong and there's zero place in in our world for it and and I thought tyre sleeve is even as a police officer to end the heinous crime and and I am committed as a member of Congress to continued the important mission that you know as a member of Congress and I am a couple of things older share with you Kristin there the listers I joined the human trafficking caucus this is a group of members of reviews we look at cutting-edge research on various forms of human trafficking and really as well as best practices to fight human trafficking you know I like a co-sponsor of several bills I was at the I was at the you know the Duluth event talking about a January human trafficking month and what we need to do in the advocacy programs supporting them and you know just last week we were in Grand Rapids uh you know with support Within Reach and this was a group of advocates that are that are on the frontlines with law enforcement and had members of our Native American community on that panel understood that a Native American a man or woman is ten times more likely to be trafficked and so those those are alarming statistics and and I for one and this is a couple minutes ago I talked about legislating in between the guardrails the human trafficking is is is so nonpartisan bipartisan we're working on both sides yell to to put legislation that's effective and to make sure it stopped would make sure we take care of the victims get them to help indeed and for sure make sure that we we prosecute the offenders we those that traffickers are going to be dealt with and and they're going to pay for their crime it's horrendous and I've seen it firsthand and many of the advocacy programs have and the advocates themselves and we need to make sure that these victims are treated and taken care of I also am a co-sponsor of Savannah's act you know these are these are pieces the legislation in DC that are said that we're moving on it and we're we're moving in a really rapid pace and it's a number one we need to and number two every day somebody a boy or girl man or woman is traffic in the state of Minnesota and a particular northern Minnesota and I for one will do whatever I can to end this heinous crime thanks for the call Krista okay thank you Krista up next we have a question from Brett from McGregor Brett has a question on rural broadband Brett you are now live on the call good evening Pete ain't Brett how you doing good my question is Pete what about the high-speed Internet for out here in rural areas I mean it's only good for our schools for our people at do home schooling for home healthcare for the medical or we see many progress in that peat bread thanks for the call great to hear your voice the answer is yes you know broadband we know that the high speed reliable internet it's not it's not a luxury anymore it's a necessity and especially for rural Minnesota like you talked about that Brett you know I'm a co-sponsor of both a broadband data act and the broadband Maps act you know these bills are going to require that the granular data collected on the broadband service and they're going to make it unlawful for a person to knowingly submit an inaccurate broadband service data and these bills passed the house we need to make sure our mapping is correct and that we put our investments in those areas breadth of rural Minnesota and really rural America that need it and you know you mentioned you rightfully so Brett mentioned that the school's the hospitals we need our schools or hospitals our businesses to stay competitive and to do that we have to make sure that rural high speed internet is available to everybody and that's that's part of our transportation infrastructure bill or parts of it and also the Small Business Committee we're working on that because we know that many small businesses if they are able to you know get the high-speed Internet they can actually move their business and some of the metro areas and bring them to you know our smaller communities or rural Minnesota and live our quality of life and they can still you know keep their business so it's important breath that's a really timely question and again this is another legislation in between the bear grylls it's non partisan despite bars is extremely important and you know like I say our rural schools and our our rural students deserve the best and they don't take a second test or backseat to anybody our rural hospitals or clinics or rural libraries rural small business are just as important to have them connected to the Internet as anybody in any metropolitan area so breath that's a that's a great question thanks for asking it okay Thank You Brett so up next we have a question from Cory from Grand Rapids Cory has a question Cory you are now live on all hey Pete I bet I've been in the logging industry my whole life and I was wiring what you think you could do to maybe influence somebody to bring a new mill in or former cooperative with loggers to try and bring down this stumpage battle that we have going mm-hmm well Cory you're you've been in the business long enough you know that that number one the logging business the timber business is a huge economic driver in our region and we can talk about you know some of the businesses we can try and bring in you know the potential LP plant and cook that's going to be that's something we've talked about but it's going to talk it's going to take the EPA to make the Rin change to allow non merchantable timber for instance to be used for biofuel I mean we it's an excellent way as you know according to clean up our forest floor to keep the economy going to keep you employed and others employed and I think it's really important to to let you know that I supported an increase in the timber sales and the appropriate in the appropriations bill and that I secured seven billion more dollars to expand this program which is going to help us right you know in the heartland in our forests and the thing that is really the concerning is is disappearing the Chippewa National Forest that the the allowable sale I want to push it as close to a hundred percent if not a hundred percent but it's going to take some time and and Cory you know that in the Superior National Forest where those timber sales are going up about 16 17% that's better than where it was and now we want to have the Chippewa too and it's about building relations with those foresters in this area in bringing in experts like you Cory to help guide the discussion you're the experts you are the you manage the forests the best and I just can't tell you how important that the logging and trucking industry is to the entire state of Minnesota and you know we want it we want to be able to harvest these the wood when it's when it's the right time when it's mature we don't want it to die in and and you know land the forest floor without having the ability it's a great renewable resource and and forestry management is really important but we have what we have as a federal legislature you know we're working on those federal lands to be able to make sure that you and other logging companies have the ability to you know help us with the forest management make a good living you know cut the trees they're renewable we use them for in our in our industries you talk about the paper and pulp industries and I think it's important that that we that's still focus that's one of the economic drivers that we talk about when I talk about unleashing the economic engine core that is includes the logging and trucking community and thanks for the question Cory okay thank you Cory and just a reminder to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue up next we have a question from Dan from Randall dan has a question on Veterans and you are now live on the call thank you and tell you well thanks Pete for having the town-hall meeting yes and you know as the mayor of Randall and also has a commander of Morrison County Disabled American Veterans chapter number 12 hey you know I want to thank you and all the other congressmen for all you the bills that you've passed this year for veterans I know the president just signs a Widow's tax bill and then they cite they cleared the Bluewater Navy bill back now there's a lot of things going on up there for veterans that individuals it's a local level here are concerned concerned about and happy about yeah yeah well I yeah I just saw the one I know if you knew that there's still there's still people pushing to move the fishing museum out of the city of Little Falls which Little Falls is actively continuing to try to to keep it there even though with the underlying individuals but I didn't know if you'd heard much about that or is it you know since you're from this area yeah you know I've heard a little bit about that mayor but I want to tie let's get back to the veterans and I am extremely and I talked about that that what are the goals is make sure we take care of our constituents and our veterans and their priority I'm extremely proud of what we've been able to do to be able to take care of our veterans I want to make sure that you and other veterans get the care that they promised and the benefits that they promised and earned just a couple of bills I want to talk to you about I introduced the fair care for Vietnam veterans Act in this legislation ads for illnesses to it it adds Parkinson's bladder cancer hypertension and hypothyroidism to the list of presumptive diseases associated with Agent Orange and I'm very very proud to have introduced that those are four diseases or illnesses that research has indicated that the exposure to Agent Orange had to have had a probability of being a factor in people getting you know those illnesses and and I'm very proud of another bill the veterans access to child care and this the legislation is going to make a child care pilot program permanent you know the program offers free child care for call veterans using VA healthcare services and that passed the house - and so the veterans are are and will continue to be a priority for me as you know Dan my-my wife spent just under 25 years in the military issues an Iraq war veteran and you know I as a family of the military family I understand firsthand and and the veterans issues and the concerns we have and I'm going to be a champion so mayor thanks for your question and just I think to all the listeners please know that the veterans are extremely important to me okay I suggest a reminder that if you want to ask a question please press star 3 to do so and so up next we have a question from Joan from Duluth Joan has a crashing on gun violence Joanie you are now live on the call hi Thank You representative stopper you and I have met on several occasions yes and Joan before you asked the question I really appreciate your contact to our office reference that prevent fire a family fire act I appreciate it right well thank you for supporting that for those on the call who don't know it's a bill that would provide incentives for gun dealers to to give safe storage devices to people who purchase guns and safe storage is very key to preventing suicides preventing young children from getting their hands on guns so it's a it's a good bill and thank you for that so Joan adulter Joan it also provides tax credits to the retail yes retailers right all the firearms - yeah right right yep so I've been listening for a long time I'm in a minority on this call I believe I'm a Democrat but I'm your constituent and I need to assure somebody who mentioned the Democrats have gone mad that I haven't gone mad and I don't think the Democratic Party has gone mad but so I represent 84 percent of Minnesotans and ninety-seven percent of Americans who what background checks on all gun sales and you did vote against that you and I have talked about that but now there's a possible bill that may come up but not sure when or if the extremist protection order bill which would allow people to report someone who could be a danger to themselves or others to law enforcement and law enforcement can temporarily removed firearms from the situation there were there was testimony on the bill that's coming in the well it may not ever get a hearing a real hearing in the Minnesota Senate on last week in giving there was a hearing this is a bill that could save lives it could save the lives of veterans your previous color talked about veterans 22 veterans a day commit suicide most of those are my firearm if it's allowed to temporarily remove a firearm we could save lives and so if that bill were to come to the house would you support it well I have to you know I'd have to take a take a look at it the actual particulars but Joel you brought up some you know a bill that I I supported and and I also want to let you know Joan that that I'm a co-sponsor of the 21st century NICs act a very good piece of legislation and it permits the National instant criminal background check you know the NIC system to access the national data exchange it's the index as part of a higher background check and the index was established after September 11th and that uses criminal records from federal local and state agencies and I think that's important too to add you know to look at and I'm proud of that an NS D I think Joan you and I have can agree that that there is definitely ways that we can you know keep our community safe as a law enforcement officer nobody wants a drug dealer habitual criminal or somebody in Isis to possess or be able to purchase I think that the due process part of it it is it is part of the Constitution it's the Second Amendment and I think there's a conversations going on and you've been part of them for thirty years about the the ability to work together get get something that that we think works and and and I applaud you for your efforts and I want you to know and I want the listeners to know that Joe and I respect what you're doing and every time unit you and I have that interaction it has been civil I respect your opinion and and I respect you know what what what you've done you know going forward I just want to make sure that that when we do this we preserve the rights and you know as we move forward because it because we don't want to take anybody's you know rights away at this point and I think that there's it if there's a will there's a way I think that working through it and a lot of discussion I mean it's the very this is a great topic and for those of you don't know I was a victim of two violent gun crimes and and our local paper the Duluth News Tribune brought one to your attention a couple weeks ago a very detailed and you know I guess we'll go from there but Joan please know that that I appreciate you I appreciate your views and I appreciate your civility everyone we have time for just one more question and that question is going to Warren from cloquet Warren has a question on the federal deficit Warren you're now live on the call thank you for your support first of all of our military men and women we first had a chance to meet at the ruck march a few years ago and I'd like you to just - thank you for doing such an honorable job your first year it is just great to have a voice in northeastern Minnesota for the first time in 40 years just keep doing what you're doing with the integrity you're doing it we really applaud you for that my question people with all of the day-to-day issues and the real needs that we do have how do we address that elephant in the room that trillion dollar deficit that keeps growing and I know that's not an easy question with a short answer but how do we get both sides of the aisle to to look at tackling that for our kids in our grandkids Pete thank you all hang up and listen and I appreciate everything you're doing that thanks Warren for thanks Warren for the question and I appreciate the comments so you know I've talked about Washington DC being bipartisan let's the elephant in the room as Warren says let's let's understand that this issue that our national debt has come from both sides of the aisle and so once we understand that stop the blame game and now let's get to work and and reduce and not give that next generation a country that is so far in debt they can't get out you know I've been here 13 months and I see I see opportunities where we can you know we can we can invest in programs that are working really really good and then some programs they may not be working so good and maybe we not ought to invest in that but change it up a little bit or I mean there's we're talking about this every day and this is a bipartisan problem it is it's a it's a problem that the debt deficit there's when we look at it the holistic holistically we have to come together and and work on you know we talked about the elephant in the room you have to you have to take the elephant down one bite at a time so one little area that we can save one little you know a part of you know XYZ Department in our federal government that that could be reduced a little bit at a time when you add it all up it it can come to be a lot of money and let me tell you something to the listeners the the federal government is we know that we can cut waste fraud and abuse we see it and one of the things that we as a group you know whether it's the Energy and Commerce or the Ways and Means Committee which I'm not on but there's there's there's waste fraud and abuse in every part of our government and every single day we can look we have the option of cutting it to review it and it's a it is a problem that we all have I mean this is we didn't get it we didn't get to this debt overnight and we're not going to get out of it overnight but we have to start and start we will and I know under this president you know he spoke a couple months ago talked about the ability to you know reduce our the national debt so our children don't have to you know live with in in such an indented nation and we can do it but I think everybody is going to have to everybody is going to have to be a part of it not just this group that group you know other groups everybody is going to have to be a part of the solution and like I say I believe in people and not governments and I believe in people and not political parties Warren and and we have the ability to do that and after 13 months I'm seeing some areas where we certainly have the opportunity to user use our dollars wisely use our dollars wisely and and I think that we're doing it on the transportation infrastructure committee trying to allow permits to to move forward faster rather than the continuously delayed for instance bridge projects or more more studies or what of you and that just delays projects makes them more expensive and you know there's ways to do it and we're doing it and listen this is it's a problem that both parties are responsible for that's the elephant in the room and both parties will solve this and it's a great question one I appreciate your your comments and I'm really sorry that we couldn't get to everyone who wanted to ask a question tonight but I think that you know I will say that before we end this call I just want to thank you all for participating in the telephone Town Hall tonight and I appreciate the productive discussions and I value your feedback it's an honor and a privilege to serve you all in Congress

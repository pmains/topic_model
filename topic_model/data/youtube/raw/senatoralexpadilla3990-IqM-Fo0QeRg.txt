the bureau of labor statistics predicts that over the next eight years jobs and stem fuels will grow 10.5 percent to more than 11 million in the united states now filling these jobs will be critical to protecting our supply chains growing our economy and keeping the united states at the forefront of technology and innovation however there's just enough qualified american stem graduates to meet our country needs and by 2030 there will be an estimated 2.5 million stem job vacancies uh miss love are you still with us if so i'd love to i am okay wonderful i want to direct this question to you given your role and expertise you said in your written testimony that quote we should stop treating people like liabilities that need to be managed and start treating them like assets that can be developed for the betterment of our country and communities end quote why is doing so for students important for the united states to remain at the forefront of technology and innovation well i have always thought it's ridiculous that we would have students come to our country learn and gain the expertise that they have and then we ship people off to just compete against us it makes no sense this is why i emphasize we can't just i i am i've always been a a supporter of doing something for daca recipients but we have a multi-pronged issue that we have to face for instance we need to emphasize that cross-border migration jeopardizes opportunities to come to the united states legally in the future and we can't forget that recipients of h-1b visas are waiting in long lines we are doing not just migrants a disservice but we're doing a disservice to the american people in all aspects so i am again am emphasizing and pleading with congress to continue to do the work it's not acceptable for us to remain a country that does not have good immigration policy that reflects our needs and our compassion yeah thank you and actually i agree uh wholeheartedly uh but think it may be helpful for the sake of making progress to recognize that we have to recognize those different populations i mean for all the times i hear something about the southern border the southern border the southern border an individual or a family coming to the southern border of the united states seeking asylum which is lawful based on federal law and international law it's a very different group of people than the millions who have been in the united states for years and years and years working paying taxes raising families raising doctors we shouldn't hold have one situation keep us from doing rights uh by the millions of immigrants both documented and especially undocumented um that deserve better that it's in our national interest i want to transition to a different topic you know this spring more than 100 000 undocumented young people will graduate from high school yet an overwhelming majority of those graduates are ineligible for daca because they entered the united states after the daca required arrival date of june 15 2007 so that they fit all the other criteria of daca minus the fact that it's been 10 years since taco was signed in fact daca recipients or students who are potentially eligible for daca as written now represent less than half of the undocumented college and university student population undocumented students are generally barred by federal law from accessing in-state tuition and financial aid but some states and i'll give credit to texas for having been the first followed soon after by my home state of california passed laws to make in-state tuition and financial aid available to undocumented students other states however are doing the opposite by actively preventing undocumented students from even enrolling in public universities first uh dr larissa i know you spoke to this in response to a question from senator booker just wanted to offer you another minute if you wanted to add or expand on your prior comments yes thank you senator um yeah i think this is such an important um really piece of information to focus on knowing that there's more than 100 000 undocumented young people that will graduate and not really uh have the ability to continue with their lives in a way they will be barred from entering the workforce and face more challenges to accessing a college education and truly it's a disservice to to our country to know that all of this potential can be lost for me when i think about the challenges they will face maybe in some states they won't even be able to access a driver's license to to get to class assuming they even are able to be allowed to study in a home institution and have the ability to pay for tuition um i also think about again a lot about mental health piece too because all of these laws and all of this in action comes down with great impunity in the human body um and we're sending a message right we're sending a message to them that that their contributions are are not enough and uh and that their lives don't matter when we don't change laws and we continue to to have them live in limbo um so i think it's time that we we help change this message thank you i'll just also add for the record that many many many of these uh undocumented students graduating high school will do so as their school valedictorians and their valedictor valedictorian speeches in graduation just break my heart mr barella understand well we got a minute ago that there's some states that are actually moving to make it harder for undocumented immigrants to attend college or be eligible for financial aid can you describe what the impacts of these changes to the law or proposed changes to the law would be both for students and again the universities as institutions thank you chairman we know from the national conference of state legislatures that there are 19 states that currently do provide in-state tuition for undocumented students but that leaves you know my math is bad right now 31 i believe is the number from doing my math correctly uh that would not have those same uh those same policies and could potentially right now be passing a legislature that would make it impossible for them to access that in-state tuition this would be a major barrier uh inter you know daca students undocumented students uh it is hard to uh plan for a future when you don't know if you will be able to graduate uh to afford a college education but then to be able to graduate and work and stay in the u.s that fear of deportation would be there and it's hard to invest in yourself when you are uncertain of what that future may look like so it has a huge negative impact on our society by us not being able to take full advantage of the contributions that undocumented students make to this country but for universities we have a declining enrollment in domestic student enrollment in this country we have had five consecutive semesters of declining enrollment by u.s students in our universities there's capacity there are seats we should not be limiting uh who can who can achieve and be able to attend those universities and and use their talents to the fullest thank you thank you uh and final subject i want to make sure we get on the record here today and that's the impact of international students on universities and communities and our economy international students studying in the united states contribute roughly 41 billion dollars to our economy and support more than 458 000 jobs about one out of every five entrepreneurs who have founded a startup in the united states is an immigrant one in five and three quarters of those founders first came to united states as students specifically immigrant entrepreneurs who have founded a startup in the united states are likely to start their companies in the same state in which they were educated clear direct nexus particularly where they receive their graduate education the economic impact of international students is very clear but international students can also enrich the educational experience of u.s citizens by exposing their fellow students to new perspectives and new ideas international students like all immigrants bring tremendous value to this country mr barola can just elaborate a bit more on the benefits international students bring to the experience of domestic students in the united states thank you mr chairman uh domestic students americans benefit tremendously from international students both in the short i shouldn't say both but in the short the medium and the long term in the short term they're in classes they're learning from international students gaining different perspectives those classroom discussions those discussions in the dormitories at night all add to the educational experience for domestic students and international students also are paying full tuition to attend our universities they are also adding economic activity directly into those cities uh they are going to grocery stores buying groceries they are renting rooms out from uh from community members that have a spare room in their house and they are uh you know investing and contributing to the local economy by going to restaurants and and whatnot so they bring tremendous immediate economic benefit to the u.s and the communities but in the long term as you mentioned they are founding companies they are leading in research maduro pharmaceuticals was started by an international student they are employing americans after graduation and they're helping work with americans to build our research and our technology thank you very much

I think the gentleman from South Carolina is misusing the word preempt to preempt means to prevent the state law from being effective to supplement means that you have to obey the state law and you have to pay the federal law legitimate yield for a I'm sorry I only have five minutes of the mayor if the chair will yield me additional time I will yield geral yield an additional 30 seconds I will yield the gentleman 30 seconds we had this discussion last time with Minister silver rule was here my state has a law that has a two day waiting period they are proposing a regulation that is a 60 day waiting period and my question is doesn't thus the federal regulation preempts state law and I think you would agree that it would no I would not reclaiming my time if the federal law requires me to wear a belt and the state law requires me to wear suspenders I will comply with both laws if you take the position that the state legislators are in the best position to provide consumer protection then you should repeal dodd-frank as I'm sure or at least these provisions of dodd-frank as I'm sure has some support on your side of the aisle when we passed the law establishing the CFPB we decided that in addition to following state law which might provide a two day period there could also there will also be an additional federal law now you can say that a state that decides to have no regulation in a financial area has made a conscious decision that that is the best policy for that state but we passed a federal law to say that there will be standards preempt is when you tell a company they don't have to comply with state law supplement is when you say you have to comply with the state law plus you must comply with the federal law mr. cadre thank you for all you do part of what you do is coming here to Congress so that we can comment on what you do and perhaps help you an even better John I think I just learned from you a little bit so I appreciate that okay now as to mr. stiver letter there are some who say that that a letter signed by many of us and I want to say I signed the letter and I bet step ahead of you I've read the letter it does cite code section 10 22 b3 and quotes it accurately and some have said well therefore it's in favor of exempting some of smaller institutions so toddlers wouldn't be wearing shirts at all but in fact it what it calls for is look at each regulation determine whether you can have a one-size-fits-all regulation i buy hats and one-size-fits-all or shirts need to be tailored to the right size and the only asked in the letter is to be sure that you regulations don't have unintended consequences and the specific focus is that when you write a regulation and you would want a different regulation or a different approach for smaller institutions that you have a portion of the regulation ably will the smaller institutions that that that's sound advice and it's something we will continue to try to heed yes and there may be individual circumstances where we bring to your time will be glad to take input on that in particular issues yeah we talked a couple days ago you Virg financial institutions to use text messages and thank you for saying you'll go to the FCC and make sure that the FCC will allow financial institutions to use text messages if i can get a text message from my bank telling me i'm about to overdraft my account pay my phone company a nickel to get that that information i want to focus on tread these are complicated regulations are particularly complicated for smaller financial institutions i want to commend you for having the hold harmless period and institutions would like to get more written guidance as to how to apply the regs and what remediation steps they should take when remediation is necessary we've talked about either hold harmless period continuing and I think you should continue the hold harmless period at least until you can issue the interpretations necessary to provide written written guidance so that may go on forever but will continue to be very attentive to the industry and we've encouraged them to bring us their their prioritized at least as long as it takes two to answer the questions that have emerged in the lab in the first four months obviously some new a question could come up and finally as we've talked the regulations require an inaccurate statement as to the cost of title insurance in those states like California where there's a buyers policy and a owners policy and you get a discount on the owners policy when you get the lender's policy to correct the record there's a lender's policy and there's a buyer's policy mm-hmm I was actually reminded I gave you an extra 30 seconds so you got 14 to them oh thank you go to town so in any case mr. mr. Cod Raya you will be looking to make sure that the regulations deal with the situation where there's a stated price for the policy the buyer of the home is going to pay for uh but there's an automatic discount that what's disclosed is the is the net price that the I know that's an issue that's been under active consideration during the rulemaking process and and I believe since the time of

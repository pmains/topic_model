my top priority in Congress is to lower the cost of your health care I know firsthand how broken our health care system is I've had to sell items on eBay to pay for medical bills when I gave birth to my son I've been dropped from my insurance company and I know these aren't the worst of the stories because I've heard from Iowans who have been forced into debt from medical bills or who don't have access to life-saving care or have to choose between paying for their prescription drugs or putting food on the table and no Iowan no American should ever have to make that choice in my first 200 days in office I'm proud to have voted for bipartisan proposals to lower the cost of prescription drugs ensure protections for Iowans with pre-existing conditions and permanently repeal a provision within the Affordable Care Act that would raise premium prices on Iowa families I've said from day one that the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect but we can't go back to a time when insurance companies could deny coverage for Iowans with pre-existing conditions refuse to cover essential services like prescription drugs or charge women more earlier this year I toured rural health facilities across the district and learned about the unique challenges of providing access to quality affordable health care in rural communities I introduced bipartisan legislation to provide much-needed relief to rural hospitals by repealing burdensome regulations that make it more difficult for these hospitals to provide quality care this legislation has passed out of the Ways and Means Committee with bipartisan support and now heads to the floor for consideration as a member of the congressional health care task force I'm committed to working with Democrats and Republicans to advance practical bipartisan solutions to improve our health care system and lower costs for Iowa families you

Republican Florida congresswoman Kat camek who is calling for DHS secretary Alejandro mallorcas to step down and congresswoman Kevin McCarthy echoing the same words as you are that he should step down then is it impeachment if he doesn't absolutely I think all options are on the table when you have lied to Congress you've lied to the American people you have quite frankly ignored the fact that there is a humanitarian a national security and Public Health crisis playing out on our Southwest border you have either been negligent in your duties or you have just chosen not to do them neither is acceptable so we're going to do the investigation that is necessary and if Alejandro mayorkas does not step down before January 3rd then we will take those investigations and we will lay the groundwork for impeachment that's what's on the table and that's what needs to be done the Border has to be secure this this has come up before it came up yesterday morning and the pushback on on the impeachment and career hearing uh push for impeachment was that he's got several jobs and that the border is just one of those jobs your reaction to that that's just ridiculous the the homeland security secretary is charged with the National Security of this nation it's Homeland Security and when you have an open border that is open entirely at the will of this Administration that's just unacceptable up to this point we have seen just this year 98 individuals on the international terrorist watch list that have been apprehended God knows how many more have gotten through I mean when you have millions and millions of people who have come here they have not been vetted it's an open border policy and you have a trafficking operation that is taking place on our very watch really at the behest of this Administration I mean that that's just absolutely insane uh for him to say that he has many hats and this is just one of them well he takes full responsibility because he is in fact the Secretary of Homeland Security and he told me himself that the buck stops with him and it's going to well and to be clear it was Defenders of him speaking on his behalf yesterday saying that whether it's the Secret Service or or you know the FAA the skies the the ports uh that you know his job is all-encompassing fair enough but maybe he can walk and chew gum at the same time you know I do want to ask you about title 42. that's coming to an end but the Border crisis continues and we're looking at another year of record numbers of migrants coming over the only people that are benefiting this are the cartels uh yes are we are we misguided and maybe instead of going after my orcas maybe the push needs to be for for let's support our border agents who are helpless who are committing suicide who are struggling with alcoholism because this Administration the body Administration does not seem to have their back can we focus on that and turn somewhat of a positive into the disaster that is the southern border yeah I mean to your point you know can we walk into gum at the same time absolutely and we need to be doing that we can secure the Border while supporting our border patrol agents we can actually take on the cartels while ensuring that the border is secure we can uh execute on a humanitarian Mission without having an open border policy we can do all these things it just takes the will and the policy I've talked to I can't tell you how many border patrol agents and they say you know we just need a policy we want to be able to do the job that we signed up for and right now this Administration is prohibiting us from doing that so if we're going to address the root issue here of border security we've got to give the policy we can add technology and force multipliers we can add more manpower but until we actually have the willpower in the White House to uphold the laws that are currently on the books nothing's going to change so that's first and foremost what Congress has to do we've got to put pressure on this Administration actually uphold the law as it is written instead of manufacturing a new law by executive order by his phone and pen and making comments that basically give our South American neighbors the impression that the border is wide open and just come on over which is exactly what he did when he came into office uh congresswoman it's great to see you thank you so good to see you all right have a good one

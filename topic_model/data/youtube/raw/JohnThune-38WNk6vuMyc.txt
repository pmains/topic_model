joining us now from Center Finance he is Senator John thune Senator it's a pleasure having you on you are the Senate Republican whip Senators critics say this FTX Story shows what a phony thing fake thing woke capitalism is companies using investor money to go woke for political purposes FTX Dan Bishop is saying he it it had higher ESG scores and Exxon Mobil and still was a fraud even Sam bankman freed made fun of ESG as quote dumb and I'll talk what do you think of all this well I tell you what to me what this and other things that we're learning more about Liz suggests is just what a danger this ESG agenda is you have all these big investment firms in this country and you've got an Administration a government basically that is using government power through financial insecurities Regulators to pressure investors not to invest in certain sectors of our economy namely oil and gas but the thing that we worry about in the future is they're going to start coming after agriculture farms and ranches ranches livestock producers you know who raise livestock they emit methane so it doesn't fit within the ESG parameters of what is a you know approved investment for these liberal uh woke you know companies that are participating in this agenda so I think this is a really dangerous thing I think it's something that we we've got to shine more of a light on Expose and help the American people understand what's really at risk here yeah Sam Baker freed was proponent and so was his parents about effective altruism we got to ask you this what what's with the timing of the administration arresting bankman freed a day before with his Hearing in Congress shouldn't they get him under oath and use that the statements under oath for the case against them I mean this fraud has been out there for a month is it because he has a Flight Risk was he about to embarrass DC well I don't know the answer on with respect to the timing or on all that hopefully we'll find out more about that but you know what I do know is yes we need to get answers in this and it would have been nice to have him under oath we've had him uh testify in the past in in front of various committees up here but certainly since this has all happened uh he's got a lot of light that I think he could shine on what actually happened here what the facts were as we learn more about it so hopefully uh irrespective of what happened today eventually that opportunity will Avail itself although it gets harder once he's under under are you hearing politicians in D.C breathing a sigh of relief that he did not testify I've not had people say that directly Liz I just think that again and you can question the timing and I think it's a fair it's fair to do that um you know it may be that he was a Flight Risk that's what they've suggested but the Department of Justice uh you know the the steps that they took today were certainly um interesting in terms of the timing well the doj says he gave illegal campaign donations using quote stolen investor money and that the by the way the Ft FTX bankruptcy could claw that back 73 million 40 million went to Democrats he bought influence he packed his board with DC insiders former cftc Commissioners to lobby and weekend government oversight and you know weakened controls right at the same time he had zero accounting and zero controls over investor money inside FTX no record keeping whatsoever so how did this guy get to have such power in Washington D.C when he was you know playing with investor money like it was a video game yeah well it is remarkable that he was able able to get as far as he did absent any of the controls that you just mentioned I mean he has a company where he was using proprietary funds investor funds mixing with his own and and financing all these crazy activities some of which were political in nature but obviously the the things that he was doing I think this is a lesson for everybody in this ESG to try and satisfy a a government in Washington D.C liberal policy makers that he was doing the right things with respect to the green agenda and climate that's what this ESG agenda is all about and it's a really dangerous agenda I think for the country because it attacks core industries that are so important to our livelihood in this country be they energy be they food production and and that's clearly where obviously he invested a lot of resources trying to satisfy people here in Washington D.C senator let's take a listen to what happened in Congress today watch this Sam bankman freed or should I say inmate 14372 um had one purpose in all of his efforts here in Congress was well-known figure uh only one wearing shorts his one purpose was to keep the SEC out of crypto the the FTX group is unusual in the sense that you know I've done probably a dozen large you know scale bankruptcies over my career including Enron of course uh every one of those entities had some financial problem or another uh they have some characteristics that are in common uh this one is unusual and it's unusual in the sense that literally you know there's no record-keeping whatsoever I think everybody loved the exciting idea of a politically Progressive smart entrepreneur who is going to reimagine capitalism I'm glad to see it's finally unraveled what you have is a crypto Casino crypto Casino I mean it gave out four billion dollars in loans to cronies including a billion bucks for himself FTX spent a reported 256 million bucks on almost three dozen luxury properties in the Bahamas and now you know they're probing whether his parents were in on it they were Stanford University professors reportedly his father was getting paid by FTX he was going in and out of the Bahamas and his you know the son bought the parents a 60 million dollar luxury home in the Bahamas to your point the parents were very much involved in effective altruism too but what this is is stealing investor money to make yourselves look like you're the good guys right and and again and he's needed needs to be held accountable for that um and again I I think the this sort of woke capitalism that is all of a sudden just permeated uh this country and especially when Financial Services Regulators Securities Regulators use their powers to punish people to penalize people investors companies who invest in certain sectors or certain industries because those are the ones that satisfy that woke agenda that's just a really dangerous thing when you start when you have a free market economy that where a government is stepping on the scales and essentially influencing a lot of those Market decisions you're going to end up with some some really bad outcomes and this is a huge example of that well this is stealing investor money for those political purposes right this is a flat out case of how bad well capitalism is but this is also not telling investors how maybe their 401K money their retirement money is being used for maybe returns that they won't get that they should be getting that's story right Senator final word yeah it is it's about Investors ultimately and protecting investors he didn't do it clearly he was and and I I again have no idea how he got away with this for as long as he as he did except there's no regulation in that market right now but even more regulated investors and companies who control enormous amounts uh through index funds of people's investment in this country are making a lot of these decisions predicated upon that woke agenda and that's flat wrong for the country it's a stealing and for FTX what they did Senator Johnson thank you so much come back soon it's a pleasure having you on a merry Christmas and happy holidays

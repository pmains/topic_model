now house minority whip steve scalise um great to have you back with us i want to start with this uh it seems that this border control problem is one that's gone on for decades and no matter which party is in control the white house the house the senate nothing concrete or long term seems to be get done anything lasting it's something that's used to bludgeon each other the the various parties depending on who's in control so congressman what do we do how do we solve this problem well and you can see what president trump had done to get control of the border because when he came in we were having a similar border crisis the remaining mexico policy was something that was very effective president trump negotiated an agreement with the president of mexico a lot of people thought he couldn't do that because they were having a lot of friction you saw it play out in the press but yet president trump was able to get that agreement and it stopped a lot of the flow the northern triangle agreements agreements with countries in central america were very helpful also and then of course building the wall was helping stop the flow because you were allowing border patrol agents to do what they want to do i was down in mcallen texas not long ago along one of the worst areas of border crossings uh illegally and what the border patrol agents there tell you is you know when you had all those tools in place they were able to focus their time on stopping the drug dealers the drug cartels from mexico that right now unfortunately have complete control of america's southern border they were apprehending them they were stopping the fentanyl and other dangerous drugs they were stopping the human trafficking where so many sexual assaults occurring they're not able to do that right now because of what president biden's done so yes i'd like to see real reform to get back to a functioning legal immigration system president trump wanted to do that too nancy pelosi never wanted to get an agreement democrats have had a horrible record on this when they had complete control under president obama house senate white house they never tried to fix immigration today they're not trying to they're trying to open our borders send that message out to the world it's not just south and central america as you know you've got people from middle eastern countries on the terrorist watch list coming across our southern border that's how bad it is biden created this mess kamala harris has been right there as par as the border czar she's helping enable this crisis and he could stop it today by going back to the things president trump put in place that worked well one of the things that president trump put in place that governor abbott is going to try to resurrect congressman is completing construction of the wall at least in the state of texas we'll see how far he gets in his ability to do that another big issue of course uh other than immigration that will likely be a major issue for the 2022 midterm elections is the crime wave spiking across the country we've got a lot of democrats right now who are running away from this idea of defunding the police president biden even came out in recent days and said hey there's money in the american rescue plan to fund new police officers on the streets and yet democrats in congress are not coming forward with any legislation what's going on there on capitol hill yeah it's very clear democrats embraced this crazy radical idea of defunding the police last summer it had been building for years in fringe elements of the democrat party but they wholly embraced it you saw everybody from speaker pelosi to some of her top lieutenants publicly coming out calling police racists calling for defunding police calling for dismantling the ability to police to do their jobs and it had a devastating effect we saw retirements at all-time highs and now we're seeing the other bad side of that and that is crime out of control in many of these cities that defunded police and they're all democrat-run cities uh deep the democrat party could resolve this today by saying they were wrong just admit they were wrong and go back to their local mayors that did this and the city councils and say refund the police at the local levels build your police force back up to come to the federal government and say hey come mop up the mess that we created is not the answer it's going and fixing the problems that they created in those cities that all of these washington democrats enabled supported uh and cheered on until the public revolted against it now they're trying to wash their hands of the dumpster fire they created yeah congressman to your point there are cities that are starting to say whoa whoa maybe we made a mistake last year many of them now going back to their city councils their local budgets and saying let's put some of that money back they're asking for that and a number of big cities people coming forward and saying we want more police officers in our neighborhoods i mean we're hearing from people and our fox news polling shows that the vast majority of americans have confidence in their police departments and want to fund them properly but to your point about this about what democrats are doing these are democrat-held cities i want to read something from the ap and give you a chance to respond they say the effort to blame democrats for crime may offer a preview of republican strategy for upcoming elections but they say the argument ignores the complicated reasons for fluctuations in crime rates a list that today includes the upheaval wrought by the coronavirus pandemic and protests that erupted after the killing of george floyd by police how do you respond well if you look at most cities today look chicago just this last weekend had almost 80 shootings and their mayor defunded police are they really not going to connect those dots and try to think people don't know what's going on people in those most affected communities are the ones that are the most limited saying hey this idea was a complete and utter failure stop defunding the police instead they want to try to push blame to other people everybody knows what happened everybody knows what they did now they just want to try to avoid the blame because they never want to admit that they were wrong they want to blame other people but defunding the police backfired it was a stupid idea they did it anyway and now we're seeing the results with high crime in so many of these cities and incidentally you see a lot of these in these local cities the local prosecutors are not prosecuting a lot of these criminals they're not prosecuting a lot of criminals who are using guns in their crimes yet they want to ban guns from law-abiding citizens so their next step is going to be gun control not against the criminals who are committing crimes but against us those of us who are law-abiding citizens we've got to push back against that too but that's the next step you know it does appear congressman that uh some democrats at least want to refund on this defund the police idea uh illinois congresswoman sherry busters said defund the police is a phrase that i wish had never been uttered we've got to do a better job of talking about what we want to do michael dukakis who lost the 88 election because he was perceived as being soft on crime instead of defund the police he said it's nuts telling the hill quote i'm saying to myself my god what the hell is going on here but at the same time the national association for police organizations which did support president obama and biden in oh eight and 12 but endorsed president trump in 2020 is giving many democrats higher marks on on its issues that it gives to republicans including yourself you got a 50 rating from napo what's that about well ultimately groups like that are more concerned with just getting more money from the federal government but as we all know local police are funded at the local level it was locals who defunded police and so if they want no accountability uh you're not gonna find an absolvent of accountability from people like me uh so i will support good police every single day and i i have stood up for police when you've seen others out there criticizing him so i'm sure some of the people on their a-list are people who embrace the defund police movement that tells you a lot about their score card in fact that is the case there's no question about that congressman steve scalise from the great state of louisiana good to spend time with you thanks so much for joining us appreciate it always great being with you thanks

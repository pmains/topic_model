minutes Thank You mr. chairman for organizing this hearing and thank you to our witnesses for their time and for their service as the administration said in its 2018 Nuclear Posture review the non-proliferation treaty or NPT remains fundamental to the global non-proliferation regime we must ensure our non-proliferation tools are strong and varied enough to meet challenges from bad actors like Iran and North Korea at a recent meeting of the United Nations disarmament and International Security Committee Russia and China voted against calls for North Korea to re-enter the nuclear non-proliferation treaty yesterday yesterday remember meanwhile North Korea sent two short-range ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan there's so much going on we don't even hear about this activity anymore mr. Rademacher how seriously are Russia and China undermining efforts to rein in the Kim regime's nuclear ambitions and how can the United States use the upcoming and PT review to restore broad international support for North Korean denuclearization thank you Thank You congresswoman it's a very good question I address it in my prepared remarks you know there there's there's a refrain that we hear very regularly from the State Department from our US officials who deal with with China on the question of North Korea and what they always come back saying is you know the Chinese they want to help their hearts in the right place but they've got these constraints they're doing the best they can we're going to try and get them to do some more and I've heard that so many over and over some over so many years that I've stopped believing it you know I I mentioned in my testimony that in the 1970s South Korea had a nuclear weapons program when they and they were our ally when we found out about it we went to them and said you've got to stop this right you want us to defend you we're telling you you don't need nuclear weapons you can rely on our nuclear weapons you can rely on our security guarantee you have to stop this and they did you know North Korea is a treaty ally of China they have a mutual defense treaty China is in the position to do to North Korea what we did with South Korea they've just never done it and they have a lot of good stories about oh we're worried about refugees we're worried about economic collapse you know what the reality the reality is that if you assess it this nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula they decided a long time ago it was our problem not their problem it works out to their advantage in a whole bunch of ways it makes China and I'm sorry it makes South Korea and Japan much more dependent on I have some more questions I have to say it let's hope at this NPT review we can restore this broad international support for this move forward under the NPT nuclear weapons States may not help non-nuclear countries develop nuclear weapons systems Pakistan which has so far refused to join the NPT was involved in the development of North Korea's growing nuclear capabilities mr. Radha maker how can the international community pressure Pakistan to adhere to the goals of the nvg I guess I would say candidly that that will be a long-term project because hell will freeze over is that what you're saying yeah okay I mean the NPT has been a phenomenally successful treaty you know really they're they're only at this point four countries that have never signed it one of them is South Sudan and that that's a problem that will take care of itself but India Pakistan and Israel have not signed it they're probably not on track to do so anytime soon as between India and Pakistan you know those countries have nuclear weapons they are you know security threats to one another they perceive threats from one another I don't think the international community has a solution that we've identified that will persuade those two countries to give up nuclear weapons in 1995 NPT party states agreed to establish a zone free of weapons of mass destruction or WMDs in the Middle East today tragically we are seeing states like Syria actively engaging in the proliferation of WMDs with the support of Russia and Iran both NPT signatories dr. Smith how should the United States push for progress in the WMD non-proliferation at the review and what mechanisms exist to bring Russia and Iran into line in five seconds I would go back to where you started your remarks man with the other tools that are available so regarding the NPT I think we've spoken a lot the right are a number of other tools that have been brought to bear in the Middle East through the Cooperative Threat Reduction programs proliferation Security Initiative right long list of those we need to continue to leverage those on all ends of that threat spectrum great thank you why my time is expired I yield back thank you the

senator what did you think of last night's debate everyone's saying the talk over the screaming back and forth that it was a waste of time what do you say i can only describe it as exhausting it was exhausting even to watch much less participate in i frankly don't think it was that informative and i've got a suggestion for the presidential commission too if they're listening why don't we do a 30-minute interview with each candidate in separate rooms don't put them in the same room but really try to get a little more of an in-depth conversation challenge them push them to answer questions you know more completely but the debate format is sort of like this mini war but i don't think it's that informative i really would rather see a long-form interview i do 30 minutes with each an hour and a half is frankly too long anybody watched an hour and a half that didn't have to i wonder what was going on but also i don't think it was that great for the people in the middle you know those who are undecided yet i you know i don't think there was a lot that was garnered from last night that might convince you either way i mean i think the one important issue on on you know biden's responses was that when he was asked would he pack the supreme court uh he wouldn't answer and i think that's a pretty important question because that's a pretty dramatic change to our form of government and i think could be very destructive and i think frankly the media ought to force him to answer that question but other than that i didn't get a whole lot out of the debate you know said i wonder if the president himself or his case to force that out of rent ball because the president scored a number of powerful points last night but on that issue of whether joe biden would uh pack the court or blow up the filibuster or any of these other matters naming a group and law enforcement that supports him um the president's interruptions were such that they they gave biden an opportunity to to not have to bother answering and i'm wondering in the next debate for either gentleman whether that that's a smart strategy for the guy trying to get the best of them yeah i think letting vice president biden talk more actually might be a good strategy i do think that when he said i am the democrat party he was very forceful with that that he was rebuking his left and saying i'm not for the green new deal even though he has actually said he was for the green new deal in the past that rebuke to the left wing needs to be out there and to be aired but the other thing is when he says i am the democrat party when he was asked why don't you call the governors and mayors where the cities are on fire in portland and seattle and chicago he said well it's none of my business i think that point needs to be hammered home that if he thinks he is the democrat party he is their nominee why isn't he willing to do anything to try to have some law and order and stop the arson the molotov cocktails and the violence in our cities um i'd be curious to get your take on the president last night on his comments on this so-called hate group proud boys he seemed familiar with it last night's stance still stand down um but unfamiliar with it today uh what do you know about it do you think the president should be more forceful in you know specific opposition to specific so-called hate groups what would you advise you know i think the point needs to be made explicitly that we are unequivocally opposed to white supremacy or any kind of political ideology based on race any kind of law or legal philosophy based on race and that goes for anybody we believe in individual liberty that every individual is judged as an individual not collectively as a group and that it means nothing to say that you are black or white or brown it's about who you are as an individual and that's about the party we've always been that needs to be unequivocal when you get beyond that though i think it is important to note that there are some on the left now black lives matter for instance in louisville kentucky has said that they are glad that my wife and i were terrorized and that they want us to be terrorized they want us to live in fear so i think this is a group that is using race in an incorrect fashion and is saying that white people and representatives need to live in fear and i think there's a problem with that as well so while yes we should denounce white supremacy we should also denounce any group that is believing in any kind of racial uh superiority or some sort of collective racial way of thinking of things you know very quickly son we don't know exactly what the debate commission is talking about and setting up new parameters for the next couple of debates i guess including the upcoming vice presidential debate some have suggested that the moderator be free to cut uh cut their mics if they're going over or if they're doing well essentially what they were doing last night are you pro cut their mics i was thinking more like an opening in the floor that you fall through the opening on the floor and that's it a little awesome yeah just no no sort of warnings no sort of like oh slap on the hand just immediately the floor opens no it's it's hard to control two strong-willed people on a debate stage like that but i think people should think about a long-form interview think about in in your career as an interviewer how sometimes you get more over a long interview as you try to draw someone out some interviewers are great at drawing something out of people they didn't intend to say and maybe we'd get more out of them actually individually in a 30 minute followed by 30 minutes so it's a big audience but you do 30 minutes of the same questions to each candidate but the follow-on questions by the interviewer might be slightly different to try to draw out a full answer that's interesting that's a that could be a very telling moment also you've got us thinking now senator that we should look at the floor space in the next couple of interviews and whether you can't drop people like a dr evil thing um real quick how's your dad doing yeah he's doing the feeling he's doing great and it's a it's a miracle of modern medicine uh he was given medication to reverse an impending stroke and he's completely free of symptoms his symptoms went away as the medicine went in and we're very thankful he was back doing his program live i suggested he could do it taped but i called him in the hospital right after the episode was happening as he was getting better and he was already complaining i've got to finish the interview we're going to talk about the iran agreement he was ready to go back to the studio and finish the interview he took one day off but if it's any you know sense of his work ethic he was back the next day doing a live program all right it's in the uh paul family dna thank you senator i'm gonna give my best to god i'm happy to hear all of that uh rand paul we are gonna explore this trapdoor thing i think he might be on to something

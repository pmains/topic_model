Thank You mr. chairman good morning welcome to the both of you today is a terrific day for the state of Texas and for the federal judiciary very pleased to welcome both of these nominees who are exceptionally qualified judicial nominees and and very fine human beings let's start with mark Pittman mark Pittman hasn't been nominated to a seat in the Northern District of Texas justice Pittman is a sixth generation Texan he was born in Big Spring Texas he was raised in Cooper Justus Pittman received his college degree magna laude from Texas A&M University and his law degree from the University of Texas where he was a founding member of the Texas review of law and politics but not to forget his Aggie loyalty mark today teaches at the Texas A&M School of Law mark I'm sure that is a powerful demonstration of your ability to bring people together that you've earned the esteem of both the University of Texas and a.m. at the same time after law school Mark clerked for Fort Worth the judge Eldon B Mahon the federal courthouse in Fort Worth is named after Judge Mahone today and marks chambers will be there after he's confirmed indeed when he's confirmed I understand that marks courtroom will be the one that his former judge held as well I'm sure that's quite quite the honor mark and I'm sure you will continue that legacy legacy and make your judge proud mark also worked as a litigator at one of Fort Worth's preeminent law firms for several years learning from another great Texan dee Kelly in 2004 mark entered government service from 2004 to 2015 he served as a trial attorney in the Civil Division of the Department of Justice as an assistant an assistant US attorney in the Northern District of Texas as a senior attorney for the FDIC in Dallas as an enforcement attorney for the SE C's Fort Worth office and as a special assistant US attorney again in the north district of Texas apparently mark has trouble holding a job Mark's government service was distinguished every step of the way he's received several awards for his public service including excellence and information technology award from the SEC and the Chairman's mission achievement award from the FDIC mark could only be drawn away from from federal public service for an opportunity to serve Texas when he was appointed as a state trial court judge from 2015 to 2017 mark served as a trial judge in the 352nd District Court in Tarrant County Texas and in 2017 governor Greg Abbott appointed mark to serve on the second Court of Appeals in the state of Texas he serves there as a justice today so mark has a wealth of experience as a state court judge both trial and appellate to drawn on the federal bench then we turn to Shaun Jordan Shaun is someone I know exceptionally well Shaun has been nominated for a seat on the Eastern District of Texas and he grew up he grew up in East East East Texas otherwise known as Fairfield Connecticut but while he was in Connecticut he learned about the value of service from his mother who was a nurse who spent many years working with terminally ill patients after graduating from Fairfield college preparatory school Shaun volunteered to serve our country in the Army he served first as an infantryman and then as a paratrooper in the Army's 82nd Airborne Division while in the military Shaun met many of the Texans that serve in the Armed Forces and they gave him some of what he says is the best advice he ever received go to college at the University of Texas like a great mini Texan Shaun took their advice moved to Texas and never look back he's lived in Texas for 30 years starting with his years at UT where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa he followed that up with the University of Texas School of Law where he graduated with honors in 1994 Shaun then spent a decade in private practice where he learned trial practice in every stage of a case but Shawn wanted to return to public service so starting in 2004 Shawn joined the office of the Solicitor General of Texas and I have to tell you both the state of Texas and I personally were much better for it I hired Shawn as an assistant Solicitor General initially and then promoted him to be Deputy Solicitor General of the state of Texas because I saw firsthand the exceptional skill Shawn brings as a lawyer representing the state of Texas we worked side-by-side representing Texas before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals before the Texas Supreme Court and before the United States Supreme Court and I will tell you Shawn brings his background as a paratrooper to practicing law because in major cases representing the state of Texas Shawn was always always the person you could count on to jump on the grenade and handle the most difficult the most challenging the most pressing issues after 2012 after serving many years in the Solicitor General's Office Shawn returned to private practice and he's been the co-chairman of the appellate practice at two large law firms which continue to represent clients at all levels in both the Texas and federal judiciary with both Shawn Jordan and mark Pittman I'm confident that we will have two excellent federal judges who will hear every litigants case with fairness and with fidelity to the law I welcome your family's congratulations and we're proud of you both thank you well Thank You mr. chairman welcome again both of you we just passed both of you in your judgment what makes a good federal district judge justice Pittman we'll start with you in my mind a federal district judge is made up of three qualities and these are qualities I learned during my clerkship and from being exposed to other judges that I highly respect but I would say number one correct temperament treating all persons big or small with dignity and respect treating them as you would like to be treated I think number two knowing your role under our Constitution that the role of a district judge is a modest one you are only supposed to interpret the law and you should not devolve into any kind of policy decisions our personal preferences because if you do you're straying out of your lane and finally I think a good work ethic moving your docket alone you owe it to the American people to get your docket moving and to diligently move your cases make sure they go to trial speedily and efficiently mr. jordan senator i think the the first quality great judge is that you need to be faithful to the law you need to apply the law even if you don't like the outcome number one number two you need to be fair impartial and just so that no you don't have any bias in favor of or prejudice against anyone in your courtroom and number three you need to be hardworking and be decisive at number four as distant judge Pittman mentioned you need to be courteous and professional and treat everyone in the courtroom with respect well let me say both of you based on many years of professional experience I'm confident that you will each of you will be excellent judges and and continue to be faithful to the Constitution which is the highest charge given to every judge and I have every confidence both of you will meet that charge

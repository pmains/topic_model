is congresswoman abigail spanberger democrat from virginia and vice chair of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus congresswoman thank you so much for being here and i'm going to apologize in advance we may have to cut this interview off a little bit abruptly to listen to the president over at nato so i do apologize if we face that contingency but why don't we perfect great and let's start there because you i know have a national security background the president has gone overseas to try to send the message america is back in preparation for this meeting from with vladimir putin on wednesday we know the white house has said that they don't need deliverables from putin at this at this point or they don't expect them uh what do you think the president needs to accomplish with that summit i think the president is taking the right tact i'm pleased so far with everything i've seen in terms of how they're talking about this meeting vladimir putin is a strong man authoritarian and we need the president of the united states president biden to demonstrate strength commitment to american democratic values and to stand up for our country for our democracy for our the integrity of our elections and to be strong as he contends with vladimir putin we've we know that we are at a challenged point in our relationship with russia and we are not going to get past that by the president doing anything other than standing firm and and advocating for our nation first and foremost so in terms of deliverables i think the the president and the administration are taking the right tact i do hope that topics of conversation uh when they meet will be focused on cyber attacks whether they are driven by the russian federation or by the criminal uh organizations that take harbor and and based themselves in russia without any consequence i hope that he will speak aggressively about uh russian efforts to undermine our elections and meddle um in our elections and particularly uh continue to endeavor in misinformation campaigns and i i hope that he will stand up for democratic values uh and ask firm questions about the fate of mr navalny

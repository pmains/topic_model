how will a windfall profits tax on oil get us back to energy Independence joining me now is North Dakota Senator Kevin Kramer he's a member of the Senate environment and Public Works committee it's obviously rhetorical question Senator but we need more oil when you attack something more you get less of it we're going in the wrong direction aren't we exactly right David I mean remember this is the same president who in the State of the Union Hood we're going to put you all up those 10 years we only need oil for 10 more years oh in the meantime we're going to double the tax on you you're making way too much money and God forbid you'd expect any of that investing more oil to bring down the price of gasoline and bring down in education it and and make us a safer nation and a cleaner environment unbelievable it's the most absurd y which uses a political slush fund let's be clear about it in 2022 in that one year leading up to the election he drew down about 40 percent of what we have it went from about 600 million barrels down to 388 million barrels I mean he can't he can't if he goes on like this he won't make it to the next election no that's exactly right and remember those that strategic petroleum Reserve was put in place at a time when we did not have the abundance that we have today in oil in this country it's an emergency reserve for things like hurricanes and Wars the only times it's ever been drawn down previously or during those types of an emergency now the good news is that when the SBR goes to zero you still have the bach and you still have the the major plays and it's except that he won't let us drill there so no it's an absurd policy it makes zero sense well speaking of slush funds by the way we have this new so-called Green Bank by the EPA uh meanwhile the EPA can't afford to give the people in in uh in Ohio help with their with their horrible disasters their natural disasters in Pennsylvania and and they're given 27 billion dollars 500 times 10 right quickly either cylinder times 10 without with very little oversight non-profit organization is going to be in charge of all of this money and by the way in case you forgot we're really in debt a long ways we could have you know we can't afford another 27 billion dollars for somebody's dream right Senator Kramer I wish we had more time great to have you on have a wonderful weekend thank you so much for being here with us appreciate it my pleasure David thank you

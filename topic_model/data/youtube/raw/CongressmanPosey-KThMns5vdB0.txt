for what purpose does the gentleman from florida seek recognition i rise in support of the objection madam speaker that objection the gentleman is recognized for five minutes uh thank you madam speaker as you've heard from both sides of the aisle over and over and over today tonight members of congress take an oath to protect and defend the constitution clearly the constitution says state legislatures make voting laws period in a subject and clearly in pennsylvania in some other states non-legislators change those voting laws no matter who wins or who loses those are violations of the constitution whether you me or anyone else likes it or not as congressman davidson pointed out over a dozen fbi agents were immediately dispatched to fully investigate bubba wallace's garage door but sadly the fbi never responded to my request to investigate massive voting irregularity accusations like the video footage from georgia that we all wish we didn't see neither has the department of homeland security the department of state the postal inspector general the director of national intelligence the cia and sas of all the u.s department of justice the right to vote is not only a constitutional right it's also a civil right and we must protect it running a fair and transparent election is not something america should run away from is something we must live up to every eligible american has a right to have their vote counted and the right to feel confident that his or vote her vote was counted not neutralized by an illegal vote otherwise i fear our republic is doomed that's why i implore you to support a full investigation and i yield the balance of my time to the fine gentleman from pennsylvania mr kelly i thank

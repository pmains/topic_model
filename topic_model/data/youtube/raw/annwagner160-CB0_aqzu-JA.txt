Thank You mr. chairman and I appreciate the ranking member allowing me to jump ahead here the New York Times recently published hundreds of pages of leaked party documents relating to repression of the wiegert's some seemed to suggest that the rampant human rights abuses in Shenzhen have had caused rifts in party leadership mr. Haddad how significant are these dissenting voices and how can the United States leverage in internal disagreement to blunt Beijing's attack on the weaker Muslims so for that question I think before like we come to the question part like it's really important to note that the documents were released by someone inside a party right and then he or she stated that the reason that he risked his or her life to publish these documents is to get Xi Jinping and then the party officials in front de justice so we have to get the signal and then the world was waiting for our document or proof or evidence like for years but now we got we got a hard proof it is coming directly from the CG being himself and then there is disagreements between the Communist Party about what to do how to suppress the vigorous but it is really good to see that there is at least some people in the Chinese government the ethnic Chinese officials that they are trying we'll say no to the Xi Jinping his order I hope we can continue to leverage a little bit of that internal dissent and it is up to us to give voice I thank you for your courage and all that you have endured more than a year ago in a controversial bid to insulate Chinese Catholics from persecution and intimidation the Vatican signed a deal with the Chinese government allowing it a role in appointing Catholic Bishops in China in the meantime China has launched a sinners ation campaign to dilute the religious ethnic and cultural identities of minority groups dr. Richardson how is Cinna cessation affecting Chinese Catholic communities both state sanctioned and underground and how has the Vatican responded soon as Asian means being loyal to the party and the government an amazing word yes it's a little hard to reconcile with the concept of the freedom to believe does seem to replace the other you know and the problems that we're seeing as a result of the cinah cessation campaign aren't unique to people who are worshipping in state sanctioned Catholic churches versus underground ones this is this is relevant to Tibetan Buddhists it's relevant across different faith communities it is hard to see much of a consequential response whatsoever from the Vatican there was a global time story this morning that I believe suggested that the Pope had China and the Chinese people central to his heart but negotiations seem to be proceeding between the two about well as a cradle Catholic I believe that it is incumbent upon the Vatican to call this sinesses a ssin campaign out especially given the agreement that they have undertaken with the Catholic Bishops in in China and I would very vociferous Lee call on that here China is in the process of assembling and implementing a dystopian social credit system that uses data mining and surveillance to score citizens to score citizens based on their quote trustworthiness I understand China plans to deploy a similar system now to track businesses operating in China dr. Richardson again what is the status of the corporate social credit system and how do you anticipate it will be used to coerce and intimidate foreign actors most recent development was about three months ago when authorities announced that they were gonna use the Social Credit System or that they were gonna apply the corporate version of it not just to domestic companies but to foreign ones as well I can only assume that our collective social credit scores are pretty low at the moment you know it's it is very difficult to tell just how integrated across the country these systems are and at the moment from our perspective they appear designed to reward or induce particular kinds of behavior it's not exactly clear what sorts of punishments you know will follow for having a lowest score we know that if you've got a good score for example you're more likely to be able to enroll your child in the school that you want or you won't have problems doing things like buying plane tickets or accessing the state services but if you have low score you can run into problems and of course you know in a normal world this might just be sort of a consumer rating system maybe but we're talking about an environment in which you know the law is whatever the Chinese Communist Party says it is when it says it is that and there's no right to privacy there's no way for people to know fully how they're being rated what the consequences are it's an entirely arbitrary system and in a way I think to the extent some people inside China have expressed enthusiasm for this idea that's as much a commentary on how politicized and corrupt a legal system is in not being able to deliver you know consistent verdicts about what behavior that's been codified by law the repression the repression and the brainwashing is significant my time has expired I want to thank you all for being here for your courage and everyone who's just behind you know that this Congress and this this committee care deeply about bringing light to this process and this disgraceful humanitarian regime so I yield back

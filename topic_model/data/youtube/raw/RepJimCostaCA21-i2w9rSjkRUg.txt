I'd like to begin with the witness from from California mr. Ortega you noted in your testimony about the challenges you're facing with this invasive non-native species called nutria that's also been a problem in other parts of the country my understanding is you have funding for eradication for two years but what happens after that a serious deficit so no no long-term funding has been secured we think the effort will acquire about five million dollars annually five million currently will support forty five staff at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the source of that funding is the San Joaquin Delta Conservancy as as issued a one-time appropriation and the amount of ten million dollars cdfw is also reallocating staff biologists to this effort so those folks should be doing their their normal day-to-day jobs but yeah I fear that if we don't secure some long-term funding we're gonna have a real hard time controlling this outbreak and are you aware of the experiences in Maryland and Louisiana and their eradication efforts and what sources of funding that they were able to bring together yeah there was actually federal funding available here in the East that that currently did not extend to California through the eradication program the something I think we ought to look at in terms of a comprehensive effort if it's applicable in Maryland Louisiana obviously we think it would be appropriate in California in you know a lot of these efforts are a result of cost share in anyway local state and federal so we should work on that you noted in your testimony again the impacts on waterways and levies and the importance of those waterways to deliver water to agriculture and urban water users could you talk more specifically have you had of any cost analysis and potential impacts in agriculture no specific cost analysis have been conducted the Central Valley is a very flat area and most of the water is wheeled through earthen line canals and so the the extensive burrowing that can occur can can really compromise understand its hundreds of feet and they establish these caves within these levees in which you'll have colonies of nutria that began breeding and as you noted after four months and with the offspring at the propagation of this species obviously is very problematic absolutely yeah the the borrowing is extensive and because of the the density in these colonies one example is they they pulled a hundred nutria out of a ten acre pond so they they're very gregarious and and they can attack you know specific infrastructure if if we don't start to get control of these and they they do migrate into the sacramento-san Joaquin Delta I think that's the the biggest biggest threat that agricultural faces the the Delta is a highly managed system that to provide water throughout the state well mr. harder has legislation on that effort of which I'm a co-sponsor and will continue to work with them hopefully he'll get back here before the committee finishes its hearing mr. Erickson and mr. Reichert you talked about the importance of the impact of trade and I noted that in my opening comments I think we all here in the subcommittee believes that that's absolutely critical and that to ensure that we have enough resources and our ports so that inspections are done thoroughly that was part of the problem I had with this tomato seed issue in China where we had to try to provide some alternative support and and I think that's why is she all noted that said mr. Velas legislation that that many of us are co-sponsoring to introduce protecting America's food and agriculture Act to make sure that we can hire more AG inspectors at our ports of entry what kind of backlog are you folks seen due to the lack of inspectors and what impact does that have on specialty crop growers and consumers so it's not uncommon for so at were a domestic producer but we do more product to complement our business and and we I would say once a month on average perhaps a couple times a month we run into issues where a load of cilantro or broccoli crowns or something coming out of Mexico gets held up at the port of entry because of a insect identification and the local inspectors may not have the authority to identify that insect so then the insect needs to be sent up to Washington DC so well it takes maybe you know occasionally we see shipments that may take three to four to five days to receive an insect identification and when it's something that's out of the ordinary at which time we typically would have to dump the load or send it to the food bank it would no longer be salvageable for us I'm so for more examples of that will be important as we try to move this legislation forward mr. Riker to briefly do you have any thing you'd like to add to follow up on mr. Erickson's experiences we see about the same in the port of Philadelphia generally we handle more of the imported commodities our CBP inspector staff is down by I believe for inspectors our athiest inspector count is generally at six we understand they're losing two of their people through a vertical integration so they have offers out there now for additional inspectors two would be the minimal as mr. Erickson said the identifiers are also in need certain commodities if they cannot be inspected or identified locally must be sent down to Baltimore area and that can in the bottom line has we need more help yes we do okay I've exceeded my time and I'd like to fern out of the ranking member of the subcommittee with mr. Rosen from

My staffer tried to book a flight for her
family to get out of Puerto Rico. The only tickets available were for first class. First class! That’s over seven hundred dollars on a flight
full of disaster evacuees. My D.C. staff did a little digging. Here’s what they learned: The American people
rely on the goodwill of the airlines to cap the prices of flights from disaster areas. The airlines decide when to start the cap
and when it will end. The airlines decide whether to keep selling
first-class tickets. And the federal government never stops charging
taxes [and fees] on flights from disaster areas. American citizens deserve better, Mr. Speaker. That’s why starting this week, I will be
introducing a series of bills to ease the financial burden Americans face when escaping
natural disasters. The Humanitarian Flight Fairness Package will
do four things. First, it will allow the Secretary of Transportation
to declare an “aviation humanitarian crisis” at specific airports covered by a presidential
declaration of emergency. Second, it will allow the Secretary of Transportation
to mandate that airlines charge no more than the median fare price of all seats sold on
that route in the prior calendar year. Third, the package will require the FAA to
waive the five dollar and sixty cent Passenger Facility Charge during an aviation humanitarian
crisis. And fourth, the package will require the FAA
to waive the U.S. International Transportation Tax, which is eighteen dollars on a flight
from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

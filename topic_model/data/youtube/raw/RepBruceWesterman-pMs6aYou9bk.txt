thank you madam chair I find it interesting that we bring up drafty is is we don't point out that all this is subject to review and you know just the the idea that NEPA is a gold standard except when NEPA is actually being used and now NEPA and the people carrying it out or somehow villains and mr. mcclaren in a recent interview with The Seattle Times you said that what is happening now is the decision making process is being politicized and removed from the science and I found that extraordinary to be coming from you the person who had picked somebody to lead the Bristol Bay watershed assessment that said in a public meeting that politics are as big or bigger factor than science in your Clean Water Act veto decision mr. McClaren isn't it true that a pre-emptive veto such as the one you undertook wasn't necessary because you had no idea if the Army Corps of Engineers was even going to grant a permit isn't it the case that unless the Corps is going to grant a permit that a veto is unnecessary so first there was no veto as I explained in my testimony but we did after three years of science imposed restrictions on the development in the watershed but that was based on good science it was a very participatory process so there was no pre decision of that as mr. Collier testified that certainly was not the case we went into this with open eyes and open ears and heard the science and made something you're saying in the 404 seat was not used originally we did use the 404 C process which Congress has provided the authority and the power for EPA to use we've used that the EPA has used that very sparingly over the years but this is a case where the science really drove that and merited it so everyone on the committee's probably dealt with the Corps of Engineers in some form or fashion and I've yet to see the corps of engineers get in a hurry about anything I've yet to see them sidestep any processes or try to fast-track anything quite honestly it's been just the opposite of that there's been a lot of talk about the political political ization of this process what exactly about the US Army Corps of Engineers and it's career military team is politicized because I've I've not seen that with any of them that I've dealt with so I didn't state that the Corps of Engineers was politicized but I did state that the EPA process to withdraw the water to withdraw the proposed determination appears to have been politicized but it's the Corps of Engineers this doing this permit so all of the federal agencies do provide input into that and the US Fish and Wildlife Service the EPA several other federal agencies have pointed out that the process is deeply flawed at this point that that the Corps is taking undertaken

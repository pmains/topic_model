and president I come to the floor today in support of the respect for Marriage Act I want to summarize my remarks though and ask unanimous consent that my full remarks be print and be printed in today's record without objection Court declared that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right way back in 2015 and the overwhelming majority of Americans support that view according to Gallup over 70 percent of Americans believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized as valid under law including a majority of Republicans despite the strong support the United States code does not reflect that consensus in America current legislation allows States and the federal government to refuse to recognize valid same-sex marriages while it is true that the Supreme Court has held this law is not enforceable it still represents congress's last word on the subject the American people rightly expect are elected representatives to bring our laws in line with their beliefs so that's part of what this legislation does it's time for the Senate to settle the issue the respect for Marriage Act which passed the house with overwhelming bipartisan support including the support by the way of 46 Republicans on the house side simply allows interracial or same-sex couples who were validly married under the laws of one state to know that their marriage will be recognized by the federal government and by other states if they move this is all in accordance with well-established Supreme Court precedent and by the way settling this issue is well within the Constitutional authority of us here in Congress after all the Full Faith and Credit Clause is part of our constitution since the bipartisan passage of this bill by the House of Representatives earlier this year in response to concerns over religious liberty this already narrow bill has been significantly amended in the Senate to include robust religious liberty protections by working collaboratively on a bipartisan basis with religious liberty Scholars Faith organizations Senate colleagues including some I see on the floor here today other stakeholders we have developed a substitute amendment that contains important protections for people of faith it has five key changes to the underlying Bill remember this is the bill that already passed the house with 46 Republican supporters but these are religious liberty Provisions that we have added to it first it has an Express acknowledgment that decent and honorable people hold diverse views about the role of gender in marriage and that such people in their beliefs are due respect this is an important statement that has implications it protects religious liberty second it explicitly protects all existing religious liberty and conscious protections under the First Amendment and federal laws including the powerful Productions provided by the religious freedom restoration Act third it guarantees that this bill cannot be used to Target or deny benefits including tax exempt status grants contracts Educational Funding licenses accreditation certification and many others because a person or organization holds a traditional belief about marriage this protects everything from the tax status of religious non-profits to the accreditation of religious schools to the contracts between faith-based adoption providers and the government from being attacked using this bill fourth it ensures that non-profit religious organizations including churches mosques synagogues religious schools and others cannot be required to provide facilities goods or services for marriage ceremonies or celebrations against their will fifth it has an explicit prohibition on the recognition of polygamous marriages these religious liberty Provisions are significant and they are meaningful and they have earned the endorsement of important Faith groups in a joint letter to the Senate eight different faith-based organizations including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also known as the Mormon church to Seventh-day Adventist Church the union of Orthodox Jewish congregations of America the council for Christian colleges and universities the Center for Public Justice the and campaign and institutional religious freedom Alliance and the First Amendment partnership all of them concluded that our religious liberty protections protect the core religious freedom concerns raised by the bill including tax-exempt status Educational Funding government grants and contracts and eligibility for licenses certification and accreditation and that they said if passed it would continue to build on the Congressional wisdom represented by the religious freedom restoration Act of 1993. so that's these religious groups that's what they say about it they helped write the language a group of leading religious liberty Scholars and Advocates religious liberty have analyzed the bill and they've reached the same conclusion these Scholars include by the way Professor Doug laycock who argued on behalf of Faith groups and won two foundational religious liberty cases before the U.S Supreme Court on balance a group of these distinguished professors determined that this bill is quote an advance for religious liberty end quote because as they say the protections are important notwithstanding these important protections and the opinion of leading experts in the field the critics of this bill continue to level accusations about what this bill does that are simply not accurate first some critics claim that this bill provides grounds for the IRS or other government bodies to revoke the tax-exempt status or other benefits from religious organizations that adhere to traditional views of marriage this couldn't be further from the truth section 7A of our Amendment actually expressly forbids the outcome that these critics are warning of it prohibits the use of the bill to Target tax-exempt status certification accreditation grant funding loan license or any other non-marital status right or benefit of religious organizations to quote Professor laycock's analysis quote those who claim that the bill would be used as the ground for denying tax-exempt status to organizations adhering to male female marriage by analogy to Bob Jones are disregarding the statutory text end quote in addition to the statutory prohibition this amendment contains a clear statement from Congress again that diverse beliefs about the role of gender and marriage including the belief that marriage is between one man and one woman come from decent and honorable premises and are due respect this Congressional statement distinguishes the belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman from the belief that interracial marriage is wrong this distinction is important and rather than portraying those who believe in traditional marriages bigots reflects a national policy that respects diverse beliefs about the role of gender and marriage while also protecting the rights of same-sex marriage couples and that's the key second some critics argue that this bill will lead to more litigation against institutions and individuals trying to live according to their sincerely held beliefs this is also false the bill only governs the conduct of State actors and contains no law to get litigation tools that would be used against private religious entities acting in a private capacity even ones that receive a majority of their funding from the state to quote again from Professor laycock's analysis respect for Marriage Act and our bipartisan substitute Amendment quote poses little or no new risk to religious liberty Beyond those that already exist end quote third some critics continue to make the bewildering argument that this bill could lead to legalize and recognize polygamy again no grounding in reality no state allows bigamy or polygamy and this bill does not change this moreover our Amendment explicitly says now nothing in this act or any amendment made by this act shall be construed to require or authorize Federal recognition of marriages between more than two individuals end quote finally some critics argue that this bill is deficient because it does not contain new enforceable rights for private businesses or other entities that apply beyond the scope of this bill this is not a fair criticism this bill is legal Scholars and many Faith groups agree poses no new risk to religious organizations while containing significant benefits and protections for people of faith of course the bill does not cover or address every lawsuit or dispute that may arise between lgbtq and religious interests but it does address the disputes that could arise because of this bill in conclusion I urge my colleagues to look carefully at the new religious liberty Provisions take a look at him I hope you'll be able to support respect for Marriage Act The Substitute amendment is a carefully negotiated well-practed piece of legislation that protects people with faith as well as same-sex married couples a statement in a recent letter from the council for Christian colleges and universities accurately states that our Amendment and I quote sends a strong bipartisan message to Congress the administration and the public that lgbtq rights can co-exist with religious freedom protections and the rights of both groups can be advanced in a way that is prudent and practical end quote I think that's the major Point here they can coexist that's what our legislation proves that's why it deserves the support in my view of our colleagues so I urge them to join me in taking this path forward to pass this bill with the same overwhelming bipartisan support we saw in the House of Representatives the American people want us to settle this issue and millions of American couples who are married including many in Ohio are counting on us to recognize and protect their marriage and give them the peace of mind that they deserve I yield back my time

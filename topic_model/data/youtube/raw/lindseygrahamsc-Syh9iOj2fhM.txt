hey join us up from Capitol Hill Republican senator from South Carolina Lindsey Graham Lindsey mark is coming back to Washington DC about that we have a 94 reunion can't we yes and we will be buying just as it was a 94 this guy lives on a plantation but he's a cheapest guy i think that i met in washington DC He gives cheap a bad name chief about him okay so you've said quite a few things over the past several months in September 11th about Benghazi and you say the dam is about to break when the dam breaks what are you looking for here what should Americans be looking for these Benghazi hearings today people who were there coming forward to say it was a terrorist attack from the get-go that they may have been other assets in the region that could have been deployed when the attack began nobody knew how long it was going to last and I think you're going to find more about the spin from the White House about the video is not going to hold water so people who were involved in the attacker come forward and put it better context senator I know you have some serious concerns about exactly what happened there and I'm just wondering because I guess some in the White House or others who don't see your point of view would say that this has already been thoroughly investigated by the accountability Review Board which is chaired by Admiral Mullen and ambassador Pickering does that not allow it olay any of the concerns that you might have well to be honest with the accountability Review Board never talked to Secretary Clinton these are good people were doing it I don't know if its staff driven or not but we now know who change who recommended the talking points to be changed you had a spokesman from the State Department saying the first version of the talking points given by the CIA would be used by Congress to attack the State Department for denying security requests well that's not exactly the way to vet information and that wasn't found out by the accountability Review Board I think the truth the story of Benghazi is that after the attack seven weeks before an election there was an effort by some senior people to put a political spin on this rather than tell the story that it was a terrorist attack from the get-go because they were so close to the election so is that your biggest concern about the fact that they that the president had a political message seven weeks before an election that were beating al-qaeda or is the bigger concern that the Ambassador asked for more security we're now hearing others ask for more security and those requests seem to be if not completely ignored dismissed my biggest concern is that this is an example of how the light footprint is not working we understood pretty quickly McCain in myself when we went to Iraq that this wasn't just a few dead Enders remember when secretary Cheney said this is just a few dead Enders a rock is really okay well we had the wrong foot print we had the wrong strategy I see the same thing in Libya we were there in october two thousand eleven and you could see this coming but it's i think a foreign policy going wrong here Syria Libya Egypt I think the greater story is that the light footprint approached the Mideast at a time of turmoil is not working and here's another story when Secretary Clinton toll on the fourteenth of sep tember family members we're going to prosecute the guy who made that video how could she possibly have said that either she was totally detached from reality and Benghazi is putting political spin and on the 18th of sep tember when the president went on Letterman and said this was a result of a hateful video a week after the attack I think the president needs to explain that statement either he's really detached or he was putting a political spin on it and that's important Jon Meacham senator given the drone policy given the president's brought anti-terror policy over the last five years where do you rank him in terms of his stewardship as commander-in-chief on a terrorism issue I think on the drone side he's up this game in a very good way he's used drones in the most effective way of any presence since the technology has been deployed we really have heard al Qaeda along the tribal regions when it comes to managing the Arab Spring and understanding the threats at Libya face but not having a trained army trying to not be bush at all costs outsourcing security and Libya to an onyx government leading from behind in Syria letting it just completely disintegrate I would say that that his approach to the Arab Spring which nobody could see coming that's quite frankly I've been a failure and I'm not very impressed by what we're doing with Iran we talked they enrich uranium I hope he up since game costs the biggest fear I have is radical Islamists getting a hold of chemical weapons in Syria or Iran getting a nuclear weapon all right senator lindsey graham thank you very much come back on the show it's well your honor you know senator and I tend not to agree on really yeah we just edit and say that loudly in South Carolina I'll say it loud and clear to help you but you know what it's great that you came on it's not a bad experience we ask questions our viewers are smart and I think it's all right I'm thinking when France he was at my birthday party well I'm just thinking it's too bad that some folks who work in Washington like Heidi Heitkamp can't come on and answer questions don't get me started on honey we are covering all right hey Lindsay thank you so much for being with us good luck with Mark Sanford when he gets back all right we'll buy him dinner okay very good

California is recognized for two minutes as my colleague for California pointed out in we in Porter Ranch experienced the largest natural gas leak in history seven thousand families were evacuated for months and yet as I speak there are no federal regulations for underground natural gas storage facilities and the state regulations are surprisingly minimal even in famously green California why because the natural gas industry and regulators believe that natural gas was only a problem if you were in within a few hundred feet what we've experienced with this multi billion cubic foot leak is seven thousand families evacuated from an area in a five mile radius because the volatile organic compounds on the mercaptan in that natural gas caused enormous health problems that's why I went to the President of the United States and the vice president at the caucus that we attended and got a public commitment that we would get regulations probably this year this legislation is important because it makes it clear that while finsih has the regulatory authority to act if they don't act they are required to act within two years under this legislation I'm pleased to say that the legislation includes a provision that I think is very important than which I have championed from the beginning and that is to clarify that a state can adopt tougher standards than whatever the federal government adopts the legislation also officially establishes the Department of Energy Aliso Canyon natural gas task force that task force is already up and running we're working with it it's the brainchild of senators boxer in Feinstein and I think formally establishing in this regulation makes sense we need tough natural gas storage safety regulations for this entire country because Aliso Canyon one the storage facility next to porter ranch was only the fifth largest natural gas storage field there could be others it could be in your district that's why we need tough standards and if we don't get them from fem so this year we'll have legislation requiring them within two years after the enactment of this legislation I yield back

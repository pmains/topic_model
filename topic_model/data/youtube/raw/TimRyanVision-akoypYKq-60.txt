of the most direct benefits for the war on poverty is an increase in the minimum wage and today ironically enough is the five-year anniversary since the minimum wage has been increased some states are higher than the 725 federal minimum wage some are in ohio 795 in index for inflation which is better but not anywhere near where we need to be and i wanted to come and talk for a couple minutes about need to do to and what the benefits would be and i know we normally hear from somebody who's going to say this is going to cost jobs this is going to slow down economic growth and all the rest and i will share with them a study that just came out from labor that said that the 13 states that increased the minimum wage this year had some increase whether index for inflation or through legislation saw an increase in the minimum wage had more rapid job growth than all of the other states and for those people who don't understand how that could be because we hear so much rhetoric this is going to cost jobs this is going to cost jobs if the average family has more money in their pocket to go out and buy things that is good for the economy and imagine if the walmarts and the sam's clubs and all the rest had a higher minimum wage if those folks were making an extra couple bucks an hour and it doesn't have to happen tomorrow we can do it and stage it over the course of the next uh few years to make sure it doesn't have a dramatic impact on business but of all of those folks made an extra 16 or 20 dollars a day an extra 100 bucks a week an extra 200 bucks every two weeks for a pay an extra 400 bucks a month that's a lot of money that's enough to go out and get a chevy cruze made in lordstown ohio and pay the insurance and the rest on that and what's that do for the economy if the million and a half people in the country the 62 000 people in my congressional district who make the minimum wage go out and have a little bit extra money that's how you're going to move the economy and

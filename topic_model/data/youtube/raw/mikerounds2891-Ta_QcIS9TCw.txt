let me just begin by saying thank you very much to all of you for your support uh to myself and to my family um in the passing of my wife gene uh been a very difficult couple of weeks but most certainly as all of you know life moves forward and she's in a much better place we're back to work in washington and it's different nobody to really text back home and say i've made it or anything like that but nonetheless uh this is where our work is at right now this week coming off of thanksgiving break we've got the national defense authorization act which we'd like to address there's a number of very important items within it that i think should become law but we'll have some challenges getting it through the senate we've also got a continuing resolution which will fund government which we have to address before the end of the week that will be a challenge but i think within the senate there's enough reasonable people here that will find a path forward to take care of that and then finally we have a debt ceiling increase which we'll have to work through we're not exactly sure how much time we have on that but it may very well be sometime in january nonetheless all of those items are kind of in the forefront here right now they're important items that need to be addressed i just wanted to let you know that i've appreciated all of your help all of your support we're back in we're working and i think that's the way that gene would have wanted it and most certainly that's our commitment to you is to get back to work and to do what's right thanks

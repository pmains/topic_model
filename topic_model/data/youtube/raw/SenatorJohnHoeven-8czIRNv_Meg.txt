well unfortunately we came up one vote short on the keystone pipeline today i wanted to make two observations number one i want to congratulate senator hogan again for his extraordinary good work on this and number two to let everyone know this will be an early item on the agenda in the next congress and i'm very confident that senator hogan's bill will succeed and we'll be able to get it down to the president congratulations senator hovind i turn it over to you thanks leader uh well we're disappointed we knew it was a going to be a tough to get the 60 vote threshold we've had 59 as you're aware of thought we might get 60 or 61 didn't happen but all along as we've said we knew we'd be in the new congress on this issue because the president's made it clear he's going to veto this bill and so we were prepared to come back and if you do the math we had 59 votes today but if you look at the new congress you can count four more right away net and i think there may be others when you look at west virginia when you look at iowa south dakota colorado you can see that we're well over 60. but we're going to have to do better than that we're either going to have to get to 67 or we're going to have to attach this legislation to a broader energy package or maybe an appropriations bill we've done that before again in 2012 we passed the keystone bill attached to the payroll tax holiday that required the president to make a decision he turned the project down that's why we've come back under the commerce clause of the constitution and this bill provides congressional approval for the project so as i've talked about with many of you we'll go back and and work to decide the best approach but i want to thank our leader for saying that we're going to be back on this bill in the new congress early on and it comes down to the merits it is about energy it is about jobs it is about economic growth and it is about national security by building a secure energy future for this country and not depending on the middle east for our energy and the american people know it and overwhelmingly they're saying to their elected representatives and senators approve this project and so we're not going to stop until we do

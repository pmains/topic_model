REPUBLICANS INTRODUCE A TAX  REFORM BILL THAT CAN PASS THE  HOUSE. JOINING US IS REPRESENTATIVE PATRICK McHENRY OF NORTH CAROLINA HE'S THE REPUBLICANS CHIEF DEPUTY REPRESENTATIVE. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK WITH US. >> GREAT TO BE ON. >> YOU'RE ONE OF THE DEPUTY  WHIPS. THAT MEANS YOU COUNT VOTES DO YOU HAVE THE VOTES BASED ON WHAT YOU KNOW OF THE BILL AND AS REPRESENTATIVE KING SAID IT'S  BEEN KEPT PRETTY CLOSELY UNDER WRAPS. DO YOU HAVE THE VOTES TO PASS IT BY THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS IF IT DOES NOT INCLUDE A DEDUCTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL TAXES? >> NOBODY HAS SEEN THE RUNS YET. IT'S HARD TO ARGUE TO REPUBLICAN MEMBERS TO VOTE FOR A BILL IF IT'S A NET TAX CUT, THEY'RE GOING TO BE FOR IT YOU HAVE TO SEE THE MODEL. I'VE GOT GREAT CONFIDENCE WE'LL  BE ABLE TO PASS THIS BILL. WE'LL PASS IT BEFORE THANKSGIVING >> IS REPRESENTATIVE KING GOING  TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE  PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WHERE THE RATES ARE, WHERE THE VARIOUS BRACKETS KICK IN HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AND MODEL FOR HIS DISTRICT THE NET EFFECT OF MAYBE LOSING THE STATE AND LOCAL AND EVEN THE PROPERTY TAX WRITE OFF THAT'S  IMPORTANT IN MANY OF THOSE STATES >> EVERYBODY WANTS TO ARGUE  ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL TAX  DEDUCTION OR SOME TAX LOOPHOLE EVEN IT'S ABOUT THE NET EFFECT. TAX REFORM IS ABOUT ELIMINATING  AND SIMPLIFYING THE TAX CODE AND ACTUALLY, AS A RESULT, FOR REPUBLICANS, REFORM MEANS LOWER  TAXES AS WELL. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL RENDER  TO GOVERNMENT FAR LESS THAN THEY ARE TODAY. THE REASON I'M FOR THIS PLAN IS  IT PROVIDES MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF HELPS SMALL BUSINESSES STAY IN BUSINESS AND GROW AND HELPS US KEEP JOBS IN AMERICA I KNOW PETE IS VERY CONCERNED  ABOUT THIS AND A NUMBER OF MEMBERS FROM HIGH TAX STATES ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE TAX DEDUCTION. ONCE THEY SEE THE FULL MODEL THEY WILL BUY INTO THE PLAN. >> I HATE TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON  PROCESS. WE HAVE VIEWERS WHO UNDERSTAND TAXES WELL WE HEARD THE STANDARD DEDUCTION  GOES UP DRAMATICALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST WON'T HAVE  TO ITEMIZE >> WE DOUBLE THE STANDARD  DEDUCTION. >> RIGHT >> MARRIED COUPLE HAS $24,000, THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON. THEN WE GO TO 12% RATE ONCE THIS MODEL IS OUT, YOU'LL SEE A MASSIVE TAX CUT FOR THE  MIDDLE CLASS >> THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION DOESN'T MEAN AS MUCH TO PEOPLE AS IT DOES NOW >> RIGHT IF YOU'RE TAKING THE STANDARD  DEDUCTION AND WE BELIEVE THE MODEL IS OVER 85% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL TAKE THE  STANDARD DEDUCTION THEN YOU'LL SEE A DRAMATIC EFFECT FOR THEIR TAXES THE REMAINING 15% THAT ITEMIZE BETWEEN 5 AND 15% THAT ITEMIZE THEN YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE IT STILL WORKS FOR THEM TOO WE DON'T WANT A TAX INCREASE ON  AMERICAN PEOPLE. I'M A REPUBLICAN I'M NOT PREACHING THAT THAT'S NOT WHY I CAME TO CONGRESS >> CONGRESSMAN, WHAT ODDS WOULD  YOU PLACE THAT THIS BILL IS  REVEALED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC  TOMORROW OR FRIDAY >> 100%. >> YOU THINK IT'S 100% IF YOU DON'T MISS IT BY FRIDAY,  YOU'LL PROBABLY MISS THE MONDAY  MARKUP THAT WILL PUSH YOU AFTER  THANKSGIVING >> EVERYBODY WANTS TO PUT THESE  SCENARIOS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE RUNS  WORK IN ALL OF OUR MEMBERS'  DISTRICTS. THEIR REPRESENTATIVES HERE IN  WASHINGTON CAN GO HOME THIS  WEEKEND AND EXPLAIN WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS DETAIL. WE'LL HAVE LEGISLATIVE TAX EVERYBODY WILL SEE THIS AND SEE  WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE'LL CALCULATE THE MACRO EFFECT AND INDIVIDUAL EFFECT ON FAMILIES  AND SMALL BUSINESSES >> THIS BILL HAS BEEN KEPT UNDER CLOSE WRAPS IS A LONG BILL THE DEBATE PEERT IS GOING TO BE  BRIEF. DO YOU THINK IT'S SUFFICIENT IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THE GOP HAS  BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THE  DEMOCRATS OF THIS PUSHING  THROUGH BILLS BEFORE EVERYBODY HAS A CHANCE TO READ IT. DO YOU THINK THE DEBATE TIME IS  SUFFICIENT >> IT IS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IN DETAIL SINCE THE CAMP DRAFT  THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO IF YOU GO BACK TO THE '86 TAX  REFORM CONVERSATION, IT TOOK THREE AND A HALF YEARS BETWEEN TREASURY ONE AND FINAL PASSAGE WE'LL HAVE A SIMILAR TIME FRAME  FOR THIS TAX REFORM PACKAGE. THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT I SERVE WITH HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS IN DETAIL FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF  YEARS AND HAVE PUT REALLY BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS INTO THIS OVER THE LAST TEN MONTHS GETTING THE  DETAILS RIGHT. I'VE GOT GREAT CONFIDENCE IN IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY LONG  MARK UP NEXT WEEK IN THE WAYS  AND MEANS COMMITTEE. WE'LL BE ABLE TO VOTE ON THAT  BEFORE WE GET OUT FOR

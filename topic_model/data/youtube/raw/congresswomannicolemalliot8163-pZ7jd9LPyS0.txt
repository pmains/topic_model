new york republican congresswoman nicole maliotakis with more on this congressman as um hillary pointed out the shooter sent out three messages on facebook about a half an hour before he went on his murderous rampage those messages again said i'm going to shoot my grandmother i shot my grandmother and then i'm going to shoot in elementary school again as facebook said those were private messages to a single user that might have been difficult to track but he also posted images of himself as hillary pointed out on instagram uh he posted images of guns he had an exchange with somebody that apparently made him very uncomfortable and we saw this before with the guy that shot up the new york city subway that he had quite a extensive social media profile do social media companies have a responsibility to more closely monitor what's going on there in terms of potentially violent acts and helping to flag people who might commit them yeah this is uh something that i think we're all grappling with right now i think the issue is we do need to engage these social media companies we need to engage law enforcement we need to engage mental health providers and certainly individuals who see these messages they have a responsibility to also report it to authorities to try to prevent an attack i think what you said earlier today was exactly right something like this happens you hear the left calling for gun control you're hearing the right calling for more law enforcement i believe the answer is somewhere in the middle and i think that we need to talk to each other stop talking over each other unfortunately on social media today what you're seeing is politicians elected officials people in leadership positions attacking each other instead of trying to come together for a solution buffalo the shooting that took place there that individual purchased those guns legally even though new york has the toughest laws but what does new york lack you know we saw governor cuomo's policies that closed thousands of mental health beds beds across the state that perhaps has a lot to do with what we're seeing but i think at the end of the day the solution is probably somewhere in the middle but unless we are willing to speak to each other and engage those law enforcement professionals sometimes politicians feel that you know their legislation may be great but it may not be practical and so that is why we need to have everyone at the table to have a serious discussion about how we prevent this from occurring in the future yeah unfortunately in the hours i mean you could make the case minutes that followed the shooting it became a heated political debate as it often does and people are left wondering congresswoman will anything change how do we prevent this in the future parents all over the country are worried here was the governor of texas during a live update during this show yesterday on real gun laws and big city crime i know people like to try to oversimplify this let's talk about some real facts and and that is there are quote real gun laws in chicago there are more people who were shot every weekend in chicago than there are in schools in texas our job is to come up with real solutions that we can implement so you look at chicago in our brain room dug up the past weekend 28 people were shot in chicago one fatally prior weekend 33 people were shot five fatally and so on new york in the weekend in five may 22nd there were 32 shooting incidents in new york city with 36 victims i could go on do you think that is a fair comparison and do you agree with the point that stricter gun control laws will not lead to less crime and less shootings well look each state here has a cookie cutter approach when you speak about new york though it is clear that we have uh some of the toughest laws in the nation and it has not stopped incidents that occurred for example in in buffalo but what you do know also in new york it's it's not just uh guns that are the violence right you have people who are stabbing people to death you have people who are shoving people in front of trains you have a tremendous issue here with crime with violence with mental illness so i think all of that needs to be addressed across the board um you know there was somebody in my district who was recently stabbed to death uh and and and you know gun laws wouldn't have prevented that death and what about the people who are being attacked by mentally ill individuals who are riding the subway there is not um safety precautions there i think so so two things i think definitely the mental illness has to be addressed as well but i think just a fundamental teaching in society we need to start teaching our young people to respect human life to respect one another as individuals to not look at people based on their race or their religion or their creed or where they've come from and i think that's lacking in our schools today you know there seems to be a lack of value of human life when you see people getting killed on the street for you know 20 dollar robbery it is it is incredibly sad and i think as a society we need to do better and as i said at the very beginning it encompasses all of this it has to be a much larger conversation but i think social media is attributed unfortunately to a lot of what we're seeing in society of lack of respect for one another as human beings congresswoman let me if i could just go back to what you said a moment ago you said that you believe that the answer lies somewhere in the middle does that mean that you would accept some move toward tighter restrictions on gun ownership for certain people well look as a new york state legislature i did vote for certain restrictions and i think that again it has to be a compromise and i think that we can't do anything without engaging our law enforcement partners oftentimes i've seen legislation come to the floor where law enforcement is saying this is not practical or they're against certain things like a database for example you know we need to make sure that the people who are actually going to be enforcing these laws are there when we're writing these laws because at the end of the day we need something that is practical what good is it to have laws if in practice they don't work the idea is to prevent something like this from happening in the future and i do think that there is a balance to be achieved here if we just listen and engage and have a real discussion instead of looking to just score you know political points and sadly some who are politicizing a tragedy i appreciate your thoughts on that thank you very much for joining us thank you thanks good to see you okay the search for a suspected killer wanted in

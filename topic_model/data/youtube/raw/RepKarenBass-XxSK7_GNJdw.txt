democrats in the house have passed a nearly two trillion dollar stimulus bill that includes direct payments to americans the debate now moves to the senate the house bill included a minimum wage hike to 15 dollars but that provision will not be in the bill brought up in the senate because it did not meet the strict rules of budget reconciliation los angeles congresswoman karen bass says a raise of the minimum wage is desperately needed we are talking about a minimum wage of seven dollars an hour well can you imagine that i mean again fortunately our state is forward thinking we were already considering the minimum wage several years ago but um you just can't survive and so why would we in the richest country in the history of the world essentially subject people to poverty wages and what happens when you work for big companies say like a walmart or something else and you're paid the minimum wage well basically the federal government is subsidizing you because some people wind up qualifying for public assistance and medicaid and so what good does that do you're paying for it one way or another and i don't think the federal government should be responsible for subsidizing people in that manner the big companies multi-million dollar opera multi-billion dollar operations they can't afford to pay their employees better also this week congresswoman bass reintroducing the george floyd justice and policing act it includes changes to qualified immunity for law enforcement and bans on racial profiling and no knock warrants for federal drug cases bass says it was brought forth again this week because of what she calls renewed hope people are far more aware of the problems with policing in the united states than they were before the george flight justice and policing act and then i also think because we have a president who is very clearly in favor of this um i that makes me very hopeful one that we will pass it off the floor but also that we will be able to have a bill out of the senate that the president can sign and to vote on that bill is expected to happen in the house next week

this is a fraud it's a fraud president trump won by a landslide we are going to prove it i can prove it to you 18 different ways but there's no evidence of widespread voter fraud and giuliani provided no verified proof for viewers who've missed the shenanigans lately elizabeth and i are going to role play i will play a neutral observer and elizabeth will play rudy giuliani rudy i'd like you to tell me what shape this is it's a circle everybody says that this is a square the raw they're lying if you take away the edges it's a circle so just erase them katie erase them off your whiteboard but the edges are part of the shape you can't just erase them they're a fact look the edges are a fraud you can't count them the edges are not legitimate just erase them okay everybody in case you missed the metaphors here the square represents the very clear outcome the fact that joe biden won this election and also what's happening is bananas trump won the election he'll win the recount he'll win in court moving forward here at the white house under the assumption that there will be a second uh trump term we keep hearing the drum beat of where is the evidence right here sean three binders these are court filings and affidavits we have a hundred more of these i can't show them to you and we think we will win because we have so much evidence so much proof there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes well the trump campaign has lost 32 of 34 lawsuits that they filed since the election and donald trump tried an outrageous stunt on friday when he invited michigan lawmakers to the white house to try to pressure them to give him the electoral votes even though joe biden won the state by a hundred and fifty four thousand votes here in michigan it was 154 000 vote margin and no one has come up with any evidence of fraud or abuse and in georgia after a hand recount confirmed biden's win the trump team requested another recount even after the republican secretary of state certified the results i'm a passionate conservative and as i've said before i'm a proud trump supporter as secretary of state i believe that the numbers that we have presented today are correct meanwhile my colleagues in the senate are refusing to call to square a square until electoral college votes anyone who's running for office can exhaust concern in fact he may not have been defeated at all tell you i think president trump has every right to demand that every legal vote be counted trump has not lost do not concede mr president fight hard at the same time some republicans are expressing frustration with his refusal to accept defeat so what i did is got out my white board and broke it down naming names those who are standing up for democracy those who are completely repeating trump's bs and those who are wishy-washy going back and forth it's hard to measure those slippery ones one republican even said what's the downside of humoring trump for a little bit elizabeth can you think of any downside sure i can think of one like undermining the foundation of our democracy republicans are actively trying to erase votes they're targeting their hoax lawsuits on districts that are heavily democratic and populated by people of color and they're trying to erase their votes and their voices and it's only done in black communities where was it done in detroit in wayne county it's being done in black cities across the country we're not going to let them steal the election right before our eyes that's really what folk want to do look i come from a witnessing tradition that says when you see something that is wrong you're called on to speak out we've got a quarter of a million americans dead from a pandemic cases are rising we are in a crisis his anti-democratic actions are a stain not just on the united states but on democracy movements around the world and any republican leader who doesn't speak out is also a stain and we should never forget what side they chose in this moment of crisis for our nation

Republican senator Tom Cotton remember the center armed services committee sir good morning to you thank you for your time I just want you to know right now that our Fox producer Chad pergram is telling us in the house side the vaccine mandate will be stripped out of the house defense Bill and we'll get a little more information about later today what is your reaction on all this senator well Bill I've urged the Department of Defense to end this pointless vaccine mandate at a time when we have historically bad recruiting and retention numbers if the Department of Defense won't do it Congress needs to put an end to the vaccine mandate for our troops but the real Inside Story here is what Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are doing to try to hold this defense Bill hostage we pass it every year we pass it every year for 60 years it's vital for our national security and for our troops they want to add on all kinds of extraneous non-defense measures like a payoff for liberal media companies to form a cartel to work with big Tech that'll hurt center right media Outlets or allowing marijuana Distributors to engage in the banking system or paying off Joe manchin for his vote for their trillion dollar bill spending bill this summer none of these have anything to do with our troops and if the Democrats insist on adding these extraneous measures to the defense Bill Republican Senators should filibuster it and frankly House Republicans whose votes are necessary to pass in the house should not go vote for it either until the Democrats back down and send pass a defense bill that is actually focused on our national security and supporting our Troopers a little more detail on this we're told the bill will not reinstate service members who were discharged or had benefits slashed due to the refusal uh to take the vaccine so this debate's going to continue Senator I want to take you overseas in Iran we were told over the weekend the morality peace police had been suspended for the time and apparently that's not the case New York Post no Iran didn't ban the morality police had duped the press and bite Administration quote the truth Iranian women are still subject to the oppression of a radical theocracy in Tehran millions of Iranians want to see an end of the Islamic Republic of Iran and President Joe Biden needs to finally pick a side end quote So based on this tehran's not changing sir no they're not the ayatollahs would never end the morale police it's essential to what they view as an Islamic revolution they're spreading around the world what President Biden should do is proudly and loudly support the brave Iranians who are yearning for freedom and risking their lives to protest their Theocratic dictatorship in that country we should also put an end to the farce of the negotiations with Iran over Iran's nuclear program we should reimpose the sanctions that would stop Iran from getting the billions of dollars it needs to spread terrorism or for that matter to provide the drones that Russia is now using to attack innocent civilians in Ukraine Iran is an outlaw Rogue regime we can never trust it and we should do everything we can to support those Brave Iranians who are protesting it um last topic a little later today president goes to Arizona you talk about uh the possibility of an immigration deal coming together possibly between Republicans and Democrats would you be on board that they need 12 Republicans in the Senate to go for it you see that happening during this lame duck session no absolutely not Bill certainly not during the lame duck session because before we have any other kind of immigration reform we have to get control of our border you hear a lot of talk about so-called dreamers and how we need to give them some kind of legal status well right now Joe Biden is creating hundreds of thousands of more so-called dreamers every month what we have to do is secure our border prevent this historic flood of illegal aliens coming to our country before we address any other issues in our immigration system you don't know if he's got a dozen votes to you on behalf of Republicans or no no he does not and we're not going to have it in the next couple weeks if we have any immigration reform it's going to come next year with the Republican house and it has to address our border and it has to address the needs of working class Americans to get stable jobs with growing wages that outpace inflation okay Senator thank you Tom Cotton thanks for coming on today appreciate your time [Music]

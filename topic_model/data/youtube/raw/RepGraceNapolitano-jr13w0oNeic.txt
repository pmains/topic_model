um I now recognized ranking member on Napolitano for her statement thank you Mr chairman I rise in very strong opposition to this resolution of disapproval clean water were not always a partisan issue and no issue as more support among American families than the protection of our nation's Waters now is the worst time to lower our guard on protecting clean water as over half of the United States are experiencing drought conditions we need to be doing everything to ensure our cities our businesses our Farmers have sufficient safe and sustainable Water Supplies of water to meet our economic and agriculture needs our quality of life needs and our day-to-day survival I've dedicated much of my time in Congress to protecting our critical water supplies and making sure that we capture use and reuse every available drop of water in our communities and I don't plan to stop now last week public survey found that westerners are more concerned than ever about inadequate Water Supplies almost nine and ten westerners say that inadequate water supply is a serious problem in their state this is especially true in my state of home state of California as the Metropolitan water district the biggest District in the area commented to my subcommittees earlier this month the definition of waters is Central to the Clean Water acts implementation and has significant implications for metropolitan's day-to-day operations and Source water protection efforts that is why I support the efforts of the Bible Administration to permanently repeal the previous administration's dirty water rule the rules that eliminated Federal protections on a minimum of 75 percent of the stream and wetlands that have been protected by the ACT since its interception these Waters and wetlands are critical to capturing and storing rain and snowmelt to ensure long-term water supply and recharge our underground aquifers yet the dirty water rule limited or eliminated protections over Waters that provide a source of drinking water sober 117 million Americas Mr chairman I cannot understand how this resolution which seeks to undermine and confuse agency efforts to protect clean water makes any sense to microstitches who are already making sacrifices to protect our local water yes there is a cost of presentation in our communities our sources of drinking water and our environment however that cost should be borne by those seeking to pollute our water waste or fill our Wetlands for their own personal gain rather than transferring that cost to the average American or to Downstream States this resolution would increase level of pollution in their water bodies and increase risk of Downstream flooding and increase certainty that certain communities like mine cannot maintain sustainable sources of drinking water worst of all hard-working American families have to pay for the horrible impacts of the resolution we all want certainty and for decades that regulation established by former President Reagan and implemented by every Republican and Democratic Administration since then establish the framework to achieve that certainty but that we but we believe we can have certainty as well as clean water we don't have to choose between them to me the answer is clear the button group provides the best available option to balance the needs for protected our Waters with the desire for familiarity and workability within the constraints of the law and interpretations of the Supreme Court this resolution receives none of those outcomes and only likely to make it worse not better I strongly oppose the resolution and urge my colleagues to vote against a new back to bounce of my time foreign

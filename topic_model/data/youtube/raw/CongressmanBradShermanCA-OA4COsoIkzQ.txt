interesting week for corporate governance we learn that one of the most respected institutions on Wall Street countenanced two million bank fraud transactions committed by 5,300 people and that the top corporate managers devised the system to put incentives and threats of firing on the the lower ranking employees that they maintain this system knowing that there were at least a thousand employees they had fired for fraud and that they failed to monitor whether these accounts were actually authorized and so in this week when we find about 2 million criminal fraudulent transactions at just one big corporation we're told that the only problem in corporate governance is that CEOs are annoyed having to talk about shareholder proposals a real corporate governance hearing would not be one where we would consider a bill put forward by the chairman of the full committee that would eliminate the clawback provisions applicable to this case clearly those who left the company or who those who are staying with the company and got hundred million dollar bonuses and incentive packages should be called the answer but the SEC hasn't finalized the regulations we're throwing around the term gadfly and so I check with Jeff Foxworthy about what it means if you care about conflict minerals you might be a gadfly if you don't or rent Iran to have a nuclear weapon you might be a gadfly if you get proxy advice rather than simply automatically signing whatever management wants you to sign you might be a gadfly if you fail to get your proposal adopted the first time and have the stick-to-itiveness to provide it to propose it again you might be a gadfly and if you believe that Wall Street values are not the sole determinant of human morality you might be a gadfly this is a hearing about whether we're going to have real capitalism where the owners control the companies or whether we're going to continue to have crony capitalism which is so much more popular the packs that contribute to members of Congress are all controlled by the CEOs and we have the crony capitalism that says whatever management wants to do they get to do and the owners of the company have no right to stop them now part of the attack on capitalism is to tell investors that it is virtually illegal for them to consider anything other than earnings per share and making an investment that if they choose to care about not investing in Iran that they're prohibited from doing so and they'll be gone won't be given the information I would say that it is the SCC's job to protect investors and that means all investors including those who care about Iran's nuclear programs about conflict minerals about the money that is going from corporate Treasuries to this end around our campaign finance laws investors who are deprived of the right to know basically have their money stole what taken from them they can't make their own investment decisions ms Simpson we're here to protect cheer holder value is it true that your organization controls is the shareholder for far more shares than anyone else on the all the other rest of the panelists combined disperse have more than the mr. Copeland's organization how many billion are we talking about compass is responsible for over 300 billion dollars okay if if anyone on the panel controls over a hundred billion can you please raise the no hands are going up uh so we're here to protect your holder value but we only have one major shareholding organization testifying mr. England you proposed that two thousand dollar figure was too small but then you said it should be a longer holder holding period than one year our tax laws define long-term investor sometimes it's six months at best one year if we're going to say that you're not a long-term investor for purposes of the proxy statement shouldn't we take away your capital gains allowance as well on the same basis well let me be clear you're making some headway in your effort to regulate corporations and 2000 we had 6,000 of them and you've got it down to 4,500 now so there are fewer of these companies be worrying about that are incorporated I I think that mr. England are used to talking about publicly traded corporation rated yeah okay so that's what we're talking about i think those regulated by the SEC and and there's a diminishing number of those and I would submit that some of the regulatory over kill has something to do with that then that part of it also is the corporate merger mania that occurs on Wall Street where one of those corporations buys another one last corporation see and why do they do that then we have a lot of pride a lot of private equity is making a lot of money well anyway are you holding out for more than a one-year a period of time that somebody has to invest in company in order to put forward proxy proposal I want to restore some balance to a process and I think $2,000 ownership share I'm asking about Helen for one year and if not enough is your you arguing I know you're arguing for more than two thousand dollars are you doing for longer than one year I I would personally make that a little bit longer yes if we do the tax code as well I'll be with you I yield back emails back is it all

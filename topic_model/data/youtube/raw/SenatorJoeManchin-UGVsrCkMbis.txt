Hoppy, the the thing of it
is, it's for our country, everyone thinks this is
for West Virginia, or it's about me, it has nothing
to do with me. And it has everything to do not only
with West Virginia, but our country and the
security and energy that we need. And that's the
bottom line, there's not another project in America
today, that will bring this much energy within
four to five months, within a half year,
there's nothing that we can go to that will bring
2 billion cubic feet back into the marketplace. With
the high energy costs that we have, the high gas and
natural gas price, to high gasoline prices. The only
way you can get those prices down is by
manufacturing and competing more, producing
more. And that's what this is about. So when the
President made a commitment on this, I
think he looked at the whole energy portfolio of
what we have and what we need right now and coming
to realization we've got to have product in the
market. And this is one way to do it. And so I'm
very pleased about this and my goodness, Hoppy, on
top of that it's it's 2,500 construction jobs.
$1.2 billion in additional investment to complete the
project, and then you're going to have $40 million
annual new tax revenue for our state.

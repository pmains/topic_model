i want to welcome back congresswoman karen bass to our conversation i'm also joined by the former police chief of camden new jersey j scott thompson and congresswoman ayanna pressley of massachusetts it's nice to have you all with me if i may begin with you congresswoman presley people talk about defunding the police and then other people say well what that means is is uh divesting some funds from the police and other people say no it's really about moving some funds around within the police department what does defund the police mean to you we've seen the militarization of our police force result in the over policing of historically under invested so we have communities being over policed but under resourced and in fact divested from i support and believe we need to radically reimagine how we have safer healthier communities if someone is having a mental health challenge or incident why are we deploying the police to their home instead of a mental health clinician congresswoman bass um as you know there are now ads running a lot that talk about well if you defund the police now you can see where the phone calls go to voicemail when you try to call the police or there's just no one there to answer the phone at all this is going to be obviously the messaging around framing something as defunding police yes and i think it's the same lie that's been told for the last several decades i was first involved in in this issue around the funding in the 1980s and we talked about how the federal government was devolving its responsibility to the states in the states to the county and the counties to the city we made a commitment that we were going to build community institutions and we never did it and then we started investing all of the resources to fight quote-unquote crime as opposed to looking at the root causes so the lie that is being told about no one is going to respond to a 9-1-1 call is the same lie that led to us investing all of our resources in policing and shredding the safety net chief thompson you've heard from both congresswomen kind of a draft of what serving the community from a policing standpoint could potentially look like you were the chief in camden new jersey walk us through why camden has been held up as a model for how you could think about defunding or reinvesting in policing what happened there so when you look at the city of camden's history a city that had a major race riots in the 60s and 70s that were precipitated by police violence failing school systems it was a perfect storm of social inequities and in 2013 we had fired the entire city police force and started a new county police force and what that gave us the ability to do was to create a new culture and a new policing paradigm to try to address what was seeming to be intractable issues that vets the city what we did was we stopped talking and telling people what needed to be done in their neighborhoods we started to listen to them it wasn't that people didn't want their police they just wanted us to behave differently and up until that point in time we always had our ears closed and we thought we knew what was best and we had very high levels of mistrust and and we were not able to make the city a better place until we did this significant paradigm shift congresswoman presley earlier on this program we had patrice cullers on to talk a little bit about the the breathe act proposal which goes farther i think than any moderate democrat would ever really be willing to sign up for i know that you've embraced it and and not many others besides you uh what do you think is the potential that that actually is going to have any kind of legs i think it is exactly the sort of responsive reframe in paradigm shift that we need to be offering legislatively when it comes to racial justice and true justice writ large and the black lives matter uh transitioning into a movement for black lives if you acknowledge the fact that the disproportionate hate hurt and harm that has been foisted on to black americans was precise discriminatory draconian and it was legislated now we have to legislate healing and justice and the only receipts that matter in this moment as we're in the midst of a culture shift transitioning to a power shift are how we legislate and then how we codify protect and affirm black lives in our budgets we have a question sent in from a viewer take a look at this congresswoman bass my name is michael cole my question is around school resource officers or sros police officers who operate within our public schools do you see the value of their presence in our buildings and if so how do we leverage that to ensure safety and even community relationships you have a master's degree in social work so i guess i'm leaning on that part of your background to answer that question i don't know what a resource officer is in columbus ohio i do know what a police officer is in the los angeles unified school district and if you look at that budget and then to hear the school districts say that they don't have money for college counselors they don't have money for social workers they don't have money for psychologists what are we doing we are replicating the same issues that we have in the city where we criminalize social economic and health problems instead of investing all of the money that it takes for law enforcement why don't we invest it in prevention in the first place that is something that i believe needs to be done congresswoman karen bass congresswoman ayanna presley and chief scott thompson thank you for joining me

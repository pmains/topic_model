i thank you and i thank our colleague congresswoman christensen for uh taking the special order today so that we can sing the praises of a great man our colleague dear friend precious person donald payne i waited i i said i wanted to go after mr cleaver because i didn't know how i was going to even have the strength to come to the floor because this is a personal as well as official loss to many of us here and he is always a source of strength to us putting in perspective the fragility of life and the value that we must place on the contribution of all of our colleagues especially when we are blessed with the life service and leadership of someone like donald payne there are very few people that you can say someone like donald payne because he was exceptional and unique when they distinguished mr cleaver and reverend claver says that we have to fill in where and and take his mantle of the almost impossible to do because over a lifetime in public service in a long time in the congress of the united states donald payne gained standing on issues that it takes years to do but he did teach us along the way he gave us guidance on what path to follow what clues to to recognize in doing the right thing whether it was in the continent of asia africa latin america wherever it was and in our own country i had the privilege of traveling with donald payne when we were going to darfur and he didn't want to go to the sudan he'd been there many times at darfur but he was at that moment boycotting the regime and khartoum because of how they treated their people there while we were in khartoum he was in and in darfur he was in ethiopia and and somalia and the rest always working always working to have policy advice to all of us and caring about what the impact of that policy was on people what was interesting to us though is on that same trip uh to africa uh which many of members of the congressional black caucus were on including our distinguished assistant leader melbourne when we went to liberia it was a boiling hot day boiling hot day and we all went to the ame college there and at that time the ame university and they were honoring donald payne for his everything for what he knew about africa for his values and how he he was concerned about again policy as it related to people the encyclopedic knowledge that he had the great wisdom that sprang from that knowledge the plans that he always had to make things better and the way people just flocked to him because they would learn they would be inspired and they would love donald payne but it's boiling hot we go there and they decide that we're all going to dress alike that day so it even got hotter as we donned our robes and uh and here we were seeing not only telling them the esteem with which he was held in congress that was the least of it because what we were hearing was what people from around africa esteemed with which they held him named a library for him at that university in ethiopia and excuse me in liberia but you know he was a schoolteacher and he never forgot uh how important it was to for us to put our students first he called them the bright lights of our nation's future for investing in their potential for inspiring them to succeed igniting the sparks that they had within them to do their very best he was very proud of newark and serving there remember when he first came here his work on behalf of his constituents his neighbors the middle class working people people who were striving to reach up into the middle class he was always working for them he was new jerseys as has been mentioned first african-american member of congress he remained a champion a committed champion of equality and opportunity for all again he and his accomplishments both on his subcomm his committee where he served with congressman george miller who holds him in the highest esteem and on his foreign affairs committee where he serves with congressman howard berman well to hear the two of them talk uh today it's as if they have lost a brother and we all have they had a full appreciation of his hard work ethic again the knowledge that he brought to his subjects the concern he had for the american people and love he had for our country what did just think last week we had a visit to our office from bill gates coming to our office to talk about the issue of global health and he asked if donald payne could be in the meeting we had hoped that would be possible but then had to say that he was not feeling well that day this was a week ago a week ago but up until the end he was in demand recognized for his again standing on issues that related to the alleviation of poverty the eradication of disease again eradicate alleviation of hunger throughout the world and what more could be about the gospel of matthew than ministering to the needs of god's creation which the bible tells us is an act of worship to ignore those needs is to dishonor the god who made us uh donald payne was all about worshiping god by ministering to the needs i was an expert on economic political and security situations throughout africa and uh and i had the honor of uh nominating him recognizing his extraordinary work around the world i was proud to recommend that president george w bush named donald p congress congressman payne our congressional representative the democrats at the united nations uh usually it was just for one term uh on the case of donald payne we went well beyond that in recognition of the extraordinary contribution that he makes so again whether it was in his own district whether it was newark new jersey or across the world he he was a powerful and passionate voice i hope it's a comfort to his children to donald jr to wanda and nicole and all who love donald payne his dear brother bill who traveled with him frequently and loved him so much i hope it's a comfort to them that so many people who knew him well loved him so much mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time with that mr speaker again thank mr rowe and congresswoman christensen uh for the opportunity to say just a few things uh about our dear friend who will be sadly missed and long remembered his legacy lives on in the congress of the united states thank you mr speaker i would now like to yield time to the distinguished gentleman from maryland

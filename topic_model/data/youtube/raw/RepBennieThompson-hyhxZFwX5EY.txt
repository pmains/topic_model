indeed here's hoping wolf the Department of Homeland Security is working off something a little more official than its gut feelings here's why in an interview cago Tribune editorial board secretary michael chertoff said this I believe we are entering a period this summer of increased risk summertime seems to be appealing to them meaning al Qaeda he added we do worry that they are rebuilding their activities on quote but shirt off said there are not enough indications of an imminent plot to raise the threat levels instead his remarks were based on a gut feeling formed by earlier patterns of terror attacks recent al-qaeda statements and intelligence that he wouldn't disclose the White House said today there is no specific credible terror threat against the US and denied a report about an emergency meeting to discuss a potential al-qaeda threat meanwhile the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee representative Bennie Thompson has written a letter to Ray Allen showed off asking him to explain his gut feeling Thompson wants to know what color code is associated with the Secretary's gut feeling and which cities ought to be beefing up their security here's the question Homeland Security Secretary Michael Sherlock has a gut feeling that the u.s. is at a higher risk for a terror attack how much should that matter email capita file at cnn.com or go to cnn.com / cavity fire what these people think about the implications what they're saying the very well general gut feeling could make a lot of people nervous we're going to have a full report on this later in the Situation Room rkelly arena has been speaking to michael chertoff about that gut feeling I'm anxious to hear what he has to say on this day afterwards thanks Jack very much coming up but might it have that's the the Homeland Security Secretary says he has a gut feeling we could face more security threats this summer Michael Chertoff tells the Chicago Tribune editorial board there's no specific threat he's talking about but he says his assessment is based on patterns of terror attacks in Europe plus US intelligence you see an entity that is improving itself there's a we're improving ourselves they're happening with Datak and therefore we can't afford from them static our end is technology & M the vigilance of the ordinary citizen secretary Chertoff is a very circumspect man and he chooses his words very carefully he's not one to hide things so for him to say that he thinks that there is an increased risk this summer i think is very significant indeed and the factors he cited are the factors to be cited namely the increased number of warnings from bin Laden and from Zawahiri there have been so many taped warnings lately that those whose job it is to keep track of them we're finding it hard to do so increasingly sophisticated tapes by the way further there's this pattern of al-qaeda attacking least in Britain in the summer of course the plot was on file just a couple of weeks ago that's the most recent one but at least one lawmaker wants details House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Benny Thompson said shirt off a letter asking what color code is associated with a gut feeling and what city should put police on overtime as a result of that the effort in a 120 days President Bush says he would veto that atty Democratic congressman wants the Homeland Security Secretary to explain his quote gut feeling about the increased risk of a terror attack in the US this summer Michael Chertoff told the Chicago Tribune he doesn't have any specifics a basis is assessment on intelligence and earlier patterns of terrorists in Europe secretary Chertoff says quote summertime seems to be appealing to them end quote House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson has written to the secretary asking for clarification the Mississippi Democrat asks what color code is associated with a gut feeling about the terror threat and what city should be working there police on double shifts as a result President Bush's former political questions still to be a lot of questions Marcel thank you very much for talking to you have a good day and now to predictions of terror on the home front the security chief Michael Chertoff says the US bases in risk of attack the summer ABC News is reporting that an urgent meeting is scheduled tomorrow at the White House about it all kind of cell either headed to the US or already in place but the White House is working to temper that report saying this meeting is part of a regular gathering of counterterrorism officials national correspondent Katherine Harris joins us live from Washington with that story Katherine know what are you hearing about this Qaeda cell and this meeting first of all with the meeting US officials told Fox that if they really believe the cell was heading to the United States are already in the United States as was reported last night they would not wait until Thursday to hold a crisis meeting secretary trade-offs comments are also raising the ire on Capitol Hill a short time ago the head of the House Homeland Security Committee Democrat Bennie Thompson asking secretary Chertoff to explain what he meant when he said his gut is telling him we are entering a period of increased risk the letter reads in part words have power mr. secretary you must choose them wisely especially when they relate to the lives and security of the American public what color code in the homeland security advisory system is associated with a gut feeling what sectors should be on alert as a result of your gut feeling US officials tell FOX several factors are in play contributing to the threat environment and actually have been for some weeks if yours al Qaeda is regrouping in the tribal areas along the afghan-pakistan border sources tell FOX they believe al Qaeda continues to plan and plot from that region as one official putted the concern is very real though the specifics are not known also the recent attacks that were thwarted in london and glasgow as well as intelligence suggesting that other targets in europe face an increased risk as well for example the germans have been on a high state of alert fearing attacks there for at least three months US officials who track intelligence as well as the patterns among terrorist honks that the spring and periods traditionally have been times when al Qaeda and its affiliates have struck they pointed the successful attack in Madrid Spain in March of 2004 as well as a similar attack in London on subway in July of 05 for reasons give me a kind of a feeling that we are in period of not of us that I have a specific threat you know that I have in mind right now but then we are entering a period of increased partner doing US officials also believe that frequency of the tapes mostly from bin Laden's number two I 1 l's our hearing they serve two purposes in fact the first is to recruit more followers and the second maybe to raise expectations that some sort of spectacular attack is actually in the pipeline Martha all right Catherine Herridge thank you very much you're welcome for more on the possibility of an increased terrorist threat this summer

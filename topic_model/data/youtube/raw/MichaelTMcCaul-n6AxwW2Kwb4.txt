building mr. long for Missouri is recognized Thank You mr. chairman and thank you all for being here today and for your testimony Admiral Lee talking about underused resources which you say there are nine is that correct none that I can think of sir and how about manpower you shorthand it or not sir we're very lean organization and growing leaner think you use ten million dollars we can use certainly sir if we hadn't spent ten million dollars trying to figure out if a professional baseball player use steroids or not you could have had it so I'm sorry to report you can't have it what on the steroids now steroid excuse mount of submersibles i'm back on steroids now the submersibles how do you detect those you have the capabilities you need to detect those that's an excellent question sir right now the semi submersibles that we're detecting and interdict in today is is an outgrowth of the pressure we've put on the on the the cartels in the t cos and in their attempts to to get the drugs in it's an innovative approach we we the best the best technology that we have right now is our overflight our aerial surveillance that and the new radars that we are putting on our new National Response cutters enable us to see further than we ever have before the fact of the matter is though as these these organizations emerged into the fully submersible technology which we know they're already have the capability of doing we have no method of detecting them once they become subsurface how can that be a separate is it's not a stealth submarine I wouldn't assume no sir we just don't have the technology such as that that the Navy has to be able to see what's underneath the surface when it's on this or navy one assist you in that sir can't assist you yes sir we work with the Navy routinely especially in the G out of South Region so you are able to track though it might not be your agency proper correct or not when that when the appropriate naval resources are in that area of operations some of them do have that capability yes sir okay I guess that's my only question on it thank you got your back thank you for the question I was going to plane to dance up myself and my time ran out but so just so I understand you cannot detect these submersibles once or under the water when they go subsurface no certain yet but the Navy can with with those vessels that they have with the technology that allows them to do that and I won't ask you how deep you can detect it with the Navy because that would give information to we are you happy to give you a more appropriate brief and a more appropriate setting on that precisely okay thank you

I I rise today to discuss America's transportation infrastructure by legislation that I just introduced today with Chairman the Environment and Public Works Committee John Barrasso along with our subcommittee chairs on Transportation and Infrastructure selling more capital and a ranking member from Maryland Ben Cardin our legislation reauthorizes our needs and our nation's service transportation laws making this story and makes an historic 287 billion dollar investment in our nation's roads highways and bridges our nation's first highway bill was enacted just a few years after the world's first concrete highway was paved outside of Detroit Michigan Henry Ford had just introduced the model key and the first stop go traffic light would soon be installed at the intersection of East 105th Street and Euclid Avenue in Cleveland Ohio a century ago the idea of speedy and safe transcontinental travel was beyond our imagination even further from being realized we've come a long way since then today more than four million miles of roadway and 600,000 bridges helped link our country together some 220 thousand of those miles combined to make up our national highway system our transportation infrastructure is essential to America's economy to our society and to our way of life it connects us to Commerce it connects us to service and more importantly it connects us to one another the sad truth however is that as we all know too well many of these roads highways bridges are in poor condition today they've been in use far beyond for many of them their intended duration of their original design a great many roadways and bridges simply need we pay while some need repairs and others need to be completely redesigned according to the US Department of Transportation mr. president approximately 20% of our federal aid roadways are in poor condition as our 47,000 bridges that's in large part because for far too long our nation's Highway Trust Fund has been operating on the brink of insolvency the highway account is running an 11 billion dollar deficit and that deficit is growing meanwhile despite spending more from the fun than we collect we still aren't spending enough to make a dent in the eight hundred billion dollar backlog of investments needed to significantly improve conditions on many of the roads highways and bridges that millions of America all of us use depend on every day all of this has contributed to an unacceptable level of uncertainty for states for cities for businesses and for families it has prevented us as a nation from addressing the serious challenges across the transportation infrastructure that go well beyond simply filling potholes for too long mr. president we fail to make meaningful progress in America toward improving safety easing traffic congestion reducing harmful emissions and enhancing resilience we can do better than this and the legislation that's before us today if enacted will help put our country back on the right track I'm excited about it and I'm grateful to everyone who has contributed in both ways both large and small to the drafting for legislation that Senator Barrasso and I have introduced today while this bill will leverage badly needed investments in rebuilding our roads highways and bridges it will do a lot more than that it will help expedite the movement of people and goods throughout our country it will support the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs here too and it will help alleviate some of the congestion which we face in urban and suburban parts of all 50 states areas across the country and almost daily bases America's transportation infrastructure Act will help make real the vision of a safer more connected efficient and climate friendly transportation system one that will endure the test of time and keep up with the evolving demands of the world's based economy our bill is a good start now we need to build on it and make it better with respect to safety too many pedestrians and bicyclists put their lives at risk every day when they use our roadways in 2017 there were more than 37,000 37 thousand fatalities in 2017 on our nation's roadways including approximately 7,000 non-motorized users think about 37,000 fatalities that's more than all the people who live in Dover Delaware or in Laramie Wyoming after training down for many years the last and last decade pedestrian deaths have increased sharply and are now at a 25-year high in tribal communities that fatality rate is even higher that is just unacceptable our legislation addresses addresses this carnage by investing two and a half billion dollars in federal funds per year in safety improvements and by compelling states and cities with very high rates of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities to do their share as well our legislation also expands funding for bike paths for sidewalks and for other transportation alternatives to 1.2 billion dollars per year in the power states and cities to design implement and manage those projects so they are better designed to fit the needs of those states and cities too many Americans simply don't have safe places to walk or bike in some cases we build roads and ways to make it impossible for people to walk or bicycle to where they need to go be in a grocery store a daycare center a health facility you name it America's transportation infrastructure should connect us not divide us let me say that again America's transportation infrastructure should connect us not divide us it should foster greater economic opportunity nots asperity our legislation seeks to improve connectivity and accessibility by establishing app idle pilot program for states and cities to measure access to destinations like hospitals like schools like grocery stores our bill also funds a program to help remove barriers such as chronically underused highways when appropriate that create obstacles to access and obstacles to mobility but an even more pressing needs to address throughout America is the roads highways and bridges that are actually over capacity today for cars and trucks and their passengers sit for hours in traffic last year mr. president every American driver lost on average 97 hours due to traffic congestion 97 hours for the average driver per year for days it's not just a nuisance for drivers last year it cost our country 87 billion dollars in lost productivity 87 billion and let's not forget that all that time we waste sitting in our cars and trucks also degrades the quality of the air we breathe increases the cost of our health care and raises the cost of the goods that we buy our legislation addresses this predicament by authorizing additional funding for the congestion mitigation and air quality program which has been used to build carpool lanes and support a number of other alternatives to reduce congestion in addition our legislation recognizes that in many places it's just not possible to build additional lanes so we need to address congestion by managing travel demand through innovative technology through transit and tolling that's why we've also created a new program mr. president for our largest cities to provide new tools new tools to help address congestion challenges and that my friends brings us to an ever more apparent reality of climate change and it's or ever-worsening impact on among other things are our infrastructure the cars trucks and vans that we drive have become our nation's largest source of carbon dioxide emissions accelerating and exacerbating the effects of climate change and bringing with it increasingly extreme weather that we are witnessing throughout the world on an almost daily basis temperatures last week in Europe that exceeded 110 degrees Fahrenheit a hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit and we've got examples here too we just come off of hottest four years in the history of this country since we've been measuring and this year looks like it's gonna be the hottest yet well we've got to do more than the fighted and with this legislation we will so mr. president I'm proud to announce that America's transportation infrastructure Act includes the first-ever climate title and a transfer transportation bill in the history of Congress our legislation calls for investing ten billion dollars over the next five years directly in problems in policies that will combat climate change by reducing emissions and improving the resiliency of our transportation networks and our infrastructure one such program is a 1 billion dollar investment in charging and fueling stations for electric an alternative vehicles traveled and heavily traveled quarters across America while Henry Ford's model-t and its internal combustion engine are an important part of our country's transportation system zero emission electric vehicles represent our future unfortunately in most parts of America today drill drivers lacked reasonable access to charging or fueling stations for electric or hydrogen fueled vehicles our legislation helps address that concern by creating competitive grants for states and localities to build hydrogen natural gas and electric vehicle charging and fueling infrastructure along many of America's most heavily traveled highway corridors meanwhile increasingly frequent and extreme weather events continue to erode our transportation networks sea level rise threatens the structural integrity and longevity of surface transportation infrastructure we see that happening now in my home state of Delaware along major portions of the East Coast and in the flooding that has occurred in the heartland of our country it's been reported in the news that in some places in America the temperatures been so hot that asphalt highways asphalt roads are bubbling bubbling up from the heat try driving through that try driving through that well our legislation seeks to help address these threats by investing nearly five billion dollars over five years and a new formula program available to all states and a competitive Brazil and a competitive resilient sea grant program both the formula program and the new protect Grants Program would support projects across America that reinforce that upgrade or realign existing transportation infrastructure to better with the with withstand extreme weather events in the effects of climate change like the record-setting temperatures that I've spoken up and let me briefly mention one other thing mr. president through the use of natural infrastructure like the marshes and wetlands to protect the roads from storm surges during tropical cyclones or Nor'easters our bill also helps harness the power of Mother Nature to improve the resilience of transportation projects well colleagues that gives you at least a glimpse of some of the exciting aspects of our legislation that our committee chairman John Barrasso and I are introducing today again with the help of a lot of people on our committee throughout the Senate Democrats and Republicans from all parts of this country and we introduce our legislation with with their help and that help comes from every corner of the country who comes from state and local governments as well in the coming months I look forward to sharing more stories about how America's transportation infrastructure Act can tackle complicated issues improve our daily lives and help us build the roads highways and bridges of the future and as bright as our chairman and I on our committee and our very able staff members like to think we are I'm confident that our bill can be improved as it moves through the legislative process in the months ahead as I often times say if it didn't perfect let's make it better well as good as what we've done is and we're proud of our handiwork we know that it could be better and we look forward to making it better and that begins tomorrow tomorrow morning with a markup in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works at 9:00 a.m. with why clothes of as president I would be remiss if I fail to remind everyone that the 800-pound gorilla in the room with respect to service transportation infrastructure is almost always how are we going to pay for the improvements and the programs that we all know we need and the fact is as I've said the Highway Trust Fund is going broke and if we're honest with one another our way of paying for it is broken too so what should we do about it it's important to note that our legislation will continue to fund the state-level vehicle miles traveled pilot program established in the 2015 bill I'm especially pleased however that our legislation also includes it's a national vehicle miles traveled pilot program the first of its kind I believe that user fee based approaches are generally the best way to fund our nation's surface transportation system and that vehicle miles traveled systems which seek to ensure that our road users pay their fair share are the future in the meantime there needs to be a bridge to that future in that bridge will not rely on a silver bullet but on what I refer to as a lot of silver bb's some of what you're bigger than others with that let me conclude by reiterating that chairman brazo and I look forward to working closely with our colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee a committee on which I'm privileged to serve to ensure that this bill is responsibly paid for I've already begun to meet with several of our colleagues on the relevant Committees of jurisdiction I'm anxious to work with them in all of our colleagues as we face not just the daunting challenges that lie ahead but the opportunities as well mr. mr. president Winston Churchill once said good eyes count on America do the right thing in the end after trying everything else if we pull together and work together as well in the House and Senate as I believe we tend to do in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee then we can reach that in a good deal sooner than mr. Churchill and a lot of skeptics might otherwise expect so why don't we show those skeptics what we can do a great many Americans are counting on us to do just that and we can't let them down I want to again thank my staff and the staff of our Chairman chairman brasov out of senators caputo and and Ben Cardin and others on our committee for their excellent work and for negotiating in good faith throughout this year their spirit and dogged commitment are a big part of what brought us to where we are today but we all know that the the introduction of solid bipartisan bill even when it's followed the next day by a successful markup we hope in committee we must acknowledge there's just the beginning but it's a good start a very good start one that we and our colleagues and I hope we'll build on enabling us in America to seize the day I don't know a lot of Latin but I think the Latin for seize the day mr. president is carpe diem Oh as we say in Delaware Carper dear thank you I yield the floor

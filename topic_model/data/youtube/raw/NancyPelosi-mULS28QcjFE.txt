hi everyone I'm Congressman Joe Kennedy from Massachusetts five years ago I got the call that everyone dreads my wife Lauren had collapsed at work she's being rushed to the emergency room the Boston home the moment painfully familiar too many time spots you fight to push your breath down your tree your brain gets stuck on a highlight reel of worst case scenario you are dazed you're sick and you are terrified we were among the lucky Lauren was okay testing revealed no life-threatening disease or impending danger no worst nightmare confirmed most critical our health coverage gave us the support we need to focus on the one thing that mattered most we're cutting for any fence that's what health cares about not buzzwords like CBO scores or growth rates are high risky but the simple ability to keep the people you love safe and healthy and hold a commitment that we make a care for each other because we know that someday we will need that care to Trump care shatters that proudly American commitment it fundamentally restructures our country's health care into two systems one for the powerful the privileged the healthy and the wealth and another lesser system for everyone else it certain subtract the vast majority of working Americans into a series of excruciatingly impossible choices mortgage or medication child care or doctor's visits being by your loved ones hospital bed keeping your job speaker Ryan calls this freedom I call it agony president Trump public great I call it guts that's what this bill does but here's what this bill means it means that the biggest strongest boldest nation in the world doesn't think that it's people can summon the strength to shoulder a neighbor's burden it means that your moment of deepest need your government will tell you that you're better off on your own then with 320 million Americans fighting by your side but this country knows better this country is better we take care of each other we pull for each other we accept the responsibility that comes from citizenship with pride and with gratitude because it doesn't matter how big or tough or rich or brave you are you cannot be invisible our health is our great equalizer that stubborn reminder that even a mighty need mercy but any one of us can fall and every one of us will and in those moment it's not your bank account or your job title your skin color your zip code your religion your sexuality or your gender that matters it's your humanity it's your hurt and your fear is the fact that you are on the ground and you deserve a country that will pick you up not leave you to fight alone that belief underscores the Democratic vision of American healthcare shared promised a common bond that we fortify not just out of sympathy for the suffering because that it's there for us to when we need it's 30 birth because it was our son or daughter our mother or father in that hospital we would beg for the strength in the shoulders of our neighbors we would pray for a system that refused to let us fall and the weeks ahead keep your heads raised keep your voices loud help us tell the story of a better fairer stronger country and if you do we will make it song thank God wasn't

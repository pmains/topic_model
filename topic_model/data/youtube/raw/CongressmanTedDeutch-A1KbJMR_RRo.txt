director mala I'd like to get back to your findings covering June of 2017 there was a bombshell article that reported that the President of the United States was personally under investigation for obstruction of justice and you said in your report on page 90 volume 2 and I quote news of the obstruction investigation prompted the president to calm again and seek to have the special counsel removed close quote and then in your report you wrote about multiple calls from the President to White House Counsel dumb again and regarding the second call you wrote and I quote McGann recalled that the president was more direct saying something like call rod tell rod that Muller has conflicts and can't be special can't be the special counsel again recall the president telling him Muller has to go and call me back when you do it director Muller did McGann understand what the president was ordering him to do I'd direct you to the what we have written in the report in terms of characterizing and his feelings and in the report it says quote McGann understood the president to be saying that the special counsel had to be removed you also said on page 86 that quote McGann consider the President's request to be an inflection point and he wanted to hit the brace and he felt trapped and McGann decided he had to resign McGann took action to prepare to resign isn't that correct I direct you again to the report and in fact that very day he went to the White House and quoting a report you said quote he then drove to the office to pack his belongings and submit his resignation letter close quote that is directly from the report it is and before he resigned however he called the president's chief of staff Reince Priebus and he called the president's senior advisor Steve Bannon do you recall what began told them whatever he was said will be and will appear in the report it is it is and it says on page 87 quote Priebus recall the McGann said that the president him to do crazy expletive in other words crazy stuff the White House Council thought that the President's request was completely out of bounds he said the president asked him to do something crazy it was wrong and he was prepared to resign over it now these are extraordinarily troubling events but you found a White House Counsel magan to be a credible witness isn't that correct correct director Muller the most important question I have for you today is why director Muller why did the President of the United States want you fired I can't answer that question well I'm on page 89 in your report on volume 2 you said and I quote substantial evidence indicates that the president's evident that the president's attempts to remove the special counsel were linked to the special counsels oversight of investigations that involve the president's conduct and most immediately to reports that the president was being investigated for potential obstruction of justice close quote director Muller you found evidence as you lay out in your report that the president wanted to fire you because you were investigating him for obstruction of justice isn't that correct it says in the report yes and I go I stand behind the report dr. Muller that shouldn't happen in America no president should be able to escape investigation by abusing his power but that's what you testified to in your report the President ordered you fired the White House Counsel knew it was wrong the president knew it was wrong in your report it says there's also evidence president we should not have made those calls to him again but the president did it anyway he did it anyway any else who blatantly interfered with a criminal investigation like yours would be arrested and indicted on charges of obstruction of justice director Muller you determined that you were barred from indicted a sitting president we've already talked about that today that is exactly why this committee must hold the president accountable I yield back

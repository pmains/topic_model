ENTIRE INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW AT  WOOD TV DOT COM.  >> EARLIER TODAY. POLITICAL  REPORTER RICK ALBIN TALK WITH  CONGRESSMAN BILL HIGHS IN GOOD  FOR HIS REACTION ON THAT  CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN.  >> CONGRESSMAN, WE'VE ALL SEEN  OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS.  IT'S BEEN GOING ON A U.S.  ABOUT 9 DAYS, BUT WE'VE SEEN  IN THE PAST. 48 HOURS. THIS.  REALLY DETERIORATING SITUATION  AND AFGHANISTAN. AND I KNOW  YOU HAD SOME PRETTY STRONG  REACTIONS GIVE ME YOUR TAKE ON  WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND AND  WHAT THE U.S. ROLE IS AS WE  SPEAK RIGHT NOW.  >> WELL, IT SHOULD NOT HAVE  BEEN LIKE THIS AND IT COULD  HAVE BEEN AVOIDED THAT'S THE  FRUSTRATING PART OF AND YOU  ALL OF RUN ABOUT WORK THAT  MYSELF AND OTHERS IN WEST  MICHIGAN. BEEN DOING TRYING TO  GET INTERPRETERS BACK IN AND  OUT OF AFGHANISTAN, FOR  EXAMPLE, AND THIS  ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN  DRAGGING ITS FEET CLEARLY IT  DID NOT PLAN. AND I THINK  THERE'S RESPONSIBILITY WITH  GENERAL MILLEY. I THINK  THERE'S RESPONSIBILITY WITH  SECRETARY FRANKLY, I THINK  THEY OUGHT TO THIS IS THAT  MUCH OF A COMPLETE AND HERE WE  ARE GOING TO HAVE THE THE  TALIBAN FLAG FLYING OVER  WHAT'S NOW THE FORMER U.S.  EMBASSY ON THE 20TH  ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER IT'S  JUST KIND OF STUNNING TO ME.  >> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IT.  ASSESSING HAVING PEOPLE  RESIGNED. YOU THINK. THIS WAS  A MISCALCULATION.  >> OR WAS THIS.  >> SOMETHING YOU SAY IT COULD  HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. HOW COULD  IT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED.  >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, DOESN'T  TAKE A GENIUS TO KNOW THAT WE  NEED TO CREATE A SECURITY  BUBBLE AS WE WERE SEEING THE  RAPID DETERIORATION IN THE  OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.  HOW DID THEY NOT EXPECT THAT  THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE  HAPPENING IN KABUL AS WELL.  HERE'S HERE'S WHY I BELIEVE  THAT THESE FOLKS I RESIGN  EITHER THEY WERE SO WILDLY OFF  THEIR INCOMPETENT OR THEY WERE  NOT FORCEFUL ENOUGH TO  UNDERSTAND IT AND ACTUALLY  PUSH FOR THEIR POSITION. AT  SOME POINT THE RESPONSIBILITY  STOPS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND  THOSE THAT ADVISE HIM. AND I  DON'T THINK JOE BIDEN IS GOING  TO BE RESIGNING OVER THIS.  CLEARLY BASED ON WHAT HIS HIS  SPEECH WAS. HE'S DOUBLING DOWN  AND FACT AND HE WAS BLAMING  EVERYBODY FROM THE THAT THE  MILITARY IN GOVERNMENTAL  STRUCTURE THAT THE GEOGRAPHY  THE HISTORY AND EVERY  PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM,  INCLUDING, BY THE WAY, THE ONE  HE SERVED WITH FOR 8 YEARS AS  VICE BLAME THEM FOR WHAT WAS  HAPPENING NOW FOR HIS  INEPTITUDE WHEN IT CAME TO  ACTUALLY DOING IT PULL OUT IN  A MEASURED WAY. THAT'S THAT'S  THE PART HERE. WRECK THAT  EVERYBODY IS MISSING. WE WENT  INTO AFGHANISTAN FOR VERY  DIFFERENT REASONS. THAN WE  WERE IN IRAQ. WE SHOULD BE  LEAVING AFGHANISTAN IN A MUCH  DIFFERENT WAY. AND WE'RE NOT  DOING THAT. FACT, WE'RE  PROBABLY DOING IT WORSE.  >> WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO?  WHAT CAN THE MILITARY DO. WHAT  CAN CONGRESS DO NOW THAT THE  CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. WHAT THEY  ARE ON THE GROUND. WHAT SHOULD  WE BE DOING?  >> YEAH, I WISH I WOULD HAVE  HEARD MORE CLARITY ON OF THE  PRESIDENT SAYING THAT IF THE  TALIBAN HARM ANY AMERICANS.  ANY OF OUR ALLIES AND FRIENDS  IN THE THAT WE WOULD RETALIATE  NOW HERE'S HERE'S THE ODDITY  OF THIS WHOLE THING. WE HAVE  CONTROL OF THE AIRPORT, AT  LEAST ON THE MILITARY SIDE.  BUT THE TALIBAN IS SURROUNDING  THAT AND THEY'RE REGULATING  WHO'S GOING IN AND OUT. SO  EVEN THOSE INTERPRETERS AND  THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE HELPFUL  TO US. WE CAN'T NECESSARILY  EVEN GET THEM IN TO GET THEM  OF THE COUNTRY. WE'RE WE'RE  GONNA FIND OURSELVES IN HERE.  I'M AFRAID SENDING MORE TROOPS  SENT BACK IN JUST TO CREATE  THAT THAT SECURITY BUBBLE AND  THAT THAT ABILITY TO GET OUT  OF THE COUNTRY THAN WHAT WE  HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND IF  WE HAD MORE RESPONSIBLY LEFT  THEM THERE AND HAD A MORE  MEASURED WITHDRAWL. WE WOULD  FIND OURSELVES IN THIS  SITUATION. JUST THINK BACK TO  HOW WE HOW WE LEFT BAGRAM AIR  FORCE BASE. I MEAN THAT THAT  WAS JUST A TRAVESTY AND SOUTH  AND THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A  HARBINGER FOR WINE AND A  LESSON WHAT WE'RE SEEING  TODAY.  >> CONGRESSMAN, AS ALWAYS, W

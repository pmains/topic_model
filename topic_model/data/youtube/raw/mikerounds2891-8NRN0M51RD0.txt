frank kadeshi and myself so i will hand uh i will hand it off to you sir okay thank you very much johnny and let me just begin by saying good morning to all of you and i'm i'm very pleased to welcome you to this and i want to emphasize this this listening session um and our goal here is a reform effort for the native american direct loan program uh i appreciate your taking the time to visit with us today and for rest assured i think this is critical that we start with you in terms of trying to form the appropriate type of of legislative responses to get this thing rolling i know i've got some of my team on the line today as well and i just want to take just a moment to introduce kyle chase who's with me here in dc frank tadeji was in dc but in another office and johnny cochran is kind of running the operation here right now um frank and johnny are here in dc and uh they along with our coalition partners are going to be helping to facilitate the the session i do appreciate having a number of our native american veterans their family members and their advocates who are joining us at this time so i appreciate you coming in and thanks for what you do and thank you for your service to our country it truly is an honor to be able to participate with you as i'm sure you're all aware i think the bears repeating american indian and native american or alaska native people serving the u.s armed services at a higher rate than any other group this is a tradition of courage and sacrifice that goes way back and when our veterans return home especially to trust land we need to be sure that they have meaningful access to the va benefits that they've earned the purpose of today's listening session is to discuss how we can make one of those key benefits of native american veterans more accessible and that's the va department native american direct loan program or the nadl for short before we begin i just want to share a quick update about what we've been doing to try to streamline another home loan program for native americans and that's the hud section 184 loan guarantee program i'm pleased that a piece of that legislation that i sponsored called the native american housing affordability act of 2019 was incorporated into the omnibus appropriation bill that congress passed last december this bill makes it easier for lenders to close mortgages to native american borrowers without having to wait for certain documents from the bia it's a small but a very important step and i'm committed to continuing those efforts to improve home ownership opportunities on the residents in south dakota and across indian country let me get back to these va benefits and talk about the native american direct loan program one of these va benefits that we want to specifically focus on the nadl it was established way back in 1992 as a way that congress wanted to help native american veterans finance the purchase of homes on reservations it's a direct loan program which means the federal government itself is the lender and the idea is to make members eligible to participate in the nda of the nadl program a tribal government has to enter into an agreement with the va today the va has over a hundred of these agreements with american indian alaska native and pacific islander communities now for all the potential these agreements represent we know that the number of native american veterans who actually benefit from the program is unacceptably low in fact over the last five years the va has approved on average just 20 of these loans per year that's across the entire country 20 loans a year and that's not just for veterans living on trust land in south dakota that's 20 loans for the entire united states including alaska and hawaii loan approval rates are also unacceptably once once the loans come through they're also unacceptably low for example over the past two years in 2018 and 2019 and this is the where the most recent information is available to us native american veterans from south dakota submitted they submitted 24 nadl loan applications of those 24 only four were approved that's just not acceptable and i mean we've got to find a better way to do that with numbers like these we could tell you know we we know something's not right and that's something but it's got to change in order for this program to to really be to be effective making meaningful comprehensive change that will have a real impact is what this is all about when it works the nadl program gives a veteran one of the most valuable opportunities we have which is to become a homeowner every single time that this program does not work means that a veteran loses out that's probably the most important impact of all and we just we flat out intend to get that changed so let me share with you some of what the office this office has already done in collaboration with the coalition to pursue the nadl reform we've met with senior leaders from the va's loan guarantee service the office responsible for running the nadl program to share our concerns and to seek opportunities for immediate improvement now my team has also traveled to st paul minnesota to meet with va leaders there because that's where the nadl loans for veterans living on reservations in south dakota are actually managed from we invited staff from the senate veterans affairs committee to join us there and they did to take a closer look at the issues for themselves we've since built enthusiastic support from the senate veterans affairs committee leadership to achieve nadl reform currently at the request of the chairman and the ranking member of that committee the government accountability office will begin a thorough review of the nadl program this review will be crucial to identifying what steps need to be taken to achieve comprehensive nadl reform it will provide us with the biggest picture view possible showing us not just where the va needs to improve but where other federal agencies that play a part in the process need to continue their work and it should identify opportunities to incorporate community development financial institutions and other partner organizations into the system to assist veterans in obtaining this very important benefit i just say that's only one of the first steps that we've got to take it's not the end result my staff continues to have regular calls with members of the coalition and together we've developed an nadl reform action plan events like today's listening session are critical parts of this plan helping us to sustain our momentum as we move forward together to achieve our goal and that is to make the nadl program work for native american veterans in south dakota and beyond now my staff told me and i told them i didn't want to do all the talking here and that we absolutely wanted this to be a listening session as many of you know i i firmly believe that consultation is critical when we do this and i want to just clarify for everybody out there when we talk about having an action plan the action plan is one that says let's do the following items let's make sure we have consultation in going and responses back to any ideas that come up we want you to participate and to be active players the action plan does not tell us what the actual legislation is to fix these programs or these policies that's the reason why we want to hear from you today about what are the problems what really are these obstacles that are stopping it so that we can start to develop together what changes in the law would have to be and changes in public policy would have to be so that this actually works so you're in on the ground floor and the action steps are about the process we do to get legislation put together not to actually have the legislation already written if it was easy it would have been done a long time ago and we wouldn't have the challenges we've got today so i thank you for being a part of this and now really it's your turn and and at this time i want to introduce miss johanna donahoe the facilitator of the south dakota native uh homeownership coalition to introduce our special guests joanna senator rounds thank you thank you so much for being here today we know that it's very busy in washington these days so we really appreciate the time that you're taking it's just wacky out here is what it is but yeah no but look this is really important we and we want to see something happen here so i'm going to go to a mute right now and listen in now perfect okay i know your staff has told us that you really want to hear from folks so we want to jump right into our panel discussion but i also want to let you know who is on the line and and here to listen and contribute especially during the q a

three six if you could just say hello that would be great hey daryl good morning um from native american development corp thanks daryl for joining us another veteran and nadl borrower okay so um i think i've got all of the um the coalition folks um let's just jump right into this panel and we're going to start with tony as you know um you know in our meetings over the past couple years the lakota funds is a fiscal agent for the south dakota native homeownership coalition and so um we'll get started with tani and connie if you could just start a start us off by um talking about why the coalition created the veterans homeownership committee and then we'll jump right into the discussions with our veterans yep so thank you joanna but thank you senator rounds again for making time for us and for your continued support in these efforts to support our native veterans as you mentioned earlier native americans serve at a higher rate than any other population and we value their service you know here on our reservations probably more than anywhere we were really frustrated i'm frustrated isn't even the work to be honest that the veterans are having such a hard time accessing nadl the fact that you mentioned you know in five years approved 20 loans we approved in 2018 in the state of south dakota across our nine reservations only two nadl loans to native veterans today alone we have uh 10 loans in the pipeline according to our coalition members but we know that that's not enough that's just you know there's a lot of problems but we also like the coalition does we're good at identifying the problems but we're not going to dwell on them we are movers and shakers we are going to make efforts to do something about that and have proposed solutions which you've seen in our recommendations one of the things the coalition has done in 2019 we conducted a housing needs assessment for our native veterans we conducted these assessments on three reservations across the state of south dakota pine ridge cheyenne river and sicilian what we found is honestly looks shocking in writing but it's nothing that surprised any of us that are working in the trenches we found that 75 percent of the veterans who said they were interested in purchasing homes said they had little or no understanding of the nadl program 62 of veterans we talked to didn't know that nadl existed so that alone points out one of the the main concerns we have is that just that need for outreach is that a lot of our veterans um aren't as connected to the the the media sources that the general public is and that they need to be made aware that this program even exists okay connie so thank you for that background um what what happened next when you started working with the veterans so once we identified um you know we all got fired up obviously about these numbers and the sad statistics and stuff and how our native veterans weren't didn't even know about this program weren't able to utilize it we got together with the tribal veterans service officers the home ownership practitioners and obviously the other members of our coalition the communities the tribes our native cdfis who are the boots on the ground and we figured out first of all clearly identified what we found the problems to be and then um we've made like i said earlier the recommendations on how to reform nadl i thank you again for your excellent staff we've had many conversations uh with kyle and frank and and your fellow george who i miss dearly and by working with the va department but one of the things that we realized and i would say probably the main issue honestly is that our veterans many of our veterans don't have access to internet many of our veterans have limited cell service to be honest on the pine ridge reservation a lot of our veterans don't have a computer um and so they they have a hard time not only knowing that the nadl program is there um to provide them access to a loan to build their home or buy a home on trust land but they have a hard time just in communicating with the office that is only located in st paul you know what i mean that's i didn't do the google maps but it's got to be 600 miles away easily so it's not possible for us to drive to that office to ask our questions to deliver our paperwork and so what we found is that it works better and that's kind of the model that native cdfis know work is this model of hands-on help we are the boots on the ground we're the ones who have the pulse of the community lakota funds is the one with the office and kyle where it is possible for people for veterans like george and garfield to drive to the office and hand us their paperwork so that we can we can help um pass that on then to whatever appropriate nadl person is in the office and help facilitate that conversation and so we pulled in really the native city of fives but also the housing authorities uh like sharon vogel on the phone at cheyenne river our tribal veterans service officers who really are the ones who have the best relationship with our our native veterans in gerry upsell so um we've identified at least that one solution along with many others that we feel like will greatly improve the nadl program awesome thank you tony let's talk to george so um there we have two very important georges in a in this in this work george canozzaro who was a va fellow in your office senator rounds and and um you know we very much enjoyed um meeting with him virtually and in person um so he he really helped to move this work forward so thank you very much for um assigning him to this this project um but georgia roark who's in the room with tony natal um he is a he is a native american direct loan borrower as i said he's an earlier he's an army veteran so george can you talk to us a little bit about um what it was like when you first started working with the va office to pursue your nadl loan what was it like yes i started i started with the south dakota housing development and i talked to the lady in the spearfish and she told me what i had to do and so i went and i'd done it and then once i got finished with all my paperwork that they told me i needed to do i went and uh went to the va and then that's when i ran into problems i uh i couldn't get a hold of uh uh mr anderson every time i call i had a hard time get a hold of him and so i i forgot about it and then uh i went and i asked tommy if they could help me and she helped me and then after that things got a lot better so so george when you were working with the va how long did it take you uh when i worked with the va it took me at least uh two years two years to uh get into the uh program and then once i was in well then uh i was at a standstill sometimes it takes that long george if there's problems with your lease or if you have to work to improve your credit did you have any of those kind of problems uh yes i did i uh i [Music] had a lot of problems with that with them and i uh i couldn't figure out what to do of uh how to get help and then i asked tani again and then she was able to help me get my house but tony when he came when george came to you did he have his paperwork in order did he have all his lease i i was so impressed honestly because we know the challenges here on pine ridge you know it's a slow process because a lot of times it takes a long time to get a residential lease the second meeting wasn't it george where you came in honestly he brought his paperwork he didn't have credit issues he had a good solid credit score honestly he had all of his verification of income he had his residential lease already in place he brought me a pile of paperwork like this that was all neat and in order all i had to do was go through it make sure he had all the pieces scan it and send it to the nadl office okay so he didn't he there was no reason for those delays what was it when you were talking um with the va staff george was it frustrating uh yes it was uh when i talked to uh i guess his name was mr anderson i couldn't uh get a hold of him a lot of times whenever i had to uh when he said for me to call him i'd call him and then i couldn't get a hold of him and then we got another lady in there jessica and she came down to pine ridge at your closing yeah at my closing and that was pretty cool but uh okay other than that you know well but just at a loss you know did they keep asking you for the same documents over and over uh yes they did they did and uh i kept sending them but uh that didn't matter but you didn't give up right no i didn't no i didn't and and so what turned the corner for you when what kind of expedited the process what made it how did you how did you get things to move forward well whenever i got to uh when i got to uh lakota fun that's when things changed and it started moving along and uh i was i was really happy about that because of all this waiting and waiting that i had to go through to get started i i just want to add joanna part of the reason that george's was taking longer is that initial conversation he had with south dakota housing development authority was because he knew he won the governor's house and so he had already gotten that process started we knew then because george wanted a basement and needed water and sewer like most of our owners need and so i knew that it was going to require construction and i also knew the nadl's requirements when they're when it's a construction loan is just overwhelming even for me and so what i did then when i realized that george was going to need a construction loan to start with um is i immediately referred him to mazascott mazuska's the native cdfi serving pine ridge providing home loans and stuff we figured out how to do the construction loan and knew that we were going to refinance it into a a home loan for the purchase of his governor's house and got that process figured out and the loan approved in three weeks so that's the difference when you're working with native partners who know each other and the resources available in their own communities okay great well um thank you george congratulations on on getting through to the end of the process and and how do you feel now having your own place well i feel uh really uh really good about it and uh i want to thank lakota fun and mother scott for being here for me and uh i believe that uh they will help our people succeed fantastic and if there's the one thing that you want senator rounds to hear what is it uh i believe that mazaska and lakota fun are the way once once uh what do they say get you get approval from the va to get approval from the va to help the veterans here on pine ridge okay so you really appreciated the local partners because i did okay great thank you and congratulations let's um let's talk a little bit with um with stephanie provost who's a loan officer at mozaska she worked with george stephanie tell us a little bit about what your organization does and what how do you help veterans like george to close nadl loans good morning everyone um so what we do is we can basically package for any idea we collect all the documents we um help point them into the right direction of who to contact for documents needed we provide home buyer education to the borrower so that they'll have a little education in what the process is and what's needed and why we help connect them with local contractors if that's what they want um manufactured dealers depending on what they want um we help them with their land if that's the case that they still need land and then we also if they come to us with credit issues we coach them and help them with that as well great and i know that um another one of your borrowers mr garfield iron crow was supposed to be here today unfortunately he was ill but good for a good reason because he got his covet vaccine and so he just was staying home to recover from that um but mr iron crow was another borrower um he didn't end up using the nadl loan program right no he did not he actually used our rule development 502 single-family pilot project loan um and why we went with that is we did try nabl and he did come up as owing um and then so he got up actually a lower interest rate with rural development because he qualified for that so we also try every avenue we can to get them the best loan product that we can and how does the 502 relending program work i know senator rounds you and senator thune were really supportive of that pilot in south dakota um do you think that program stuff would also work with va that's a usda program where usda loans to you yes so we have the loan um it's a 80 20 match um and then um we package based off of rural development guidelines and um we take the loan on for the 30 30 30 to 33 years okay and do you think that same model could work where um va would lend to you and then you really relend to eligible borrowers yes because um as we package for rural development mazasca's own policies is not too different as far as you know debt to income ratio um pre-qualifying them the um credit history we just know how to communicate with our borrowers a little bit better as to off reservation people so i think that would actually work very well with us so if you had the capital in your loan pool you could get it out faster than va okay great um so that's another one of the of the salute possible solution senators is that re-lending program where va their direct loan could um they could lend to the the native cdfi lender who then can relend in the community um okay so let's step um is there one is there anything that you want to make sure the senator hears from the work that you're doing what's the one thing you want to leave with him um the main thing that i want to leave is um the the relationship that we established with our veteran borrowers is a long lasting one um that homeownership is very possible on the reservation there are hurdles but as us as on the forefront where the ones that help them over those hurdles and um the just the communication with our borrowers is actually very excellent and yeah okay fantastic thanks jeff so let's now um move to jerry upsall who is in the room with the folks at the sistine wahpeton housing authority good morning jerry everybody good morning senator and i'll ask the question and then unmute so that you guys can talk there um jerry i wanted to um i wanted to have you well first of all um thank you guys for being in the room and for having the veterans there with you um i know that you have talked about jerry how challenging it was for you you yourself are an adl borrower but you also help a lot of other veterans um through your work um so and you've you've talked a lot about about how hard it is to get into the va loan program but then also how hard it is once you have the loan to work with a loan servicer so can you tell us first a little bit about some of the challenges that that you experienced and and others in the room may want can share some of the challenges that they experienced hey i started my loan process in 2015 i had the credit score i had all of my electrical water sewer on site already um it took me three full years 2015 16 and 17 i got to have the completion december 2017. during that process i had to pay my homeowner insurance which was eleven hundred dollars a year and i didn't have a bill because the paperwork took so long so i paid a full year of homeowner insurance and 1100 before there was any ground broken and then i had to renew it and pay it again six months later i got to break ground so to me that was just a lot of money that i didn't have that i had to come up with um i went through four loan servicing officers at natal from start to finish um the telephone system changed during my process i could call one eight hundred at the model and get through at the beginning at the end of my process it was the one eight hundred number and each loan servicing agent had seven digit extensions now you try to memorize those extensions when you're calling them multiple times and that was so frustrating so having retention of loan officers the telephone system the money that you have to keep coming up with because they keep adding on on my end getting the tsr the fitbo the water sewer that was easy process for me working with the tribal program being a tribal program myself by the time i was done with my loan my loan packet is four inches thick um you're not done when you're done with that because then you get the servicing agencies i've been through two servicing agencies dye tech and dsi well unfortunately they have foreign servicing agencies when you call them um they it's up to you they don't give you this this uh a checklist when you're done closing your loan you find all this up to trial and error you know they start increasing loan payment they say that is up to you to get financial insurance one day thursday without you get your binder there so there's a lot of things with the servicing agencies and i really think that um we should be allowed what i would really like is us to be able to have our own servicing agencies ess first nation lending cdfis or growth south dakota we've also had other veterans through our office helping them with the loan and to tell you the truth i almost gave up multiple times on my loan if it wasn't for my husband at the time encouraging me and he said you have to get through this because if you're going to help other veterans you're going to have to know the process so it was very it's like they kept the carrot and dangling it back in it was really frustrating as a veteran where i felt like i earned it to have this capability to be able to build on trust land but by the time i was going through it i felt like i was begging i really did i felt like i was begging to get this loan no matter how many hoops i jumped through but being happy at the end is how i should have felt but i was just relieved honestly that it was finally done thank you jerry for sharing your story i know um not only did it was it no i can you hear me no jerry can you hear me yeah you're okay i can hear you i can hear you okay i think their connection is kind of coming in and out yeah um we'll be before we leave the folks at this attend um senator i also wanted you to hear from jesse who is another borrower for native american direct loan um and he's a more recent borrower so jesse can you hear me what happened here hey guys we can hear you yeah can you guys hear us yeah we can hear you can you hear us [Music] all right jesse can you hear us i'm going to unmute you um eric so that jesse can talk all right we may have to come back to jesse senator but um let's go ahead and um let's see i'm going to try one more time and just ask him eric please unmute all right it looks like they they're going to call back in so um when they get back um well i do definitely want you to talk to jesse um do you senator did you have any questions for george or um and when that when the others folks come back we can um i know we have several others on the line who want to ask questions so if you want we can just move into the q a or do you want to just have some reflections first we can we are most certainly able to move into the q a i can tell you so far what i'm hearing is um there's a big difference if you need to do some construction and and we have such a limited amount of housing on the rez's right now i think we should focus on what it takes to actually put together including construction loans as part of the discussion and then look at the finalizing it afterwards but i think there we have to talk about how we coordinate that and and be able to you know if if we could do in this year if we could set ourselves up i'd love to know whether or not there were perhaps 10 veterans in south dakota that we could identify right now that are either in the program or trying to get a loan that we would use as almost like a pilot project as to how we get them through before the end of the year and then in each particular case determine whether it includes uh new construction money or if there's not a need for new construction money and how we would establish or work our way through on each one of them and if we could do even a couple of the res where we actually got that done we could then maybe duplicate that or expand that into other other locations where you've got hands-on uh experience and you know that could actually be there on site to help folks get those loans so um but so far anyway that's what i'm coming up with and i i um i'd like to hear the rest of it and and the q a as well but uh most certainly that appears to be part of the challenge here is on construction loans and so forth and then the packaging of it when it's all said and done and most certainly the servicing is something that we all complain about um and it clearly it appears that the va does not have a good system in place for that so i'll turn it back over to you for a q a okay fantastic thank you so much um and it looks like the folks are back from sisseton well can you guys hear us now yeah okay super they can hear now um um and what i what i'd like to do um jerry is is um allow jesse to share a little bit of his his experience and before before i turn it over to you just to reflect um really quickly on on your comment um senator rounds about the construction one of the things that we actually call the georgia roark model that lakota funds in mozascal worked out is because george as he talked about needed a construction loan because he used the governor's house model which works really well with veterans um he was able to get a construction loan from mazdaska and then close a permanent nadl loan which is you know their benefit and has the really good terms um their the va was they they were willing to do that but one of the challenges is is technically you're not supposed to refinance a a non-va loan with a va loan with a native american direct loan program and that's one of the things that george canizarro had started to work on um because that's a pretty simple legislative fix so that would help with the construction process where the the veteran can do a construction loan locally and get that get the home built and then be able to refinance using nadl so that's one idea so let me just go ahead and see if we can go back to um the folks at sisseton i'm gonna mute myself and unmute you guys so um eric if you can unmute your line i'll mute myself so there's no echo yeah you hear me yes good afternoon and uh thanks for having me and uh um in regards to my loan that i i dealt with with nadl mine took probably a little over two years from start to finish but there was a lot a lot of paperwork in between there was a lot of it communicating back and forth with va and that timely response that i felt wasn't wasn't too good and also just the uh the costs that towards the end of the loan that i was never told about the appraisal time and cost inspections the deposit stuff like that regards to that that was at the end before it closed it seemed like oh you got to pay this got to pay this and that's something i wish i would have known up front and just i i guess the process it felt like they were more in ways because i dealt with two or three different ones at the uh va in minneapolis i just i just felt like they they were more trying to find a way not to give a loan than to give a loan and then to hear that there was only four approved in a couple years i mean that is unacceptable and uh if it wasn't for housing helping me with this um with this nadl process i'll probably still be going through it because a lot of that language i don't understand but it just seemed like it could have been more thorough and could have been broken down a little bit better and like i said for to take as long as it did you know like jerry said you know to be more relieved at the end than happy for the for for getting at home you know just says that too and just i don't know i felt like veterans shouldn't feel that they have to beg for something they're entitled to and i think the process could be a lot better and that's just my experience in regards to my house but yes i'm very thankful for housing and the va for finally getting my home but but i feel could be a lot better streamlined so jesse did you feel like you had to go into battle again jesse did you feel like you had to go into the battle yet yes do you have to feel like you were going into battle again oh yes yeah it seems actually it seemed more of a headache dealing with that than being overseas for two tours i guess in my opinion but that speaks volume yeah right sorry i'll just have to deal with the echo for a second anyone else said assistant wants to share something anyone else like to share some thoughts uh today's fighter uh contacts was i kind of helped the process with jesse he kind of hates us to serve as like a general contractor so it's kind of the services that we provide housing authority with the veterans i think and moving forward i tell you understand what they went through let alone the home buying process beginning your contractors and everything all together in itself finding that paperwork and their contractors as a headache i mean i understand going through jesse running a lot of questions by him uh what contractors what type of materials or things he's looking at for his home i mean that was a headache in itself i remember a lot of times he was just like what was the deal with it tomorrow because it was a lot of information i was giving giving to him and and then just adding to the va any nails working with the various loan officers various questions like jesse said upfront the the costs the extra items like the paperwork had to be filled out seemed like after the fact once being pre-approved just kind of added a bigger headache to his place so i'm glad that i was there to help them walk you through the process in any other veteran we've had a couple other veterans that went through their process as well and we have a couple others that are in contact with us now to do the same process but i think it would just be a better more communication up front and i think i'm walking through written allocation not just being any of any homeowner the process of the paperwork a lot of the terms that are in the language a lot of the documents that they're signing and i think just being upfront to the whole process what's needed so that making sure that the veteran understands everything that they're looking at and what they need to sign and what's coming ahead no surprises just before closing or right at closing they're aware of everything upfront when they begin the process when they're pre-approved not just home buyer education education but also also providing technical assistance with the construction process let me ask a quick another quick question i'm gonna meet you guys with another quick question okay i'm gonna i muted you so to to make it easier to hear me um and this is this is for david and eric um with hud i know you guys have used the hud section 184 loan program as a as the housing authority to borrow capital to build homes in your community and then you either use them for rental or for home ownership would it work for you guys to be eligible borrowers under the va program where you could borrow from the va native american direct loan program as a housing authority and then build a home and resell it to an eligible veteran would that make it easier for the veterans thank you joanna for bringing that up yes it would you know and actually we're actually working with our with our attorney right now on developing a loan distribution policy so we're not co-mingling any funds senator rounds i want to actually thank you personally for with your compressive voice out in dc and advocating for our people [Music] but yes that would just uh joanna that would definitely make that a direct more direct accessible service to our to our veterans you know when listening to the opening comments there and we're talking about four veteran loans being done well that's kind of ridiculous because our agency alone last year we did 20 for our mortgage for our tribal members and our mortgages and our utilizing the 184 program which is we're using that more of that as an advantage and an opportunity as an economic development tool here in sicily so it's about systematic change now thank you great thanks thanks so much eric um and that's a great example of of some system systemic change and that's why we're we actually senator um a lot of the folks we talked with our veterans committee about the idea to request a gao study and at first folks were like oh darn that's going to take forever but upon reflection a lot of a lot of folks across the state were really happy that you did that because it's really going to get to the root of some of the the widespread systemic problems and come up with not just quick fixes but things that really make a difference for veterans and um you know i i appreciate that and i just got to share with you it seems to me that we've got a number of tools out there but we almost we almost have to make sure that those tools are available to to organizations at the local level to assist these veterans and uh how we go about doing that may be one of the alternatives but once again this is a case of where we really want the folks who are on the front lines to be able to give us some direction as to perhaps the priority of things that we would like to do so that we we don't just go like a shotgun out in 14 different directions and not get any of them done but rather let's let's identify the ones that we really want to hit that need to be modified improved upon or coordinated with and if we can get those let's actually get some results this year let's find a way to you know like i say we had four of those individual loans out that's just not acceptable at all and if this isn't if this is a program that could help veterans where it would be better for them than some of the other programs let's let's make this our goal this year let's get some stuff in place to where we can actually make substantial improvements and then learn from that to expand it on out and if it needs public policy changes if it needs legislation or if it just needs more oversight or whatever let's lay out and let's have a plan put together here that we can execute and i'm not talking about executing it over the next decade i'm talking about let's get something rolling now yeah absolutely we're we're game we're with you we only have a few minutes left so we want to open it up to question and answer um i do want to call on sharon vogel who's one of the co-chairs for the policy committee from shine river housing authority and then um i believe also um we'll go back to system so cody our other veteran can share share his experience and and then if we have time we'll we'll open it up for other questions so sharon are can you hear yes i can um thank you um joanna um good morning senator and thank you for the goa study um you know when we're looking forward to the to the findings and the recommendations and there's one thing that you know we again need your leadership as this study goes forward is we talk you know we want to make sure that the native veterans the tribal veterans service officers the native cdfis and of course ourselves the tdhes will be interviewed and being included during this process i think that's important to get the true picture of what's going on also thank you for your support for the additional allocations and set aside for tdhe in the fiscal year 2021 appropriations in cares legislation that included expanding the hud vash program and also the million dollars set aside for special needs sharon river housing authority is going to be applying for these funds and that will expand our services to veterans um the other thing that i i want to again thank you is um you know when we had this covet environment it really reminded us the importance of a safe stable home and we need your leadership to continue to include set aside for tdhgs for all future legislations and allocations so that we can continue our work in both rental and home ownership housing development you asked earlier about you know what we could be doing um as you know the usda pilot project for section 501 re-lending has been successful and impactful uh here on shine river we had over 10 families that were able to achieve homeownership within within a year's time you know and they are um they're now living in their homes during this environment and they are um so grateful and we're grateful that it's ten less families that we have to worry about and we appreciate your support to continue this opportunity and one of the recommendations that we have is of course that you know with this type of success when you have partnerships at a local level helping veterans and other native families that we would ask that you help us replicate this pilot um with the nadl loan funds we think that would definitely um move things forward and also be a model that can be replicated in other states and other communities um you know as we um sharon can i ask you a real quick question on that again which own program which loan program was that that you were utilizing you said the code on it i i tried to write it down and i missed it okay it was the usda 501 500 shares program 502 i'm sorry 502. okay that that makes okay now i got it thanks that was my i apologize um you know the other i would would really like to thank you and your staff for acknowledging the work of the coalition um it is successful um approach of collaboration and collective wisdom to address our shared vision of increasing the number of native families who can shelter in the safety of their own home it to me being in indian housing for a number of years i don't think that we would have had the success that shine river without the coalition and the um the work and the um the education process that you go through of learning of new opportunities and resources and being able to do the policy work that has all you know helped us as tdhgs be able to leverage our dollars and um so and through this process along with the coalition and the work of our unaha regional housing and the national american indian housing council there's great advocacy out there and there's great training and capacity development that pdhes are evolving into competent housing developers you heard that from sissypin uh you've um you know pine ridge has had a successful pro program rosebud just got a tax credit project exclusively for um their bash vouchers so that they'll have a housing neighborhood just for veterans so each of us have our own successes as to what we're doing and we need to continue this critical housing development work and we need your support to keep tribes and tdhgs at the table so that we can have a strong voice as to what works for us and you asked about you know um the cost um i quickly did some numbers if we were to do 10 homes um and these would be modest homes uh for veterans and that is using the native city of five four bounds community fund as the lender and um loan processor and crha as the tdhe would be the developer for this and then you would have your 10 eligible veterans that would that approach would work and we would need part loan and part grant because a lot of our veterans need a subsidy to be able to afford their home they need subsidy through down payment assistance they need subsidy through um costs of infrastructure so a project like that would be 1.8 to 2 million to just you know get that going and being able to um again use part of it as grand and then uh the majority of it as loan for um mortgage on mortgage loans to veterans in closing a senator i would really ask for your support to reauthorize the hosta so that we as tdhes can continue to provide housing opportunities to not only veterans but all of our native families i just appreciate the opportunity um to be able to share you know these recommendations with you and just i'm just really grateful for your leadership so stay safe and just you know we stand ready to do our part and um you know we just need that strong partnership and leadership that we both have to offer thank you senator thank you sharon very much and and because we're running short on time senator i'll send it back i'll return turn the mic back over to you and with with many thanks first of all thanks to everyone who has offered comments ideas and suggestions we clearly want to be able to have a good strong working group together we want to continue to communicate with one another you you have the opportunity here to actually help form public policy that will make this work long term um i i'm very interested in what you have for your ideas uh we picked up some really good ideas today i think we should follow up with this this can't be the last time that we visit it needs to be a stepping stone approach but um we're not going to just sit on this uh i do look forward to getting the report back in in terms of what they're finding within the va program that's not working right but also i think we have to be prepared to offer solutions as well and a lot of what you're suggesting here today i think can lead to the appropriate solutions but well certainly it's going to have to be in consultation with you because you're the ones that are going to have to make it work you know on on the home front and let's stay in touch i thank you all for being a part of this today and like i say stay in touch with us we're not going to stop here and we most certainly want to be able to show results each time we get together and visit so thanks for the opportunity and thanks for participating thank you senator and we hope we hope that there may be a congressional hearing that happens after the gao reports we hope that we would be able to to share some of those ideas on the record that would be fantastic right yes i i think having this type of of an approach is really good but let's remember once we pointed out let's be in a position to have uh proposals that will actually fix it then so let's get those rolling absolutely thank you so much and johnny it will uh turn it back to you yes sir i appreciate it uh we're gonna uh i want to hang on talk to these uh great folks for a few minutes and uh come up with our uh our way forward sir okay thank you and i'll sign off right now but once again thanks to everybody and to our veterans out there thank you once again for your service bye-bye bless you

Dennis mr. speaker Mr Speaker I rise today in support of the energy and water appropriations bills on the floor which I think appropriately Plex the need to spend taxpayer dollars responsibly in light of our current budgetary problems the old funding in this bill represents a decrease of 2.9 billion dollars below the fiscal year 2013 enacted level and seven hundred million dollars below the post sequester level while funding is reduced this bill still provides critical resources for important projects and programs that ensure our nation continues to have access to affordable Bible and clean water and energy the bill also provides much-needed funding for our country's flood control projects that are constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers in my own district California 42nd district the home of the Santa Ana River main stem project which is one of the largest core projects west of the Mississippi River I'm pleased at the core and the energy and water subcommittee continue to recognize the project's importance to providing adequate blood protection to Southern California region additionally in Southern California we recently lost twenty two hundred megawatts in power generation with a permanent shutdown of the San Onofre nuclear power plant a significant generation shutdown of this nature creates tremendous uncertainty for ratepayers through our region of course energy production challenges are by no means exclusive to Southern California it's exactly why the energy programs fund in this bill are necessary and I particularly pleased that our subcommittee has funded energy programs by taking on all the above approach that includes renewable nuclear and fossil fuel Americans rightfully expect affordable access to clean affordable and reliable energy and water as a member of the energy and water subcommittee I believe we've done our best to meet those expectations with this bill and I courage all my colleagues support the bill and closings wanted to thank subcommittee chairman Friedman housing as well as chairman Rogers for their leadership and crafting a good and responsible bill with that I yield back bouncer Ellen from California yields back you

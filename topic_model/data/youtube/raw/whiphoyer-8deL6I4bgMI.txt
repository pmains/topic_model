it's the gentleman from Maryland is now recognized for five minutes I thank the gentleman for yielding this is the most irresponsible bill that I will have been confronted with in the 37 years that I have been in the Congress of the United States this bill mr. speaker is both reckless and feckless it is reckless because it would add more than one point seven trillion dollars the chairman says over two trillion dollars to the debt over a decade in a shameful act of hypocrisy for its supporters who for years have called for fiscal responsibility it is feckless because its authors write it with an eye towards politics not policy there is no courage in voting for this bill it is easy to vote for a tax cut what is hard to do is paying for what we buy and neither side does that particularly well there is no courage in voting for this bill only a suspension of common sense and abandoned commitment to fiscal sustainability furthermore my Republican friends call this bill a tax cut the gentleman who just spoke the whip said it's a reduction in rates but 36 million working Americans will receive a tax increase under this bill so it was a very careful articulation of reduction of rates but Texas for 36 million Americans working Americans will go up furthermore they call this bill a tax cut it's now a stretch of the imagination to presume that given Republicans urgency to reject bipartisan compromise and deflect public input the members of this house will be asked to accept whatever version of the tax bill can pass the United States Senate yesterday the Senate Finance Committee listen to me my colleagues the Senate Finance Committee rejected this bill 36 to 0 the senate finance committee headed by Republicans rejected this bill 36 to nothing I am reminded of what representative Matt Gaetz a Republican said last month about the budget resolution that teed up this tax plan he said that we're we bring and I quote asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have a chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody's read I want to ask you to raise your hand if you've read this bill one those who take this vote will have lived have to live with it and hope just hope that whatever mystery tax package your Senate colleagues send over here won't cut whatever concessions you've extracted I heard the whip say no special provisions in this bill I don't have the time to go through every special provision that has been used to get people to vote for this bill mr. speaker this isn't the tax reform the American people were promised or the tax reform that American people want let's sit down together let's sit down together mr. chairman you and mr. Neal to responsible good Americans sit down together not in a partisan way but in a bipartisan way that's the way we did the 86 bill that was why it was such a responsible piece of legislation let's enact tax reform that focuses on the working class the middle class the people who need the money not give over half of it to the richest people in America I don't have any brief with them we'd all like to be rich but they don't need a tax cut and the middle class does why give 50% of the revenue to them let's enact tax reform that focuses on them let's exact enact tax reform that doesn't give half the benefit to those making more than $900,000 a year let's enact tax reform that improves our long-term fiscal position rather than adding the 1.7 trillion to our debt that the CBO projects that this bill would add as former Treasury secretary Robert Rudin pointed out in an op-ed in today's Washington Post and by the way he was the Secretary of Treasury during the only four years of balanced budgets that we have experienced in the last 50 years I have one additional minute the gentleman's time has expired vote no on this bill look to your souls not your polls gentlemen what your blue ouch reject this sellout of Americana new tires Jim is no longer a gentleman from Texas is now recognized miss

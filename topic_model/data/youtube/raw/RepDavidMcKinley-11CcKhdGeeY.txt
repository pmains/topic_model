gentleman years back the chair now recognizes the amazing gentleman from west virginia my friend mr mckinley for five minutes well thank you mr chairman and please give paulette a hug for me okay that's a one friend to another uh listen mr chairman the boston consulting group has concluded there was just a modest increase in the electronic vehicles uh by about 15 by 2030 our grid will require a 25 increase in generation capacity now that may seem doable but within the same time frame this particular legislation calls for the abandonment of all fossil fuel plants coal natural gas by 2035 unless the utilities can miraculously find a solution to this elusive technology of carbon capture remember fossil fuels make up 60 of our existing power supply so mr hoffman uh do you my question do you think it's realistic to undertake a massive build out of our grid without including fossil fuels i i don't see a space in which you don't explore avenues to make existing existing fossil fuel supplies renewable and clean them up where you can talk about that in a minute we're going there in a minute so don't get it don't get ahead of me on this thing i'm going to feed you another question uh so but let's go into this transition into perspective according to our energy consultants if just a modest 1000 megawatt fossil power plant were to close that's modest the utility company would need to have the equivalent of approximately 70 000 electric vehicle batteries for backups power when the wind and solar aren't available so let's keep in mind according to the journal of power sources and manhattan institute for one electronic vehicle battery not the 70 000 just for one battery they would need to excavate approximately 250 tons of earth to harvest the minerals necessary for just one battery but that and that's just for one power plant alone that would be enough just for one power plant alone that would be enough to dirt to fill a convoy of dump trucks from new york to san francisco and back again bumper to bumper to imagine that under this conversion if we're going to close down three to 400 coal and natural gas power plants and my other question would be how long are countries going to tolerate us ripping up their backyards in our heavy pursuit for lithium cobalt nickel graphite and copper wouldn't it make more sense to continue burning our abundant supply of fossil fuels using carbon capture this is precisely the legislation kurt trader and i have been working on for several years it's a bipartisan innovation-based approach to use our resources existing resources first so wouldn't that be a more environmentally sound approach compared to alienating other countries by ravaging their countrysides just to satisfy the hungry needs we have in america so let me just close with this question to you if utilities companies have to compete with the electronic vehicle manufacturers for the same critical minerals will prices increase as they did for ppe during the early days of the pandemic so mr up where where where am i wrong on this so i i will say i can certainly say this that there it is certainly my understanding that there is no invisible force field against the other unintended consequences of when you know all these these mining approaches and other countries who don't have stringent regulations that we do in terms of of modernizing and cleaning our energy systems that those impacts will that the reason why i mean climate change is is not is not strict into any any set boundaries it is a it is a world challenge um and that's and that's from our perspective of why we maintain that advancing technologies in renewable natural gas hydrogen pyrolysis uh particularly here in california uh carbon capture as you mentioned utilization sequestration sequestration these are the pathways and how we can drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions with with without putting people who can't afford energy as a luxury out in the cold well thank you i think that's a good approach because i think what people are doing they're they're ignoring the fact that the impact this can have on jobs and what impact is going to have on people's economies with it i think we can use our the infrastructure we have within our power grid and we just clean it up and use it that way i think that's a more practical approach than taking this alternative just throwing out uh our gas and natural gas and natural gas and coal-fired power plants we ought to be able to use that so with that mr chairman i yield back balance anytime i have

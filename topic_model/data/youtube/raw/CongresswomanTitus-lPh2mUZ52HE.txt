mr. Lewis I dollar Bieber staying with us tonight others have spoken much more eloquently than I can but I want to add my voice that is very proud course of Democrats calling for action it was almost two years ago to the day that I stood in this very spot and asked for a moment of to remember to mourn to honor three people who were shot down in my district in Southern Nevada two were metro police officers who are just having lunch and one was a shopper at a nearby Walmart who stepped in and tried to kill at that moment I became a member of probably the only Club in Washington that people don't want to belong to and that's the club of those of us who have stood on this floor and ask for a moment of silence since that time two years ago that Club has continued to grow and we need to shut it down we need to take action now it won't help stop the need for those moments of silence now we're only talking about reasonable gun legislation it's not outrageous don't be fooled by the rhetoric of the other side and it's about gun ownership I own a gun I grew up in the south where a gun hangs over almost every metal and every house where guns are a big part of our culture is not about that it's about trying to make safer

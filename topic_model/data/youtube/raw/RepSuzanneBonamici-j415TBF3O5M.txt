Thank You mr. Scott miss Bonamici thank you madam chair I really appreciate this conversation thank you to our witnesses for your expertise I think it's been a difficult but very important conversation to hear that we are regressing as a country when it comes to maternal and infant health the well-being of mothers and babies are fundamental measures of any nation's development and to many Americans I think the statistics that we've heard today might sound like they're coming from a different country or a different time but it is a reality that we have to face so I we must we must face it we must address the failings and improve outcomes for all families and we touched on on several policies particularly want to point out that the inexcusably start stark disparities for racial minorities I'd like to emphasize a point made by several of the witnesses that we can improve the likelihood of healthy births even before pregnancy access to comprehensive reproductive health including contraception and prenatal care empowers women to make decisions about when and in what circumstances they choose to become pregnant I'm currently working to update legislation I introduced last session the equip act that will encourage health care providers to routinely ask women of childbearing age about their intentions regarding pregnancy and to provide appropriate care in response to those conversations March of Dimes was one of the organizations that endorsed the legislation because these pregnancy intention screenings improve the likelihood of healthy births it's kind of a win-win because it is good for maternal health and it also reduces unintended pregnancies and some of you might have noted that Oregon was the only state that's got an a-minus in the March of Dimes report in all fairness we we don't have a lot of racial diversity but we also have many clinics that are using the sort of one key question pregnancy intention screening and we also serve aggressively expanded Medicaid we have coordinated care organizations so we're doing a good job in many ways but there's still a lot of work to do we have to make sure that we're addressing those implicit biases dr. Cooper use you spoke about positive health outcomes being dependent on implementation of all sexual and reproductive rights can you talk about how those rights might not be respected in healthcare settings pre pregnancy and how those how policies can take that into account so are usually when I'm doing data I point out that and although the United States is the worst in the world and when it comes to maternal mortality and black women are dying at three to four times the rate that also means a lot of white women are dying that should not and places like Oregon give us an example of what we could do better as a country if we invested in everyone and invested in things like insurance and other things so it's important for us to think about when you restrict access to contraception so we have data my coloring Maeve Wallace and others where the places that have more restrictions on access to contraception have the worst outcomes for maternal and child health so when they say language around we're making things safer for moms you're actually making things worse so the data is the opposite of this narrative around safety so restrictions for sex education causes harm causes definitely restrictions for access to birth control for larks for abortion all those things cause harm and cause death the more you put policies in place too there are barriers the more that women and children are more likely to die right our legislature with a bipartisan basis passed legislation to fill contraception prescriptions for a whole year rather than the short term which my daughter really appreciates so I recently visited a WIC clinic in Washington County Oregon and saw firsthand how important these services are for women and families who want to give their children a healthy start in life I just want to mention in light of the public charged opinion from the Supreme Court yesterday I think we're gonna see more and more families afraid to reach out for services but which serves almost 15,000 people countywide 79% of clients are working families and 22% are pregnant we know that this nutrition education and connection is is beneficial in terms of improving birth weights and reduction in premature births and pure infant desmos stewart studies continue to confirm wix role in reducing the likelihood of preterm birth only a slight majority of pregnant with recipients just a little more than 53% are certified for the program in their first trimester you know why this is and what can we do to better encourage certification of pregnant women a lot of people are very shocked when they find out how important WIC is in terms of serving pregnant and in postpartum women infant and children younger than age of five almost half of the four million babies are born the US have been able to access WIC and and so it's an important program we do think that having more access and having more community workers and community access to make sure that women understand how to overcome the barriers to become eligible for WIC is really important WIC has but is proven to be one of the most effective evidence-based programs to ensure that to your point that again we we can improve that health outcomes reduce infant mortality reduce the risk of preterm birth we're strongly in favor of expanding and improving access and looking at ways in which to improve those community access points as well thank you and I see my time is expired I just want to say how important paid family leave is that we are the the only test realized country to not have paid family leave and what a difference it makes my state at the state level past paid family leave but we absolutely must as a country it's shocking that so many women go back to work within just a couple of weeks I was fortunate with my first child I was able to take six months off most women can't do that and and I still you know I had to explain to people why I need to take a break to go pump in the breast room and so you know having paid leave really makes a difference for a healthy start for our children and families and I've gone over my time so I yield back madam chair thank you very much

everybody how we doing [Applause] I would like to thank you all for sticking around I know it's been a long night but I would like to thank each and every one of you for being here and for supporting Ashley from the very beginning because we wouldn't be here without all of you and these guys too I guess but um it's it's been an amazing journey and we have been very blessed with wonderful people in our lives from all of you to so many wonderful campaign people and staff and I just can't thank everybody enough um it's my wonderful pleasure to introduce you all to the love of my life my congresswoman Ashley Henson [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] guys the life of the party [Applause] I want to first start out by saying just a huge thank you thank you to all of you for having my back since the very beginning it is such an honor to serve as your congresswoman and I think it goes without saying but wasn't this a decisive victory for Iowa tonight foreign it was very clear that tonight Iowans embraced the Iowa way and we rejected the D.C way we embraced Common Sense the minivan driving mom from Marion and this win would definitely not be possible without a few special people but I want to start by thanking my husband Matt [Applause] and my sweet voice Max and Jax those guys have knocked a lot of doors with me and I think they've definitely won me some votes so um they're amazing and they have been with me every step of the way in this process from the state house to the U.S house and they make it all worth it they are why I do this job um I also want to take a moment to acknowledge my opponent tonight I respect the Senators passion to serve and her family I wish them all the best in their next steps um yeah thank you thank you so to everyone watching at home tonight and everyone in this room again thank you so much for helping us cross this finish line from those of you who I've known for years to some of you who I've just met on this campaign and you've been out there helping be such a critical part of getting us across this Finish Line you are our family and you are a part of Team Henson thank you so much [Applause] so you all know how much work it is you knocked doors you made phone calls you wrote checks you really helped us get across this Finish Line you made all the difference and I'm so grateful for your support I ran for congress as a mom to fight for my kids and fight for my family so that we can leave that next Generation in America that's better than one My Generation found and I ran also because first and foremost I love Iowa do we love Iowa so Iowa has given me everything I was raised here born and raised here and I am choosing to raise my family here and I think it's really important that we continue to believe in our state and we continue to believe in our people right we have to believe in Iowa in Iowa we do it right we spend wisely we support our police don't we we respect our parents and our families and we believe in Freedom and the promise of America foreign but we know that our values and our way of life have come under attack recently there are a lot of people who are hell-bent on Transforming Our Country taking our country in the wrong direction and we've seen that on full display they're spending your paycheck like it's Monopoly money they're driving up inflation without a care in the world Iowans are struggling to meet make ends meet and they are turning a blind eye to that they're telling moms and dads that the government knows better how to raise their kids than they do that's right I don't agree with that do you no they're opening our borders they're letting criminals back into our streets defunding our police the list of failures from Pelosi and Biden goes on and on but tonight Iowan sent a clear message we are not going to stand for this craziness being pushed by Nancy Pelosi and those who are committed to doubling down on the D.C way we are doubling down on the Iowa way and I want to give a shout out tonight to our great Governor Kim Reynolds do we not have the best governor in the country and as Governor Reynolds says in Iowa America still works doesn't it so Iowans are demanding that we restore fiscal responsibility in Washington D.C we need to unleash American Energy to combat inflation and we need to secure our Southern border so I promise to continue to fight for those priorities because those are the priorities you've told me are your priorities every single day so you've entrusted me to lead you've entrusted me to take your stories to Washington DC and to be your voice again so together we can move forward not just as Republicans Or democrats in this country but as Americans we need to solve these problems these very serious challenges that we're all facing I believe Iowa is worth fighting for and I believe our great country America is worth fighting for it's the greatest country in the world not even close right so I have not forgotten the people of Iowa are my bosses my only bosses and I answer to all of you and tonight I am so humbled that you have put your trust in me for another two years to serve you so thank you my passion for serving this state is uh it's greater than it ever has been um seeing all of you here definitely helps with that but um it's certainly what I'm seeing what's happening with our country and the direction we've gone it is the most critical time to stand up and speak up and fight for our values so I will say this too I realize that not everyone out there supported me so whether you supported me here tonight or didn't I still work for you I will pledge to continue to be transparent and accessible and come to hear your stories and take them to Washington DC because that's what Iowans deserve so I will continue to do that for you so are we proud to be Iowans and did we get it done here tonight we certainly did thank you so much I will not let you down God bless Iowa God Bless America it's an honor to serve you in Congress thank you so much [Applause] [Music]

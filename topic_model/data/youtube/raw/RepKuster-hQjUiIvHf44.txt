five minutes thank you to our subcommitter leader chairlotta and ranking member Matsui for holding this important hearing today we appreciate it I'm a new member on this subcommittee and I'm excited that our first hearing is on a subject that's vital of vital importance to rural communities like my state New Hampshire satellites satellite technology provides critical basic internet services for many rural communities however as we've come to learn basic internet services are no longer enough to meet the demands of today's world during the covid-19 pandemic nearly every aspect of Our Lives moved to Virtual platforms many companies and small businesses shifted to a virtual workplace our children went to school online and we attended our doctor's appointments via Telehealth services in Congress I'm committed to doing everything I can to improve internet connectivity in rural communities that's why I'm proud to have supported the infrastructure investment and jobs act investing 65 billion dollars in Broadband infrastructure to connect communities Nationwide and I also serve on Mr clyburn's rural Broadband task force as well this investment is going to help us ensure access to high-speed reliable affordable broadband internet services for homes Business Schools and hospitals so today at this hearing I'm excited to learn more about how we can use satellite technology to help connect more Americans to the internet for many in my district the barrier to broadband internet services is not accessibility but affordability so Mr Stroup if I could currently in some communities the cost of satellite broadband service and consumer equipment may be higher than the Alternatives can you speak to how the satellite industry and recent technological advances can help to lower costs and provide affordable reliable broadband so one of the things that's happening in some communities is installing Community Wi-Fi systems in order to share the cost of the service and the equipment of course the industry is continuously trying to to find ways to lower the cost and ease the installation of the equipment but I think that this is an ideal example of how the subsidies can be applied and I would encourage every member here to convey that to the uh to their states as they're going through establishing the process for determining who is going to qualify for Broadband funding um because buying down the cost of the equipment is certainly a legitimate a means of Bringing Down the cost of of service as you noted thank you thank you um in the granite state we take great pride in the preservation of our beautiful forests and remote regions which are the Bedrock of our tourism economy now recently many of our major wireless companies have announced Partnerships with satellite providers to extend service to some of the hardest to reach places including Parks forests and even ski areas are around the country Miss Decker could you elaborate on these capabilities and their implications on the future of wireless and satellite connectivity across the country thank you for the question so I think the implications are the reason why we haven't seen a total build out of terrestrial Towers in the United States is because the cap X and Opex that's why our mobile network operator partners are looking to a satellite solution in addition to the fact as you mentioned our beautiful national parks people do not want to go out into the national park and see a cell tower but what they do want is connectivity so if the park closes which we've had happen and they want instructions for how to leave it and when they suffer an emergency they want to be able to call for help so I think as you see in the mobile network operators are looking to partner with satellite companies to fill in the gaps in their coverage and we've had examples you gave the example of the family out in California we've had accidents and deaths on Mount Washington as well and we're only you know it's literally two hours from Boston but it's very remote in the White Mountains and very rugged to get the rescue crews in there and frequently they will find you know the cell phone either the battery's dead or they're frantically trying to reach Somebody by and there's there's just not service so thank you for everything that you're doing for Safety and Security for people and thank you to all of you this has been a fascinating hearing for me and um with 30 seconds left a member of the general lady yields back

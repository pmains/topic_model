at least 19 people now connected to the president or the white house have coronavirus the president will also be returning to a white house that is in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak don't let it dominate don't let it take over your lives don't let that happen you're looking good okay look i wore this world you got it descent stay in the fight dissent ayanna lot's been happening in the past few days how are you thinking about all this for this trump white house this is really more of the same they are cruel they are callous they are corrupt and the occupant of this white house looks out for himself but not the american people in fact i believe he has contempt for the american people everyone should have the high quality health care and paid leave that donald trump benefited from this week because health care is a human right that is exactly right and you know trump has totally failed to contain this pandemic and instead he's out there hosting super spreader events and at the same time he is trying to actively destroy the affordable care act to put health care coverage out of reach for millions of americans look donald trump received top-notch health care paid for by the taxpayers while hundreds of people are dying every day in this country the american people know hypocrisy when they see it and they're seeing it right now in the white house since donald trump seems to only speak in tweets let's lift up the most important tweets that of the american people i've got one right here ayanna my boyfriend's brother was denied a hospital stay when he tested positive for covid even though his medical records show he had asthma he died a few days later in the shower rage doesn't even begin to describe the feelings we've been feeling about all of this my mom died alone in a hospital this may we couldn't be with her when she died for one simple reason to protect others from coping i can't believe this happened and i can't believe this was allowed we have to do better than this yeah you know that's exactly right all that we try to do masks and protective equipment and isolation it's to try to protect others because that's right that's what we want to do we want to take care of other people my mama has cancer i've hugged her once in 10 months and i'm largely unable to see her to hug i quarantined tested negative and we both wore ponchas masks gloves and shields so everything about this event trump makes me unspeakably angry pure selfish reckless indifference millions of people feel angry and many don't have health insurance and even those who do are at risk for losing it trump doesn't care that the majority of americans support the affordable care act he has been champing at the bit to try to repeal it we will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as obama repeal and replace obamacare and even as the trump administration is trying to deal with a new surge of coronavirus cases the president is pushing ahead with his efforts to repeal the affordable care act on november 10th the supreme court will hear arguments in california versus texas trump and the republicans could finally get what they've been chasing for years the fall of the affordable care act this couldn't be more hypocritical and it could not be more cruel trump receives the best medical care paid for by the taxpayers while he pays just 750 dollars in income taxes meanwhile he refuses to pass a cover relief package but demands the republican senate steal him another supreme court seat so the court can rip health care away from millions of people in the midst of a pandemic no less and ayana let's talk about who would suffer most everyone would suffer if the aca falls because it protects people with pre-existing conditions and let's not forget that this now includes every single american who survived covet 19 or who is sick right now but the particularly vulnerable people who would be impacted are people of color and people with disabilities this is terrible but we are not without power let's talk about what we can do to protect the affordable care act elect democrats up and down the ballot look just last week we had a vote in the senate to force the trump administration to stop trying to overturn the affordable care act in court and who blocked it the republicans and that's why we need to win big we need to take back the white house take back the senate expand our majority in the house and we need to take back state houses from republican governors and legislators that are blocking medicaid expansion november third that's a time of accountability and it's not too late to take meaningful steps to fight these attacks to resist this dangerous supreme court nominee and win these critical seats all these seats so much is at stake in this election it's going to take all of us when we fight we win so get in this fight yes get in this fight all the way

well I I was going to ask mr. bridenstine about issues such as the Stennis Space Center so I guess I guess I'll ask you to do that on the record mr. Bernstein and the the future of of rocket propulsion and the in-kind contributions that we make there and also the Space Launch System and the Orion system so I guess I'll just ask those you asked you to comment on the record about that I appreciate senator Lee engaging on this issue and let me just say this this is what I believe about climate change and and I won't even ask you if you agree with it mr. bridenstine climate change has been occurring for millions and millions of years and anyone who disputes that is simply not not looking at the evidence and only in the last few decades has it been suggested that that it is human activity that is causing climate change now you've acknowledged that human activity may be contributing to climate change but there have been wild swings in the climate for millions of years and only recently have we had the audacity to think that that we are so important that we are causing that climate change and some some other reason has just vanished from from the universe let me say this about scientific consensus it hasn't always been right so now scientific consensus is unassailable as a matter of fact Galileo Galileo challenged scientific consensus Copernicus challenged scientific consensus at their peril and it turns out they were right but they were alone for a while here is where there's not scientific consensus if we do everything the left has advocated with regard to to climate the combatting climate change if we if we outlaw coal and if we make people cold in their homes and raise their power bills three hundred percent what will the effect be will sea level be any different at the end of a hundred years we do everything the left is advocated and there is a scientific difference there is a scientific debate about whether that will actually occur I think and and senator Udall is is my good friend I think your answer mr. bridenstine to Senator Udall question is the operative matter will you make sure that politics and your own personal philosophy is not injected into the scientific work being done by NASA and you have solemnly assured this committee that you will see that politics is not inserted and to me we can we can continue to have this debate and and Senator Udall not have had it all over the country and all over the world and will continue to own on a friendly basis but you have said and I'm satisfied with that answer that politics will not be part of the scientific decisions in NAFTA so thank you and I'll ask you to reiterate on the record your great support for the Stennis Space Center and the fact that it is a vital part going forward in the in the mission of NASA I yield back

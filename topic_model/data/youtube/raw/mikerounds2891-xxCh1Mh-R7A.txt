I'll send it around so but nice try whatever you say Thank you Mr chairman uh Mr chairman first of all welcome um it's always good to have you in front of our committee um and as you know both core and headline inflation have remained persistently elevated and over the past 12 months real average hourly earnings fell by 1.8 percent about four percent since President Biden took office to make ends meet as prices increase more Americans are leaning on credit cards at the end of 2022 credit card debt hit a record of 930.6 billion dollars and 18.5 Spike from a year earlier and an average credit card balance Rose to five thousand eight hundred and five dollars over the past year the FED has acted aggressively to tame inflation and yet we are still seeing price increases and as we've discussed this several times but I I recognize that it's been an ongoing discussion but I believe that this further proves that we have long been feeling the effects of a policy induced inflation resulting from Decisions by the by the administration primarily cutting off uh the the uh the resources necessary to improve and increase domestic energy production I continue to be concerned that if you attempt to use the tools that are available at this time for the FED uh then I believe that we're going to have a challenge of not being able to address specifically the challenges brought out when you have a policy is promoting higher prices with with regard to to energy as opposed to what you're trying to do which is to bring down the total overall cost and I just wanted to ask I guess and you're going to think this is something that we've heard before but do you believe that you currently have the monetary policy tools to actually reduce inflation and I I just put it in this perspective in January of 2021 the CPI was 1.4 percent when the Biden Administration began in January of 2022 and this is before the Russian invasion of of of Ukraine CPI was at seven and a half percent seven point five percent today March of 2022 CPI is 8.5 percent wouldn't it be fair to assess that a lot of the policy or the inflation that we've seen here may very well be due to policy Decisions by this Administration Senator not our not for us to uh to point fingers our job is to use our tools you asked whether we have the tools to get this job done and we we do over time there are some things that we can't affect but over time we we can achieve two percent inflation and and we will in other words you've got a limited number of tools available to you and The Limited number of tools that you have are designed to impact simply the reduction in prices and so forth and yet if there are competing interests out there that are pushing prices higher you don't have the wherewithal to decide one tool versus another based on whether it's policy induced or whether it is a matter of a shortage in supplies from outside or whether it's War related that's right our our tools essentially work on demand moderating demand and we so that's that's what we can do so if if there were policies in place that actually help to reduce inflation in other words and by that I'm just going to look at energy alone just as a good example if policies were in place that were actually allowing Energy prices to come down in the United States then you would have less of a need to use the very blunt tools that you do have right now with regard to increasing rate increases is that a fair statement sir in a sense it is but I would just say on energy we I'm not trying to get you to a policy discussion with with what the president's doing on his on his energy policy I just want to make it clear that you have to respond to what's in front of you and it doesn't matter where the inflation is coming from or what's driving it up you're simply trying to bring it back down to that two percent number with with the only tools that you've really got yes but I will say on energy energy has tended over time time to fluctuate up and down and is not it's not mainly affected by our tools so um the things we look at are the thing are really things that are tightly linked to demand in the US economy those we can affect and I think just the fact been increasing inflate or you've been increasing interest rates and yet inflation continues to ride up would suggest just as you've just indicated that when you have high energy prices it's tough to impact that part of it with the Pol the monetary policy that you've got available to you so we're really we focus on everything but we also focus on core in particular which doesn't include Energy prices and what's happened is core core inflation has come down but nowhere near as fast as we might have hoped and it has a long way to go thank you and now latterman of supervision Michael Barr testified before this committee that he would defend the use of the aggregation method as an alternative approach to the insurance Capital standards the ICS proposed by the iais as the final compatibility criteria set to come out later this year can you confirm that you share Vice chair bars views on this am I will confirm that but I'll have to get back to you on the status of that okay thank you thank you Mr chairman

with me now Senate Homeland Security Committee Mara chairman Ron Johnson also serves on the Foreign Relations Committee senator good morning to you and thank you for your time he says live morning bill absolute right to do that with regardless to a national emergency I haven't done it because I want to do a deal through Congress sir where are we on that well if you actually look at the wording of the 96 national sees it I think the president is right it gives the president sweeping Thor she's flux of aliens we such magnitude or exhibits other characteristic effective administration of immigration laws the United States is beyond existing capabilities or you know pressure on current law enforcement no bill and you take a look at the influx of unaccompanied children and people in coming to this country is family units because of our loopholes that incentivize and reward that type type of illegal immigration in 2012 about eleven thousand people came as a family unit last year it was a hundred and seven thousand a tenfold increase in the first three months of this year seventy five thousand people came into this country illegally and were apprehended as a family unit this is a growing problem because we incentivize and reward people and it's not going away it's a growing crisis and that is the crisis the border let me give them there's nothing humane about incentivizing children to come across here that we're a third of the young girls get sexually assaulted I've seen the pictures of the dead desiccated animal chewed bodies in the desert there's nothing humane about having laws and incentivize people tame that dangerous journey or the drugs as many of hundred I'll cure senility Kelly and Conway here yesterday just so our viewers note national emergencies they're 31 still remain in effect that go back decades President Obama declared 12 including one about the flu President Trump is declared three already I thought national emergencies dealt with America but but the president's already declared one about Nicaragua President Obama had one with regard to Somalia Libya Yemen Ukraine South Sudan Central African Republic Venezuela but runde it just seems like this is a broad category senator well again you know Congress has been giving away its constitutional authority and ceding that to the president for decades this is another example I hope it doesn't resort to this I hope Democrats actually will stop being so hypocritical and actually put their money where their mouth is they all claim they want border security they voted for eight billion dollars specifically a better barrier funding they voted for forty billion dollars of border security funding in the immigration bill and yet because present is because as president Trump they simply won't provide just table stakes funding for the better barriers that we actually need and let's face it candidate Trump I can't think of an issue that he highlighted more than securing our border keeping this nation safe if he can claim a mandate through his election it really is for building better barriers Democrats are playing politics they simply want to deny in that funding this is something we should do I'm at a time but if you can do it in 15 seconds how do we get out of this well from my standpoint I'm happy to look at just really just a small increase a small budget or funding measure that actually pays the essential employees I'm working on a bill that would do that for example Coast Guard but TSA CBP are the resentful people maybe that would be something to keep the pressure on the Democrats have the diesel associated good faith will see with another that flies paychecks stopped starting tomorrow for many thank you sir Ron Johnson from Wisconsin there on the hill thank you sir every president

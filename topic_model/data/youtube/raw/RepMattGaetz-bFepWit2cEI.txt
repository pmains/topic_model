President Trump has a burning energy to bring America back he's got a plan to do it laid out and the phases to unlock the potential throughout various sectors of our economy he's got a track record of doing that I think he made the case successfully tonight that he's the person who can marshal the resources and the energy to ensure that the American economy is prosperous and fulfilled again and the president also understands that it's these America first positive populism values that have to animate the decisions we make going forward about bringing those jobs back protecting the American worker and there is no greater cheerleader for American innovation than president Trump you heard that when he talked about vaccines but I think where the president was at his best tonight was when he really showed his heart when he talked about his own friend who had passed away as a consequence of the corona virus and how it affected him to watch body bags being stacked up that our beloved Americans might find themselves in and I think he really showed the American people and I think we all saw how helpful the president can be when you have two great journalists like Brett Baier and martha maccallum asking real questions rather than just having Jim Acosta trying to provoke the president instead of actually learn how our country can get through this crisis together are you going to urge the nation's universities and schools to go back in September I am I want him to go back we have to get our country back yeah I don't want to do this forever I watched a very good government former governor of Indiana proceeding he preceded Mike Pence good governor and he just had a Purdue it's a great school and I saw him the other day he wants to go back he's going back Purdue big school fantastic they're going back we have to go back we have to go back Mike gates schools what do you think I was talking to one of my constituents recently who said it doesn't matter what business is open America will not open until the schools are open because that really is the foundation of American Society in a lot of places how one chooses to educate their children now there's been great advances in digital learning and we may see a benefit from that going forward in a variety of educational settings but lissa booths analysis is directly applicable here if schools in the absence of teachers and support personnel over a certain age are some of the most resilient institutions we can have in our society perhaps we can have them going back in the fall so that we don't lose learning the president's right also that there are real costs and not having the regular pedagogy process playing out in our communities because we have to build on that learning from one element of the syllabus and curriculum to the net let's just state the obvious here governor the governor of Michigan is auditioning to be the vice president of the United States and so whether things are going well or whether they're going poorly regarding the federal coordination she exists to be a theatrical critic of the president regardless of the support that's been divided if she's having problems with testing maybe those are her challenges in execution not the federal government's challenges because here in Florida it was just on Friday that Governor DeSantis and I were setting up a mobile testing facility to build confidence where people could drive through and get very rapid results we're working with the private sector so in those frontline industries people are able to know that when they've go into a restaurant or maybe even a retail establishment that they're dealing with employees who have high health standards and who are safe and I think that allowing the states to be the laboratories of those innovations and really push forward with ways to build that confidence ultimately will restore our economy more quickly and I'm sorry if they just haven't thought out the answers in Michigan quite yet we're doing pretty well in Florida we now know that China lied about how this virus is transmitted we know they lied about their case numbers and we know they sent faulty equipment to other countries suffering from the pandemic what we don't know yet is how do we hold them accountable for the damage they caused Matt Gaetz and I talked about this on deep dive on Fox Nation a couple of weeks ago and in fact you can catch us again on deep dive tomorrow on Fox Nature just go to Fox nature comm and sign up to see that conversation but right here let's talk about a specific mechanism that you mentioned then Matt Gaetz for how we actually try and get China to pay for what they've done tonight President Trump brilliantly pointed out that the reason China was in the position be able to do this to us is because Republicans and Democrats in years past have surrendered our sera sovereignty to groups like the WTO they have in turn caved to China and now we are in this position where they built up their economy at the expense of American workers so here's and by the way President Trump now is ratcheting up the pressure you saw when I raised the issue of the Wuhan Institute of I Rolla ji he pulled their funding yeah you see he explained he explained the position on trade and how we've actually started to confront China on trade ineffective way but here's what we should really do to ratchet up the pressure instead of bailing out Chinese businesses in the United States we should seize their assets and put them in receivership to pay damages to Americans who have suffered as a consequence of the Wuhan virus here's how we do it first we passed the Dan Crenshaw Tom cotton legislation to make China financially responsible for the damages they've caused and then when the lawsuits are ultimately filed to hold China accountable you don't just let them continue to operate their assets and their businesses in the United States you use the judicial process to put all of that in receivership that'll get China's attention that'll hold them accountable that will make the American people hold so Matt you got just half a minute to close this out so eul's I can't believe Mika was asking Joe Biden to find Tara Reid's records it looked like Joe Biden wouldn't be able to find his own shoes if he asked him to but how about you've got his friends over at the New York Times they want an investigation but they wanted by wait for it the DNC the very same DNC that paid fine knows it's really stealing so I'll have to cut you off to the outside see you next Sunday when the next revolution will be televised

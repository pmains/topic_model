thank you I i am good parts that the bill millions of people to lose their health insurance and therefore through their care and medicine this focus on medicaid for not medicated is critical for senior nursing home care for children with disabilities and balance to work hard get struggled to escape recitation this bill passed medicaid payments to ration care for enrollees let me break this down state will get a certain amount of money regardless of the actual cost it takes to care for patients health care costs and medical inflation will continue to rise out of control and the medicaid federal law breastfeed payments will not be enough unless those over time we know that costs will get stacked on the state's providers and patients who already are overburdened stage will have the so called flexibility and empowerment to trust eligibility requirements cut what type of care they will pay for yes like mental health or even cancer treatment and cupcake missed payments at hospitals doctors and clinics need to care for their patients that's why the American Medical Association the National position Alliance opposed the bill that's why the American Hospital Association and Federation of American Hospital cannot support the bill simply put there was a million more uninsured millions more and on compensated scare Medicaid will cover less needed hair and a burden of gold costs will be on working families than everyone else and I mean everyone else who will pay for the cost of care for the uninsured patient you know when I keep dating anniversary what they asked about most are I'm going to be okay can you help me feel better and is going to come what I hate with a foreign envision the medicine you prescribed at the follow-up care the APA helps over 20 mil we'll have health insurance for the first time in all six people get the care they need to feel okay in health hospitals and emergency departments care for more people because on top of data share decrease and it helps people aboard their medicine form the APA is not perfect nobody ever said it was and we should and could improvements this bill on the other hand will hurt hospital birth providers and her patients hospitals and doctors will be less able to take care of Medicaid patients and the new millions of uninsured patients that they will see this bill does nothing to reduce health care costs and as a result health care costs will continue to rise out of control and so low premiums and deductibles for everyone this bill does nothing to reduce the cost of medicine instead he gives tax breaks to corporations and adding insult to injury create a six pack penalty for working families who get sick lose their jobs and their insurance for maybe no fault of their own and use that penalty as payment to insurance companies this bill will make working family middle class and volatile populations pay more and it will help millionaires pay less this is grossly unfair this is a violation of American values of fairness let's not miss diagnose the problem it's not Macy to say more let's not make families who live sex by check pay more there are ways to help reduce premiums and deductibles and still protect others prepare for everyone yes even people with pre-existing illnesses yet even the six who visit the emergency department here are some solutions to reduce health care costs for everyone we need to help ensure more people not on and your millions to reduce health care costs and treatments for everyone we need to help reduce the cost of pharmaceutical would grow and allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices the pharmaceutical drug company to reduce health care costs and premiums for everyone let's work on getting more people in the exchanges so the risk full improve not sabotage the exchanges to her patient for political games like Republicans have done relentlessly even before the exchanges way to set up this still doesn't help people this bill does the opposite this door alarm millions of people this bill will make millions lose their health insurance and make millions who have insurance pay more and if that cupboard and let's care while giving tax breaks to corporations at this point how you might act amidst uncle from New York terrible images as well also in the marketplace so again the review which we pledge to your people just eliminate or reduce the intention offenses

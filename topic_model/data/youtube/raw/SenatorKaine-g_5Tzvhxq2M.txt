I rise today for a sad occasion and that is to remember the lives of two Virginians Alison Parker and Adam Ward journalists who were gunned down on live TV in roanoke virginia just a couple of weeks ago as they covered a local news story and there was a third victim in that shooting Vicki Gardner the president of a local Chamber of Commerce of Smith Mountain Lake who is recovering she was released from the hospital today but still has a long recovery ahead of her we saw during the summer a set of these tragedies in Roanoke Virginia my wife's hometown in Charleston South Carolina and Lafayette Louisiana and Chattanooga Tennessee my my friend the senator from Tennessee is here and in Virginia the shooting in Roanoke which was carried on live television was horrific in itself but it also is horrific because it brought up a lot of bad memories the Roanoke community is within about 25 miles of Virginia Tech where the horrible shooting happened there in 2007 that killed 32 people and wounded dozens of others I spoke on the Senate floor in April on the 8th anniversary of that shooting I talked and as is my habit to do in April and I talked about the lives of some of those who lost their lives but also some who survived and what they're doing today and I am saddened to be here because it's just another example of a horrible shooting and including in my my Commonwealth and also sad because we really haven't made any progress here in this body since I came to it in terms of trying to address this issue there's a lot of work to be done legislative and otherwise to try to address this growing litany of these horrific crimes which deeply scar our own psyche and frankly I think portray a picture of who we are as a nation to the rest of the world that is not accurate about who we are I am going to introduce a bill today that I think can help us address it it's not the end-all solution because there isn't a single solution but I want to talk a little bit about Allison and Adam that I want to talk about the bill I'm Allison Adam worked on this show on WDBJ that's the morning program and they were sort of hometown heroes because not only were they popular because worked for the station they were both from the hometown Roanoke is where my wife grew up very very familiar with the wonderful Roanoke community they both interned at WDBJ when they were in college and they were passionate members of this journalistic profession and they were just starting on these great careers Alison Alison Parker grew up in Martinsville which is just down the road from ronak about 45 minute drive she played the trumpet and the French horn in high school she graduated from James Madison University when she was a Duke at James Madison she interned for a WDBJ and they loved her work and they gave her a recommendation and her first job was not there in WDBJ but it was in North Carolina but as soon as she could move from North Carolina back to Virginia that's what she did she came back to her hometown station she covered all kinds of news and human interest stories including a recent piece on on child abuse that was a really powerful one her colleagues described her as quote proactive and quote wise beyond her years she met a boy she met her boyfriend who she was planning to marry working at WDBJ that is Alison Alison Parker Adam Ward went to Salem High School Salem is the city that adjoins Roanoke graduate in 2007 played football in two state championship football teams teachers they're describing this vivacious kind giving respectful and genuine had a passion for Virginia Tech the local college he started to go to football games with his dad when he was three years old attack he interned there also at WDBJ when he was communication students at Tech and his colleagues remembered him as somebody willing to get the the image that reporters needed you know the we all know in this line of work the guys behind the camera so important to it they make the on-camera talent shine and that was the way Adam was he loved to play tricks on the on-camera talent you know kind of tweaked him and make him not get above their station in life but he was a wonderful guy and he found love at the station to he had become engaged to a producer at the station who sadly was watching in the station the day that the footage of him being killed was shown to shock the world I am I really feel for these families I know we all do you couldn't have watched that without having a feeling even if you're a thousand miles away for the warden the Parker families and I remember having having said to the Virginia Tech families it would be presumptuous of me so I'm not going to say I know what you've lost because I don't know what you've lost but when you hear about these people I do feel like I have a sense of what the world lost i have since what the community lost i don't know what the parents and the siblings lost but you kind of have a sense when you hear about these people why the WDBJ the Roanoke community the community of journalists you kind of have a sense of what we lost as a society when they were killed and I should just say a word Vicki Gardner is a since 2002 has worked at the Smith County lake chamber commerce is major tourism area in Virginia State Park is a it is a feature that was created by a hydroelectric dam that celebrating its 50th anniversary and she was deeply involved in the planning for that and again she was badly wounded she has described you know maneuvering around to try to duck bullets as she was shot in her back and she's had a couple of operations but thank god she's been released to go home today and we're thinking about her too I said the shooting opened a lot old wounds in Virginia especially in this community sadly because Virginia Tech is so close when I spoke on the floor in april i talked about two of these young people Colin Goddard and Lily hub two who were who survived that shooting but just the effect of it on their lives eight years laters they deal with injuries that continue to be challenged and they deal with the horrible memories of that day and that was probably one of the most scarring events in modern history in Virginia everybody knows where they were and everybody knew somebody connected to it and we've revisited this the cycle of shock and then anger and then calls for change and then wondering what the right changes were and sympathy for the families but but we haven't really changed and I just would humbly submit I think there are things that we can do reasonable things we can do that will bring some accountability and will not eliminate these instances it's not it's beyond our power you know to eliminate evil we can't do that we got to be humble about it but in in every area we work on we work on here in this body with the thought that we can do things that will make situations better that will promote incremental improvements and in that spirit I want to talk about a bill that I'm introducing today that I call the responsible transfer of firearms act as we all know the current federal law prohibits nine categories of people from getting weapons the probably the most known are convicted felons people who have been adjudicated mentally ill and dangerous people who are under domestic violence prevention orders now this is a bipartisan federal law the categories have been added over time in a bipartisan way by the House and Senate and as far as I know there is bipartisan support for this provision because you never see bills introduced to eliminate these categories of what I'll call prohibited persons these are people that that Congress bicameral II and bipartisan have determined should not possess weapons now the problem is a whole lot of those people do get weapons because folks either give or sell them to them what's the current law with respect to giving or selling a weapon to somebody who's a prohibitive the current law basically is kind of a no responsibility law you are criminally liable if you give or sell a weapon to somebody who's in one of those nine prohibiting categories but you're only criminally liable if you knew or should have known that they're prohibited and that makes practice law for a while that makes prosecution virtually impossible because you know somebody will give up somebody a weapon or sell it to them and they'll say why I didn't know he was felling I didn't know he had been adjudicated mentally ill or dangerous and there's no obligation on behalf of the seller now we put obligations on sellers all the time affirmative duties and obligations but in this area we don't put an obligation on the part of a seller other than a registered and licensed gun dealer who it must go through a background check we don't put any kind of obligation on anybody to do even minimal reasonable steps to make sure that somebody is lawfully able to possess a weapon so what the responsible transfer of firearms act would do is it would revise the current formula the current formula does have a liability for sellers but only under an elevated standard that really is almost impossible to me and we would amend the federal code not to change the nine categories those are the same not to change that the punishments for for selling or transferring to them that would stay the same but we adjust the responsibility and it's a it's a responsibility and accountability act so if you are putting a weapon in somebody's hands we either selling it or transferring it you've got to take both reasonable steps to determine that the recipient is not prohibited from having that weapon and reasonable steps is is included in the statute just those words we don't say you can only do that by showing one of the following five things you can take any reasonable steps you think are necessary but you got to take reasonable steps and that's what this change in law would do and if you if you can't show to a court satisfaction you've taken reasonable steps then you will be liable for putting the weapon into somebody's hands who the federal government has said they are not able to possess a weapon this shift from the current framework I think would would promote accountability and responsibility in it why should we let a seller just casually put a firearm into the hands of somebody who's prohibited by law from having what why should we do that why shouldn't there be some minimal accountability for a seller who was putting a weapon in the hand of somebody who has been determined that they're not able to possess a weapon I mean we put burdens on sellers that there's not it is not a precise analogy but you know if you go in and try to buy beer in a place you're going to get carted why is that well because we put an affirmative burden on the sale of alcohol so that the seller has to make some effort to determine that the recipient is not prohibited from having it we do the same thing with tobacco and there are other laws that put burdens on sellers well and this is a minimal and take reasonable steps I mean to me the life of some of these people who have you know been gunned down and these horrible crimes it's just worth let's just take reasonable steps and the reasonable steps won't solve all the cases but it will help keep weapons out of the hands of those that we have determined in this body shouldn't have them I'll close mr. president and just say this of course we have to be humble enough to acknowledge there's no there's no one solution to the epidemic of gun violence nor is there a complete solution to it there's nothing that we can do that will eliminate the possibility that we could wake up tomorrow and see the same thing on TV human beings will do evil things that's not going to change that's not going to be eliminated by what we do here but but what we do as legislators and legislation is basically believe and if we didn't believe this we wouldn't be in this body that as we legislate we can improve situations we can't eliminate the possibility but we can improve it we can make it less likely that one of these prohibited individuals will get a weapon in their hand and use it against others so I I just conclude where I started Allison and Adam were wonderful people this is a community that's still really grieving and you know what compounds grief I in my experience now not as a legislative just as a person what compounds and deepens grief is a sense of hopelessness wow this horrible thing happened we've had this horrible loss and there's just nothing we can do about it that that tends to turn grief into despair and depression and I've seen it again and again sadly I was governor in the shooting in bridge at Virginia Tech and I had to deal with these 32 families and and more who had been injured and the broader community was hurting so much and when you've gone through an experience and we see this on our own personalized because everybody has had grief in their own personal line if you go through an experience where there's a lot of grief and loss and you feel that it's pointless or there's nothing you can do to improve it or transform it into something better or improve so that maybe somebody else won't have to suffer through the same experience that tends to take grief and turn it into something even more damaging despair and hopelessness and I think one of the things that we're called to do as legislators is in situations where there is grief to show that there is some hope that we can improve because I believe we can improve I mean I've just seen too many instances legislatively and in the lives of people that we can improve and we can get better and as a nation we need to get better on this issue and this bill won't do it all but I think it will be a sensible way to get better and to show those who are suffering and maybe even despairing under this epidemic of gun violence that we're not just going to accept it and sink deeper into despair and grief but we're going to grab on to it and try to make improvement so with that mr. president I thank you and I yield

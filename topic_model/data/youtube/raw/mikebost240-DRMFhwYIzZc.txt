folks they're at it again I've spent my life fighting Nancy Pelosi in Mike Madigan my opponent has spent his career supporting them as you know I've never stopped fighting for our families whether it's creating a stronger economy or bringing our steel jobs back or reforming the VA to ensure better care for our veterans or fighting for fair trade and a level playing field I've never wavered and you can always count on me to do what's right for all of southern Illinois I'm Mike Boston and I approve this message

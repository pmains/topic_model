mr. president over the past couple of weeks the Obama administration's decision to engage with Iran along with these other five nations through diplomacy instead of military action has faced key tests results are in and the the agreement that we struck tow us the the Brits the the Germans the French Chinese the Russians the Iranians and us the agreement we stock truck appears to be working thus far and God willing we may actually be on her way to a being safer as a as a result this test began on the high seas two weeks ago when the u.s. and Iran faced a crisis that could have ended tragically to davie vessels maybe US Navy vessels carrying total 10 crew members straight into Iran's territorial waters they were detained by Iran and as we many of us know they appeared on Iranian television the American vessels were somewhere they should not have been it was a mistake has a former naval flight officer who served five years in a hot war in Southeast Asia at another 18 years right up to the end of the Cold War as a p3 aircraft mission commander I know this is a mistake we never want to make never want to make defense secretary ash Carter acknowledge the error had been made the sailors were released unharmed within 24 hours of being detained flashbacks have passed hostage crisis and destabilizing tensions were on all of our minds as we watched this story unfold however thanks to a more cooperative and productive diplomatic relationship with Iran the sailors were released within 24 hours as a week came to a close though we saw additional encouraging validations that the administration's Iran strategy is beginning to bear fruit following months of the most intrusive nuclear inspections in history international weapons inspectors concluded that Iran had indeed followed through on its pledge and the nuclear deal to dismantle the parts of its nuclear program that were clearly not intended for peaceful purposes the International Atomic Energy Agency certified the Iran had reduced stockpile of enriched uranium by ninety eight percent and that the remaining uranium was not only enriched was only enrich two levels consistent with peaceful energy uses the inspectors that certified that nearly 15,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium have been dismantled that leaves Iran with only its least sophisticated centrifuges which can be used solely for peaceful purposes the inspectors revealed that a special reactor a special reactor for producing the kind of plutonium needed for a nuclear bomb in Iran will produce no more it's been filled with concrete instead finally the nuclear watchdog certified that the inspections and monitoring systems of Iran's nuclear facilities a nuclear supply chain had been stood up so as to ensure Iran's continued compliance with a nuclear deal always happen much faster than most of us would have expected it certainly happened faster than I expected it would in fact some critics of the nuclear deal said that Iran would never live up to the promises that had made never get despite that skepticism today we see Iran that has taken irreversible steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons program in order to make good on his pledges as president amid the nuclear deals implementation the u.s. achieved another diplomatic breakthrough with Iran one that I and the number of our colleagues had a hand in the Iranians released the five individuals all dual us Iranian citizens citizens that they had been detaining in Iran for some years the release was a result of intense diplomatic negotiations secretary Kerry and his team negotiators worked overtime to secure their freedom they deserve our appreciation and our things I had never forgotten about these Americans and neither had my colleagues whenever we spoke or met with senior Iranian officials in recent years we consistently called on them to release our unjustly unjustly detained citizens the end result is that these Americans are free to rejoin their families in America instead of rotting in an Iranian prison the events and achievements that occurred during these six days were a remarkable validation of the Obama administration and those of us in the Congress who voted to support the nuclear deal and that we had made the right choice but our challenge with Iran our challenges with Iran have not got valleys vanished not by a long shot Iran continues to support terrorist organizations like Hezbollah Iran pops up the Assad regime in Syria Iran tests and developed bigelow ballistic missiles in defiance of UN Security resolution another American former FBI agent Bob Levinson to pierce disparate eight years ago and run your awning government needs to do all it can do to help return him to his family or if they can't do that if he's no longer alive at least help find out what happened to this American and of course Iran refuses to recognize Israel's right to even exist addressing these problems with the run will not be easy they will require the same kind of intense negotiation pressure that helped to bring about an end to Ron's nuclear weapons program and the release of the teen Americans that means that our relationship with Iran won't always be composed of carrots they may well be at times when sticks are needed to try to convince that nation's regime to change its behavior toward us and our allies including Israel perhaps no better action illustrations dynamic than the United States recent move to increase sanctions on Iran for its illegal testing of ballistic missiles something is in clear violation of UN sanctions at the same time that the u.s. was lifting nuclear sanctions on Iran is part of the nuclear deal the Obama administration was leveling sanctions against 11 entities for their role in supporting Iran's ballistic missile program addressing our challenges with Iran over the long term will also require this administration along with future administrations and Congress's to adopt afford in foreign policy that looks beyond the rhetoric of Iran's current regime have a chart here that I wanted to share with everyone to tonight it's really a a collage of photographs these these photographs were taken I believe in the aftermath of the decision to talk to a group approved the the agreement decision reached by the US are five negotiating partners and the the government of Iran and this is a collage of photographs that indicates the the measure of really joy that the Iranian people reacted to this successful negotiation not with I just want to say Iran is a little understood by most most Americans ryans the country they got about 78 million people there today the average age of those peoples I think under the age of 25 a lot like the people that the young people we see in these in these photographs for the most part they're well educated they're lying share of them don't remember the Iranian Revolution of 1979 taking of American hostages at our embassy or the cruel sher shah who we supported until his ouster this is a population reflected in these photographs this is a population appears more focused on rebuilding Iran's troubled economy than pursuing antagonizing military activities favored by the Supreme Leader a nation supreme leader and by many in the Revolutionary Guard and the weeks ahead this new generation of young Iranians will head to the polls sometime in the month of februari and in order to choose the country's next parliament and an entity called the Council of experts Forge I believe is the body that will choose or help to choose the next Supreme Leader of Iran at stake for the Iranians is a choice between the policies engagement in economic revival being vigorously pursued by President rouhani foreign minister Zarif and their supporters as opposed to the politics of antagonism and steel dissemination it appeared to be favored by the supreme leader in many in the Revolutionary Guard we've seen photographs this week of a president Ronnie Ronnie president meeting with not just the Pope Francis I think the first meeting between the leader of Iran in the the pulp in close to 20 years but also it is meeting the meetings through throughout Europe calling on countries calling on businesses in order to should I try to solicit and pave the way for investments not in weaponry nuts then you know aid to Hezbollah but investments in the roads highways and bridges things that we need they need them a whole lot worse their roads highways bridges their airports three trains make us all look like 21st century they need to invest in those things they have a lot of oil in the ground they have the ability to pump a lot more I think they have pumped right now about 300,000 barrels a day they have the ability to by the end of this year pump as much as 1 million barrels of oil a day and they're not going to do that without the enormous investments in their oil infrastructure and they have a great need to do that and these young people know that that's where they would like to spend that money we should make the upcoming more help make the upcoming parliamentary elections in February for these voters and others an easy choice and easy choice we should continue to show the people who've Iran that their cooperation their commitment to peace will be rewarded how what will the Economic Opportunity and the shouting of Iran status as a pariah in the international community we gotta listen to these people we ought to listen these people they're not much older than the pages that are sitting here in front of me this deceiving they are interested in their country changing for the better their interests rated interested in in reform a number have relatives who live over here in our country is a lot of Iranian Americans to live here in in this country and the most part I think very valued citizens and people we can be proud to call Americans but we need to listen to these young people who are calling for reform who want to reconnect Iran to the national community frankly it would be wise of us to do so for the sake of our security and for the sake of our ally security and for stability in the Middle East mr. president I see no one waiting to be recognized at this time and I'd like to ask unanimous consent that we entered to a quorum call

and leading off our discussion tonight is democratic congressman adam schiff of california he is chairman of the house intelligence committee and a member of the january 6th select committee uh congressman schiff thank you very much for joining us on this important night and i want to begin with what we just saw with ari melber's interview that in all of that information you have now voted to refer to the justice department the full house will vote on this presumably it will pass and all of that will be sent to the justice department as a former prosecutor yourself how long would it take someone in the justice department to figure out that peter navarro is guilty of criminal contempt of congress how many minutes after watching ari melbourne's interview could they conclude that well lawrence just doesn't take very long because peter navarro as well as dan scavino the other person that we held in contempt made it simple for the justice department they refused to show up you can't just say i'm not even going to bother to come if you believe you have a claim of privilege you come you identify what question you're going to assert a privilege to now they don't have any good privileges to assert and that may be the reason they didn't show up but it makes it very simple or it should for the justice department so they're going to want to do their due diligence nonetheless so i don't think they'll make a decision in a matter of minutes but it should not be a difficult call for the justice department i mean legally uh the navarro claim is exactly the same as him saying that the former federal employee named trump who's now retired from the federal government gave him the authority to drive at any speed that he wanted to and drive through any stop sign he wanted to anywhere in america it is such a a legal science fiction claim that peter navarro is making uh it seems like the justice department every extra day it takes to think about this would just be embarrassing itself well you know navarro's out there uh pushing a book in which he talks about things which he says he can't talk to congress about um of course that's enormously hypocritical inconsistent it just undermines any kind of a claim you might make but but again it is vitally important that the justice department act on these criminal referrals if they don't if congress can't enforce its subpoenas it means we can't do our oversight and if we can't do our oversight we can't hold any president accountable uh past present or future uh it makes us into kind of a play thing for a despotic president uh and so they they need to enforce these congressional subpoenas they need to hold these people in criminal contempt and more than that as judge carter wrote so eloquently in his opinion today there is evidence that the president may have engaged in crime or fraud against the united states and the justice department needs to do its part to hold him accountable there are reports indicating that jared kushner is cooperating with the committee and may be submitting to an interview this week what can you tell us about that well sadly lawrence there's not much i can tell you about that uh we don't uh routinely talk about witnesses who may or may not be cooperating or may or may not be coming in for an interview or deposition so at this point i'm afraid i can't comment and what about the committee's consideration of uh virginia thomas as a possible witness who by the way mentions uh someone she calls jared in her texts to mark meadows well we are not making a comment on jenny thomas tonight now we may have more to say uh in the near future but at this point we don't have a comment uh i you know i can say more generally with respect to either of these two witnesses anyone who has relevant information the committee wants to hear from and more than that i think it's a patriotic duty for them to come in uh in the case of the two people we held in criminal contempt it was also a legal requirement but uh people should should not even require a subpoena uh to do their duty uh we had a situation where uh efforts to overturn the election resulted in bloody violence in which people died uh it it's an ethical obligation a duty of citizenship i think uh to provide whatever information people possess the uh supreme court of the united states uh the most powerful court is the only court in america that has no ethics standards no ethics rules of its own it leaves the question of recusal to each individual justice to make for himself or herself but there is one federal law that says it is against the law for even a supreme court justice to participate in a case that involves an interest of any kind of the supreme court justice's spouse the spouse does not have to be a party to the case a plaintiff or a defendant in the case this what we're seeing with clarence thomas's ruling about these communications that include communications by his wife is a very clear violation of that law could you imagine a clearer violation of that law well lord ironically as a member of the slack committee i have less freedom to talk about this at the moment than non-members of the committee but i will say this um i've i felt i think for many years now that uh there needs to be a code of ethics for the supreme court uh and and i think that uh it ought to hold justices to the highest standards and and i think that congress needs to explore whether it can insist upon a code of ethics if the court doesn't adopt one on its own congress with adam schiff thank you very much for joining us tonight we really appreciate it

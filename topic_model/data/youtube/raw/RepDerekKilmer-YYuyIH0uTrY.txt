Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to call for the house to immediately take up legislation to reauthorize the secure rural school schools program for more than a hundred years the federal government has recognized the financial stresses that national forest land puts on local communities the failure of Congress to reauthorize this program at the end of the last Congress has resulted in significant budget gaps and enormous uncertainty for county governments in my state and throughout the country school districts across the country are poring over their books figuring out how to scale back essential services that they provide to students to our kids and to their families in Washington State one County has seen its budget for the sheriff's office cut in half making layoffs inevitable in the region I represent Jefferson County is now struggling to repair a key access road that was washed out from a storm without secure rural schools funding to complete the repairs the counties left hoping a state emergency declaration will provide needed funds other counties are facing similar projects in limbo mr. speaker let's maintain our federal obligation to rural and timber communities and work in a bipartisan fashion to pass legislation that reauthorizes and funds this critical program as soon as possible Thank You mr. speaker gentlemen

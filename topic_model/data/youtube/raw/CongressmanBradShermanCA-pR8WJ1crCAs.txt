your secretary you were here in July Democrats and Republicans gave you questions for the record and we got responses to those last week six months can you commit now that the vast majority I plan to answer one or two really tough ones but that the vast majority of the questions for the record that are asked by Democrats and Republicans today will be responded to with real answers within 30 days I can I can tell you that I told my staff I thought our response time you can make the commitment I asked or just apologized through the pass we will do everything we can to make sure it's 30 days but it won't be as long as it took last time I can assure you okay because I have a number of questions for the record I need answers and the first relates to the F sock report to base iffy designations on activity based an activity based approach I want to commend you for moving in that direction and I'm interested in your plans for implementing recommendations of the Treasury's asset management and insurance report and the report on non-bank Sippy designation process in particular the recommendation that in activities based approach be used so I'll ask you to respond to that for the record also we hear that the International Association of Insurance supervisors is pushing a global standard that clashes with our system for state-based insurance regulation and I want to know your reaction to that and whether we can ensure that we're going to promote our own system in that negotiation I can assure you we well thank you now last time you were here I asked you about the Armenia tax treaty didn't expect you to know that I'd asked well I did tell your staff in advance and we have gotten the most absurd response I'm an old tax lawyer I know it's hard work but this is the easiest job they're ever going to have they responded to Judy Chu who also raised this by saying that this is a very resource-intensive process here's the model treaty we've published it and the government of Armenia has said they just want to sit down and use this as the basis and get the treaty done 28 members of Congress have asked you to do this can you commit to investing 28 hours of one tax lawyer just 28 hours of that one tax lawyers time because and to start the process I think he'll he or she will finish the process we're talking about filling in the blanks in a document we already have can you commit 28 hours of one tax lawyers time I can commit the 28 hours and we will get it done and the benefits will include the exchange of information provisions which will allow the IRS to get information about anybody hiding assets in Armenia and thereby enhance our tax collection process when it comes to marijuana we currently have the fencin guidance and if you were to revoke that then that would really make it better for armed robbers in my community because there'd be huge amounts of cash at the local marijuana dispensary can I have I hope you'd respond for the record what you plan to do and I hope that you would indicate that you're interested in keeping our communities safe I don't want bags of cash at a marijuana dispensary down the street from my constituents can I count on your answer I can commit to you that we are reviewing it but I assure you we don't want bags of cash I want to make sure that we can collect our necessary taxes and other things in other than when you were here last time you assured us that although we didn't designate China as a currency manipulator even with though we've lost a lot of jobs to there admitted past currency manipulation that the Trump administration was going to do something about this in back of you we've got the chart that shows that every month that Trump has been in office we've seen any increase in the trade deficit with China are we just gonna talk tough or when you come back a year from now are we going to see a different chart I think you're gonna see a different chart okay and if we don't can you then designate them a currency manipulator no one has nothing to do with the other one is we are very focused on trade the currency manipulation independent that but they have on their word markets by their past manipulation of currency and I yield back the time of the gentleman has expired

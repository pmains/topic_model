- Happy New Year everyone, it's Lauren Underwood
and it's January 1st, the first day of 2018. I hope you've all had a Merry Christmas, happy holidays filled
with laughter and cheer with all of your family and friends. You know, on this first day of the year I often like to sit back
and recharge and take stock of what we want to
accomplish in the year ahead and so for many of us, 2018 has been really a long time coming. We've marched, we've protested, we've called and called and called and now, finally in Illinois's
14th Congressional district we have our chance to cast our vote. Over the last several months
our campaign has really grown and I'm so grateful to have your support. We've been working
together to talk to voters all across the 14th district as we prepare to vote on March 20th, and so in the weeks ahead we
are going to have house parties and phone banks and canvassing and even a couple of candidate forums, and I know that together we will flip Illinois's
14th Congressional district, so thank you for all that you do. So excited for the journey ahead. Join us.

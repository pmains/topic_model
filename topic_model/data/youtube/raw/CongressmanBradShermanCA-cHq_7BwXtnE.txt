MR. SHERMAN: I WANT TO THANK   THE SPEAKER FOR RECOGNIZING ME   AND INDICATING THAT I CAN SPEAK  FOR AN HOUR. YOU KNOW, WE GET CAUGHT UP IN  SO MANY ISSUES HERE THAT WE  SOMETIMES DON'T EXPLORE THEM IN  DEPTH. AND WITH AN HOUR I PLAN TO LOOK  IN DEPTH FIRST AT THE  PRESIDENT'S TRADE POLICY TOWARD  CHINA, AND THEN TOWARD THE   REPUBLICAN TAX BILL. THE PRESIDENT IS MEETING AGAIN   WITH PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA.  THEY'LL OUT A BEAUTIFUL JOINT  STATEMENT. THEY'LL POSE FOR PHOTOGRAPHS.  AND YOU KNOW, THEY'LL EITHER BE  A -- THERE WILL EITHER BE A  BUSINESS DEAL OR TWO TO  ANNOUNCE.  THESE ARE THE TWO LARGEST  ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD.  THEY INVOLVE TENS OF TRILLIONS   OF DOLLARS.  SO EVERY MONTH A FEW BIG THINGS  HAPPEN THAT ARE BAD AND ONE OR   TWO BIG THINGS HAPPEN THAT ARE   GOOD.  THERE'S ALWAYS A PARTICULAR  BUSINESS DEAL THAT YOU CAN   PACKAGE AND WRAP AS A PHOTO OP.  BUT THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVE TO  LOOK AT THE OVERALL TRADING  RELATIONSHIP.  AND THE TRADING RELATIONSHIP IS  THIS.  WE RUN HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF   DOLLARS OF TRADE DEFICIT AND   EVERY BILLION DOLLARS OF TRADE   DEFICIT COSTS US 10,000 JOBS.  SO LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAS  HAPPENED WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP   HAS BEEN IN OFFICE.  WE LOOK AT EACH MONTH AT OUR   TRADE AND GOODS WITH THE   PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.  AND WE START WITH A DEFICIT OF   JUST A BIT OVER $22 BILLION,   AND FOR THE MOST RECENT  STATISTICS AVAILABLE, AUGUST OF  THIS YEAR, WE'RE UP TO ALMOST  $35 BILLION. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS  CHART IS THAT EVERY MONTH TRUMP  HAS BEEN IN OFFICE OUR TRADE   DEFICIT WITH CHINA HAS GROWN.  NOW, HE CAN SAY THAT HE DOESN'T  HAVE THE POWER TO DO ANYTHING  ABOUT THAT.  HE JUST WANTS TO BE A PRETEND  PRESIDENT. A PRETENSE PRESIDENT.  OPPOSING PRESIDENT -- A POSING   PRESIDENT. HE CAN POSE FOR A PICTURE BUT  HE DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY  TO DO ANYTHING.  THAT IS COMPLETELY WRONG.  LOOK AT SECTION 338 OF THE   TARIFF ACT OF 1930.  AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THE  PRESIDENT ACTING ALONE COULD   ELIMINATE THIS DEFICIT BY  IMPOSING TARIFFS ON CHINESE  GOODS NOW. BUT HE WON'T DO THAT.  BECAUSE HIS PLAN AND WHAT HE'S   DONE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS,  HE CAMPAIGNS LIKE HE'S BERNIE  SANDERS, AT LEAST ON THESE   ISSUES, AND HE GOVERNS LIKE  HE'S FROM GOLDEN -- GOLDMAN  SACHS. WHICH OF COURSE MANY OF HIS  ADVISORSING TOO ACTUALLY ARE.  AND EVEN AFTER -- ADVISORS   ACTUALLY ARE.  AND EVEN AFTER THE CAMPAIGN WAS  OVER IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR,   THE CAMPAIGN CONTINUES.  AND HE CONTINUES TO PRETEND TO   BE IN FAVOR OF THE TRADE   POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH BERNIE  SANDERS AND OTHERS AND HE  CONTINUES TO GOVERN IN THE   INTERESTS OF GOLDMAN SACHS.  NOW, THIS CHART DOES NOT   REFLECT SERVICES BECAUSE   SERVICES TRADE BETWEEN THE   UNITED STATES AND CHINA IS NOT   AVAILABLE ON A MONTHLY BASIS.  BUT THE TREND WOULD BE EXACTLY   THE SAME.  HUGE GROWTH IN THE DEFICIT,  MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER MONTH  AFTER MONTH, FEBRUARY, MARCH,  APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY AND   AUGUST OF THIS YEAR. AND LIKELY TO CONTINUE FOR THE   OTHER MONTHS THAT THE PRESIDENT  CONTINUES TO SERVE AND THAT  STATISTICS BECOME AVAILABLE. NOW, WE'RE TOLD PERHAPS THAT   IT'S OK TO GIVE AWAY ALL THESE   AMERICAN JOBS BECAUSE WE NEED  CHINESE HELP TO DEAL WITH NORTH  KOREA. LET'S SEE HOW THAT'S WORKING   OUT. THE PRESIDENT, PRIOR TO THIS   TRIP, HAD MET WITH PRESIDENT XI  TWICE. NOW WE HAVE A THIRD MEETING. AFTER THOSE FIRST TWO MEETINGS,  THE NORTH KOREA EXPLODES A   HYDROGEN BOMB AND TESTS A  MISSILE CAPABLE OF REACHING  MAJOR CITIES IN THE MAINLAND OF  THE UNITED STATES. ALL WITH THE ACQUIESCENCE OF   THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.  SO WHETHER YOU'RE CONCERNED  WITH OUR NATIONAL SECURITY OR  WHETHER YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH  JOBS AND TRADE POLICY, WE CAN  NO LONGER HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO   POSES AND PRETENDS ANDING NORSE  THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY THAT HE  HAS ON LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN ON  THE BOOKS SINCE THE 1930'S.  NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE   REPUBLICAN TAX BILL. THIS IS A BILL WHICH WILL RAISE  TAXES ON MILLIONS OF MIDDLE  CLASS FAMILIES.  NOW, IT GETS WORSE IN A FEW  YEARS. THERE'S A BIT OF A BAIT AND  SWITCH.  THEY'LL WANT TO TELL YOU, JUST   LOOK AT HOW THIS BILL WILL   EFFECT YOUR TAX RETURN IN 2019.  WELL, IF YOU PLAN TO STILL BE  ALIVE IN 2027, TAKE A LOOK AT  THE EFFECT IT'S GOING TO HAVE  THEN.  LET'S LOOK AT MIDDLE CLASS   FAMILIES.  NOT THE POOREST 20% IN OUR   COUNTRY, NOT THE RICHEST 20%,  THAT MIDDLE 60%. ROUGHLY 30% OF THOSE FAMILIES  IN THE MIDDLE CLASS ARE GOING  TO SEE A TAX INCREASE ON THEIR   2027 TAX RETURN. AND THAT TAX INCREASE IS LIKELY  -- IS CALCULATED AS AN AVERAGE   OF $1,300 PER FAMILY.  WELL, LET'S LOOK AT THE  INDIVIDUAL PROVISIONS. TO SEE HOW FAIR THEY ARE TO  MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. FIRST, RIGHT OFF THE BAT, THEY   TAKE AWAY THE PERSONAL   EXEMPTION. WHICH ON NEXT YEAR'S TAX   RETURN, THE FIRST YEAR THAT  THIS NEW BILL WOULD BE   EFFECTIVE, IS WORTH $4,150 PER   PERSON IN YOUR FAMILY. THAT'S NEARLY $21,000 FOR A  FAMILY LIKE MINE, OF FIVE. THEY TAKE AWAY $21,000 OF  DEDUCTIONS EVEN FROM THE   POOREST FAMILIES IN AMERICA AND  FROM EVERY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY   AS WELL. NOW, THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO   REPLACE THAT WITH A CHILD TAX  CREDIT, BUT IF YOUR YOUR   CHILDREN ARE OVER AGE 16, THAT   CREDIT IS LIMITED TO A FEW   HUNDRED DOLLARS NEXT YEAR AND  THEN THEY MAKE IT ZERO FIVE  YEARS FROM NOW.  SO IF YOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO   TURN AGE 17 SOMETIME IN THE  NEXT FIVE YEARS, THEY'VE GOT   YOUR NAME ON THIS BILL.  AND THEY ALSO DO INCREASE THE  STANDARD DEDUCTION.  BUT TENS OF MILLIONS OF  AMERICANS DON'T EVEN TAKE THE  STANDARD DEDUCTION.  THEY CHOOSE TO ITEMIZE THEIR   DEDUCTIONS.  SO ONE REPLACEMENT IS  INAPPLICABLE IN A FEW YEARS TO   KIDS OF A FEW YEARS OLD. AND THE OTHER IS INAPPLICABLE  TO THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES  THAT DON'T ITEMIZE THEIR   DEDUCTIONS.  BUT EVEN IF IT IS APPLICABLE TO  YOU, YOU'RE LOSING, FOR A  FAMILY OF FIVE, $2,100 ROUGHLY,  AND WHAT ABOUT A FAMILY OF SIX,  A FAMILY OF SEVEN, A FAMILY OF   EIGHT, ANOTHER $4,150 PER CHILD  .  AND THEY REPLACE IT WITH AN  INCREASE IN THE STANDARD   DEDUCTION OF $1,200 AND A PER  CHILD CREDIT OF $600 OR $300 OR  ABSOLUTELY ZERO. IF YOUR KIDS ARE OVER AGE 16   AND IT'S A FEW YEARS FROM NOW. NEXT, LET'S TALK ABOUT MOVING  EXPENSES.  THE CURRENT CODE IS A THAT   YOU'RE WORK AT FACTORY AND IT  CLOSES DOWN AND IT'S MOVING,   100 MILES 3RKS00 MILES AWAY,   AND YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR HOME,  YOU HAVE TO FIND A NEW HOME TO   LIVE IN, YOU GET TO DEDUCT YOUR  MOVING EXPENSES. THEY TAKE THAT AWAY. BUT WHAT DO THEY SFLEEVE IF YOU  OWN A FACTORY AND YOU SHUT IT  DOWN AND YOU TO MOVE TO CHINA,   ALL OF THE MOVING EXPENSES ARE   TAX DEDUCTIBLE.  SO DON'T LET THEM TELL YOU   THEY'RE TAKING AWAY THE MOVING   EXPENSE DEDUCTION. SURE, THEY'RE TAKING IT AWAY   FROM INDIVIDUALS.  AND EMPLOYEES. BUT THEY ARE LEAVING THE MOVING  TAX DEDUCTION FOR THOSE WHO ARE  MOVING THEIR FACTORIES TO  CHINA. AND OF COURSE THEY TAKE AWAY   THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT INTEREST   DEDUCTION. SO IF YOU ARE INVESTING IN   YOURSELF OR IN A FAMILY MEMBER,  EDUCATION, THE INTEREST  DEDUCTION WIPED OFF YOUR TAX   RETURN.  BUT IF YOU'RE INVESTING IN A   CHINESE FACTORY, THE DEDUCTIONS  ARE THERE FOR YOU. SO THEY'RE NOT ANTI-INVESTMENT.  THEY'RE JUST ANTI-INVESTMENT IN  THE SKILLS AND CAPACITIES OF   AMERICAN WORKERS.  NEXT IS THE MEDICAL DEDUCTION.  NEXT IS THE MEDICAL DEDUCTION. IT'S AVAILABLE ONLY TO FAMILIES  WITH LARGE MEDICAL NEEDS.  BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THE  MEDICAL DEDUCTION UNLESS YOUR  UNRURMED MEDICAL EXPENSES AND  THANKS TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE  ACT, AT LEAST MOST PEOPLE HAVE   DECENT INSURANCE, BUT YOU STILL  HAVE MEDICAL EXPENSES THAT ARE   OUT OF POCKET. IF THEY EXCEED 10% OF YOUR   INCOME, TO THE EXTENT OF THAT,   YOU CAN TAKE A DEDUCTION.  IF IT IS 13% OF YOUR INCOME, YOU CAN DEDUCT THE 3%. THAT'S NOT OVERLY GENEROUS.  IT'S NOT EVEN APPLICABLE TO MOST FAMILIES WHO NEED IT.  WHO NEEDS IT?  PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES,  FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WITH  SPECIAL NEEDS, PEOPLE WITH   CANCER.  THAT'S WHO THEY TARGET.  AND THEY SAY, WELL, IF YOU MAKE  SOME MONEY AND THEN YOU HAVE TO  SPEND IT DEALING WITH MEDICAL  SERVICES, DEALING WITH THERAPIES FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN, FOR  DISABLED, FOR CANCER, WELL JUST  BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE YOU HAD TO SPEND IT ON   MEDICAL SERVICES, WE WILL TAX  YOU ON THE MONEY.  AND THEY DO. THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE  WHO ARE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE   EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES AND THAT  IS CASUALTY LOSSES.  IF YOU HAVE A SMALL FIRE OR SOME SMALL CASUALTY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A DEDUCTION.  THE DEDUCTION APPLIES WHEN YOUR  CASUALTY LOSSES EXCEED 10% OF  YOUR INCOME AND THEN ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY EXCEED 10% OF   YOUR INCOME. WE HAVE HAD THE WILDFIRES IN MY  STATE OF CALIFORNIA, NOT TO  MENTION THE HURRICANES IN THE  CARIBBEAN AND THERE ARE PEOPLE   WHO ARE GOING TO SAY, WELL,  THANK GOD IF THE DISASTER HAD TO HIT US IT HAPPENED IN 2017   BECAUSE OUR CASUALTY LOSSES ARE  DEDUCTIBLE.  WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT DISASTER?  PEOPLE WITH UNINSURED OUT OF   POCKET LOSSES EXCEEDING 10% OF   THEIR INCOME WILL NOT GET AN A   DEDUCTION. IF THERE IS AN ENORMOUS DISASTER AND THE CNN CAMERAS ARE THERE  THEN YOUR REPRESENTATIVE CAN   COME AND ASK FOR A SPECIAL TAX   RULE.  FIRST, WHAT IF YOUR HOME BURNS   DOWN AND CNN ISN'T THERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF AN ENORMOUS   DISASTER BUT JUST SOMETHING THAT HITS YOU AND A COUPLE OF   NEIGHBORS. YOU'LL NEVER GET A SPECIAL TAX   PROVISION. YOU AREN'T GOING TO WRITE ONE  FOR THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE, 30 OR  40 PEOPLE OR 80, 90 PEOPLE   AFFECTED BY A SMALL BRUSHFIRE,   BUT WHAT IF YOU ARE PART OF THE  NEXT ENORMOUS CATASTROPHE, YOUR  CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION WILL BE HERE HAVING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO BARGAIN TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO  TAKE THE SAME DEDUCTION THAT'S   BEEN IN THE CODES SINCE THE  1950'S OR WHETHER TO BARGAIN TO  TRY TO GET DISASTER RELIEF TO  REREBILLED THE -- REBUILD THE  INFRASTRUCTURE.  SO WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?  IT IS CLEARLY WRONG AND UNFAIR   TO TAX PEOPLE ON THAT PORTION OF THEIR INCOME THAT THEY HAVE TO   USE TO DEAL WITH IN A TRULY  EXTRAORDINARY CASUALTY LOSS. AGH, THERE IS ANOTHER PROVISION  THAT HASN'T BEEN TALKED ABOUT  MUCH AND THAT IS THE WAY THEY  INDEX CODE PROVISIONS FOR  INFLATION. THERE'S SOME OF THE PROVISIONS   THEY DON'T INDEX AT ALL. SO THEY SAY, WELL, YOU CAN TAKE  YOUR PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION AND  ITEMIZE IT, ONLY THE PORTION UP  TO $10,000.  THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MONEY, BUT  THEY DON'T INDEX IT. SO WHAT ABOUT 10 YEARS FROM NOW, WHAT ABOUT 20 YEARS FROM NOW?  YOU SAY I WON'T BE IN MY HOUSE   20 YEARS FROM NOW BUT THE PERSON YOU SELL YOUR HOUSE TO WILL BE   THERE. AND IF THEY SAY, MY GOD, ALL THE PRICES ARE HIGHER, THE WAGES ARE HIGHER AND TAXES ARE HIGHER,   THAT $10,000 LIMIT IS THAT I   CAN'T DEDUCT HALF OF MY PROPERTY TAX BILL.  THAT WILL BE FACTORED INTO THE   PRICE OF YOUR HOUSE. SO AS TO THE THINGS AFFECTING  HOME OWNERSHIP, NO INDEXING,   EVERYTHING LOOKS BIG NOW GETS  SMALLER AND SMALLER EVERY YEAR   AS A RESULT OF INFLATION.  AND THIS TAX BILL IS GOING TO  CAUSE MORE INFLATION AND THERE   ARE OTHER PROVISIONS WHERE THEY  SEE THEY ARE KEEPING THE   INDEXING BUT CHANGE FROM C.P.I.  INDEXING TO CHAIN INDEXING.  IT'S A SYSTEM FOR INDEXING THE   BRACKETS LESS THAN WOULD BE IF   YOU JUST LOOK AT THE CONSUMER  PRICE INDEX. SO YOU SAY, WELL, I'M ONLY GOING TO BE IN THE 25% BRACKET UNDER   THIS BILL. AND AS I GET RAISES TO   COMPENSATE ME FOR INFLATION, I   WILL BE IN THE 25%.  NO, YOU WON'T, BECAUSE IF YOU  ARE FORTUNATE, YOUR EMPLOYER   WILL ADJUST YOUR WAGES FOR REAL  INFLATION, BUT THE BRACKETS ARE  ONLY GOING TO INCREASE FOR   CHAINED C.P.I. WE TAKE AWAY THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. FIRST, THIS IS A DEPARTURE AS  OTHER PROVISIONS ARE FROM THE  CONCEPT THAT WE SHOULD TAX   PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. IF YOU MAKE A CERTAIN SALARY AND 10% OF IT IS TAKEN OUT AND USED  BY YOUR LOCAL AND STATE  GOVERNMENTS, THEN YOUR ABILITY   TO PAY IS THE 90% OF YOUR SALARY YOU GET TO KEEP. BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO TAX YOU   ON WHAT YOU KEEP AFTER STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, THEY WANT TO TAX  YOU ON THE MONEY THAT HAS  ALREADY BEEN SPENT ON TAXES. THE EFFECT OF THIS IS NOT JUST   ON THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE GOING TO LOSE A TAX  DEDUCTION ON THEIR RETURN AND BE TAXED UNFAIRLY.  THE RIGHT-WING THINK TANKS SAY   WE KNOW WHY. THAT WILL CREATE A POLITICAL   ATMOSPHERE WHERE STATES LIKE   CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK AND NEW  JERSEY WILL SLASH THE AMOUNT OF  MONEY THAT THEY SPEND ON THINGS  LIKE PUBLIC SERVICE, PUBLIC  SAFETY AND EDUCATION.  AND SO WE WON'T JUST BE  AFFECTING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT TAKING THE TAX DEDUCTION, WE   WILL BE TURNING TO LOWER   FAMILIES AND MIDDLE-CLASS  FAMILIES WHO DEPEND UPON PUBLIC  SCHOOLS AND WILL JUST CAUSE A  POLITICAL SITUATION WHERE LESS   MONEY IS SPENT ON LOCAL  EDUCATION. SO THIS JUST DOESN'T AFFECT  THOSE THAT AFFECTS THEIR TAX   RETURN BUT AFFECTS EVERYONE WHO  LIVES IN THE COMMUNITY.  NOW, AS I HAVE ALLUDED TO  BEFORE, TAKE AWAY A BIG CHUNK OF THE HOME MORTGAGE DEDUCTION,   PARTICULARLY THE PERSON YOU SELL YOUR HOUSE TO LATER. SO IF YOU SELL YOUR HOUSE AND  GOT KNOWS WHAT THE INFLATION   RATE MAY BE, IT MAY BE   SIGNIFICANT, IT MAY BE $500,000, DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT OF  MONEY THEN BUT SOUNDS LIKE   $500,000 IS NOW. SO ANY WAY THE HOME MORTGAGE   DEDUCTION LIMITED FOR THAT BUYER TO $500,000 OF MORTGAGE AND THE  PROPERTY TAX LIMITED TO $10,000  OF PROPERTY TAX. WHAT EFFECT IS THIS GOING TO   HAVE ON THE ABILITY TO SELL YOUR HOME WHICH IN MANY PARTS OF THE  COUNGET TRY ARE YOUR HOME NEST   EGG. PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE EQUITY IN THEIR HOME AND MAYBE THEY CAN RETIRE BECAUSE THEY HAVE 25%   EQUITY IN THEIR HOME.  YESTERDAY BEFORE THE FINANCIAL   SERVICES COMMITTEE, WE HAD   TESTIFYING MARK ZANDI, ONE OF  THE LEADING ECONOMIST, WHO IS  HEAD OF THE ECONOMICS OPERATION  AT MOODY'S.  AND HE SAID IN MAJOR METRO AREAS LIKE THE ONE I REPRESENT ARE   GOING TO SEE A DOUBLE-DIGIT  DECLINE IN HOME VALUES AS A  RESULT OF THIS BILL. A LOT OF THAT IS THE LIMIT ON  HOME MORTGAGE DEDUCTION AND THE  PROPERTY TAX.  THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS IN THIS BILL THAT ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT  HOME PRICES, DOUBLE-DIGIT  DECLINE. AND WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE   COMMUNITY? YOU MAY SAY I DON'T OWN A HOME,  I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT, WHO IS   GOING TO COME TO THAT RESTAURANT AND HOW BIG ARE THEY GOING TO  TIP IF THEY JUST BEEN TOLD, GO   TO ZILLO AND SEE THE VALUE OF  THEIR HOME AND SEE A   DOUBLE-DIGIT DECLINE.  THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. AND SO WHETHER -- THIS AFFECTS   FOLKS FROM THE NEW YORK METRO  AREA, PHILLY METRO AREA, LOS   ANGELES, SAN DIEGO, ORANGE   COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA.  YOU ARE SUCKING MONEY OUT OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND GIVING IT TO   THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY TAKING AWAY THE STATE AND LOCAL   PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION.  YOU ARE THEN SLASHING THE VALUE  OF HOMES, DOUBLE-DIGIT DECLINE,  WHAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE IN   CIRCULATION TO SUPPORT THE   ENTIRE REGIONAL COMMUNITY? THIS IS GOING TO HIT LIKE A  HURRICANE EVEN IN AREAS OF THE   COUNTRY THAT DID NOT EXPERIENCE  A HURRICANE. NOW, MY PARTY IS SO FOCUSED ON   THE GREAT UNFAIRNESS OF THIS   BILL.  THE FACT THAT IT PROVIDES THE  BULK OF ITS BENEFITS TO THE TOP  5%, EVEN THE TOP 1%. AND THAT FACT IS HIDDEN BY THE   ANOMALY THAT MOST OF THE   ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS OF THIS   BILL DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THE  REPEAL OF THE ESTATE TAX.  THEY ONLY LOOK AT THE INCOME TAX PROVISIONS.  YOU CAN'T EXCLUDE A WHOLE CHUNK  OF THIS TAX BILL AND ANALYZE IT. BUT WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE HUGE   UNFAIRNESSES THAT WE ALMOST  DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE   EFFECT IT WILL HAVE ON THE   OVERALL NATIONAL ECONOMY.  THIS ISN'T JUST AN UNFAIR BILL   OR ENRICHES THE RICH, THIS IS A  DEFICIT EXPLODING, OUTSOURCE   PROMOTING, JOB-KILLING,  GROWTH-REDUCING DISASTER FOR OUR NATION'S ECONOMY.  NOW, YOU WANT TO KNOW THE EFFECT OF HUGE TAX CUTS ON AN ECONOMY?  LOOK AT KANSAS.  THEY SLASHED THEIR TAXES.  AND NOW A REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE IS REVERSING IT BECAUSE OF WHAT  THAT HAS DONE TO TAX RECEIPTS  AND TO THE KANSAS ECONOMY. BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AND SEE  WHAT EFFECT THIS IS LIKELY TO  HAVE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL.  I TURN TO THE CENTER FOR ON  BUDGET AND POLICY PRIORITIES,  WHERE THEY SAY THAT THIS TAX CUT IS AN INEFFECTIVE WAY TO SPUR  ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IS LIKELY TO HARM THE ECONOMY IF IT ADDS TO   THE DEFICIT. WELL, WHAT'S THE PLAN IN THE   BUDGET REPUBLICANS ALL VOTED   FOR? TO DELIBERATELY USE THIS TAX CUT TO INCREASE THE DEFICIT BY $1.5  TRILLION.  BUT THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET   OFFICE UNDER REPUBLICAN  ADMINISTRATION OF THIS HOUSE AND THIS CONGRESS SAYS IT IS GOING   TO DO $1.7 TRILLION. BUT THEY SAY, WELL LET'S LOOK AT IT MORE DYNAMICICALLY. IT WILL INCREASE THE DEFICIT BY  $2 TRILLION BECAUSE IT RAISES  INTEREST RATES AND ENCOURAGES  OFFSHORE INVESTMENT STRIPPING  ECONOMIC GROWTH OUT OF THE   UNITED STATES AND FOR A HOST OF  REASONS I'LL GET TO. THE MORE YOU LOOK AT THE TAX   CUT, THE MORE APPARENT IT IS   THAT IT WILL CUT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INCREASE THE DEFICIT EVEN  MORE THAN THE $1.7 TRILLION THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE  DURING REPUBLICAN CONTROL OF   CONGRESS, THE CONGRESSIONAL  BUDGET OFFICE IS CURRENTLY   ESTIMATING.  WHY IS THIS? WELL, FIRST, BECAUSE INCENTIVES  TO INVEST IN THE TAX CODE HAVE   LITTLE OR NO EFFECT ON PRIVATE   SAVINGS, ACCORDING TO A  CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE   REPORT.  BECAUSE THE IMPERICAL EVIDENCE   AND NUMEROUS REPORTS SHOWS THAT  THE 2003 TAX CUTS HAD LITTLE   IMPACT ON INVESTMENT OR  EMPLOYMENT.  NOW I SPEAK WITH A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE HERE BECAUSE I LIVED  20 YEARS OF MY LIFE IN THE TAX   WORLD. MOST OF IT RIGHT AT THE  INTERSECTION OF INVESTMENT AND   TAX LAW.  I SAT WITH FAMILIES AND CHARGED  THEM A LARGE AMOUNT PER HOUR TO  DESCRIBE WHAT THE LATEST TAX   LAW SAID AND WHAT INVESTMENTS  -- WHAT EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ON  DIFFERENT INVESTMENTS. AND MY EXPERIENCE AS A C.P.A.  AND TAX ATTORNEY AND CERTIFIED   TAX LAW SPECIALIST BY MY STATE   BAR WAS IDENTICAL TO THAT OF   WARREN BUFFETT.  WHO SAID, I'VE WORKED WITH   INVESTORS FOR 60 YEARS AND I   HAVE YET TO SEE ANYONE, NOT  EVEN WHEN CAPITAL GAINS RATES  WERE AT 39.9%, OR WHEN THEY  WERE 15% AS THEY ARE NOW, I'VE   NEVER SEEN ANYONE SHY AWAY FROM  A SENSIBLE INVESTMENT BECAUSE  THE TAX RATE ON THE TO --  BECAUSE OF THE TAX RATE ON THE   POTENTIAL GAIN.  PEOPLE INVEST TO MAKE MONEY AND  POTENTIAL TAXES HAVE NEVER   SCARED THEM OFF. NOW, THAT IS WHY WHEN YOU LOOK   AT THE EFFECT OF THIS BILL, YOU  COME TO THE CONCLUSION, AS THE   CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DID  IN LOOKING AT THE BUSH TAX   CUTS, AND WHETHER TO EXTEND  THEM OR ALLOW THEM TO EXPIRE,  THAT IF YOU HAVE TAXES AND YOU   USE THAT MONEY TO PAY THE  DEFICIT, THAT DOES MORE TO HELP  THE ECONOMY, IT IS MORE  IMPORTANT TO FIGHT THE DEFICIT   THAN IT IS TO TELL VARIOUS   FAMILIES, OFTEN AT THE VERY  HIGH END, THAT THEY GET A TAX  CUT. WELL, LET'S LOOK AT AMERICAN   ECONOMIC HISTORY.  I'VE DESIGNED THIS CHART HERE  AND I FOCUSED ONLY AFTER THE   1986 TAX CUT FOR WHICH RONALD  REAGAN IS FAMOUS.  THERE WERE MANY THINGS ABOUT   OUR ECONOMY BACK IN THE EARLY  1980'S AND THE 1970'S AND  1960'S THAT AREN'T RELEVANT  TODAY. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TRADE   POLICIES BACK IN THE 1970'S  THAT WE HAVE TODAY.  SO WE LOOK AT THE 19 -- THE  RONALD REAGAN 1986 TAX POLICY  AS SLIGHTLY ADJUSTED BY GEORGE   H.W. BUSH. WE LOOK AT THE POLICIES THAT WE  HAD -- I KNOW THE 1986 TAX LAW,  YOU'D THINK, WELL, THAT MUST   HAVE AFFECTED 1986.  NO, IT REALLY BECAME EFFECTIVE   IN 1988. SO YOU LOOK AT 1998 -- 1988 TO   2003 AND WE HAD AN ECONOMIC  ECONOMIC GROWTH. THEN IN 1994 YOU SEE THE EFFECT  OF THE CLINTON TAX POLICIES  ADOPTED IN 1993. AND WE SEE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF  WELL OVER 4%.  AND THESE FIGURES HERE ARE REAL  ECONOMIC GROWTH PER YEAR,  ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION.  4.4%.  SO THEN GEORGE W. BUSH GETS  ELECTED AND STARTING IN 2001,  HIS TAX POLICIES ARE ADOPTED BY  THIS CONGRESS AND ENACTED INTO   LAW. AND WE SEE THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH  IS ONLY 1.7%.  NOW, THOSE BUSH TAX POLICIES   CONTINUE ENFORCE UNTIL 2013  BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ALLOWED THEM   TO STAY IN FORCE.  UNTIL WE FINALLY ADOPTED OBAMA   TAX POLICIES EFFECTIVE IN 2013.  THOSE POLICIES CONTINUE TO BE  ENFORCED RIGHT UP TO TODAY.  AND THE MOST RECENT STATISTICS   WE HAVE ARE UP THROUGH   SEPTEMBER 30 OF THIS YEAR. THE ECONOMIC GROWTH UNDER THOSE  POLICIES HAS BEEN 2.22%. SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE IS THAT  WHEN WE ADOPT REPUBLICAN   ECONOMIC POLICIES, AND THEY  BECOME EFFECTIVE, WE HAVE  SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER ECONOMIC   GROWTH THAN WHEN WE ADOPT  DEMOCRATIC TAX POLICIES AND  WHEN DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY PASS   THOSE POLICIES AND HAVE THE  GUTS TO PASS THOSE POLICIES AND  PUT THEM INTO LAW. SO, YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIRE THE   REPUBLICAN PARTY.  THEY'RE ABLE TO GET MEMBER   AFTER MEMBER AFTER MEMBER TO   SAY WITHOUT ANY PROOF THAT   TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS WORKS,  THAT IF YOU JUST CUT TAXES, YOU  SOMEHOW HELP THE ECONOMY.  IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU CAN   LINE UP 100 MEMBERS TO SAY THE   SAME FALSEHOOD AT THE SAME   LECTERN IN THE SAME  CONGRESSIONAL HALL.  ON THE SAME HOUSE FLOOR. WHAT MATTERS IS THE REAL   HISTORY AND THE REAL HISTORY IS  THAT THE HIGHER RATES IMPOSED  UNDER DEMOCRATIC   ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE NOT JUST  LED TO HIGHER TAX REVENUES,  THEY'VE LED TO HIGHER RATES OF   ECONOMIC GROWTH. WHY IS THIS? FIRST AND PERHAPS MOST   IMPORTANT, IS HAVING MONEY   AVAILABLE FOR BUSINESS   INVESTMENT.  THERE'S A POOL OF SAVINGS  CAPITAL AVAILABLE IN OUR   MARKETS AND IN OUR ECONOMY.  AND THE REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL  WOULD COME IN AND SCOOP $1.2   TRILLION OF THAT, TAKE IT OUT  OF THE MARKETS, TAKE IT OUT OF   THE BANKS WHERE IT COULD BE  LENT TO SMALL BUSINESSES, TAKE   IT OUT OF THE BOND MARKETS   WHERE IT CAN BE USED FOR   EXPANSIONS BY BIG BUSINESS, AND  JUST USE IT TO PAY FOR THE TAX   CUTS.  NO WONDER TAX CUTS THAT  INCREASE DEFICITS HURT BUSINESS  INVESTMENT AND HURT THE  ECONOMY. BUT THERE'S MORE.  WE THEN ADD TO OUR NATIONAL  DEBT AND THE NATIONAL DEBT IS  FOREVER. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE  INCREASE IN THE DEBT OF $1.5   TRILLION TO $1.7 TRILLION, BUT   THAT DEBT WILL BE HERE NOT JUST  10 YEARS FROM NOW, IT'S THERE  FOREVER. YOUR GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN ARE   GOING TO BE PAYING INTEREST ON   THAT DEBT. BUT THEN WE HAVE THE   INTERNATIONAL IMPACT.  YOU SEE, THEY'RE PROPOSAL  PROVIDES FOR -- THEIR PROPOSAL   PROVIDES FOR A ZERO PERCENT  TAX, ZERO PERCENT U.S. TAX, ON   ANY MONEY MADE BY ANY FACTORY  AS LONG AS YOU MOVE THAT   FACTORY ABROAD.  AND IF THE WAGE RATES ARE TOO  HIGH IN CHINA, YOU CAN PUT IT  IN VIETNAM.  NOW, THEY DO, IN ADDITION TO   SAYING YOU MOVE YOUR FACTORY   ABROAD YOU PAY ZERO TAX ON ALL   THE MANUFACTURING PROFITS, BUT   BECAUSE THAT MANUFACTURING IS  BEING DONE ABROAD. SO WE ENCOURAGE MOVING THE   FACTORY ABROAD.  THE WORK IS BEING DONE ABROAD. WE DON'T TAX IT. BUT IN ADDITION, WHAT IS AN  AREA OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WHERE  AMERICANS EXCEL? IT IS THE CREATION OF  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WHILE THE MANUFACTURING MIGHT  BE DONE ABROAD, THE DESIGN, THE  PATENTS, THE COPYRIGHT, THE  TRADE NAMES, THE MARKETING   PLANS, THE TRADE SECRETS, THE  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS   CREATED HERE.  BUT UNDER THIS BILL, NOT ONLY  THE PROFIT YOU MAKE ON THE   FOREIGN FACTORY, BUT THE PROFIT  YOU MAKE FROM ALL THAT   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CAN PAY  ALMOST STEERO PERCENT AMERICAN   TAX IF -- ZERO PERCENT AMERICAN  TAX IF YOU JUST TAKE THAT  PATENT AND PUT IT IN A FILE IN   THE CAIMAN ISLANDS.  NOW, I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT  OUR CURRENT SYSTEM FOR TAXING  INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS IS  ANYTHING THAT WE CAN BE PROUD  OF.  THE PRESENT SYSTEM, IF YOU MAKE  MONEY IN THAT -- IN A U.S.   FACTORY, AS A TASKS 35%, YOU   MAKE IT IN A FOREIGN FACTORY,  WE ALSO HAVE A TAX 356%, BUT   YOU CAN DEFER IT.  SO RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE JUST  TRYING TO DECIDE WHERE TO PUT  THE FACTORY, YOU'VE GOT A TAX  IN THE UNITED STATES THAT YOU  ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY, AND A TAX  ON A FACTORY ABROAD THAT YOU'LL  PAY EVENTUALLY.  WELL, WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY TAKE THAT 35% EVENTUALLY  TAX AND TURN IT INTO A ZERO  PERCENT FOREVER TAX. HOW MUCH MORE INCENTIVE COULD  THEY PROVIDE TO MOVE AMERICAN  FACTORIES OVERSEAS?  NOW, THE PRESENT SYSTEM ALSO   HAS A PROBLEM IN THAT YOU CAN  DEFER TAX ONLY ON THE MONEY YOU  KEEP OFFSHORE. SO THEIR SOLUTION IS TO SAY,   WELL, BRING IT ONSHORE, WE'LL  PROVIDE A LITTLE TINY TAX ON IT  AND THEN ALL THE MONEY YOU'VE  MADE OVERSEAS THE LAST 10 OR 20  YEARS, NO U.S. TAX.  AND AT LEAST THE MONEY GETS  REPATRIATED. DEMOCRATS ARE ANXIOUS TO WORK  WITH REPUBLICANS ON  REPATRIATION.  THEY CAN PROBABLY GET A MORE   REPUBLICAN PLAN ADOPTED THAN   ONE THAT I WOULD ENDORSE IN  THIS SPEECH. BUT WHY NOT TAX THE  UNREPATRIATED MONEY? THAT WAY WE WOULD BE SAYING,   BRING THAT MONEY BACK OR DON'T   BRING IT BACK. YOU PAY THE SAME TAX.  SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL BRING IT  BACK.  WHAT WE CAN ALSO DO IS MOVE TO   WORLDWIDE UNITARY  APPORTIONMENT. ELIMINATE ALL THE TAX GAINS,   AND MOST OF THEM ARE   INTERNATIONAL. ELIMINATE ALL THE REASONS TO   MOVE FACTORIES ABROAD. AND GENERATE ANOTHER TRILLION  DOLLARS EVERY 10 YEARS FOR OUR   TREASURY.  THAT'S THE SYSTEM THAT WE OUGHT  TO BE MOVING TO. I'M NOT HERE TO SAY OUR PRESENT  SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL. I'M HERE TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD   NOT ADOPT A REPUBLICAN SYSTEM  BECAUSE IT MOVES US EVEN   FURTHER AWAY FROM WHAT WOULD BE  A FAIR SYSTEM THAT WOULD NOT   ENCOURAGE OFFSHORING.  ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH WE'RE   AFFECTED INTERNATIONALLY IS  THAT THIS TAX BILL WOULD CHANGE  CURRENCY VALUES. CHANGE THE EXCHANGE RATE   BETWEEN THE EURO, THE YEN, THE   CHINESE CURRENCY, AND OTHER  CURRENCIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN A WAY THAT WILL ENCOURAGE   AMERICANS TO IMPORT AND  DISCOURAGE THOSE ABROAD FROM   BUYING OUR PRODUCTS. JUST ANOTHER ECONOMIC HARM.  ANOTHER ECONOMIC HARM IS TOUTED  BY THE CONSERVATIVE SUPPORTERS   OF THIS POLICY.  THEY SAY THAT BY CUTTING TAXES,  WE'LL GET THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT AND STATE AND LOCAL   GOVERNMENTS TO SPEND LESS MONEY  ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND EDUCATION  .  IF YOU WANT TO ASK WHAT IS IT  THAT MAKES A COUNTRY WEALTHIER   THAN OTHERS, IT'S FIRST AND  FOREMOST THE EDUCATION OF ITS  WORKERS AND THEN, SECOND, THE  INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S AVAILABLE  TO PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY.  IN ADDITION, AS I MENTIONED  BEFORE, THEY'RE GOING TO CUT   THE VALUE OF HOMES NAGSEWIDE.  MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE --  NATIONWIDE.  MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE MAJOR   METROPOLITAN AREAS.  WHAT DOES THAT DO TO MIDDLE  CLASS SPENDING, WHICH DRIVES   OUR ECONOMY? IT DRIVES THAT MIDDLE CLASS  SPENDING DOWN. WHO'S GOING TO GO OUT TO A   RESTAURANT IF YOU JUST HAVE  BEEN TOLD THAT YOU'VE HAD A  DOUBLE-DIGIT DECLINE IN THE  VALUE OF YOUR HOME?  THIS BILL WILL ALSO CAUSE  HIGHER INTEREST RATES BECAUSE  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GOING   TO BE BORROWING ANOTHER  TRILLION AND A HALF TODAY 1.7  TRILLION.  -- TO $1.7 TRILLION. SO THERE IS A DIFFERENCE   BETWEEN ME AND MY PARTY  LEADERSHIP.  THEY SAY THAT THE MAIN REASON  TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL IS   THAT IT IS UNFAIR BY GIVING  HUGE TAX BREAKS TO THE TOP 1%  AND INCREASING TAXES FOR   MILLIONS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES. I SAY YOU SHOULD VOTE AGAINST  THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S A   DEFICIT-EXPOSING,  OUTSOURCING-PROMOTING,   JOB-KILLING, ECONOMIC  GROWTH-DEPRESSING BILL.  BUT I THINK WE'LL AGREE,   WHETHER YOU VOTE AGAINST THIS  BILL BECAUSE IT'S UNFAIR OR YOU  VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL BECAUSE   IT'S BAD FOR OUR ECONOMY, YOU  WILL BE PERFORMING AN IMPORTANT  SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY.  BUT LET ME NOT NEGLECT, LET ME   NOT NEGLECT THE FACT THAT IF   YOU VOTE THAT THE BILL ISN'T   TOTALLY WITHOUT BEING USEFUL TO  SOMEBODY.  IT WILL REDUCE TAXES FOR THE   DONALD TRUMP FAMILY BY OVER $1   BILLION. IN ESTATE TAX AND TENS OF  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INCOME  TAX. BUT MAYBE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR  YOU. LOOK AT WHAT IT WILL DO FOR THE  KOCH BROTHERS. FAR MORE THAN IT WILL DO FOR   THE TRUMP FAMILY.  SO IF THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU,   IF THAT'S THE RESULT YOU WANT  TO ACHIEVE, THEN VOTE FOR THE  BILL.  I THINK I WANT TO THANK THE  SPEAKER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO   SPEAK THIS LONG. AND I WILL HAVE A MOTION TO  MAKE AS SOON AS I FIND IT ON   THESE PAPERS OR JUST SAY THAT I  MOVE THAT THE -- I'VE BEEN   ASKED BY STAFF TO WAIT ONE   SECOND.

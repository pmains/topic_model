member of congress with connections to the u.s intelligence community says a terrorist attack near the olympic games could be imminent fox's doug lazader has that story this morning from washington this is a startling assertion from a member of congress who has recently been to sochi who thinks an attack could just be a matter of time the massive security buildup for the olympic games and the so-called ring of steel around sochi may not be enough to stop a terrorist attack i think there's a high degree the probability that that something is going to some something will detonate something will go off but i do think it's probably most likely to happen outside of the ring of steel in the olympic village texas congressman mike mccall the chair of the house homeland security committee says that's because never before have there been such specific threats to disrupt the games you have the leader of the chechen rebels omar of calling for attacks on the olympics calling for a tax on civilians including women and children and then zawahiri the al qaeda leader the lieutenant of bin laden now ford you know reinforcing that threat and so that that's a whole new ball game that makes i think these olympics are very very different he fears an attack outside the security zone similar to the ones that we saw in the run-up to the games that targeted a train station and a bus u.s officials and security teams are on the ground in sochi but there have been long-standing concerns about the level of cooperation between the u.s and russia that said we do not have an interest in embarrassing the russians we have exactly the same interests with with them when it comes to the security of everyone here in sochi so we're quite satisfied with the level of cooperation we have now satisfied now but u.s officials do say that that relationship has recently improved in washington doug lousader fox news

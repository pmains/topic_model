hey y'all okay some real talk remember when they said the adults were finally back in charge and that the party of science and the working class and compassion was back here's the thing none of it's true you're not the party of science if you believe that school should still be closed or that you should wear a mask after being fully vaccinated or that gender is a social construct or that the world ends in 12 years or even 100 for that matter and you're not the part of the working class if you think people should be paid not to work you propose job-killing policies where you show contempt for small businesses and then over regulate and over tax them will google and amazon cheer the demise of their competition you're not the party of compassion if you think girl athletes should compete against boys you think dignity of work should be replaced by dependents or you think massey legal immigration isn't deeply unfair to legal immigrants so no the adults aren't back adults don't laugh at a border crisis push woke social justice on our military received energy dominance to russia elections matter and we do need adults in charge we need leaders who understand that government is not your savior not your religion but your guarantor of natural rights american accomplishment is limitless when freedom is government's primary goal

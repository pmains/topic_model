in parts unknown new episodes Sundays at 9:00 on CNN all right president Donald Trump making it clear he wants a travel ban and he wants the original one the one that courts found targeting Muslims his staff scrambled to say the president's words don't count because they were on Twitter and thus not official now that is absurd and raises the question of why the president would do this why would he undermine his own White House message and how does this odd confusion affect governing let's ask Democratic congresswoman and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi it's good to have you with us there are a number of topics to discuss today but what do you make of what happened yesterday the big guns Kellyanne Conway Sebastian Gorka going out there and saying no no no those tweets from the president which took time and he was very clear about they don't count that's not policy he didn't mean it well I'd like to hear what he has to say about that I think frankly that what he's talking about is a disregard for the Constitution and this is what the courts are about this is about the balance of power and here he is saying even though the courts have rejected one or version or another of what he has put forth he's doubling down he does succeed in doing one thing keeping all the attention on him there's so many things we should be doing job creation and all the rest let's have that debate in the rest but it just keeps bringing attention to him why the tactic what do you think's going on to me we've never seen this before I mean you know the Obama managed administration had its problems had its problems with the media but the idea of the president going out of his way to undercut the spin of the White House is unusual well it is unusual but as I've said if you want a job at the White House know your blood type because you're going to get thrown overboard at some point were under discredited and you see that happening but I think they'll be interesting to see how he reacts to their reaction to him but he doesn't care it as long as we're talking about him good better and different the attention is not as for example where's your Johnsville it's six months into your chart where is your you've been elected what eight months ago any of them where is your job to that's what America the election was about about the future and now over time that is done John well you have some big issues coming up the the president actually tweeted this morning to the extent that accounts about his desire to meet with the big Republicans and get going on taxes and health care to get it right what is your understanding of the progress from what I hear from the Republicans that there is there hasn't been very much progress but he should be meeting with all of us if he wants to make progress because there are some anti governance elements in the House and the Congress that are just never going to be for anything unless it's so bad and that would be very harmful to American people that's the fight we have to make so two points of pushback in terms of the lack of progress the first one would be well if the Democrats weren't so obsessed with trying to impeach the president and pushing the Russian investigation beyond the proof you might be getting more things done on the governing side who says that I'm saying well they have a majority of the house they're the majority of the Senate they have the White House any day of the week but the Russia investigation is dominant for good and many political no I don't think so I think this is beyond politics Russians as Asians beyond politics and with the latest revelations you can see this is undermining our democracy our electoral system be actual hacker the hacking that the hacking the altering maybe and the dumping undermined our election so we should have an outside independent commission to study what that is we have tried to say this is critical infrastructure the Republicans have resisted that but we must the element mechanism of our elections right but the collusion argument which a lot of Democrats state as a fact like oh the collusion case there is no collusion yeah you don't haven't seen any proof it again I know the investigation is not over we don't know what evidence they have or don't have but is there some criticism for Democrats and seeming to want to force this to envision I think of the Democrats you see Adam Schiff you see senator Warner and others I think they're very measures what I've said to members the only thing that matters are the facts the facts and the law and that's what investigation will reveal to us I think we have to remove all doubt as to the impact of the Russians in our lives and I think it's important the American people to know what do the Russians have on Donald Trump politically financially personally that he is standing in the way of this legitimate investigation as to the Russian impact on our election and to prevent them but why do we have to have something on him why couldn't your own theory serve as a rationale which is he doesn't like it it's bad for him you guys keep talking about Russia it's a negative for him at Jade's his victory so he doesn't want it to go on that's why the American people have a right to know the truth and why would the Republicans stand in the way of the truth why can't we see his tax return but again we're talking about him what we should be doing is working on job creation in our country now to that point and we discussed this during the townhall the value remembering again listen again and it was a good night to have where people were able to address some of these concerns about the frustration let's say you're right and there is a vacuum of power manifested as progress right now on things that matter whether it's infrastructure jobs tax why not fill that void as Democrats and say we're not going to wait on him here is our jobs plan let's see what they here are fixes to the ACA so he doesn't have to pull the subsidies and tanked the current program in any way an expectation of a bill that isn't there yet well there's two tickets but the second point for the fact is is that the prep the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land the president should be honoring the law of the land and funding it and he is he is sabotaging it he shouldn't be doing that the most important thing that we can do is to make sure that the bill that the Republicans pass and have does not become the law of the land because 23 million people would lose their health insurance copper's premiums would go up benefits but if you don't have the votes should you just lie in wait as opposed to moving to try and get a compromise no we follow the lead of President Lincoln public sentiment is everything we're taking this to the public and the public is weighing in the public is what to see this the bill the first time it came up that the public is what's going to defeat it in the Senate in the form that that it passed the house so the it's really important that people see the distinction and the distinction is to keep the focus on that do we know how to improve the Affordable Care of course you think the president would have said let's sit down and do that first thing we can start with is is afford a prescription drug that classic readers can judge that it contributes more to the increased cost of medical care than anything we could have certainty in terms of the funding of the Affordable Care Act which the president has placed in doubt and when it's in doubt the insurance companies say we don't know how to set our rates or we have to set them higher because we don't know if we'll have the cost share and observed the uncertainty of that we have to address issues that relate to young people to attract more of them into it so there's there is a any bill that is passed Congress civil rights have Medicare Medicaid Social Security all of it should be subjected to scrutiny as to how it can be done better but if it's being sabotage that's at his doorstep and if the rates go up that's at his doorstep because he has not a bank the world the land representative Nancy Pelosi appreciate you being here we know that there's a lot of discuss we have the big testimony coming up on Thursday after it I'd love to get your thoughts that's right and let's just say the president has said he's not going to stand in the way of call me testifying I don't know if there'd be a bombshell but there'll be a door opening and I want to make sure that there's no executive privilege for many of people in his administration who could go through that door we'll see soon enough thank you for being with

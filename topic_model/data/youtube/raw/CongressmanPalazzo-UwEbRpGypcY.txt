Thank You mr. chairman mr. secretary thank you for coming back this year and join our conversation last year I want to start off by saying thank you we had you know and I want to echo the Chairman's comments on cotton and dairy and how you you committed to work with us and you have and as has the administration so thank you on that also I'd like to thank if your staff properly prepared you you probably already know the question I asked you before um I asked it because it's similar to the one from last year but I do want to revisit the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service catfish inspection program and there's pretty much two issues here first after our conversation from last year you know I was actually disappointed to see that same proposal to show up on page 48 again wanting to remove the catfish inspection from the USDA which is doing a phenomenal job when providing for our food safety and inspection and moving it back to the FDA which did a horrible job and I think and but I won't dwell on that just yet I'll give you an opportunity to speak but moving on the Vietnam and some faxes since 2016 the program has turned away hundreds of tons of imported catfish because they contain dangerous chemicals and drugs banned in the US I mean hundreds of tons they kept from our dinner tables here in America and and thanks to the food safety inspection services good work American consumers are have confidence that they're consuming safe and in quality food and so the 2008 farm bill moved you know basically put the food safety inspection of catfish to the USDA again in 2014 same bill it's been done under Democrat controlled Congress and presidents as well as republican-controlled Congress and presidents and see I think you get the point now two years later you know hundreds of millions of pounds of catfish rejections later the Vietnam has complained to the World Trade Organization that something Congress did in 2008 by law almost ten years ago is now unfair and because physis is requiring Vietnam to have food safety system at least equivalent to not the same but equivalent to the US they're saying that that's unfair I don't think it's unfair I think you know this argument between USDA and FDA is political but I think I know several of my colleagues on this committee in the past have agreed that they think the the catfish inspection programs should rightfully be in USDA where they're doing a phenomenal job and where FDA has not been able to have the same successful record that you've had and that the food safety is important to the American people so I'll allow you the opportunity to comment do you think you know requiring other countries that import foods into America to have at least equivalent safety inspections do you believe that to be fair well absolutely the silliness of the Vietnam case is that it's the same standards that we hold our domestic producers to and as you indicated this is going on for a while so the very fact that they would allege that we're treating them unfairly while we have to our own domestic producers both while caught and domestic for those same standards is that doesn't make any sense I don't think the case will go anywhere at all but it's important obviously you you made a statement that I don't think anyone can disagree with it food safety is is critically important it's one of the most important things that we do we take that very seriously I'm not sure about the FDA and there are several issues I think that we would like to address with the FDA over responsibilities going forward I appreciate that again you know the echo prior to the USDA taken over the inspections I'm assuming hundreds of tons of catfish we're actually making it on to the American consumers tables that contain dangerous chemicals that we do not want and we would not accept in the USDA once they took on the responsibility I guess they took it seriously they've done a fantastic job and and I think you know the American people would like to continue to see y'all do that in second so the the omnibus bill the f8 the fiscal year 18 omnibus bill provide ample funding for the food safety inspection service are you committed to ensuring that that money makes it way the food safety inspection services do you see any reason why it wouldn't comply with the law absolutely sir I think again we view food safety is one of those zero tolerance issues obviously USD has a lot of responsibility and making sure that the public not only gets safe food but perceives the food that their say is is under operating under safe conditions both those that we're importing and that it's locally domestically produced well mr. secretary thank you and we appreciate what USDA does for America mr. Chairman I yield back

Jackie joining us now from the other side of the owl Democratic congressman from Massachusetts a member of the House financial services and transportation and infrastructure committees Jake Akin Kloss he also serves on the new house select committee on China Congressman thank you for taking time we are obviously watching this spy balloon floating we have our most recent pictures you can see from North Carolina we believe it's moved from there we're working to get up a live shot from South Carolina where we have cameras we're not sure exactly where it's going it's been 24 hours since the Pentagon told us where exactly it is we're following that but Congressman let me ask you because uh Andy Barr is a colleague of yours now on this new China committee and he's talking about bipartisanship what are your thoughts as we watch this and track this balloon first and foremost the Chinese Communist Party should not be allowed to enter U.S airspace to break international law and certainly to surveil sensitive sites and there needs to be accountability for that and a proportionate response I agree with representative Barr that we need a sound strategy for competing with the Chinese Communist Party in the 21st century that rises above partisan politics that's why I'm excited as one of the youngest members of Congress as a veteran to be on the select committee on China so I can work with Democrats and Republicans to ensure that we out-compete the Chinese Communist party and and protect both American interests and project American values as a combat veteran Congressman you can appreciate this question we were told obviously by the Pentagon they didn't shoot it down over Montana because of the potential debris field which could have been hundreds of miles in the danger it could pose but if this balloon does now track in the coming hours over South Carolina and out over water they may have a shot that reduces casualties and collateral damage should they take it if they have it every Mission from when you're a second Lieutenant all the way up to when you're chairman of the Joint Chiefs is going to have an operational risk Matrix they're going to look at Force protection versus the objective of the mission and try to balance those two prerogatives and that seems to be what the Pentagon is doing right now they're looking at the imperative to protect civilians on the ground but also of course the necessity of Defending U.S airspace and preventing any surveillance by the Chinese Communist party I see no reason not to have confidence to date that the Pentagon is going to take action as appropriate to to resolve this situation is is bringing it down at some point appropriate uh provided that we can ensure that there's not going to be any civilian fatalities or any Force protection issues it's certainly within the rights of the United States to do that I'm not going to peer over their shoulder while they're in real time uh in real-time decision-making mode congress's role is oversight and every mission that the military does is going to have an after action and Congress is going to be a part of that for sure but I know that you know when I was out on patrol as a lieutenant or a captain uh the last thing you want is your decisions second guessed in real time and so until or unless they gave us any reason to to not have confidence in their actions uh I think they're doing the right thing and let's talk about the committee you're one of the leaders now on this uh new select China committee what does this incident now mean for that can we expect hearings what do you want to know it underscores the dysfunctionality of the relationship between the two uh largest most powerful nations in the world and we need to carve out a sophisticated sound strategy going forward there are areas where we're going to have to manage conflict on the South China Sea at the Taiwan Straits with their intrusion of U.S airspace there are areas where we're going to want to compete whether it's investments in in Africa and Latin America in the southeast Asia and there's areas where we may need to collaborate like with climate action and Global Public Health it is a nation of 1.4 1.4 billion people and it's going to require a nuance and thoughtfulness and I'm optimistic that this committee is up to the task and as we are showing our viewers uh pictures this is from earlier you're seeing on your screen next to Congressman knocking Claus but the picture now that's up is our live camera in Myrtle Beach the balloon has not entered there according to our team on the ground there but we believe there is a chance we could do it uh Congressman I want to ask you a little bit as we as we wait to see if it's going to go over there it's been as I mentioned 24 hours since the Pentagon gave us an update to the American people deserve a little more transparency in knowing where this balloon is yeah I mean I think when when a a foreign actor has aircraft over United States airspace the American people always deserve transparency and accountability and the Biden Administration to date has delivered a proportionate response and I expect them to continue to communicate with the American people I'd also just point out here that the the actor that looks weak and incompetent right now is actually the Chinese Communist party I mean the first rule of covert surveillance is don't get caught and second they can't even control this thing and are looking like they've got their hands up in the air saying we don't know what to do next this isn't a deeply unimpressive display of uh the projection of Power by the Chinese Communist party right now but are they are they potentially testing us to see what our response might be yeah I'm not going to try to get inside the head of the uh of the polyp Bureau right now what I will say though is uh the United States always needs to respond with strength as we have seen uh with President Trump's disastrous appeasement of Vladimir Putin it only invites aggression and when President Biden has stood up to Vladimir Putin in Ukraine we have seen that we can rally the West we can rally our East Asian allies and underscore the strength of American values and of American power Kirsten Jacob and Kloss thank you for your time as we continue to monitor this we appreciate it thank you much

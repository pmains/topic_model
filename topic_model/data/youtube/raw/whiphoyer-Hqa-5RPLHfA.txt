vil with Democratic congressman from Maryland and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer he joins us from statuary hall Steny our congressman thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us I know you've been tweeting about this calling it hashtag GOP tax scams so it's pretty clear where your intentions lay the House bill is kind of a draft as we were talking about since it will have to be reconciled with the Senate version the Senate version doesn't have a lot of room to spare because they can only afford to lose two votes there so from where you sit how much of a tax raised you believe we're going to see versus a tax cut well I think we're more likely to see a tax cut we certainly haven't seen tax reform at this point in time and it is interesting when you talk about the Senate the Senate voted on the House bill unlike the house where the Republicans voted for it this House bill in the Senate Finance Committee lost 26 to nothing not a single Republican senator voted for the House bill so they may have had a victory today but that was a Pyrrhic victory and in my opinion a loss for the American people that say this is a tax cut bill in point of fact it raises taxes on 36 million middle-income families working families in this country it explodes the deficit by 1.5 trillion dollars and the people are going to pay off that deficit our children so from that standpoint this is not a good bill it lost 26 to nothing in the Senate I hope it fails and very frankly if we do tax reform we ought to do it in a bipartisan fashion which is what we did in 1986 we all have hearings we all have witnesses that we all have the American public have an opportunity to come in and say how this is going to affect them this bill is not a good bill for America it's not a good bill for our citizens and when you give 50 percent of the benefits right there's a lot of talk a lot of talk about helping middle income people well if you took 1.5 trillion it borrowed that money and then you could put it on the table if you want to help middle-income Americans you give most of that money to men income America that's what happens so congressman it sounds like you do like the idea of giving a tax break to middle-income Americans given that approach is there anything about the House bill that was passed today that you like the House bill is a hodgepodge of cobbled together efforts but which primarily is focused on tax cuts for the wealthiest in America as I said on the floor I don't begrudge people being rich I think most of us want to be rich that's not the issue the issue is if you're going to take 1.5 trillion and distribute that which I frankly think we can't afford as a country but if you could do that now you ought to give it to the people you say you want to benefit not to the wealthiest in the country and that's what happens under this bill and very frankly analysts after analysts after analysts says this bill will not pay for itself it will explode the debt and future generations are going to be put deeply in the hole the problem here congressman is that the Republicans I think are viewing this is a need they must do this in order to secure the midterms and keep the House and the Senate when we get to the midterm elections next year I know you've said that you think the Republicans will actually lose the house when it comes to the midterms here but do you see their point and why don't you hold early this could lead to them losing the house and plaid you raised that issue because I think this bill was passed not for policy reasons not because it was good tax policy or good reform policy it was passed because the Republicans believe that if they don't pass this tax bill they're going to lose the next election my view is passing this tax bill will also lead to their losing the next election this is a bad bill it's bad for the middle class it's bad for the country it's bad for our children and hopefully it's going to be defeated but this was not passed on policy grounds very frankly we could have done a bipartisan bill we could have addressed the disparity in terms of the corporate rate with the rest of the world we could have brought that rate down as a matter of fact President Obama suggested three years ago in a State of the Union bringing that rate down we could have adjusted other taxes for the middle class for working people spur job creation but that's not what we did and not only did we not do that but we did it in a rushed because in my opinion the Republicans understand that this bill will not bear analysis that honest people who look at this bill have said it will not grow the economy it will explode the debt and middle-class people in many instances will get a tax hike congressman a quick question for you here and final question as well there's a lot of criticism that the Democratic Party needs a refresh here that you and Nancy Pelosi's some of the veterans represent the old guard and perhaps should retire to make room for new blood we've seen a lot of Republicans for instance retire or say that they're going to be retired how do you respond to that I think the young guard on the rush on the Republican side just passed a very bad bill the issue is not age it is policy it is how do you help people in America grow jobs and Make It in America and get a better deal well that's what we think we offer and we're going to continue to offer that and we think that will prevail thank you so much thanks to you a congressman Steny Hoyer House Minority Whip coming up we'll bring you an exclusive conversation with Forest City Ratner CEO Marianne Gilmartin her thoughts on how the Gio

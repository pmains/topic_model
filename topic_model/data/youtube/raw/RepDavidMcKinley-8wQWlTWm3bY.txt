uh and and welcome ms chang uh at the president's press conference on march 24th uh the president appointed kamala harris to quote lead the effort to stem the migration across our southern border close quote but in the last 77 days she's not visited the border anyone trying to solve this crisis involving unaccompanied minors without visiting the border is really like a doctor uh diagnosing a patient without examining them shang wouldn't it be helpful to you hhs and orr if vice president harris visited the border see yes or no this has been an all uh government yes or no please i've got three other questions i'd like to get to yes or no yeah to be we focus on acs mandate um and we are focused on doing what congress has asked us to do which is to care for the safety okay so i can reclaim my time i'm sorry you're not going to answer it uh under the trump administration the maximum number of unaccompanied minors reached 2600 and they were excoriated but as of june 2nd according to hhs there are now 17 000 unaccompanied minors under your care now rather than using a diplomatic approach to solve this crisis vice president harris is about politics blaming the influx on everything from the trump administration to climate change fortunately at a meeting with the guatemala president jim geometer he stated that the biden administration's policies giamante did he stated that the biden's administration policies were the ones to blame for this crisis and they were inviting migration including unaccompanied minors to our because of our open border policy so miss chang do you agree with president giamante that the president that the obama administration's policy may have contributed to this crisis involving minors what i can tell you sir is that i agree with the wisdom of congress when they implemented the law that says that hhs should be in charge of our humanitarian response to caring for vulnerable children you're not going to answer that again so thank you so then we have a third question uh saying the president of guatemala has claimed that many of the children that are brought here come from coyotes or human traffickers and would and should be classified as unaccompanied minors president obama and trump both use the fencing techniques that we've seen in the press to segregate our children and women from the men but that policy was widely criticized and stopped president biden appears to be reinstating that policy so but i'm curious if we could just role play for a minute if if for example if a 35 year old man brings a 30 a three-year-old child across the border and is apprehended he claims the child is his until that can be verified do you keep the two separated so we actually only care for unaccompanied children um is this child considered and i mean you don't know is is this child an unaccompanied minor with a 35 40 year old person how do we separate how do we make that determination and do it how long do we wait until we determine this child does not belong to that adult so i can only speak for acf and hhs's role which is to care for unaccompanied children who have been referred to us by dhs oh if i could then so if this child is ultimately determined not to be a father or a relative what i understand for your testimony they're placed in child care until they reach the age of 18. now after which i i'm trying to understand the mechanics then do you does do you go to that family and foster family that maybe the child's been there for seven or eight years and then extract that family extract that that person uh from the family and deport them so i'll try to answer that question as best i can sir um so for children who we cannot find a sponsor for but i will say uh we never did got a foster parent you know where they are they're they're in tulsa oklahoma uh they've been there they've been in your care now for five years six years do you go back when they're 18 and extract them out and deport them so there are certainly some children who age out of orr's custody again we care for children which means until they reach the age of 18 and whether that's in our care in custody or after we have placed them in a licensed provider or a long-term foster home it is possible and they are there until they reach age 18 or their asylum proceedings have concluded i'm sorry madam chairman that we didn't get the answers on that settlement science expired chairman recognizes ms schakowsky for five minutes

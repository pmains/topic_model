and chair and i recognize gentleman from west virginia mr mckinley for five minutes uh thank you mr chairman in light of some of the testimony that was has been given i'd like to yes unanimous consent that this article by dr borac be included in the file let me uh i'm sure we'll accept it but let me make sure the minority has taken a look at it and you can go ahead and we'll make that request i think what dr borac says in light of some of the comments have been made here is that um i think we've heard once again there seems to be a an attack on the coal industry in west virginia um i thought we were having a testament we were having a panel on modernization and how we work but this has turned into a little bit on part of some of the folks uh one more attack on our coal miners in the industry and what boracay was on his report said coal mining is not per se an independent risk factor for increased mortality in appalachia appalachians suffer disproportionately poor health and significantly higher mortality rates than the rest of the nation the appalachian counties with the poorest health were also the most economically depressed the least educated and those with limited access to social and medical services so to try to connect that to mountaintop mining is a stretch there may be a connection not going to just i'm not going to dispute that but i think we have to take other things into consideration uh smokeless tobacco i didn't say or or or tobacco use i didn't see that as a chart to see whether or not that i didn't see a chart about diabetes that could that be affecting health and cancer issues with that so i think we have to be fair when we're when we're doing these kinds of reports that we haven't tried to be more unbiased than what i've heard in this testimony so far also in in one in mr watson or dr wassen your report you you talked about the sports uh sports fishing industry creates more jobs in the surface surface coal mining maybe it does maybe it does but i'd say the coal mining jobs that are being paid 50 and 70 thousand dollars a year are far better than the sports fishermen and maybe in the 25 000 job uh if we're trying to if we're trying to get these people out of poverty we need to have good paying jobs and and for and once more an attack on the coal industry because we've got counties in west virginia and in eastern kentucky that just simply don't have other alternatives that's what they say they're economically depressed and to take away something that's a good paying job is is really a threat to their livelihood so i think we have to be careful about jumping to conclusions i wish they one of the proponents were here today to continue on with this discussion instead of skipping out um but but you also raised a good point uh dr yarmouth or dr wasson about yarmouth the armistice bill was is interesting and i hope it does get a hearing i think we need to have those kind of we can't be afraid in congress to talk about tough subjects but at the same time it was announced earlier today that we have 321 bills sitting over in the senate the other egg not being acted on so i would say that perhaps maybe that's a good trade if we're going to take up yarmouth's bill then maybe the the other body ought to take up some of the bills that we have sitting over there that have to do with jobs health care coal mining and the like but let me touch just close again with your issue about the fly ash because i think your group and some of the groups that you represent we're opposed to the flash bill that's passed out of the house four times it's one of those bills that's sitting over the 321 that's sitting over there in the senate without action it would have addressed all the problems that you've talked about all the leakage the flash bill the legislation the coal ash bill took care of impoundments it took care of dam safety it took care of water leakage all those issues were taken but yet groups that you are engaged with oppose the legislation i i i think it's hypocritical that you're coming here and telling us that we need to do it when we've done that we we've we passed that but the senate the other body won't take those bills up so um i i hope that you can be more fair in your assessment in the future all of you as we address these issues in modern day let's stay to the subject matter so are you telling me that that brandy huffman the dep is uncon he's incapable of handling issues in west virginia on dep i don't i do not in any way mean to impugn uh mr huffman and you've used that you use the the freedom industries tank you've talked about uh the the surface mining all those issues come under his purview and you're in you're you're you're denigrating you're running them down and i'm is that fair i'm saying the facts on the ground show that the the goal the out the environmental outcomes that we would expect are not being achieved the health of people county is he should he lose his job that is i i i do not have a position on on whether or not mr huffman should should have his job i am simply observing that if we look at just the science just the environmental outcomes that we see on the ground in west virginia they are not being achieved what we should expect when people in southern west virginia counties have the same life expectancy of somebody in iran or syria or vietnam that's that there's something wrong i i've run over my time but i'd sure like to see it because i i think that as a vietnamese at age 36 37 in vietnam i think the life expectancy is great much greater than 36 and 37 in southern west virginia and i'm sorry that i've run over my time gentlemen's times expired i did consult with the minority and without objection i had asked for the the article authored by jonathan borek to be accepted into the record without objection so ordered the chair now recognized general from texas mr greene for five minutes

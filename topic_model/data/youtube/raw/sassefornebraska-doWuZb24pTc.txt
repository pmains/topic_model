Donald Trump's biggest political enemy right now might not be any of the other Republican candidates instead it could be a first-term senator from about as far away as you can get culturally from New York City senior political correspondent Michael manual tells us who it is Ben Sasse is a first-term republican senator from Nebraska who was recruited to wrestle at Harvard and has a PhD from Yale sasses current personal mission appears to be waging a one-man fight against Donald Trump if he started to answer real questions and take seriously what his responsibilities would be in this office that would be a great thing I mean the president answers the phone at 3am in this in the Situation Room he doesn't answer it at the chuckle hut last week's ask traveled a neighboring Iowa to help candidates running against Trump like fellow senator marco rubio who paid tribute to SAS but you know ben is one of the he's just a new memory cannon with Joanie are in same class one of the strongest defenders of the Constitution I've ever met yet so far SAS hasn't endorsed Rubio or Senate colleague Ted Cruz the Republican Party is blessed with an embarrassment of riches we have a number of really good candidates we have a lot of people who believe in the Constitution and we need to be telling that story of what actually makes America great after the Iowa caucuses SAS took to Twitter drip Trump this is the headline by three-to-one margin Iowa ours reject real Donald Trump he should now answer real policy and executive power questions or exit the race SAS asked Trump on Twitter about bragging about his extramarital affairs which Trump called a cheap shot Trump fired back at SAS last week tweeting the great state of Nebraska can do much better than Ben Sasse as your senator saw him on Greta totally ineffective wants paid for politicians then Trump mocks asses appearance tweeting Ben Sasse looks more like a gym rat than a u.s. senator how the hell did he ever get elected SAS fired back thanks as the son of a football and wrestling coach this is high praise what voters in my state say is he should get serious or he should get out and I think both of those would be wonderful outcome the Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for comment as for SAS he waited a full year before delivering his maiden speech on the Senate floor then he ripped Congress were not tackling the generational crises we face sasses reputation on Capitol Hill is no nonsense Brett Mike Emanuel up on the hill Mike thanks

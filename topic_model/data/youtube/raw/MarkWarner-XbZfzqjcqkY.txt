this you know the thing that that is somewhat frustrating to me is this shouldn't be that hard you know finding a balance plan with some additional revenues some reform and some of our programs cutting some government spending four trillion dollars over a ten-year period we're not talking about doing this all tomorrow shouldn't be that hard this is not you know putting a man on the moon or defeating communism are starting the civil rights movement this should be kind of the basic requirement of any elected official that you hire at least at the federal level to at least put the country on a sustainable fiscal path we should say what listen to him or I think as a businessman before the politician you know he has a good idea and if everyone will work together maybe some of those ideas could be gearing out I feel a lot more optimistic I feel I feel like I have more more possible in order then you know people that are willing to kind of look at both sides eco suggesting the Democrat side inside I feel like we'll be in a lot better position than we are today

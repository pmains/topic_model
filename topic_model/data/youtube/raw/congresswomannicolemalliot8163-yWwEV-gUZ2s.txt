next thank you madam speaker i rise to pose the previous question so that we can immediately consider h.r 7809 the communities deserve cops act to get police back on the force and criminals off our streets police departments across the country are struggling to hire and retain new recruits to keep up with the pace of retirement and resignations officer morale has been decimated by anti-police rhetoric coming from politicians pro-crime policies that tie the hands of our police like the disastrous bail law of my state where perp arrested in the morning gets out of jail before the police officer even finishes his shift crime is america's in america cities is skyrocketing it's skyrocketing as a result of these policies an increase in ambush style attacks against our police have put our officers in harm's way both on and off duty in 2021 america saw the most law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty since 1995. an nypd officer they put their life on the line for forty six thousand dollars a year in my hometown department nypd has seen more than fifty seven hundred retirements over the last three years because politicians have made it impossible for them to do their job nationally retirements are up 45 percent and resignations are up 18 creating a dangerous situation in cities like mine that finish 2021 with the highest homicide rate in a decade the communities deserve cops act would allow law enforcement agencies to use federal grant dollars to offer hiring and retention bonuses to our police officers it would increase resources for our police at a time when too many politicians including those in this chamber are looking to strip away resources it's unfortunate that legislation like this even needs to be considered the endemic problems surrounding our police are a direct result of a systematic targeting of those who protect us by the progressive politicians earlier this congress i offered a resolution condemning calls 30 seconds earlier this congress i offered a resolution condemning calls to defund abolish or dismantle our police and guess what every one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted against it this is the problem when our police departments are understaffed and overworked congress must step up to provide them with the tools they need to effectively do their job in this year's federal budget i fought to get millions of dollars for the nypd k-9 unit forensic equipment and protective gear i urge my colleagues to now support this critically important piece of legislation to give out brave men and women in blue the respect and the support they need to do their jobs and keep our communities safe thank you and i yield back gentlemen for

so will Congress be able to put politics aside and finally pass comprehensive gun reform comprehensive a gun that a term that the president used here now to weigh in is congressman Roger Marshall thank you very much for joining us appreciate it good morning glad to be here so give us some I just begin with what you believe will happen today we're told that the president will have some sort of announcement later this afternoon on what he plans or what he wants do you know anything that will be included in that well I think you're seeing some of the same things I'm seeing but I just think was brilliant what he did yesterday I think this is just totally Trump being transparent I was just as exciting did he see him push people together and just to tell the American public this is the discussion going on so I think we're going to continue that discussion today and continue to talk about all the options out there yeah I found it interesting one of the things that you had to say I believe it was on your Twitter account you said after reflecting on the tragedy I can't help but think what if what if teachers coaches authorized personnel had the opportunity to carry concealed weapons on school grounds so that's one thing you agree with yeah absolutely so I just I do think that no matter what it looks like whatever system we set up there's going to be failures in it eventually and I think that there are people that know what they're doing they know how to handle a handgun and so if you have the proper training I'm okay with the letting teachers coaches but I really encourage every town to see what they can do to beef up their own security yeah and another thing I know that you find very important are background checks and mental health yeah as you as a physician I've seen this just explosion of mental illnesses and even hearing that now that 20 percent of our kids have a mental illness so you know what's going on with society that we're having mental illness issues in and certainly there's a lot of people out there that don't should not have guns that have mental illnesses yeah do you think it's really possible though for both sides to come together on this because another thing the president pointed out yesterday and it's true nothing's been done we haven't been able to get anything done up until this point I absolutely think we have to I don't think there's any choice but to get together and seeing both sides talk so fluently yesterday and so so transparent I think that's a step in the right direction we just passed a bipartisan Budget deal so I think that that's a good sign to America that we can get done yeah did it surprise you that what he had to say about the NRA oh you know not really I just have a different take on the NRA I think that that they bring something to the table and just to put my cards on the table I'm a lifetime member of the NRA as well but I think the I expect the NRA to lead on this issue I think that they'll have great ideas they know solutions that will work so I think that's just the president pushing back on the NRA saying you know you need to be part of the solution and not part of the problem everything it's very interesting just earlier in the show we had a debate between two people who are both members of the NRA and they both had very different perspectives on what needs to happen so a lot of viewpoints out there let's move on to this next topic though if we can a president Trump slamming Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his decision to use Inspector General to investigate the alleged FISA abuse by the Obama administration what do you think about all of this well you know I think this is just President Trump being transparent and I think he's so fed up with this process we've been investigating us for a year there's been really nothing conclusive or nothing that would suggest President Trump did anything wrong he's just ready to get on with it and I think this is I just very transparent president Trump and I think we all know you have to have some pretty thick skin to work for president Trump well and it's very interesting because President Trump issued or made the statement on Twitter and then you had the picture that appeared last night about this dinner between Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein another I think it was DOJ official at this high-end Steakhouse saying that this is definitely meant to be a message to President Trump in response to his tweet that's that's okay I'm just I think there's so many other more important issues going on in Congress right now like you know getting back to the gun control we have an app to deal that we're working on but these are just gamesmanship between two very powerful strong people and most congressmen are just letting it go rolled right off our backs okay well that's good to hear congressman Marshall thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate

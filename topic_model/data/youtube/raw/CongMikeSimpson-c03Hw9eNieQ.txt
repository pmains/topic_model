has or will the administration submit legislation for amending the energy policy act 2005 and will that include waste covers okay you first asked the question I thought you were referring to the part of the dealt with egfp well that and the way confidence issue okay so on the legislation as you know Congress minutes deals with ng MP has some verbiage in it that has has been kind of overtaken by events and we need to get together soon in the administration to propose legislation that would correct some of those issues I don't know of any discussion about weeds confidence and legislation related through needs to confidence so that question kind of takes me by surprise and I'd have to think I'd have to think about that I'll take a message back that we need to legislate waste confidence if we don't we're going to print a nuclear industry to standstill because we don't have a permanent geological repository you can't really say you got wasted office in the and the NRC is going to say oh I'm afraid I don't understand but I understand one other thing the defense authorization bill reduced the gpp of the general plant project limit from five from 10 million 25 million for NSA labs in 2011 we've supported a 10 million dollar limit in this committee because it is it actually gives more flexibility the labs to do some of the projects and I've seen the results of it out of 90 so some of the things that they've done do you support keeping the GPD limit at ten billion dollars for the non NSA mess I do support that and I believe under secretary cumin is there something similar board and emphasis on it slip in one last question one of the very important projects that you're working on one of the program's that's very important as a light water reactor sustainability program talk about the importance of that the importance to our energy future and what we hope to gain to that and what is our 2011 goals for this program if if we first if the existing sweep of 104 reactors if the vast majority of say a hundred have life life extender license extension for 60 years which seems like it's going to happen half of them already have been approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission then in a year 2029 the first of those will go off on like 60 year life will be over and the last one in 2050 so that's twenty percent of our electricity that will go offline release electricity a seventy percent of our green electricity will go off line most proposals or most predictions of gen 3 reactor deployment and even small modular reactor deployment it would be very difficult to make makeup that complete loss of existing fleet and so we think it's in the country's interests to to participate with industry on dealing with issues that the regulatory commission will ask if they were to ask for a further extension of further license extension out to let's say eight years and so they are Duke there are aging issues materials issues issues related to non-destructive evaluation how would you for example use instruments to go you know react proportions of robbery Turtles try to assess in real time what's the behavior and how is it aging we think is extremely important that the federal government participate in this when it's sure that it's the more long-term issues and the issues that full cross reactor types so it is not getting into private things proprietary things that kind of thing with industry so we think the program is extremely important thank you and thanks for the job you're doing look forward to working with young and he's important projects right for Idaho and for the country

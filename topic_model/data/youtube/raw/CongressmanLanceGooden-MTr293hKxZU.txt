texas business owners in congressman lance gooden's district tell him their employees just returned this week as the benefit expired joining us now member of the house financial services committee congressman lance gooden sir thank you for being here we appreciate it thank you good morning good morning you know there are a lot of people out there hard-working upstanding citizens out there who are having a hard time right now who do need money do you think there is any any possible hope for common ground to be found i think so and what you just said the hard-working people that are legitimately laid off that are unemployed those are the people who are suffering the most because businesses that have shut down they need to get back operational and what this six hundred dollar additional benefit does is it it disincentivizes uh some people from going back to work and we've seen that and i want to be clear we're not talking about unemployment insurance we're talking about the additional 600 benefit the other side would like to say that we want to just take away unemployment that's not the case but what that 600 dollar benefit has done is incentivized some people to stay home because they make more money by not working and that's just crazy that the government is competing with private industry and businesses in my district are sick of it they've said we haven't been able to get employees to come back to work because it makes no sense for them if they know that they'll make more money sitting at home and this week now that that benefits has expired many of those employers in my district have said they've had no issues with their employees coming back to work i've i've heard similar things too from business owners saying that once the 600 is gone you know it'll make it easier for me to get some of my people back um who specifically when you say businesses in your district what kind of businesses are you talking about that are struggling to get people to come back because of this benefit this was these were mostly small businesses they were they were not higher wage earners but these are people who have struggled uh because they have been unable to convince their own workers to come back whether it is a warehouse or a large company even a local nail salon that i talked to a nail salon owner she said she couldn't get her people to come back to work it's it's all aspects of business uh large and small and we've got to stop competing with private industry the government should not be in the business of encouraging people not to work and that's the problem that we've got to balance between that and people who are actually legitimately unemployed that want to work but their their businesses have been shut down we've got to encourage those businesses to get back in in business and encouraging people to stay home is just not the answer yeah a lot of people want to work but just can't right now let's talk about melon voting for a second because the president of course has been blasting it chuck schumer nancy pelosi met with the postmaster general take a listen to what both sides have to say we did meet as the speaker mentioned with the head of the postal service it was heated discussion all ballots have to be counted we are are demanding that the regulations be rescinded you're never going to know who won the election it's a catastrophe waiting to happen is it a catastrophe waiting to happen it is you can look at the recent new york primaries that the in many cases the races weren't decided for many weeks after ballots have turned up missing the one thing that chuck schumer was right about is that all ballots must be counted he's right they should be counted but if we're depending on the united states postal service to get those ballots counted when many times packages can't even get delivered then we're in a heap of trouble and if that's something that this country wants if we want to rely on the united states postal service to help run our elections we don't need to start talking about that three months before election day that's something that would take years first you've got to turn the postal service around second you've got to actually have a process that people believe in and if you look to places like new york and california where election results are announced and then that gives everyone two weeks to go and harvest ballots that's just not right in an application process like we have in texas for seniors and for the military uh requires people to actually fill out an application signatures are verified we make sure that the ballots belong to the people that they say they're coming from and some of these other states it's it's just totally insane the way things have been done that's going to be a very interesting november i think we can all agree on that congressman thank you so much absolutely we do appreciate it thank you it is 19 minutes after the hour a

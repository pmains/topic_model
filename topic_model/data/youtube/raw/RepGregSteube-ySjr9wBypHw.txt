good evening thanks for joining us for real America with Dan Bull tonight folks greatly appreciate you trusting us with your time I know it's valuable when we left you on Friday evening here on the program what was happening in the House of Representatives there was no new speaker elected yet however just after midnight if you were watching Saturday morning on the 15th round of voting and some intense negotiations to put it mildly well they all came together McCarthy receiving 216 votes the threshold was reduced because a bunch of the 20 members that had gone against McCarthy had just voted present Jeffrey's got 212. again there were six that voted president of the present rather of those 20 original Freedom caucus members who were against McCarthy's nomination as Speaker of the House again it took 15 rounds we haven't seen that since about 1856 when it took about two months and 133 votes that last race to get the ballots was a long one that night but as you can see everyone then rallied around McCarthy now there are some big changes in how things will be conducted in our house and that's what a lot of the freedom caucus holdouts were pushing for were there other things behind the scenes like committee appointments um just some normal infighting and politics I'm sure there was however Anna Paulina Luna brand new member of Congress you've seen her on this program from Florida she put a list of items that the freedom caucus were holding out for many of these now will change how the speaker conducts business in our house and this is a good thing I think it's great it's good for America now here's what she put and when we get our next guest here we'll kind of verify if these things are actually going to go through a term limit vote that should be brought up as a vote that sounds like a good one single subject bills my gosh who wouldn't want that the Texas border plan a budget that stops an increase in the debt ceiling and holds the Senate accountable amen ending all coveted mandates and funding how about this one 72 hours to read a bill that's just a few and there's more and more there as well again I hope that happens now as I said it was pretty heated if you didn't watch Friday night I was actually glued to C-SPAN here you see uh Kevin McCarthy approaching Matt Gates on that uh vote number 14 when it didn't go the way that they had thought it happened then all of a sudden what the hell everybody turns around well watch Mr Mike Rogers just above Kevin McCarthy above the guy with the bow tie get grabbed whoops and pulled back evidently he was making some threatening remarks and gestures towards Matt gates for not going along with the vote and doing present and getting all six members to do it in the 14th vote so again some intense moments there I thought it was entirely childish and personally I think they should center Rogers that's just me don't be going around threatening other Republicans don't be calling them terrorists Dan Crenshaw we're supposed to be getting along okay this is a big victory we're in charge of the house let's pull together and get the work done for the American people and stop fighting like this is high school 1992. okay grow up all of you we want to see work from our Republicans that's why we put you there in the first place and I'm talking to all of you not taking sides on anybody here former president Donald J Trump played a vital role behind the scenes in getting this compromise to happen to get Kevin elected as speaker and some are on board with it some are scratching their heads wondering why Trump did it and some say no way no ever we don't want Kevin ever but Kevin knows if it weren't for president Trump he wouldn't have this role I do want to especially thank president Trump I don't think you should anybody should doubt his influence he was with me from the beginning somebody wrote the doubt of whether he was there and he was all in he would call me and he would call others and uh he really was I was just talking to him tonight um help him get those final votes and he sure did our first guest this evening representing Florida's 17th District our friend Congressman Greg stuby what a wild night Friday was Greg I literally was texting a bunch of you guys watching it on C-Span wondering what in the heck was going on especially when that whole little Rift went down between uh Rogers and Gates and everyone up in that corner on the 14th vote but finally we've got a speaker and now things are going to start moving forward with Republicans in charge of the house your assessment with the four days the 15 votes I mean you guys take off how many weeks in the summer I didn't care about the four days to be honest I just want to see results do you think this is good or bad for the nation now moving forward well I'm glad it didn't take 133 rounds like it did at the time before if you look back in history yeah uh but uh yeah I mean look there's a lot of good things that came out of this I I don't I don't say I necessarily agree with the way that it was handled I believe that this all should have been handled behind closed doors before we got to the actual vote so we were all on the same page but um there was a lot and you kind of laid out some of the concessions and some of the rules um that some of these holdouts wanted and uh after some of those were agreed to then 14 members flipped over and eventually six voted present and he got there by one vote um Trump has always supported him and I think there's going to be a lot of good that comes from this I just hope that now we have a speaker and the Republicans should unite around Kevin McCarthy and unite around this agenda the commitment for America and the commitment to America and do the things that the American people put us here to do yes that's laid out in that commitment and uh let's get let's get to work let's pass this rules package today tonight and start passing these bills that uh leader leader uh Majority Leader now scalise put out there that we're going to start getting after it and some of those that I see are very interesting and I say hallelujah amen thank you is 72 hours to read bills before you guys actually vote on them because I recall numerous times we would reach out to your office and other members of Congress and say nope Auntie Nancy just threw up a vote on some Bill we got to run in we have to cancel the the live interview and you guys have to run because they would just throw up a bill and you'd have to vote and nobody got to read the damn thing that one got in that's important to me what about the pork spending I know that was a concession they want to be made where you couldn't throw pet projects into other bills stuff has to be read individually as individual bills no more of this piling all in one big thing two three thousand pages did that get through yeah this is all the way that house should operate you shouldn't be spending money if you don't have a way to pay for it that's called the Pago uh piece you shouldn't be voting on 4 000 page pieces of legislation and not get it until hours before the vote and you're right that's exactly how speaker Pelosi ran the house uh she would craft all these pieces of legislation like the Omnibus and some of these other things behind closed doors and then literally call a vote and then literally and I'm not exaggerating this literally hours before a vote 2 000 Pages would show up on the internet and that's what we were voting on in an hour so a lot of these are not only good for the house but they're good for the American people it's transparency for the American people on what we're voting on and they have time and the Press has time to react to that and talk about it and the actual policies of the house it's going back to America's house and the people's house yeah instead of speaker Pelosi's house and the final question for those folks who are never McCarthy folks who don't like him or don't trust him there was some rules put in about how speakers can be a speaker can be changed now in the rules and how many votes needed did that make it through in the concessions yeah that's supposed to be in the concessions that was in the draft that I've seen so far it's a five vote threshold so five members of the House can move to vacate the chair and then you're going to have that speaker's election again or that motion uh it would be an up or down vote on the motion and then if if he isn't able to stay there then we'd have another vote for speaker but I think he's going to stay true to these conservative policies and principles as he's laid out and the commitment to America we have a conservative conference we have a majority Conservative Republican conference so way more uh than a super majority conservative conference within the conference and I think you're going to see all the conservative things that voters across the country voted to put us in charge of the house is going to happen in the next hundred days all right we're going to hold all you guys and gals to it I won't hold my breath because I know it's DC and it's a swamp but things are looking up Greg so I will stay positive thank you sir for coming back on the program you take care yeah you too good

Thank You mr. chairman gentlemen thank you for being here today we've already discussed and got a good idea of how complex your missions are in in both of your areas of operation and you know our inviter national interests are threatened by violent extremists by great power competition and all of the multi-faceted challenges that you face as I looked at recent reporting on SOUTHCOM much attention has been on a dictators effort to citing clinging to power or an AFRICOM the persistent presence of violent extremists are these events merely symptoms of a larger systemic problems in both regions and and what in your assessments are the prime drivers of instability in South calm and AFRICOM and how are your commands posture to deal with the root causes because it's one thing to deal with the symptoms but but what are we doing to really get to the root causes that are that are occurring in both of your regions I'll go first senator thank you very much and I'll use Nazira as an example here as a population of about 19 million about 50% of those are under the age of 15 they certainly are in a very difficult area of Africa meaning that they have pressing from all sides whether it be Isis West Africa Jay and I M in the West whether it be aq coming down through the Algeria Algerian border on the way to Mali they have Isis West Africa on their eastern flank so they're in a tough situation but I think this is that what goes unnoticed sometimes is the whole government approach that is used in Nazir so for example USAID has about 150 million dollars a year that they use for things like education especially for young girls for government in government infrastructure and so forth moreover the Millennium Challenge corporation has their honor I think the second year of a five-year compact down there which has to do with with agriculture watering crops and so forth so if you look at the security assistance that we're providing and you add to that USAID effort and the Millennium Challenge compact that's I think a good example of a whole government approach of how we're trying to deal with a country that has some very significant security challenges we do have some bright spots like to point out Brazil has been a exporter of security but in our history same with Colombia and the trajectory of both our mill mill relations with those countries very positive in the current that as well as situation we're sharing a lot of information we're looking at this as a regional solution Chile commanded in in our largest exercise the room of the Pacific but around the region corruption weak governance a lack of jobs these are things that have effect and these are whether the military is a part of this whole government solution I saw this in Honduras I was in an outreach center run by USAID it was right next to a partnered police station we had a few Army's Civil Affairs people there meeting with some young men and women that had been supplied jobs and when I asked the one individual he'd gone all the way to the u.s. Mexico Mexico border and turned around and came all the way back walked as part of the care of him but he came back I said well why'd you come back he said it was pretty scary for me I felt I felt I should come home I said well why did you go he goes the family next to us was starving or hot we were starving then the family next to them was starving but across the street they had some food because their their father had made the United States and was sending remittance back so at the heart of this is it's a it's the want of a better life and an economy and want to have your kids go to school and all citizens of all the world deserve that thank you so so looking at this hook of an approach how easy has it been for you each to work with other executive branch agencies to provide a coordinated whole government approach and is this happening for example it may be happening in Egypt but is it happening in other parts of Africa and how are we are we consistent in applying this approach and what can we do to really help you be part of this as team so that we can get at the root causes well senator I would say that the AFRICOM staff has individuals from those agencies that work very closely with on with us on a daily basis moreover as dollars become tight our return on investment needs to be demonstrated as a consequence we have to be better stewards of the of our efforts in terms of where we where we want to our emphasis we need to coordinate that and synchronize that with this agency because really it gets I think to the larger issue of influence and the China influence as well we need to demonstrate that we can compete with them we may not be building soccer stadiums or government buildings but at the same time we're teaching them how to be better farmers we're showing them what education can do for them so the bottom line for us is we need to continue to work with our partners which we have good relationships with by the way there's this development diplomacy and defense effort in the AFRICOM at State Department with AFRICOM is very very positive experience we have representatives from every inner agency at my headquarters and they sit in in every meeting we're working this problem set hard and we're working in conjunction with country teams in the embassy a consistent level resourcing is important and recognizing this is a problem that will take years to solve not months or days thank you thank you mr. chairman

with doug holzakin uh my colleagues on the other side of our they're rushing for this uh this energy transition and ignoring the realities we talked about higher costs fewer jobs we're still going to have bad air quality and and uh we're still going to have the environmental hazards that are out there so i i still don't quite understand why they're pushing their ideology when the facts don't back up what they're what they're pursuing and particularly today when they came out the g7 made their big press conference that even then when it was all done they couldn't decide what to do about coal so other than we're not going to finance coal but then but then china and japan are still going to finance coal around the world china is burning 53 of all the coal so we're still going to have emissions problems around the world until they could so i can see globally they have a problem so my question what will happen to the united states economy if this radical left socialism movement rushes to go ahead with these unrealistic climate goals while china need to expand theirs what will happen to our economy the production portfolio in the united states and the rapid rapid discoloration is going to be a hard thing to adjust to even slowly over a long period of time some rapidly timelines are extraordinarily short it poses great damage we've not had two followers another dan goldberg take a look at our legislation from regulatory approaches quite a big police target in the aluminum industry we also built a big aluminum plant up in oswego new york uh so i have some familiarity with it but that's why it was important to hear from you because we were told the electricity plays a big part in making aluminum so if they persist in pushing this ideology rather than science if they persist on this what would be the impact on the aluminum industry with higher higher utility costs it's competitiveness congressman again we we have competitors all over the world and we have again competitors who understand the the strategic importance of aluminum and so they will be more than happy to fill any gaps that we that we leave in the market um again we're giving up good paying american jobs that's going to be part of the you know a big part of the price that we will pay on this and again we will lose uh not only in in the aluminum industry but in our downstream industries because it's going to be more expensive for them to get their materials from our industry so it it looses all the way around and again we're helping to fuel the economy of other nations that are not our best friends and do not have our uh are not strategic allies of ours think we've already touched on it but i need to hear your words as well so as as we transition to 100 of energy power by 2035 uh eliminating oil gases and i know the pjm market it's its own the renewables are less than 10 so we're going to have a a real challenge on our hands the pgm market which is the one the largest energy distribution that we have in this country but what happens if we if we make this transition in a short timeframe based on ideology how realistic is it that they can do this without dramatically increasing utility bills um well we think it is highly unlikely because there are so many obstacles number one like you said it's going to be very expensive number two it's not going to allow for a technology-based and investment in incentives in advanced coal technologies whether that's coal first cc us hydrogen which would also allow us to complete internationally because right now china is building 247 000 megawatts are either in construction or will be built over the next decade that's more than the entire u.s coal fleet which is 234 thousand so unless they make measure it uh agreements then we're not going to see you could retire every coal plant in the united states and it's not going to have a meaningful impact on greenhouse gas emissions in addition as it relates to reliability and resilience as we think about what happened in california two million customers were interrupted in urchin four million customers lost their power in my soap spp in the history of stp the southwest power pole this is the first time they have ever had a blackout i would submit to you that the coal fleet and miso and spp outperformed and was the most resilient of all the few sources it was able to double its capacity factor from the year before and meisto and svp have all agreed that without the cold fleet they could have had widespread outages like california and archive we've seen a lot of analysis and even in pjm that has a high reserve margin that even with a small amount of coal retirements and we have extreme weather like we had across the midwest that they would also be subject to blackouts but also to skyrocket rocketing electricity prices and in myso when we had this event and spp power prices skyrocketed almost 40 during the polar vortex power prices and pjm skyrocketed 2 200 because we again we're beginning to see the cracks and what happens when we go too far too fast i don't like to recognize the chairman in waiting again uh are you ready for it you're ready this time so chairman uh you've got uh five minutes right okay

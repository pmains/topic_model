I first contacted Senator manchin's office on March 1st because my husband and I had yet to receive any communication from the IRS about our 2020 taxes and the tax refund we were expecting I called between our filing date and December 31st I had called the IRS about nine times and was just constantly told six weeks eight weeks wait six more weeks and finally March 1st I contacted Senator manchin's office after seeing a blurb in their e-newsletter I reached out Angie Walsh contacted me within two days and within six weeks our situation was resolved and I just cannot explain how what relief washed over me when we received noticed that our refund had fun or our taxes had finally been processed our relief was just palpable um it just took such a weight off our shoulders and I was very grateful foreign

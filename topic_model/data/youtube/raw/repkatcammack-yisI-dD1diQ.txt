joining me now Florida congresswoman Kat camek she sits on the house Homeland Security committee Merry Christmas congresswoman thanks for carving out the time you know in the middle of Biden's raging border crises Republican senator Tom Tillis is putting your party's brand on amnesty how's that grab you well Merry Christmas to you too and let me just be very clear up front border security is non-negotiable and to me it's like they're saying the quiet part out loud for two years now we have heard from the bite Administration that there is no crisis there is no issue at the border but yet now we have Democrats stepping up and saying hey we'll give you border security if you go along with our amnesty plan to me that's like I said saying the quiet part out loud admitting that there is a problem which of course we all know is the first step but the second part of this is that it is non-negotiable and no world should border security be attached to any deal because it should be a standalone I firmly believe most of our bills if not all should be Standalone bills single issue bills and when it comes to National Security that is constitutionally one of the very few things that the federal government is charged with so from my perspective this is a dead-on arrival piece of alleged piece of legislation and of course we've seen it in years past where these comprehensive bills they all I may start with the best engines but they end terrible sad death so from my standpoint well let's just we will not have any yeah let's just hope this this uh this lame duck session doesn't provide an opportunity for the chilises and the romneys and the and the McConnells of the world to jam it through before uh the Republicans take the majority and by the way congresswoman you have been fantastic on the border and and trying to protect Americans putting Americans first instead of foreign Nationals not every Republican can say the same let me get to a different subject here every day we're learning more on how the government allegedly conspired with big Tech to deny Americans their constitutionally protected right of free speech in this latest example the latest drop in Elon musk's Twitter files exposing the political bias behind Trump's ban of Twitter but also revealing that government officials participated in the censorship now the Chris Salcedo show would like to propose a law to hold these violators in government congresswoman accountable if a person in government partakes in actions that deny Americans their constitutional rights we suggest the following punishment way on the Salcedo show number one an immediate termination from their government position number two a lifetime prohibition on serving in government at any level or in any capacity and number three a fine mandatory jail time or both would you draft and or support such a bill listen Chris I support accountability wholeheartedly and I don't know if you're a Game of Thrones fan but I like to say much like winter is coming accountability is coming and January 3rd will prove to be a very very important day because For the first time in a long time there will actually be people held accountable for all of the misdeeds from years past and I'm not talking just about like the hunter Biden stories I'm talking about Hillary Clinton and her Infamous oh I'm accidentally erased 33 000 emails uh you know nonsense people need to understand that there are no double set of standards in this country and that's what the political Elites and the Liberals on the left have been living by a completely separate set of Standards so we need to really take steps to investigate and go through that process and make the case that is irrefutable that people like Alejandro mayorcas like people who have put up these misinformation boards and disinformation Boards all these things need to be put in place to prevent another situation where we have censorship and suppression of facts because what we've seen from Twitter under Jack Dorsey is really this element of we know better than you and that has been the Mantra in Washington We Know Better Or we know best no you don't this is a government We The People by the people and for the people and so we need to get back to that basic premise and I can tell you that I'll take a look at that proposal that you had right up there on the screen and we'll follow up with you I did I wouldn't dare say Circle back my goodness gen saki ruined that but we need to be very very very focused in making sure that we're delivering the accountability that the American people deserve well I'm glad glad you're going to come back with us on that because I think it's important we need you know Jack Dorsey aside we need to have some accountability in government when they usurp their fellow citizens constitutional rights

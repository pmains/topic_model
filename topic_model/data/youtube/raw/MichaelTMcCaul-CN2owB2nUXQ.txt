you are talking about defense in the scale here so a couple years ago Wall Street Journal wrote an article about a staff from important theft of engineering data regarding f-35 enjoy start designing information inspiration about lon Cronk system etcetera and he talked to a lot of Air Force folks right now it'll tell you next-generation aircraft a really fine pieces of software and fast forward to for secretary gazes last trip to China the day before he landed the Chinese decided to unveil their new next-generation aircraft which looks shockingly familiar like you have 35 now we can say all right go Steph here and it takes more than just designing the plane you're not flying and I trained it but there were two issues here that are worth commenting on one is this is a next-generation aircraft that's critical to our nation's security but also for Alice we are going to sell it we are going to supply it it's not just hundreds of billions of dollars in economic security for us but it is literal national security for our friends and allies around the world as well as ourselves so there's that mystery of it and that's where the defense industrial base security comes importantly sagging Berg is because it is that flying piece of software the commander of the Navy needs tenth fleet who has the where is the honor of commanding the only fully that doesn't have any ships because there's an electronic warfare fleet has said publicly he worries of a loss of control of kinetic weapons systems because of cyber security vulnerabilities so if you combine what is happening with farid data above the f-35 design engineering you fast forward to the Admiral commander of the tenth fleet has said you can see how this issue becomes very important so talking to you first we and this is what I was in an advanced persistent for our world that you mentioned you can talk a little bit more about how an epp well the techniques they use how they persistent threats and licenses qualitatively different than what we usually see the cybercrime and then jahaal ask you from a defense industry perspective and comment about what we do to secure the nation's defense industrial base and what isn't the challenges you see this advanced persistent very environment of the property rights on the question of Enki T's effects say anything about these things is that to successfully execute possession attack you need a multi-level strategy when we look at a GPS that we've done research on the written various reports on one such as reward night dragon what have you what's fascinating about them is the fact that there's usually an intelligence from em to it where the organization spends time identifying soft targets human assets in order nations that have the ability to execute the malware once that work is done then the organization focuses on the traffic will offer an email with a photo or some personalized piece of data that the recipient we have reason to open then is the execution of that acapella trust office usually has malware head and then is once it's on the system than the apt then gets circulated throughout the system and because of its unique characteristics has the ability to go under what is typically the security regime of any organization which is still very blacklisting morning which is so very highly reactive which is on to me absolutely that's about protecting an organization gets going threats and then the apt then you know sits of detected IP you know this maybe it's a big issue to aggressively better innovation technology point of view we're driving that other organizations are two takes good policy and then it'll stay schemin over log training the organization's need to focus on so as you see emails and don't quite look right read email to do over twice around given you guys are from our perspective life is just a general dates on their free fastest way we implement our procedures processes to protect our product and that product any generator weapon systems although product we have formed globally around world that are non weapon systems protect our people protect our infrastructure as well as protect our clients and there's overlap among and between the freedom of the underlying foundation that we believe is very critical every business represented this room and read on the net energy is the investment naked our human capital and that does very very critical to us they're quite frankly inside animators and not human cattle dog around me off demand and is grown back so we've done is we have invested heavily in uninitiated just to do that where we have in some cases designer own course we're in some cases you may I wrapped around the outsourced but a series of modules that are all aligned protecting our infrastructure protecting our customers protecting our product and both at the executive level to enhance awareness of the issues some on it the Secretary to boss level doesn't necessarily have it actually right secure code appreciation for all elements of better securing a defense industrial base unit executive level is very important and then down to the practitioner level with a lot of hands-on activity going on to both from an offensive side as well as the defensive side of the equation so that's definitely the focus for us running

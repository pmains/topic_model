go back to that shutdown fallout though and get the democratic perspective Karen bass is a Democratic congresswoman from California she's a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committee representative bass thanks for being with us so you voted against the funding bill to reopen the US government why well for several reasons first of all what was not in the bill which means it's essentially a cut was community health clinics so it is wonderful that the children's health insurance program was funded but where are the children going to go in my district for example six to seven clinics will have to shut down because of the lack of funding and of course because there was no deal for the dreamers that is certainly a huge issue in California so there were many reasons why many of us were dissatisfied I do hope it can get worked out in these next few days but we'll see but do you think your party caved too soon in which case you would be agreeing with President Trump well I don't think I don't think the Democrats cave no I think the Democrats acted responsibly I do think it's very important to note that the Republicans control the three branches of government the White House the Senate and the House of Representatives and it is really their responsibility to not do a continuing resolution but to do a comprehensive budget proposal which we've not had for a number of years and so this creates tremendous difficulties in a lot of different areas of the government when they have to lurch from continuing resolution to continuing resolution never having any stability in their funding but why use the government shutdown as a strategy in the first place it's terribly unpopular with Americans or terms coming up and I was gonna say you have important midterms coming up and the party appears divided you voted against the funding bill others who perhaps are running for re-election in red states voted in favor of it it seems like there's no not everyone's on the same page at a critical moment well I think it is true that not everyone is on the same page but please understand the Democrats do not have the power to shut down the government even in the Senate not all of the Republicans voted for the bill to begin with and in the House of Representatives they do not need our votes at all so the responsibility has to be with the majority party not with the Democrats well they can withhold their support for a funding bill that needs more than 50 votes right right right exactly they do have some level of power right the minority does have some level of authority in the Senate that is not true in the house which is where I am a member now let me ask you a little bit about how your party has been described in various publications one column in particular caught my attention David Brooks in the New York Times criticizing the Democrats in this case he is saying the Democrats are the party that believes in government it doesn't do them any good to make the federal government look dysfunctional the Democrats are trying to defend a bunch of seats in red states this immigration uber Allah's strategy was never going to play well they're Democrats when you lose a negotiation to a president who doesn't know his own position you've really impressed me how do you respond to criticism like that representative bath oh well you know I do have to say that amongst the Democratic base the Democratic base was very very strong in feeling as though we needed to come up with a solution for the dreamers we also needed to fund the community health clinics and the hospitals that serve the poor population and unfortunately the Republicans cast this as though we were protecting illegal aliens what the truth of the matter is is that the dreamers did have legal status it was Trump who removed that legal status when he chose to discontinue the program so I think that the Democrats will continue to fight for a solution for the dreamers this is the hand you're playing now Donald Trump made the announcement that he did there's a golden opportunity isn't there for the Democratic Party despite the fact the economy is booming in the United States the president is still unpopular I mean relative oh yes 30 what but the party doesn't seem to have neither a strategy or a figurehead or some message that goes beyond at least we're not the other guy oh no no no III would disagree what I will tell you in my state in California we have a number of seats where I believe that the Democrats will win during the midterm elections because we have historically never had a president who had ratings this low and also the Republican Party in general and so I do believe that the Democrats have an alternative vision have alternative programs and strategies and I believe through our organizing and activism that has been generated in a way that we have not seen in decades because of Trump I believe that will be victorious in the midterms all right and certainly there is a record number of women as well running which will makes that very interesting election representative Karen bass of California thank you so much for joining us on CNN we appreciate your time

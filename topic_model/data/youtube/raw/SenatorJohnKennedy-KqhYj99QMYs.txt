thank you mr chairman mr secretary thank you for being here i have i have watched you operate and i don't mean that in a pejorative sense and i want to tell you i've been impressed of course i reserve the right to change my mind and there are a lot of things i want to talk to you about today but but i'm not i'm going to talk about what i think is an overarching opportunity that we're missing i think the state department is missing it i think the congress is missing it and i think president biden is missing it so we're all missing it in my judgment the coronavirus is not over it's better in the united states but but it's not better in south america it's not better in sub-sahara africa it's better but not good in india and and the the the facts are the facts i don't mean to be this to be a political statement the virus came from china the best vaccines came from the united states and and we have an opportunity right now to demonstrate to the world what american leadership looks like we have an opportunity right now to do the right thing to help save lives to do the smart thing in terms of our national security and to check the rise of the communist party of china not the people of china people in china are good people but the members of the communist party of china are pirates now we we know that many countries like the united states have the ability to manufacture and to store and distribute the vaccine but a lot of countries don't and it's dangerous not only is it immoral us not addressing this problem it's dangerous for the united states as the virus mutates and and in my opinion um what i would encourage you to encourage the president to do is this week to announce that of of of all of our foreign policy issues and they're all important everything from myanmar to i get it but our single most important priority for the rest of the year is going to be to vaccinate the world i'm not talking about 20 million doses here 10 million there i mean to vaccinate the world i don't know how many doses that is 500 million a billion a billion and a half it's the right thing to do it is the smart thing to do it won't be popular in some quarters but we ought to do it anyway now the funding i think you would find that uh you would have a bipartisan effort from the united states congress to find the money not all my colleagues are going to agree with me on this but i think we could find money to do it from the last coronavirus bill i didn't vote for it i thought it was unnecessary expensive i thought it wasn't related to the coronavirus it was it was sold to us as a as an economic disaster relief bill clearly we're not in an economic disaster anymore i think we could repurpose some of the money but i don't want to fight about that now but but i would strongly encourage you to do that let's show the world what american leadership is all about and that will pay far greater dividends than anything we can do in terms of summits are are foreign aid and it's also the right thing to do and i just don't think the administration is seizing this opportunity and i think you're missing a political opportunity that's for my side that's bad but for the world it would be good senator can i just say that i am in violent agreement with you uh let's do it and i could not have said it any any better than you did and i would just say stay tuned good thank you

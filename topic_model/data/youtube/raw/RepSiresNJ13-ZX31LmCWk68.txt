last week I rise today in honor of holocaust remembrance day which was observed last week and April nineteenth the theme of this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day was choosing to act offer an important reminder of the sacredness of human life and the need for all us all of us to stand against evil the Holocaust represents one of the darkest periods in human history and illustrates the worst of human behavior yes Sam still denied the events of the Holocaust ever occur it is no wonder that Israel is freely concerned with the developer of nuclear weapons in Iran putting these arms in the hands of radicals who have shown no respect for human life or basic human rights we must support and stand by Israel during these dangerous times we must always keep in the back of our minds the history of the Jewish people understanding the history helps us understand their concerns and feelings about what currently is going on in the world on Holocaust Remembrance Day we are reminded that the Jewish people have had first-hand experience with true evil and we must work to ensure that such atrocities do not happen again in a year back for what purpose does the gentleman from Texas rise

hello everyone thank you for joining this evening you know whenever we have new information or resources from washington dc i want to make sure that everybody in the 37th district takes full advantage of all the resources so we know that when president biden signed the american rescue plan it included payments direct checks that hopefully everybody has received by now because if you use direct deposit hopefully you got a surprise and a 1400 check in your account but before we get into uh the taxes which is going to be the focus of what we talk about tonight i just want to provide you an update of where we are with the vaccines and i am hoping that everyone on this call who is eligible has already had their vaccine i consider myself double vaxxed that's what we call each other now these days and you know i got my second vaccine in january and so it is just a huge relief to know that i am protected well la county says that in a few days everyone 16 and above is going to be eligible to be vaccinated and so i hope that again everyone signs up you can go to myturn.ca.gov you can go to los angeles county public health.lacounty.gov if you live in south la and live in a south la zip code and are a senior without computer access you can call the vaccine call center that is currently run by the st john's well child and family center they will help people in eligible zip codes and i'm sorry if you're not from south la but we are focusing because that is where the deficit is in terms of people who have not been vaccinated so if you don't want to go on a website and you want to make a phone call you can call 866 980 zero eight seven zero eight six six nine eight zero zero eight seven zero for others you can use the websites that i mentioned my turn.ca.gov los angeles

that you understand the new filing deadlines as well as the benefits that are now available and how to claim them we're also going to discuss the direct economic impact payments and that's the check to make sure that you will receive them so before i turn it over to the experts and to my chief of staff who'll be moderating tonight darren harris i want to make a note that we have been receiving calls in both my district office and my dc office regarding delayed payments for ssi filers so i want everyone to know that the irs and the treasury department announced recently that they anticipate because there was a backlog with ssi so they anticipate payments will begin to be issued this week to social social security recipients and other federal beneficiaries who do not normally file a tax return soon with the projection that the majority of these payments would be sent electronically and received april 7th are in the week following i also want to say that while we do have experts on the call they will not be able to discuss questions regarding specific cases but they will be able to provide you with information to follow up with their agencies and a recording of this event along with information will be will be available to everyone who signed up for our newsletters next week so now if you're not signed up you can do so at bass.house.gov backslash signup with that let me introduce or mention our first speaker annabelle marquez who serves as our congressional district liaison with the irs our second speaker is mark narlevsky with the california franchise tax board and he is the office of the advocate for taxpayer rights and our third speaker is asuela valela the deputy director for the la county department of consumer and business affairs tonight are i'm going to introduce our chief of staff darren harris who will take the call over and formally introduce our speakers and i apologize if i mispronounced anyone's name thank you everyone thank you so much miss bass with that let me introduce our first speaker annabelle marquez who serves as our congressional district liaison with the internal revenue service annabelle yes thank you and thank you congresswoman bass for this opportunity to speak to your constituents about important irs information i'll start by sharing that the irs began processing 2020 tax returns on february 12th the agency also extended the filing deadline this year the new tax filing deadline for federal tax returns is may 17th we expect to process more than 160 million federal tax returns this year and for this reason the irs recommends that taxpayers file electronically not only is electronics filing the safest and most accurate way to file a tax return e-filed returns have fewer errors which means fewer delays most refunds are being issued in less than 21 days refund information is generally available within 24 hours after the irs acknowledges receiving your e-filed return now you can check your refund status by using a tool on the irs.gov website the tool is called where's my refund and we also have a mobile phone app irs to go which you can download on your smartphone and check on your tax refund there now the opposite of getting a refund is obviously when you owe taxes so for that we say you should file your return by the new extended deadline of may 17th even if you can't pay the full tax owed if you believe you may have trouble paying a tax bill by the may 17th due date don't panic you should still file your tax return even if you're unable to pay it in full however we do recommend that you pay as much as you can to avoid penalties and interest now the irs offers several payment options such as short-term extensions to pay an extended payment plan or an offer in compromise also if you just can't pay at all because we're going through some difficult times give global pandemic you can also request that the irs temporarily delay the collection process until your financial situation improves now you can find more information about making payments on the irs website by going to irs.gov forward slash payments now let's talk about economic impact payments commonly referred to as stimulus payments the first two economic impact payments were based on your 2018 or 2019 tax return information or if no tax return was filed the payments were based on social security veterans affairs or other federal benefits or information you had entered into the irs's non-filer tool that we made available last year these first two rounds of economic impact payments were paid as an advanced payment of the 2020 recovery rebate credit and they are not taxable income economic impact payments were issued to eligible individuals again in two rounds the first payment was for one thousand two hundred dollars or twenty four hundred if you file jointly with a spouse plus an additional five hundred dollars for each qualifying child claimed as a dependent the second round of stimulus payments was for 600 or 1200 if you filed jointly plus an additional 600 for each qualifying child claimed as a dependent these payment amounts were reduced if your income was above certain limits now at this time the irs and the treasury department have issued all first and second round payments possible due to the statutory deadline for issuing them if you did not receive a first or second payment or if you receive less than the full amount you were eligible for you can qualify for the 2020 recovery rebate credit now in order to claim the 2020 recovery rebate credit you must file a 2020 tax return even if you don't normally file taxes the 2020 recovery rebate credit has similar eligibility requirements except that it's going to be based on your 2020 tax return information and circumstances rather than your 2018 or 2019 tax returns now following the approval of the american rescue plan act in march as the congresswoman mentioned the third round of economic impact payments began reaching americans last month so far more than 156 million eip3 payments have been issued since the irs began rolling them out on march 12th generally if you're a u.s citizen or a u.s resident alien you're eligible to receive 1 400 or 2 800 for a joint return plus another 1400 for each qualifying dependent as long as you are not dependent of another taxpayer on a 2020 tax return have a valid social security number and your income does not exceed certain limits which is generally 75 000 for an individual taxpayer 150 000 for a married filing joint uh return now unlike the first two payments the dependent portion of the third stimulus payment is not restricted to children under 17. this means eligible families will get a payment based on all of their qualifying dependents claimed on their return including older relatives college students adults with disabilities parents and grandparents you should check the get my payment tool on irs.gov to check on the status of your third stimulus payment most eligible people will get the third economic impact payment automatically and won't need to take additional action the irs will use available information to determine eligibility and issue the third payment to eligible people who filed the 2020 tax return or a 2019 tax return if your 2020 return has not been submitted considering we did extend the filing deadline and if it has been submitted but not fully processed then the irs is using your 2019 tax return they'll also also be making uh eligibility determinations for folks who didn't file tax returns but registered using the non-filer tool that was available on irs.gov last year so if you use that non-filer tool to claim your first round of economic impact payment then we'll have your information to automatically distribute your third economic impact payment um now people who receive social security veterans of spiritual railroad retirement benefits as of december 31st 2020 and don't usually file the tax return don't have to take any action either as the congresswoman mentioned we recently obtained updated files for folks that receive these federal benefits and eip3 deposits continue to be issued and so you should be expecting uh those payments soon if you have not yet received it but many folks received um eap 3 dated april 7. so today would have been the day many people received that third round and i'm talking specifically about social security beneficiaries and federal benefit beneficiaries so now if you don't fall into one of those categories i just mentioned you'll want to file a 2020 tax return in order to be in line for a third economic impact payment and claim the 2020 recovery rebate credit i talked about earlier for eip1 and eip2 if you didn't receive it you can go to irs.gov for more information and you will find a plethora of information on eip1 2 and 3 because each one came with it with its own set of rules so there's a few slight differences with each one of the economic impact payments that were issued and the third one that continues to be issued now i know that many of you may have questions about the expanded child tax credit for 2021 including the advanced payments of the credit we don't yet have guidance and information available we are working on it our commissioner did state um in recent congressional testimony that the irs will be working on perhaps developing a tool where folks can go and register to receive these payments but we don't have anything un finalized yet as soon as we have more information i will make sure that i pass this information along to congresswoman karen bass's office so that her constituents can learn how to do this we do anticipate this information to be posted over the summer so in the next few months um finally i know i'm probably extending my my remark uh period here but um you may be wondering how you can get help filing your tax return if you have access to the internet and you're comfortable using a computer and your income is below 72 000 you can use irs free file the irs free file program is a public private partnership between the irs and many tax preparation and tax software industry leaders who provide their branding products for free you can find more information at irs.gov forward slash free file if you need personal assistance filing your tax return you also have options if your income is under 57 000 you can receive free assistance from irs trained volunteers to locate a site near you you can use our volunteer income tax assistance locator tool found again irs.gov you can also call 800-906-9887 to get help finding a volunteer income tax assistance site near you thank you for your time and i look forward to answering your questions thank you so much annabelle our second speaker is mark noleski with the california franchise tax boards office of the advocate for taxpayers right mark take it away oh first of all i would like uh to thank congressmember bass for this invitation good everyone good evening everyone it's a pleasure to be with you today i have a few comments that i'd like to make relating to california taxes and some other programs at the franchise tax board first of all consistent with the internal revenue service the franchise tax board has postponed the state filing and payment deadline for individual taxpayers to may 17 2021. the postponement applies to individual filers whose 2020 tax returns and payments were originally due april 15 2021 it's an automatic postponement so there's no need to call us it applies only to tax returns and payments it does not apply to estimated tax payments and then on another note annabelle covered the federal economic impact payments and i want to inform you that they are not taxable for california income taxes california also has an earned income tax credit or the cal eitc hopefully you're already aware of it and i'd be happy to answer questions as we have time however i also want to share with you the new golden state stimulus this new program will provide golden state stimulus payment for those who qualify it's a one-time six hundred dollar or twelve hundred dollar payment per tax return you may receive the payment if you receive cal eitc or file with an individual taxpayer identification number or itin for most californians who qualify you don't need to do anything to receive this payment it's based on your tax filing so the qualifications of course are file your 2020 taxes and be either a cal eitc recipient or an itin filer who made 75 000 or less total california agi you must live in california for more than half the year and be a resident as of the date the payment was issued and then of course you cannot be eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another's return if you qualify and you have not filed yet you'll receive your payment 45 to 60 days after we've processed your tax return so for electronic returns it's a little over two months and for paper returns it'll be about three months the new program or this is a new program and we expect to send the first checks out within two weeks i think april 15th is our our goal date and that's the first rounds and we cannot send checks out to everyone at the same time because there's so many so please allow about six weeks if you've already filed a return and if you haven't filed yet we encourage you to do so you'll generally receive your payment in the same manner as you do a tax refund if you have direct deposit then you'll receive a direct deposit payment otherwise you'll receive a check and if you received an advanced refund by your tax preparer you'll receive a check the golden state stimulus payment is not taxable for california state income taxes and there is a deadline you must file by october 15 2021. very quickly i will say that the cal eitc is available for those who qualify you you must be 18 or older and have a maximum income for of of 30 000 for the year 2020. the income must be subject to california income tax withholding or self-employment income and you can go to our website for the cal eitc calculator our website is ftb.ca.gov that's frank thomas boy dot ca for california dot gov we also have the young child tax credit this accompanies the cali eitc if you have a dependent that otherwise qualifies you for cal eitc and they are under the age of six there's an additional credit of up to one thousand dollars per qualifying child we have a free filing option called calfile and you can find it on our website ftb.ca.gov along with more information about the programs described above and these resources have been provided to representative bass thank you thanks so much mark our third and final speaker for this evening is susanna fabela she's a deputy director with the l.a county department of consumer and business affairs thank you so much for the invitation to join you this evening again favela deputy director with ellie county's department of consumer business affairs the department of consumer and business affairs is committed to supporting constituents through the recovery through the recovery efforts last year our center for financial empowerment launched what we call the financial navigators program it was a timely program as the onset of the pandemic created a higher demand for resources and services as covid19 continues to

opportunities by visiting dcba dot la county dot gov thank you thank you so much once again my name is darren harris chief of staff to congresswoman karen bass so um excited to have this town hall meeting this evening we've received a lot of calls regarding the irs but i do want to provide some vaccine information for the folks who may just joined us if you are seeking a vaccine you should go to my turn.ca.gov for the folks in la county you can go to publichealth.laconty.gov and for people living in south dela and you don't have access to a computer you can call the st john well child and family center at zero 866-980-80870 eight six six nine eight zero zero eight seven zero with that we could go to our first polling question for the evening ian sure thank you thanks so much we'll get this one started here and folks you can vote on these surveys using their phone we want to know have you received at least one vaccine shot press one for yes and two for now again our first polling question for you is have you received at least one of your vaccine shots press one for yes and press two for no we'll have another survey coming up in just a minute we've got a few of them tonight but we're gonna get to our questions now we've got a lot of great questions lined up and darren it looks like we've got jody in line first jody you're live on the line go ahead please hi i just wanted to check again when are the state taxes due is it the same day in may yes this uh state income tax is due to the franchise tax board on may 17 2021 and and if you owe money i there won't be any interest or anything charged until then right that is correct it defers the both the filing and the payment so no interest or penalties will accrue until after may 17th thanks very much and thanks for having the telephone town halls they're really helpful thank you so much jody our next question is susie susie are you on the line i received the first stimulus check and haven't received the other two and my question is i'm wondering why and what can i do hi susie thank you this is annabelle with irs um the second stimulus check was basically approved by congress on december 27th and we had a statutory uh deadline of january 15th to issue millions and millions of eip2 which was what we call the second stimulus payment because we had such a short time frame to distribute so many payments unfortunately we weren't able to get to all of them which is why many people are wondering why they didn't get eip2 as far as eip3 we are currently distributing eip3 payments so that may explain why you haven't received yours quite yet just today the irs announced another 25 million payments went out um so what you can do in order to get your eip2 is file a 2020 tax return and claim it as a recovery rebate credit for eip2 for eip3 i would say wait a few more weeks to see if that amount hits the deposit uh if that you know that deposit hits your account or if you receive the paper uh check by mail and if you don't say by the summer time then i would encourage you to contact the congresswoman's office and we can look into what may have happened to eip3 but for now i can tell you that it's likely that you didn't receive eip2 because of that statutory deadline but you can claim it after recovery rebate credit for eip3 i would say just you know hold off for a few more weeks to see if you finally receive it because again we continue to issue those thank you thank you so much as i mentioned before over the past month we received numerous calls into our district office and so one call was one um question was what if i didn't get my payments yet and do i have to pay taxes on these payments can one of our speakers answer that sure so the economic impact payments are not taxable meaning even though you have to report them on your 2020 tax return you're not paying income taxes on those payments um they're not in you know you don't have to include them as income if you haven't received them what we recommend is you file your 2020 tax return and you claim them as a recovery rebate credit um that way you know it'll be a credit meaning it's still a refundable credit but the eip1 and eip2s are no longer being issued which is why you have to file the tax return to claim the massive credit and for california purposes they are not taxable so they will not be on the california tax return thank you so much another question that we received in our district office will families with young children really get a monthly check you know as i mentioned uh you know during my remarks um yes so the child tax credit is something that is currently being developed we don't have details we don't have guidance yet to be explaining exactly how it'll all work out but based on the legislation language and the american recovery plan act it looks as though families will be able to receive an advanced child tax credit which will then have to be reconciled when they file taxes next year but once again i encourage everybody to visit irs.gov for the latest information and as i promised earlier as soon as we have the details of how this child tax credit uh will play out i will make sure to send that information to congresswoman karen bass's office thank you and for california purposes we do not have a similar credit we do have the young child tax credit that's tied to cal eitc so if you have a young child under the age of six and you qualify for cal eitc then you can request a refundable credit of up to one thousand dollars per qualifying child but it will be reported on the tax return and paid at that time when the return is processed we do not have a advanced payments or a monthly payment plan thank you so much and for the folks who are joining us you can call our district office at 323-965-1422 we'll have all of the speakers contact information and we'll be sure that you get all your questions answered um our next question should i file a return this year even though i don't make that much the tax law generally tells folks that if for example if you are a single individual and you and you earned less than twelve thousand dollars in a year the tax law doesn't require you to file a tax return however for the purpose of claiming any benefits that you may be entitled to claiming the recovery rebate credit or the earned income tax credit these are benefits that you would only receive by filing a tax return so if for some reason you didn't receive eip1 or eip2 um you know definitely i would suggest that you file a 2020 tax return so that you could see those benefits and also claim any other credits that you may be eligible to receive as a result of filing a tax return and similarly but for different reasons uh california would would ask that you file a return uh in order to get the golden state stimulus uh and also if you qualify for cal eitc uh however our uh filing uh filing amount is 14 797 it's a little bit higher but a cal eitc recipient may receive uh that credit uh for an income much less than 14797 so it's worth looking into thank you so much uh we have thomas cena from our district yeah thank you darren and thomasine has asked us to read her questions so i'll go ahead and do that here she says um tax related that read the franchise franchise tax board it's a two-part question number one will we have to pay taxes on the six hundred dollars and fourteen hundred dollar stimulus payments and two in 2019 after i filed my state taxes i was reassessed and showed that thirty four dollars and now it's 359 dollars higher in penalties and they told me that they forgot to give me a 122 tax credit will i have to pay the 359 dollars so a couple questions there from thomasfina okay so can we repeat that just one time sure so she the first question is will we have to pay taxes on the six hundred and fourteen hundred dollar payments and then in 2019 she filed state taxes was reassessed and showed there were thirty four dollars and now she's been charged penalties but she was initially told they forgot to give her a 122 tax credits that looks like it would have covered that initial 34 assessment okay so that um well first of all the economic impact payment or the golden state stimulus those either those items will not be taxable for california purposes now with re in relationship to the specific account question that is better solved by calling our 800 number our general assistance line or you could actually use a feature on our website that's called chat just search for chat it's actually on the home page and you can ask a question about your account and they will want to authenticate so have your 2019 tax return with you and they can authenticate you and speak to you about specific questions on your return but without doing an account analysis there's not much help i can provide currently thank you um we will take a question from jacqueline from culver city jacqueline uh good evening thank you so much for this opportunity to see um so i received my first stimulus check directly deposited to my bank so the second one i did not the third one i just received this morning and it's pending processing my question is is you know do i have will there be an opportunity for them to issue the eip2 check directly to my bank or do i have to take advantage of the recovery rebate thank you jacqueline the deadline for irs to issue economic impact payment 1 so eip1 was december 31st 2020. the deadline for irs to issue the second economic impact payment or eip2 was january 15 2021 which means if you didn't get eip1 or eip2 the irs can no longer issue a check per se now it has to be claimed as a recovery rebate credit by filing a 2020 tax return so for your particular situation where you received eip1 but did not receive eip2 i would suggest that you file a 2020 tax return and claim it as a recovery rebate credit to receive that since you know you've already mentioned that you'll be getting your eip3 which was likely based on your 2019 tax return since you since you if you haven't filed a 2020 return so the answer is yes you'll have to claim it as a recovery rebate credit for eip102 thank you so much once again my name is darren harris chief of staff to congresswoman karen bass and i think we're ready for our second poll question ian sure thing our next poll for you folks is if you have decided to not take the vaccine when it was made available for you what is your reason press one if you don't trust it press two if you don't know where to go press three if the lines are too long and press four if you would take it or you're not eligible to take it so again if you've decided not to take the vaccine when it was made available to you what was your reason press one if you don't trust it press two if you don't know where to go press three if you think the lines are too long and press four if you would take it or you're just not eligible to take it next i appreciate that poll and uh we'll toss it back to you here darren thank you so much our next call question will be from frank frank are you on the line hi yes thank you for uh for hosting this uh my question is uh i filed my 2019 return very late right right around december 30th and uh i still haven't it's been three months and the irs website and the two people i've talked to told me they still haven't received my 2019. so i didn't get the 600 and now my account tells me that uh the system will not accept my 2020 return because it doesn't have my 2019 return so now i can't get the the third payment of the 1400 one so since i'm essentially just sitting here waiting now three months in on the irs processing my 2019 return and that's holding up my 2020 return and all of the stimuluses are tied to having my taxes in what can i do thank you thank you frank that's a very valid question you know i do apologize for any inconvenience that you may be experiencing with your filed returns i i will share that um given the closures you know 90 of irs facilities closed last year for a period of several months due to the global pandemic so you can imagine what type of backlog that created now that our employees are returning back to the processing centers there's a lot that still needs to be processed for 2019 and we're trying working very diligently to get those uh returns processed now if you filed a paper return meaning you actually had to mail it to our fresno processing center know that they are again working very diligently to processing those paper returns have to be manually entered before it shows up into the system you mail the return and if it's if it's not you know somebody has to physically retrieve it and take that paper return and enter that information and that data onto the computer system for it to show up anytime you call it then we you know type up your uh type in your social security number and find you know your account so if it's not showing up yet that means that it's probably still uh along somewhere along the pipeline will hopefully show up soon now for the issue having to do with your 2020 return not taking because the 2019 information isn't available that usually happens with tax software and the tax program asks for a particular number i believe it's the agi that can only you know that you can only get based on your 2019 return so what we're recommending to tax preparers and taxpayers that are that can get through this block is that you type zero for your agi because it's just kind of like a verification question so that you can proceed with the filing of the return and that should allow the 2020 return to process uh and then also for for eip3 as a reminder eip3 will be issued throughout the rest of the year so if you're having a bit of a you know hiccup with your 2020 tax return once that finally goes through the eip3 will generate and be issued to you so there's still time for that although i understand people need these funds now um if you claimed your second eip in your 2020 tax return that you're not able to process because of this 20 2019 issue um then you should receive your eip2 once that finally goes through now um again you know these are all issues we're facing and it's a very very busy time this is a peak season for the agency when we also have this colossal but important task of distributing economic impact payments while we're trying to process tax returns and the backlog of returns from last year so we do ask for a bit of patience and we're working diligently to get these things taken care of and to make sure that everybody receives their economic impact payment and their refunds um you know as soon as possible thank you i'm gonna go ahead and read a question from estella in south la the question is do constituents with i t i n numbers that's not a social security number that don't file taxes qualify for the california stimulus payment as far as the um golden state stimulus it's a requirement to file a tax return and either be a cal eitc recipient or an itin filer so that's the itin filer who made less than 75 000 and that's the total california agi so there has to be some earned income uh either through filing with an itin or you have to be a cal eitc recipient thank you our next question is eden from madera heights hello um thank you so much for this time and and thank you so much for this forum my question may have been touched on but i'm i'm still not clear on the answer eip3 is based on your 2019 tax return if you haven't done your 2020 yet if your 2020 income decline and you now file your 2020 does that change your qualification for eip3 yes that is correct so if you um let's say the irs how can i describe let's say we accessed your account or scanned your account for the purpose of calculating eip3 and at the time of account access the only tax return information available to us was that of 2019 and the 2019 tax return information did not make you eligible because maybe you had uh higher earnings than the the income threshold which is 75 000 but then you file a 2020 um tax return and the 2020 tax return qualifies you for eip 3 then eip3 will generate and be issued to you because eip3 will continue to be distributed through the end of the year so it's just going to take a while for assistance to catch up with the new tax returns so that then we can go in there and determine eligibility based on your 2020 earnings thank you and let's go with our last and final poll for this evening let's do it uh final poll is if you haven't had the vaccine yet do you know how to get it when you're eligible press one for yes and two for now again if you haven't had the vaccine yet do you know how to get it when you're eligible press one on your phone for yes and press two for no and back you there thank you so much thank you so much let's go ahead and wrap up our conversation for this evening as you all know when the american rescue plan um was passed last month it included payments and tax benefits to our community and so we received a lot of calls over the past month and we just thought that it was so important to have this

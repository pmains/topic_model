  XAVIER UNIVERSITY IS GETTING A BIG CHECK TODAY.  CONGRESSMAN TROY CARTER WILL JOIN UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS TO CELEBRATE THE START OF A PROJECT THAT WILL BRING NEW STEM AND PRE HEALTH ADVISORY CENTER.  CONGRESSMAN CARTER IS JOINING US VIA ZOOM RIGHT NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE PROJECT AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR XAVIER AND FOR STUDENTS THERE.  AND THIS IS >> A PRETTY BIG DEAL.  YES.  THANK YOU, ERIC.  HOW ARE YOU TODAY?  VERY GOOD.  WE'RE >> VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT.  THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING DIRECT FUNDING TO XAVIER UNIVERSITY.  THIS TWO POINT FIVE DOLLARS MILLION WILL HELP KICK START A PROJECT THAT WILL CREATE A STEM CENTER AT THE ST. MICHAEL'S DORMITORY, A DORMITORY THAT HOLDS SIGNIFICANT AND HISTORIC VALUE.  BUT NOW WE'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE AN EXPANDED HEALTH ADVISING AND TUTORIAL CENTER FOR STEM SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENERGY ENGINEERING RATHER AND MATH.  THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM THIS >> DORMITORY INTO A CENTER OF ENGINEERING AND MATH EXCELLENCE SOMETHING I'M VERY, VERY PROUD OF.  THIS FUNDING WILL ALLOW THE UPPER FLOORS TO BE NEW CLASSROOMS, STEM EDUCATION AND THIS IS A PART OF OUR DIRECT SPENDING OF SOME THIRTY ONE POINT FIVE DOLLARS MILLION THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING BACK FROM CONGRESS AND COMMUNITY PROJECTS AS A PART OF OUR APPROPRIATIONS.  YEAH, AND >> HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME FOR TEACHING FUTURE DOCTORS.  PHARMACISTS HAVE BEEN VERY BIG IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND THEY WANT TO EXPAND THAT EVEN MORE >>.  ABSOLUTELY.  THIS GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY XAVIER UNIVERSITY IS KNOWN INTERNATIONALLY FOR NOT ONLY GETTING THE MOST AFRICAN-AMERICANS INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL BUT ALSO SEEING THEM THROUGH GRADUATION AND ACTUALLY BECOMING MEDICAL DOCTORS A PROGRAM THAT RIVALS MANY OTHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  XAVIER IS HARD SCIENCES HAS BEEN A PROGRAM THAT IS INCREDIBLY RENOWNED FOR EXCELLENCE AND THIS GIVES A YET ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO HONE IN ON THAT CREATE MORE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE THIS KIND OF EDUCATION AND >> WHERE'S THIS MONEY COMING FROM?  >> THIS IS A PART OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS COMMUNITY PROJECTS, COMMUNITY PROJECTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO SPECIFICALLY ENHANCE THE LOCAL PARTS OF OUR DISTRICT TO IDENTIFY A WORTHWHILE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT IN THIS CASE THROUGHOUT CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT L.A. TO A PROJECT THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT WILL HAVE AN ENHANCEMENT TO A PROJECT OR PROGRAM.  THESE ARE DIRECT ALLOCATIONS FROM OUR CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS AND IF I CAN SWITCH GEARS FOR A SECOND TO THE TO THE WAR IN UKRAINE,  PRESIDENT BIDEN IS ASKING THE CONGRESS FOR A THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN AID.  THAT'S A LOT THAT'S ON TOP OF THE BILLIONS THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS ALREADY GIVEN SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI WAS IN UKRAINE AND TOLD OF A LOT OF SOLINSKY THAT THAT THE U.S. WILL WILL BE WITH THERE WITH THEM UNTIL A VICTORY IS ONE.  IS THAT ADMINISTRATION POLICY OR IS SHE JUST SPEAKING AT LEAST IN HER OPINION ON THAT NOW >>?  I THINK IT'S IT'S UNIVERSAL.  I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CONGRESS HAVE SPOKEN IN ONE VOICE.  THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY UNIFYING EFFORT BETWEEN HOUSE DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, SENATE DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, A COMPLETELY BIPARTISAN EFFORT RECOGNIZING THAT WE MUST PROTECT OUR FLANK SO WE MUST PROTECT DEMOCRACY ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR AMERICA TO CONTINUE TO ENJOY OUR FREEDOM.  SO STANDING WITH OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN UKRAINE IS VERY MUCH A PART OF POLICY THAT PROTECTS US AS WELL.  AND >> NO MATTER HOW LONG IT GOES, IF THIS BECOMES A WAR THAT GOES ON I MEAN SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID IT COULD GO FOR MONTHS MORE EVEN YEARS MORE >> . WELL, YOU KNOW, WE WE ARE WE FIND OURSELVES ALONG WITH OUR NATO PARTNERS PROTECTING OUR ALLIES.  IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT PUTIN HAS STARTED THIS WAR BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO AMERICA AND ALL OF OUR ALLIES THAT WE STRENGTHEN OUR FLANKS AND PROTECT AND IF IT MEANS SENDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS THE CONGRESS HAS DONE, WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING AND WE'LL HAVE TO JUST KIND OF PLAY THIS DAY BY DAY, WEEK BY WEEK, MONTH BY MONTH.  BUT THE ONE THING WE WANT TO BE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR ON IS AMERICA WILL NOT RUN.  AMERICA WILL STAND UP AND PROTECT ITS ALLIES AND WILL MAINTAIN ITS PLACE AS A SUPERPOWER.  BUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING DEMOCRACY ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE BY PROTECTING DEMOCRACY ALL OVER THE WORLD WE MAINTAIN THE PROTECTIONS FOR AMERICA.  SORRY >>, CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  APPRECIATE THAT.  WE'LL LOOK FOR YOU AT THE XAVIER.  CONGRESSMAN CARTER WILL BE PRESENTING A TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR CHECK TO XABI UNIVERSITY LATER TODAY AT ST. MICHAEL RESIDENCE HALL WHICH IS WHERE THE CENTER WILL BE LOCATED.  HE'LL BE JOINED BY A HOST OF UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE MONEY WILL FUND THE NEW STEM AND PRE HEALTH STUDENT ADVISING CENTER MULTIPLE NEW ORLEANS COUNCIL

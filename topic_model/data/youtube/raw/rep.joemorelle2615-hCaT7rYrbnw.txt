hi this is congressman joe morelli on what would have been her 202nd birthday i want to take a moment to pay tribute to susan b anthony a trailblazer activist and rochester icon susan b anthony became a household name for her courageous acts of protest against injustice and inequality particularly in fighting to expand women's rights she took her fight to the ballot box where she was famously arrested for voting in the 1872 presidential election a full 48 years before the 19th amendment was ratified giving women the right to vote that act of heroism along with many others throughout her life would prove to be a pivotal step in the women's suffrage movement our nation is a better place because of her unwavering courage and conviction i hope susan b anthony would take pride in the strides america has made in the fight for equality but there is still so much more to be done we face new barriers that threaten our progress from access to the ballot to access to essential health care these are fights we cannot and will not abandon in the words of susan b anthony herself failure is impossible so on this susan b anthony day let us pledge to march down the trail she blazed for us and carry on the fight for true equality for all you can always count on me to be an ally in that fight thank you

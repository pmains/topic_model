you want to hold the administration accountable for what has happened you want to hear from whistleblowers who have first-hand knowledge about what went south right biden tends to throw his own people under the bus right he says well the military told me to do this the intel community never told me that cotton lies multiple times and we're wondering what else is there this whistleblower page the exact same one i've been using for the issues in the military and crt and all that so it's just at crenshaw.house.gov where officials from the department of state department of defense the intelligence community they can go and tell us the real story okay tell us what the facts are compared to what the minded administration is saying and those those facts whether it's decisions leading up to this uh or the execution of it right we need to know that's the old that's the best way that we can get the right information um and actually hold this administration accountable so biden knew that all of our helicopters all of our equipment all of this these this deadly american weaponry would fall into the hands of the taliban eventually they knew this before they pulled out that is an extremely important fact this is a consistent theme biden will create the worst possible mess and then act like like he's a hero as the arsonist tries to put out the fire that they created and left people inside the house when he said that the military wanted to stick with the deadline of august 31st the only reason that is is because biden put them in such an awful position that it was becoming a problem for for the protection of the force and also biden didn't even give the military a mission of getting everybody out the fact that they knew it would happen and continued along this plan should is an abomination right such a dereliction of duty

welcome back after tuesday's courtroom decision that held a bad cop accountable for his actions california congresswoman karen bass is taking the next step forward towards meaningful change as lead author of the george floyd justice in policing act she joins us now live from d.c welcome congresswoman welcome welcome thank you thank you it's it it's been almost 48 hours since the jury reached the guilty verdict on all three counts what do you think was the was the thing that really moved this needle what was different well i think what was different is that the evidence was just overwhelming and to see a man tortured to death over nine minutes and to have all the expert witnesses come on and say that the only reason he died was because of the knee on the neck and the defense was not able to put on credible witnesses in fact their main scientific witness was had it was under a lawsuit for fabricating his testimony in previous cases and so i think it was just overwhelming congresswoman you know police officers are so rarely convicted especially of murder um by president biden said that this could be a moment could be a moment of significant change do you agree that this is a tipping point for police reform yes instead of saying could be i would say will be i absolutely believe that we're going to get this over the finish line and it's tremendous positive momentum from tuesday because exactly as you said this is a rare moment and so we have to capture that energy and channel it and i do believe that we're going to do that there's a lot of goodwill going on here on the hill democrats and republicans working together congresswoman the prosecution in this case was very careful not to paint this trial as anti-police they actually said it was pro-police because officers like derek shelvin make the rest look really bad now we also saw 10 law enforcement officers testify against chauvin do you think this verdict is the first step in changing police behavior well the verdict no i would love to think that but i do hope that it put puts police officers on notice that you know the blue wall was cracked and it was incredible to see the officers come forward and testify because you're right that never happens but that's not going to be enough first of all of course i was glad at the verdict but we need to be very mindful that a sentencing needs to happen as well and in the rare occasion when there have been guilty verdicts there have been judges that have given uh defendants a slap on the wrist and that just can't happen this time so i think we're in a a great position but it's going to take policy legislative change one on the federal level and on the state and local level to prevent these kind of occasions from continuing to happen congresswoman before the verdict was reached president biden weighed in saying he was praying for the right verdict we also heard congresswoman waters comments that protests should quote get more confrontational if the verdict came back not guilty do you think it's appropriate for politicians to weigh in while a jury is still deliberating and do you think they might have i'm sorry inadvertently given shelving grounds for an appeal well i was actually shocked when the judge said that um i have a hard time but i do have to admit i'm not a lawyer have a hard time seeing how a statement from a congresswoman would lead to an appeal and i do think that she was referring to protest and frankly if it hadn't been for massive protests and i am only referring to peaceful protests if it hadn't been for that momentum last year we would have never had the bill in the first place and i think when president biden made his statement if i'm not mistaken the jury was already sequestered that is correct the jury was sequestered oh she's still talking okay i i did i didn't i didn't hear your last words something went wrong with the technology but yes i wanted to reiterate yes the jury was sequestered when when president biden made that statement so it's a moot point uh as the jury was preparing to give the uh the chauvin verdict sixteen-year-old uh mikaya bryant was shot four times and killed by ohio police body cam footage shows she had a knife but her family claimed she was the one who called police saying people were fighting outside her house it's very much an active investigation and it's confusing to me i must say perhaps you can elucidate i mean what what is your reaction to this point well first of all that one was particularly personal uh to me because one of the issues i've worked on for decades is our child welfare system and she was a foster child she was in a group home and it is a very common occurrence that in those group homes there are fights and the police are often involved but you know what we have to take a step back and question why do so many people die at the hands of police in the united states i think it's too early to say what happened in that shooting we were all looking at the the video cams and the officer certainly said that he had no choice because she was close to hurting another individual but you know since the trial started on march 29th there have been over 69 officer involved shootings that have resulted in death at some point we need to take a step back in our country and say why is it that so many officer-involved interactions with uh citizens result in death you you probably saw the original report on george floyd it said that he died that there was a medical emergency if it hadn't been for that 17 year old that took that videotape george floyd's murder would have just gone by the wayside and since he was killed may 29th of 2020 there have been over a hundred officer involved shootings that have resulted in death so it's time that we take a real deep look at law enforcement in the united states and look at how do we change the culture so that we don't have these situations how do we prevent them and we have some very specific ideas a few miles down the road from george floyd's murder we saw dante wright shot and killed by officer kim potter his funeral will be held today we have heard claims potter allegedly mistook her gun for a taser she's resigned and is charged with second-degree manslaughter now she seems to be saying it was a mistake and a lot of us are having a hard time understanding how you can confuse a taser with a gun can you well not only that how is it that you've been on the force for 26 years i mean i would have a hard time understanding that if you'd been on the force for six months but we always say that training is the issue and it just shows the training is not always the issue because you can't tell me she wasn't trained but i have a bigger question why was he stopped to begin with he was stopped because his tight his tags were expired well apparently in that area and in many other areas around our country because of covet the department of motor vehicles had been way behind so lots of people have expired tags then they said they stopped him because he had air freshener hanging off of his mirror see one of the things in our bill that we are going to get signed by president biden is looking at racial profiling we have to look at the fact that african americans and latinos are stopped at extremely disproportionate rates so yes we can examine what happened at the moment that dante was killed i want to raise the question as to why he was stopped to begin with we're going to have more with congresswoman karen bass when we come back we'll be right back we're back with congresswoman karen bass sonny congresswoman we clearly still have so much work to do in addressing uh policing in america you mentioned earlier when it came to the bryant shooting that the police officer said he had no choice uh and some are saying that of course he had no choice because he couldn't even tell the age of of the children involved and as you know black children are often adultified it's called adultification bias because young black girls as early as five are considered not to need protection the same amount of protection that white girls uh need and you are a lead author of the george floyd justice and policing act which has already passed the house but is now stalled in the senate the act includes a federal ban on chokeholds and importantly gets rid of qualified immunity for police officer in my view that's the most important but what are the biggest changes you want to see when it comes to reform sure absolutely well qualified immunity as you mentioned the ability to sue an officer holding officers accountable and so the ability to prosecute an officer because even the prosecution of derek chavin was unusual and then raising the standards of policing policing should be like any other profession so there's eighteen thousand police departments in the united states and there's no national standards there's no accreditation we should be able to collect data so that we understand whether or not racial profiling has taken place we should be able to provide grants to communities so communities can actually re-envision public safety i think that there's a lot of things that we can do and even though the bill right now is currently stalled in the senate i will tell you that we have been having conversations all along and i feel very positive that after the energy from this uh trial and the success of the verdict that we're going to be able to get this across the finish line and soon i love that our thanks to you congressman karen bass you come back anytime tell us what's going on and how we can all be better citizens we of course will be right back thank you

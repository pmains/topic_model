epa is indeed proposing a regulation that future coal-fired facilities must implement a carbon capture system that reduces their emissions by 50 but like you've heard from some of the other speakers it cannot be performed there are no commercially a applications available we've even heard testimony as you've heard from before from the epa saying we know that it can't be done for 10 years or more therefore the mission here is no coal-fired electric powerhouses will be constructed in america until this technology is available now that has to be coupled with the concept of maybe through research and development maybe that'll happen but we all know here in congress that this administration has cut the research money in national energy technology lab last year 40 this year 41 how are we going to achieve this objective if we don't have the research into the development of this process you've heard the quotes i'll add one more joe biden who said the vice president has said that they don't this administration does not support clean coal technology what better manifestation of it in this particular rule that they're that they're promulgating they're trying to bankrupt and stop us from burning coal and what they're doing is hurting the working men and women all across america putting them out of work these 1200 people we've learned that aep has already canceled one of its own projects the mountaineer plant because they found out that that cost was going to be as i understand it increasing the utility bills by 80 percent to consumers to schools to manufacturers and they chose not to do it so for anyone that believes that there's no war on coal they're in denial this president administration and those who support these are hurting our consumers they're hurting our nation they're closed-minded about where we're going to go in developing our fossil fuels the foss the fuel that fueled our industrial revolution so this war on coal must stop there's ideologically driven regulations must not be implemented until the technology and the economics justify their costs thank you very much and i yield back this time i recognize the gentleman from california mr waxman for five minutes thank you very much mr chairman this committee has heard

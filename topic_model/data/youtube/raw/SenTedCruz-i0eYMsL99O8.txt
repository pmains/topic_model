the senator from Texas Madam President dr. King's profoundly just and moral letter from a Birmingham jail continued there comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair I hope sirs you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable in patience you express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws this is certainly a legitimate concern since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws one may well ask how can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others the answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws just and unjust I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws one has not only illegal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws conversely one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws I would agree with st. Augustine that an unjust law is no law at all now what is the difference between the two how does one determine whether a law is just or unjust a just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law for the law of God an unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law to put it in the terms of st. Thomas Aquinas an unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law any law that uplifts human personality is just any law that degrades human personality is unjust all segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality it gives the segregate er a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority segregation to use the terminology of the Jewish Jewish philosopher Martin Buber substitutes an I it relationship for an aye thou relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things hence segregation is not only politically economically and sociologically unsound it is morally wrong and sinful Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation is not segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation his awful estrangement his terrible sinfulness thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court for it is morally right and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances for they are morally wrong let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws an unjust law as a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself this is difference made legal by the same token a just law is a law that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself this is sameness made legal let me give another explanation a law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that as a result of being denied the right to vote had no part in enacting or devising the law who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state segregation laws was democratically elected throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters and there are some counties in which even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population not a single Negro is registered can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application for instance I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit now there is nothing wrong with having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade but such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment privilege to peaceably assemble and protest I hope you were able to see the distinction I am trying to point out in no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law as would the rabid segregationist that would lead to Anarchy one who breaks an unjust law must do so openly lovingly and with a willingness to accept the penalty I submit that an individual who breaks the law that conscious is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice is in reality expressing the highest respect for law of course there's nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience it was evidence some blindly in the refusal of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake it was practiced superbly by the early Christians who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire to a degree academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practice civil disobedience in our own nation the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience we should never forget that everything that adolf hitler did in germany was quote on quote legal and everything that the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was quote unquote illegal it was quote unquote illegal to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany even so I am sure that had I lived in Germany at the time I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers if today I lived in a communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed I would openly advocate disobeying that country's anti religious laws I must make two honest confessions to you my Christian and Jewish brothers first I must confess that over the past few years I had been gravely disappointed with the white moderate I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negroes great stumbling block in his stride towards freedom is not the white Citizens Council ER or the Ku Klux Klan er but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than the Justice who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice who constantly says I agree with you in the goal you seek but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the negro to wait for a quote more convenient season shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill-will lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight to a substantive and positive peace in which all men risk the dignity and worth of human personality actually we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension we merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive we bring it out in the open where it can be seen and dealt with like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all of its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light injustice must be exposed with all the tension its exposure creates to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured madam Speaker I yield to the senator from Virginia

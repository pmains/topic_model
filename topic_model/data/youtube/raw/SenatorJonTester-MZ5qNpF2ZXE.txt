responsible for in bath at USDA I'd like to have dialogue with that person we will do that as we have with Senator Roberts as well whose vitally interested there within Kansas State will do a great job we think the Department of Agriculture has a core competency to manage the in bath facility and we would love to have those conversations and by the way you're you're visually there you've got a Secretary of Agriculture that understands that was a pile of grain sorghum that was vulnerable to the washing machine and solar issues early on 99 points the price of grain sorghum dropped in my home town of Plainville Kansas on the day the tariffs were announced we're very mindful of that Thank You mr. secretary please come to Kansas senator tester thank you madam chair and I want to thank you for being here today secretary Purdue very much appreciate hearing from you and I've got a few thank-yous first of all I thank you for your commitment to use commodities instead of cash you're right on I thank you for the work that you did on Brazilian beef took a lot of guts and you did it and you did it early and I think it's at a standard that I very much like the Conservation Reserve Program part in your budget where it's 80% of fields won't work if I got a 10 acre field I'm not going to put 8 acres into CRP and form the other two acres however 80% of whole farms will work and I think that's a good policy what we saw in the 80s was people putting whole farms in and a mass exodus from the land so I thank you for your vision and hopefully you have the same vision in that as I do I want to talk about crop insurance because when I go home most people are pretty damn happy with the farm bill they are and they tell me unequivocally don't screw up crop insurance it's it's our lifeblood it is our safety net you know in this proposal for the second year in a row you're gonna cut subsidies for crop insurance and I know there are some out there that don't understand agriculture that think that that's just a good thing to do you understand agriculture and I will tell you that it's unacceptable and I want to know if this is real or if you really really have an expectation of us putting that money back in and this is just a way to look make the budget look better I think you rightly articulated my view of crop insurance certainly and understand the value of it and I think it's one of the other great programs in 2014 that was guided toward producer risk management yeah that we can continue to utilize I think again I support the crop insurance program and will support what you all added in 2018 all right to utilize that thank you just tell you that you know and it's been expressed earlier we did some stuff on direct payments and we make crop insurance a better program I believe I would love to tell you that we don't need taxpayer dollars in that program I think you'd like it too but the truth is as we do otherwise it'll be unaffordable people won't use it we're dealing with nature we're dealing volatile markets and I want to talk about those volatile markets for a little bit it's been touched on already Mexico is the biggest importer of American grain in the country they just signed an agreement with Argentina for 30,000 tons of wheat late last year due to a number of reasons but probably the NAFTA talks maybe the border wall maybe tariffs period our largest trading partner Canada is uncertain and look there's a lot of things wrong with NAFTA you and I both know but I'm gonna tell you that you pull out of this and it's gonna be major havoc to the markets you combine that with what's going on with TPP where I believe 11 nations signed it United States wasn't part of it and one of the countries was not China by the way we got we've got a series of things that are going on with the administration that are not going to be helpful for farmgate prices and so if you combine that with the tariffs on steel and aluminum and in fact the durum and cattle and other things China said no it's a huge market and as the chairman said we should be expanding I'm not contracting them but what I hear on the press is the presidents could say you know what don't worry about it farmers we're gonna give the responsible the secretary of Purdue to make you whole not exactly those words but that's what I hear that means that we're going to be depending on more taxpayer dollars not unless we just talked about the administration's view of cutting aid to crop insurance and now we're gonna turn around and say you know what because of what I believe are uncertain trade policies we're gonna take more taxpayer dollars and reimburse farmers who don't want government subsidies as a general rule they want their paycheck coming from the marketplace could you address what you're gonna do when in fact these markets go to hell because they're gonna and they are well let's address what we're hopefully will do to keep them from going wherever you say they're going yeah well the truth is sunny and I really like you you were really a good guy and I mean that I mean you're a guy I'd like to have a beer with but the truth is is this what's going on right now is having impacts right now today and I had laid eyes or in my office he said we're signing bilaterals it's been 15 months has there been in being a bilateral signed I don't know of any but I know we've backed out of TPP I know we're talking about backing out of NAFTA I know we're putting tariffs on Chinese goods I know look I get China's bad actor they've been doing stuff but you put me and my neighbors out of business in the process and I'm not saying you personally but the administration we got a major problem here so I know it's to get a better deal but in the meantime those prices go to hell we're done let's talk about where we were all in the trade negotiations again we were I think we had a successful negotiation with chorus and that will be announced very soon agriculture is better off no worse off than we were with chorus we are expecting senator a an agreement on NAFTA that has some improvements for agriculture maybe not all that we wanted but some improvements with agricultural NAFTA I know that you and I probably wouldn't use the same negotiating style the president Trump does but it appears that even with China calling the question on some of these things look there no doubt I'm anxious producers are anxious it's their livelihood it's their future but we we do expect that we can get negotiations here done on those I think that will relieve the anxiety meter to a degree and then deal with the Chinese issue okay well I would just tell you that we had some pretty damn good years from wait 214 in Montana because we had good prices and we had good production the last three years have been pretty tough if this tax on the margin for error here is non-existent people are going to it's going to be remember the 1980s if this doesn't get solved pretty damn quick we're gonna see a repeat of the 1980s I don't want to see myself losing the farm or my neighbors that's all and I know you don't either I hear you and I agree with you thanks senator combs Thank You mr. chairman welcome mr. secretary it's good to see you American can

Senator cotton thank you so much Center cotton miss Colin I want to return to a topic address by Senator Cruz Senator Booker and it's about the low morale at the FTC under your tenure Center crew cited a letter um of former employees but we do have data on this from survey from current employees in response Center a Booker you implied that your employees may be concerned about what you call the future of work that's not what this survey says and again this is from the office of personnel management President Biden's office of personnel management on one question asked whether they have a high degree of confidence in my organization senior leaders to maintain high standards of honesty Integrity it went from 87 in 2020 to 53 percent in 2021 on another in my organization senior leaders generate high levels of motivation and commitment in the workforce again it went from 80 percent in 2020 42 percent in 2021 on a third measure I have a high level of respect for my organization senior leaders and it went from 83 percent in 2020 to 49 in 2021. Ms Khan why do your employees have so little faith and confidence in your leadership thanks Senator as I said I take these survey results extremely seriously um the survey was done quite early in my tenure and since then we've been diligently identifying the source of some of these results and making sure we're taking aggressive steps to address them do you think it reflects well that it was done early in your tenure I mean you you took over there in in June of last year that's correct the survey was conducted in November five months later so you think a 34 drop in the number of employees who have confidence in your honesty integrity is something that reflects well on your leadership in just five months on the job Senator as I said I take these results very seriously so does my senior team and we're addressing it do you think you'll improve this year uh we haven't yet heard when we'll get the results back from OPM but of course we'll be looking at that closely Mr Cantor we may not agree on every bit of antitrust law but I want to congratulate you on your performance in that same survey it improved on almost every measure of senior leadership so you must be doing something right at the antitrust division so good for you um I'd like to talk now about the environmental social and governance movement also known as ESG which is really just a effort to weaponize corporations to reshape Society in ways that voters would never endorse at The Ballot Box specifically I want to talk about the ESG group known as climate action 100 plus a group of investors and activists who have pledged to limit fossil fuel production both individually and collectively the investment firm BlackRock is a prominent member of this group last month 19 State Attorneys General signed on to a letter to Blackrock CEO Larry Fink the letter stated and this is a quote blackrock's coordinated conduct with other financial institutions and to impose Net Zero raises antitrust concerns group boycotts restraining trade or concerted refusals to deal and again this is another quote from the letter clearly run afoul of section one of the Sherman Act Miss Khan do you agree that collusion to restrict Supply is generally unlawful as a general matter collusion is unlawful there's no antitrust exemption because you call something ESG as their uh no to the contrary we've seen firms come to us and try to claim an ESG exemption and we've had to explain to them clearly that there is no such thing so do you then share the state attorney's General's concerns that ESG coordination among financial institutions including BlackRock could run afoul of the Sherman Act or other antitrust laws I'd want to look at that issue in particular more closely before sharing a opinion on the legality but certainly those types of cooperation or agreements in as much as they can affect competition are always relevant to us Mr Cantor yes um it's long-standing Department policy not to comment on specific matters or specific companies but you know generally speaking directionally Senator I agree with the sentiment that collusion is anti-competitive and I also agree with the underlying sentiment that uh when when firms have substantial power they use that power to achieve anti-competitive ends that that should be actionable under the antitrust law okay thank you I'm glad that you both agree that this raises concerns and antitrust laws um as have many Wall Street lawyers and even Progressive law professors not groups of people that often agree with each other um I I believe that enforcement or at least investigation in these matters needs to be pursued more vigorously uh I think it may not be because the whole point of the Bible administration's energy policy is to constrain supply of coal and oil and gas and you see the Dreadful consequences of that in what's happening in Europe and what will happen there this winter so I hope that more we get more vigorous enforcement but if we don't perhaps we'll get more vigorous oversight in January thank you all

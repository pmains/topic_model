well good morning everybody my name's Roger Marshall I'm a congressman from the state of Kansas I just started a year ago and I'm a physician as well I was a private practicing ob/gyn for 25 years in rural America a little city called great bin Kansas and like many of you I've been on call every day or every other day for 25 years was also part of a physician don't hospital and also oversaw three County Health Department so I think I've got to see healthcare through several sets of eyes I'm very honored that the physicians working together association would ask me to participate in this program and I think we have several questions that you have submitted and Chris is going to read the first one for me okay you know I think that this really gets at the at the root problem you know when people ask me what's the biggest problem in America the answer is the cost of health care now that we have national security moving in a positive direction we've decreased regulations for for business and the economy's rolling the number one concern and just not by my measurement by many polls by the Small Business Association the number one concern is the cost of healthcare and when we think about addressing that I have three basic principles for rolling down the cost of health care and number one is is transparency just like this question answers that every every state could have a website that would which would show prices as well as outcomes I would let every physician group every the hospital organizations figure out what type of issues they want to measure as far as outcomes the next transparency is number one the next one is consumerization how do we make patients better consumers and we do that by giving them expanded HSAs and the third principle is innovation innovation can do more to drive the cost of health care down than any legislation I can write if we just get government out of the way so very much believe that transparency innovation and consumerization are the next steps a position shaped how you practice politics you know I think I have learned so many positive things about being a physician and as I speak to constituents as I speak to other congressmen in my mind their patients and as we were all taught in medical school that getting a good history is way more important than being able to have a specific examination of the body so I try to listen really hard what they're saying and trying to help people describe exactly what's going on so everything I do here I look at it like I'm a physician and I tend not to overreact I like to get all the results in I want the lab tests I want the x-rays I want the MRI I tend not to overreact and you know my job is that I've been here before my job is to help the patient get through it so as I get my feet on the ground on the issues that I'm responsible for I try to bring that position a Meinhard approach of a yellow scientist but yet with a heart trying to look through everybody sets of eyes right so consolidation well you know what's happened over the past 10 years is government over-regulation of every every industry and no one's felt that more than hospitals then I would say banking would be number two whenever there's government over-regulation it creates consolidation when there's consolidation of industry or consolidation of choices it's going to drive the prices up and what we're seeing in healthcare right now are multiple all ago monopolies across the country and and indeed they are driving the price up so we need legislation and laws that will encourage more choices for consumers more choices for patients rather than less look I've had a nurse practitioner in my practice since the day I started and she was incredible but we touched base every day we had very very good policies and I think through 25 years we never had a hiccup we've had piays work in our emergency room now but always under the direction of a physician so I'm completely against nurse practitioners or pas having independent practices and they need to work with physicians certainly that's that's very much the truth I bet a third of our day now is spent doing dotting i's crossing T's the Affordable Health Care Act and concerned the computerize of medical records has basically made us all data entry people you know I know in my practice I I got along with just three nurses for 25 years and once the ACA came around I had to hire two more nurses and actually cut back on the number of patients we were seeing basically two nurses spending eight hours a day ten hours a day doing data entry for me so we have to roll it back and that's why I was in favor one reason I was in favor of repealing the entire ACA and that was done on the house side but the Senate could not do it very much interested in fixing health care and this is part of the fix is somehow rolling back these regulations stay tuned the president is doing some doing some great things right now dr. price was doing some great things in HHS and kind of waiting now for the new HHS director to kind of get their feet on the ground and help roll back some of those regulations as well skyrocketing drug prices you know I think number one I talked about this innovation issue going on right now our current FDA product FDA processes prevent competition from coming to market very quickly I certainly we want to make sure that we have safe medication that's always our top priority but right now it would take ten years and a billion dollars to get a new drug from entering the FDA process to being approved so somehow we have to streamline that maintain the safety of it as well but we have to streamline that process so that would be one one situation certainly I'm concerned about what's happening with some of the PP PBMs we want more transparency with those transactions so there would be another opportunity as well so just to wrap things up I want to once again thank the physicians working together association for giving me the chance an opportunity to speak I would ask all of you to consider going to our website if you just google Congressman Roger Marshall it'll take you to

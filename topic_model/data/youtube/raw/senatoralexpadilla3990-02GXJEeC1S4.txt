for your questions thank you mr chairman um seven minutes goes by fast i'll jump right into it mr secretary a major breakdown of the us immigration system is the failure to consider the fate of the children of long-term visa holders now these are children who have parents who have applied for a green card and are in the u.s with legal status legal status but their applications remains stuck in years-long backlogs and as a result there are currently over two hundred and fifty thousand children who are at risk of aging out from the protection of their parents lawful status lawful status when these children turn 21 they face the impossible decision of leaving their families to self-deport to a country that is often completely foreign to them or remaining in the united states undocumented and living in the shadows to address this problem i introduced the americans america's children act to help fix this often overlooked inequity in our immigration system now i'm proud to say that it enjoys from the start bipartisan support including from my colleague senator paul member of this committee but as you all know mr secretary we have a lot more work to do to clear backlogs and reduce processing times at uscis that's partly why i'm pleased to see the 765 million dollars included in the pres in the president's budget request this year to help work through the processing backlog secretary marcus do you think it makes sense for our immigration system to allow children to be brought here lawfully on their parents visa raised and educated here oftentimes for decades but not have a clear opportunity to become an american citizen because their parents green card petition is stuck in the backlog senator padilla i think the legislation that you proposed is one element of much needed massive fix to our broken immigration system thank you and can you please explain what the 765 million dollars requested for uscis will be used for and whether it will be sufficient to work through the backlogs senator padilla the 765 million is comprised of two parts one to address the backlog if i'm not mistaken in two to hire additional asylum officers to implement the asylum officer rule that will take effect later this month which we believe is a very much needed reform to the asylum system that will that will not be enough uh to put u.s citizenship and immigration services on firm financial footing that agency was dismantled it was on the brink of bankruptcy it is funded predominantly through the fees it collects and that is why we are very focused on a fee rule the fee rule calibrates the fees that we charge applicants it calibrates them according to the costs incurred in administering uh those benefits and there has not it's it's a law that a fee rule is to be promulgated i believe every two years and it's been over six years i think that a fee rule has been promulgated which is why we're so focused on it there's two issues i want to get to so i just asked that whatever additional resources uh that you would need to successfully clear the backlogs share that with my office share that with this committee we want to be helpful second i want to highlight fema's emergency food and shelter program which provides funding for ngos as well as state and local jurisdictions along our border i was disappointed to see that the amount requested in the budget for this part of the program was only 24 million dollars and as you know border area local governments and ngos doing this kind of work provide critical services that are typically functions of the federal government such as temporary shelter food transportation for families and adults who are released from government custody without proper funding support operations will inevitably be scaled back so my question is a simple yes no will you commit to working with me to ensure that we have the necessary resources to meet the needs of organizations and local governments providing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable migrant families and individuals yes i will senator and that is actually one of the six pillars in our plan that we uh detailed in the memorandum i published that's great thank you and the final area uh deals with uh wildfires you know historically the stafford act which governs fema's disaster efforts has not been explicitly inclusive of wildfires which are increasing in frequency and severity throughout the west not just in california due to the unique nature of wildfires california has experienced tremendous difficulty after catastrophic wildfires in getting approval for federal disaster assistance most recently the calder fire had victims who were denied individual assistance despite the fact that more than a thousand structures were destroyed and despite president biden himself having visited the area and committed assistance from the administration secretary marcus will you commit to working with my office to ensure that the disaster assistance needs of all communities impacted by wildfires are more fully supported by dhs and fema yes i will senator and we have a number of different efforts underway in that in that regard understanding very well understanding that both the frequency and the gravity of wildfires that this country is experiencing has have increased and in fact our department is working with the department of agriculture in the department of interior in setting up a commission to address of this very threat to the security of our homeland okay thank you mr secretary mr charles reserved my further question for the second round

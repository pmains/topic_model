well going into this pandemic nobody knew what the numbers would be like we didn't know how easy it was to transmit we didn't know how many would die a lot of us including on this show assumed the worst now with more testing it has become much clearer who is actually threatened by the virus and who is not people under 50 for example appear to be at very little risk and that includes the vast majority of America's prisoners across four American states 3277 inmates have tested positive for the corona virus 96% of them have not shown any symptoms at all despite that some politicians are exploiting this disaster to continue their long-standing demands that criminals go free even as you are harassed by authorities for leaving your home on MSNBC over the weekend Nancy Pelosi explained that prisoners must go free all of them why it's not because they'll ever endanger Pelosi herself who was safely ensconced on her estate in Napa no it's because of the Bible and our caucus we are very devoted to the Gospel of Matthew when I was hungry you fed me when I was homeless you shelter me yet when I was in prison you visited me and so this for us is a part of our value system meanwhile the only person in America apparently was going to prison is Roger stone he is scheduled to go this week for the crime of having the wrong political views that's real we'll bring you more on that when he does if he does meanwhile in Congress senator cory booker's introduced a bill that would end all detention for immigration offenses as long as the corona virus exists he wants to fight a virus spread by international travel by instituting de facto open borders is a very serious person but it's not just about immigration or emigration offenders deadly criminals are going free as well in New York a man accused of rape was just let go as a preventative measure not clear what they were trying to prevent not rape because ten days later use arrested for attempting to rape another woman in Pennsylvania two prisoners will release from the state's supermax prison and many more including violent criminals will release from maximum-security facilities crime rates are going up in wash you see they've gone way up they may be lying about it but it's real in Washington State there are plans to release a man accused of fatally running over a woman then fleeing the scene this is lunacy Congressman Matt gates is introducing legislation to deport detained illegal aliens instead of releasing them into our country he joins us tonight amazing you to even congressman thanks for joining us amazing you would even have to propose a piece of legislation like this why are you doing that well the problem with Nancy Pelosi statement is that we aren't visiting the prisoners under her plan they'd be visiting us just imagine the post coronavirus world that the left is trying to create they want kovat catch and release on the border that's the cory booker bill that you described they want to move cellblock C into our neighborhoods and then they want Americans stuck at home waiting for some inefficient government system to deliver a check while the place where we used to work is shut down waiting for another Chinese will swab to be delivered so we can enter phase three so my idea is instead of releasing criminal illegal aliens into our communities we should deport them immediately that's why I filed the pandemic Act and you know what Tucker that's what Mexico does right now Mexico is seeing success curbing illegal immigration because they are immediately deporting people as a consequence of coronavirus I think we should love our country at least as much as Mexico loves theirs of course this is totally unrelated to love of country in fact you'd have to despise your country I would think too proposed the legislation booker has what do you think the agenda is here exactly why is he doing this this is part virtue signaling but this is the left using the corona virus to try to have all of the social engineering that they seek they really do want a world where there are no borders where American taxpayers have to provide for everyone in the world whether they follow our laws or not and just think as the Republicans and President Trump were working to provide provision to American workers and the American businesses in people you have the left saying that they had to hold back to gain leverage for their agenda we shouldn't just be horrified that they would use coronavirus for leverage we should be frightened by the actual agenda that they're trying to execute where ms-13 is getting the moving van the north at the same time you've got them inviting their cousins from prison to come live in the subdivision next to you yeah I don't think anyone is living in the subdivision next to Nancy Pelosi and I think people should be I think these these measures should apply to the people who promote them but they don't of course congressman thanks a lot that was a bad thing for what you're doing sucker

another man who's been incredible and he's been a friend of mine for a long time we actually competed against each other he wasn't at all nice during the campaign and who would have thought we would have become good friends right who would have thought but we did and I could say the same for Ted right well we were good friends and then really bad they said when will it get bad the mian it's like the Academy Awards look at all the media before when it was successful it died when they went after us okay the Academy Awards regular just a regular program now but I said Ted and I get along good in fact he was having a big event near the White House and he wanted to get more people so he invited me he said can you come I said you know we're running against each other this is true and the press said well you two guys are actually campaigning together and yet you're fighting each other for the nomination and I said that's right we like each other we get along great I think he's great we both had this incredible relationship I said but don't worry it'll end and when it ends it'll be really bad probably worse than normal and it was vicious for about four months but then we have a great relationship again it was a pretty bad one for a little while right they didn't even think how bad it would get but it has been it's been great Ted Lindsey I'd like to have you come up and say a few words you've been terrific thank you very much [Applause] thank you [Applause] well in theory at 4 o'clock we're going to vote on two more judges so I'll move this saint forward after I got beat like a dog which he likes hearing he called me over the white house and said I'd like you to help me I said I'd love to help you be a great president because you're now my president and he says I don't have your phone number and I said there's a reason for that so the highlight of my campaign was when you gave out my phone number if I did as well as my phone number it might have been a different story to the committee thank you the Judiciary Committee is not for the faint of heart our democratic friends are tough they believe in their causes and we have to fight hard for our causes but one thing I want to say about President Trump the defining moment of your presidency for me was the Cavanaugh hearing this room would be empty if we had failed Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh lived a life we should all be proud of he worked hard in the way he was treated was the worst experience I've had in politics a lot of people would have pulled the plug on him mr. president thank you for not pulling the plug [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and Levite requires supported who would have been after bread if it went down what conservative young lawyer would want to go through this if we'd have failed brat Cavanaugh so Chuck was right when you run and you get reelected a year from now one of the main reasons is that people in the conservative world believe that you fight for judges god bless you [Music] [Applause] [Music]

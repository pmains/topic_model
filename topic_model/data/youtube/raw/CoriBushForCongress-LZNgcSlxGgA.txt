Hey everyone!I It's your candidate for US
Congress for Missouri's First District. I'm here to say we need you, and we need
you right now. We need you to phone bank. You may say,
well I don't have experience, I haven't done it before. Don't worry about that, we will train you. Look, we only have a few days left to
make a difference. Every call that you make is going to
take us closer and closer to that finish line, towards the victory.
So, we need you to stand with us and make it loud and
clear that Cori Bush for Congress is the campaign to stand with. How are
you going to do that? Let us know by going to our website coribush.org/events. Sign up for as many shifts as you can;
help us make these phone calls. Let's take this to a victory. Because if you
can give me the next few days, if you can help me out for the next few
days to get across this line, I promise you I will do the work. I will
be that passionate fighter, that champion for our issues seated in Congress. Thank you so much. Let's win this together!

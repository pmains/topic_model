R LAST SHOT TO EASE REGULATION BEFORE MIDTERMS. VONNIE: CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CIRILLI IS ON CAPITOL HILL. WHAT ARE WE ANTICIPATING WILL BE THE OUTCOME OF TODAY'S LOW? KEVIN: WE SHOULD ACT -- ASK THAT TO CONGRESSMAN MCHENRY WHO IS JOINING US AGAINST -- AHEAD OF THE VOTE ON DODD-FRANK. WHAT IS NEXT? SEN. MCHENRY: THIS PRESIDENT HAS MOVED FORWARD THE DEREGULATORY AGENDA AND REGULATIONS. WHAT IT COMES TO FINANCIAL SERVICES, THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST DYNAMIC CHANGE. KEVIN: WHAT DO YOU THINK IN THE TERMS OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT THERE COULD BE ANY MORE DEREGULATORY PACKAGE THAT ADVANCES OUT OF THE MIDTERMS? REP. MCHENRY: WE ARE WORKING TO SCHEDULE VOTE ON THAT. THIS PACKAGE IS THE FIRST SUBSTANTIVE REAL CHANGE IN A LARGE FORMAT THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TO THE SENATE SINCE DODD-FRANK WAS ENACTED EIGHT YEARS AGO. THIS IS A FANTASTIC WHEN EIGHT YEARS IN THE MAKING. THAT WILL BE THE GREATEST BENEFIT FOR COMMUNITY LENDING, MORTGAGE LENDING, AND GETTING CAPITAL. KEVIN: IS LIKELY TO ATTRACT SOME DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT. REP. MCHENRY: I WANT GOING TO HOUSE LEADERSHIP AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE. KEVIN: ON HOUSE LEADERSHIP, THERE WAS A CLOSED-DOOR MEETING WITH PAUL RYAN AND THE CAUCUS. FROM REPORTS, I AM SEEING THAT HE IS A BIT FRUSTRATED WITH THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE FOR FOLKS WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY KIND OF HOLDING IT UP AS A RESULT OF THEIR POSITION ON IMMIGRATION. WHERE ARE WE AT WITH THAT? REP. MCHENRY: THERE ARE TWO UNRELATED ISSUES. WE HAVE A LARGE GROUP IN THE HOUSE THAT WANTS TO TAKE ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT LARGE GROUP IS DIVIDED IN MULTIPLE CAMPS ON HOW YOU RESOLVE THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE. WE ARE A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. OUR REPRESENTATIVES AND HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES IS HOW YOU SOLVE IMMIGRATION. WHEN YOU ADD ON TO A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT OF A NATIONAL ELECTION COMING UP, THAT ADDS A DIFFERENT LAYER OF PAINFUL DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN IMMIGRATION. THE POINT IS -- WE WILL HAVE TO COME TO TERMS, PROBABLY IN THE MONTH OF JUNE, WITH A SERIES OF VOTES WE WILL HAVE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM. KEVIN: CAN SPEAKER PAUL RYAN HOLD ONTO THE SPEAKERSHIP BEFORE THE MIDTERM ELECTION? REP. MCHENRY: YES. KEVIN: NO RESERVATION ABOUT THAT? REP. MCHENRY: WE ARE PRETTY RESOLVED IN KEEPING PAUL INTO THE SPEAKERSHIP THROUGH THE END OF HIS TERM. IN NOVEMBER, WE WILL HAVE OUR ELECTIONS INTERNALLY. KEVIN: WE COVERED IT ALL. THANK YO

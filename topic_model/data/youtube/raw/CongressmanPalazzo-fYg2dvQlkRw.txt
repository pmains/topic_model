mr. pallazzo Thank You mr. chairman mr. Brock thank you for being here today I've known several FEMA administrators and you seem to be one of the best ones I've heard explain your agency so thank you for your honest and clear answers real quick you know I'm from gut for Mississippi Mississippi's fourth congressional district one thing you can relate to that is Hurricane Katrina we were Ground Zero and we took it right on the chin and it took almost a decade for us to you know be comfortable in our recovery and the one thing the Gulf Coast and not just in Mississippi but coastal areas and any any place that lives on or near the water which was practically a majority of the human population in America that relies on insurance the NFIP program and Mississippi alone is 64,000 NFIP policies right and 2013 Congress you know tried to improve the NFIP program only to basically you know cause a lot of unforeseen problems and with that was the drastic rate increases on homeowners who had no fault of their own were in the NFIP program because it was a government program and it was only insurance available overnight they were gonna see their rates go up you know you know double triple quadruple and you know that was a big concern and Congress acted swiftly I think the term was unintended consequences is what many of us used on the floor now the bill was tied to some other things such as the RESTORE Act which was the delivery of the the penalties from the BP oil spill and a two-year Surface Transportation extension and so you know the fact we were going to find a longer term solution NFIP the reauthorization because prior to there's 16 or more short term reauthorizations and obviously those reauthorizations and the fear of it expiring and you can't get a mortgage if you you required have flood insurance so it was affecting home ownership home building you know economic development it's just uncertainty and instability of the market now well guess what fast forward you know the house has passed a bill which is impassable maybe it has some good reforms there's no way I'll ever pass the Senate because it's going to increase rates on homeowners and it's going to cause again market market disruption but you know we're for you know moving as much of this to the private sector as possible but there's not a private sector market right now in many areas and so I guess the thing is can you kind of tell me has the the fact that we haven't reauthorized the program it looks like we're constantly searching for must pass legislation to attach even the short term reauthorization to is that having any effect and you're in on your agency right now well the problem you know it will thanks to the Congress those supplementals helped us in debt forgiveness right off the bat every time we have a massive event it gets to a point where FEMA can't even pay the interest bill anymore on the NFIP program and so we need to make the NFIP program financially solvent and I don't have all the answers on that but sometimes I think we may be attacking it in the wrong manner so for example any house in the United States can flood why are we just solely focused on these flood zones and what we learned from Harvey is thousands of homes can flood outside of those zones that were not depicted in there particularly if Street drains are not well maintained or the built environment changes the flood zone quicker than the mapping changes and so every house can flood I often you know we're working until their plate of fix I'm working you know and mitigation guys are working with the private industry through reinsurance and I believe that we you know we've offset some of that costs and save taxpayers over 700 million dollars most recently with getting them to back us up through reinsurance the thing about NFIP and what runs through my mind and we would have to talk to the private sector to start dialogue but why is flood insurance not connected to every insurance policy in America why is it not in All Hazards insurance policy every time you buy a house and so you reduce the cost she spread it out it becomes more affordable and I mean I don't know why we have to have this ala carte system if you got to have fire insurance that you can let lapse if you've paid off your house you can choose or not to choose to buy NFIP flood insurance if you're outside a special flood hazard zone why are why are we not working with the private industry on a more innovative solution of saying can we get to an all-hazards based insurance package for a homeowner all-hazards sounds good to me yeah so I want to be very sensitive my time it is a flyout day and thank you mr. Brock and I have some several questions related to mapping on the Mississippi Gulf Coast compared to my neighbors in Louisiana and Alabama I'll submit those for the record thank

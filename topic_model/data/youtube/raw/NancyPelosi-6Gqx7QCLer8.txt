this week on Capitol Hill we have a tale of two priorities Democrats want solutions Republicans want sequester's everyone is working democrats democrats are working the senate is working on their proposal which you have seen the senate democratic proposal i'm here with my colleague congressman Chris Van Hollen who has excellently by the Democrats on the Budget Committee he'll present our proposal that meets the standard of balance and fairness avert the sequester through the end of the calendar year it's consistent with what the Senate Democrats are unveiling today and free tree has responsible spending cuts revenues and job growth as well I just ask everybody to keep in mind two numbers the first number is 750,000 that's the number of jobs that the independent nonpartisan congressional budget office says will be lost between March first and the end of this calendar year if we allow the reckless across-the-board sequester to take place 750,000 American jobs lost it will reduce our economic output for this year by a full third it equates to erasing the number of jobs gained between October of last year through January of this year wiping out five months of job growth the second number i hope you'll keep in mind is 44 is the number of times the house democrats have put forward a plan in this congress to prevent those across-the-board cuts from taking place let's just let's just be mindful of the consequences of what is happening and do the right thing and not have this sequester it is mindless what's just as bad is that with less than two weeks to go and the clock is ticking down to a sequester that will cost the american people 750,000 jobs by the way those are not better and play job through 7 or 50,000 I mean federal employees will be furloughed but the 750,000 jobs lost or throughout the private sector because you're going to be taking a hundred and twenty billion dollars out of the economy during the period from march first to the end of the year and why because the republicans refuse refuse for example to n tax subsidies to Big Oil refuse to have millionaires people making over two million dollars a year pay their fair share that's why and this is just it's just wrong it's not it's not a responsible way to proceed and again you can pick out this or would you do this or would you the fact is over all over all we have to do what is responsible and I hope that the Republicans in the Congress would see the light to do that in the house now we can't do that if we're not here and that's why why are we leaving why will they not make millionaires pay their fair share and Big Oil give up their tax subsidies instead to take it out on the public safety the education of our children our national security why are we leaving when we should be staying here to work this out march first is right around the corner

mr. president I rise to speak about the mass murder in Florida last month and I rise to ask a simple question that millions of Americans in every part of this country are asking at their kitchen tables right now is Congress finally going to do anything meaningful about gun violence when will enough be enough what will it take for this body to move beyond the same talking points that we hear after every mass shooting and actually do something to prevent more deaths mr. president will Congress finally see what the vast majority of Americans see gun owners and non gun owners alike that America's gun violence problem isn't going away unless Congress musters up the courage to take it head-on or will Congress continue to give the lip service of thoughts and prayers and then do absolutely nothing we have to act because once again there was a massacre on American soil once again it was inside a school once again American children were gunned down we keep living through a nightmare of gun violence that repeats itself in schools movie theaters churches nightclubs concerts and every single day on the streets of the cities in every state around this country Sandy Hook Aurora Charleston San Bernardino Orlando Las Vegas Sutherland Springs and most recently parkland Florida mr. president we can help stop this we have the power to help stop this the question is whether Congress has the political will to do it whether this institution will finally put families first our children first and stand up to the gun manufacturers and the NRA I urge every member of Congress to reflect on why they first ran for office we are here as public servants to serve the people who sent us here not to serve the gun industries profits not to serve the organizations and companies and lobbyists that demand political retribution when we do the morally right thing does Congress have the will to act does Congress have the basic courage this country needs I'm sorry to say that I don't know but we can put it to the test there has been a lot of talk more than normal even about our need to act in this chamber so I will say this to my colleagues let's make this time different let's listen to the children from Stoneman Douglas high school let's seize this moment let's take action I implore my colleagues to listen to what the country is saying about gun violence today listen to the families listen to the survivors from Parkland and tune out all the other noise I did it is possible 10 years ago I had an A rating from the NRA just like many of my colleagues today but when I met the mother of niasia prior yard when I met her classmates niasia was an honor student from Brooklyn she was dancing with her friends having fun loving life she was killed by a stray bullet in her community now I have an F rating from the NRA and I don't understand how after meeting with all these families after meeting with all these children whose lives have been destroyed and torn apart by gun violence I don't understand how any public servant would not vow to do what it is necessary to make sure that never happens again it's what we do after a terrorist attack rightfully so it's what we do as a country we come together we say never again and we do whatever it takes to protect our country we have to have the very same sense of urgency now plain and simple it is a lie to say that we have to choose between protecting law-abiding gun owners rights and protecting our children from being murdered by assault rifles it is a false choice to say that we cannot end gun violence without violating people's constitutional rights mr. president it is time for members of Congress to stand up for what's right for America and do what is right for our communities and say no to the NRA I commend one of our colleagues in the House of Representatives a Republican from Florida an Army veteran who is seeing this crisis differently now - he wrote quote I know that my community our schools and public gathering places are not made safer by any person having access to the best killing tool the army could put in my hands I cannot support the primary weapon I use to defend our people being used to kill children I swore to defend that is what leadership looks like so I implore my colleagues in the Senate to see our gun violence problem differently see it with your heart see it for what it is it is a matter of national security of public health of public safety that will never go away unless Congress does its job so once and for all let's pass laws that actually are meaningful that actually can do something not just something simple so we can say that we did something and move on and I strongly agree with my colleagues that we need to improve the mental health system let's make those investments but it should not stop there we have to dress the fact that we have weapons of war on our streets today we have to address the fact that it is so easy for people to buy a gun people who should Bure have that privilege let's vote to ban semi-automatic assault rifles Congress has already fully banned them Congress has already recognized that some weapons have no place in the civilian world and a weapon of war that was designed for military use that can fire up to a hundred rounds in one minute or a hundred rounds if you trust at a bump stock a weapon that can completely out gun a police officer it has no place in the civilian world so will my colleagues vote with me to ban semi-automatic assault rifles and then let's vote to ban the high-capacity magazines that go with them they are made for pores they are not made to be in our schools not in our cities high-capacity magazines let killers fire dozens of rounds without having to frequently stop and reload they're designed to let someone fire bullets at as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time so let's vote to ban high magazine high-capacity magazines and let's vote to passed universal background checks that is something that is so common sense so obvious to many people who should not get their hands on these weapons are easily able to get them and there are so many loopholes they allow people to buy semi-automatic assault rifles online where there are no background checks they allow people to buy semi-automatic rifles at gun shows where there are no background checks it simply doesn't make sense that every person who buys a firearm doesn't go through a basic background check system and you know who agrees with that 97 percent of the American people I can't think of any other issue where there is such near universal agreement across our entire population so let's do what our constituents are demanding from us not the NRA is demanding from us and vote to pass universal background checks and when we do it let's make sure that the effort is actually sincere if we are only voting on universal background checks when it's tied to the issue of concealed carry reciprocity then that is not a sincere attempt to fix our broken background check system if Congress is saying that will only pass universal background checks if we pass a new law that says a stranger for one state has to be allowed into my states or your state when he has a gun hidden under his jacket that is an insult to 97 percent of the American people who want Congress to pass universal background checks now so let's finally vote to overturn the outrageous law that has banned the Centers for Disease Control from even studying the issue of gun deaths the CDC can study any other cause of death heart disease cancer car crashes plane crashes unless it involves a gun don't you think it's strange that when we debate this issue the two things related to gun violence that Congress has actually banned in recent years are research research on gun violence and a ban on the ATF from using computers to keep records so let's vote to allow the CDC to conduct research on gun violence so we can finally have the information and the data we need to fight gun violence as effectively as possible and let's also pass a law to finally make gun trafficking a federal crime over and over again law enforcement officers keep finding illegally-obtained guns being used in crimes numerous NYPD officers have been killed by guns that were illegally obtained by criminals and there is no federal effort there is literally no federal law to stop someone from loading his truck with guns and Georgia driving up the i-95 and selling them in a parking lot in the Bronx directly to criminals and gang members I have a bill that would make this illegal it's called the Hadiya Pendleton an I Asia prior yard gun trafficking crime prevention act it's bipartisan because both parties agree that gun trafficking is a source of gun violence in our cities this bill is named after nyesha who I mentioned earlier and another teenager from Chicago who was also killed by a stray bullet both guns in those crimes were trafficked so let's pass this bill and finally make gun trafficking a federal crime mr. president if we're not trying to solve this problem now then we are failing as elected leaders Congress must solve America's gun violence crisis now it is urgent our country is demanding it Americans deserve more from Congress than just banning bump stocks just fixing NICs which while I strongly support both of them will not do enough on their own so let us not fail our country again mr. president I would like to ask our colleagues to immediately vote to ban semi-automatic assault rifles and bump stocks to pass universal background check system and close all of the loop to allowed the CDC to research gun violence and cause of death to close the gun show loophole and to finally make federal trafficking a federal crime

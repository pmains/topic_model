in depth this morning the violence along the us-mexico border and an arrest in that Mother's Day Massacre they're joining us this morning the Honorable Texas congressman Michael McCall good morning and thanks for being here the place we're having okay Zeta member Daniel hey soos Elizondo Ramirez also known as a loco the crazy one arrested for that massacre 49 people looking at mutilated bodies i should say left along the highway what is happening down there it's really horrific yet forty nine bodies cut up into pieces thrown on side the road I was down loreto two weeks ago we met with the federal state local task force law enforcement talked about the situation in wave of Laredo we have a war going on between the Sinaloa and the Zetas and now the Mexican military's coming in so it's a perfect storm in Nuevo Laredo it's spiking in its violence in fact two days after we had that briefing 23 individuals were hung over bridges and they were decapitated that's a signature of the Zetas cartel that is essentially kept their heads and often so they also leave banners saying we did this oh yeah they want people to know to fear them and that's why they cut the heads off they mutilate bodies now fortunately we have the culprit arrested but this violence has been going on yes since called Ron declared war against them for that a number of years now fifty thousand Mexican people have been killed in this war that's more than Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan and that suggests the package years that's correct now will this arrest by el loco mean anything will the violence decrease because he's no longer in the picture I don't think so I mean you know you cut the head off and another head grows and so there are many lieutenants ready to take power because there's a lot of money to be made it's very glamorous lifestyle for them and they're young and they don't expect to look very long you know so i think this why you can cut the head off of the snake here the another head will grow back did the u.s. in any way play a part in the apprehension of the loco yes yeah we actually have very good coordination with the Mexican military with law enforcement to the extent we can trust them and the federal police are actually polygraphed in Mexico so we have a very good coordination with their intelligence community as well to apprehend these these individuals but you know this what I'm most concerned with is that the fact this is going on just right you know south of our border there are 300 cartel of cities where the cartels are present the United States including Houston and so what I'm concerned with is you know to prevent that violence we see happening in Mexico start occurring in the united states in a sense that would take us back to the 1980s and the miami cocaine Wars when they did have gunfights in the streets correct i mean the movie Scarface and the the violence that happened in Miami at that time we want to do everything we can ensure that doesn't start happening in the United States there's an election coming up in Mexico are there concerns on the US side that something that we may not agree with might happen if a new person comes into office yeah you know the opposition party the president called Ron is most likely to win according to you know what I've read the concern it's called the pre-party the concern is that historically the pre party has been more cozy if you will with the cartels will negotiate deals and in a truce to bring down the violence so that's the concerns the pre candidate can win and then you'd have a negotiated settlement with the cartels which would maybe bring down the violence but the corruption would spike and the cartels would flourish and so they'll tell you that they're committed to security they're going to continue what cauldron has done in a little different way but but you know we'll see what are we doing on this side of the border there were attempts by some of your colleagues to have the equipment that was utilized in Iraq brought back and then placed along the US border you know to provide protection well congressman Henry Cuellar and I worked very diligently to look we have technology that DoD has invested money in its tried-and-true dits over in Iraq and Afghanistan it's coming back home a lot of it now why not leverage that existing technology and these tough budgetary times and deployed to the southwest border so we're done that sensor surveillance technology we've met with the department of homeland security officials to try to get that stuff down on the southwest border they're starting to do that right now we're able to get three UAV for Texas these are the the drones that can see it from the sky and radio down to Border Patrol to apprehend people trying to cross so I really think technology that's a piece is yet to be finished but I think technology is going to be the answer down there to fully secure that border now technology is one of the reasons they brought you here to Houston today you're about to help one of a local energy companies introduce something that would protect us in the event of a terrorist attack on our infrastructure correct Center Point's unveiling with the Department of Homeland Security what's called a transformer which is really a backup system for energy we know we saw with the Hurricanes on the Houston coast power going down in all across Houston including in my district in tomball and Katie this would be a backup system that that would no longer happen it could essentially provide that energy and in the event you know whether it's a natural disaster or man-made say a cyberattack we know that there are those who want to bring down our power grids or energy systems this would provide that backup system in the event of a cyberattack trying to bring down our energy congressman a call thank you so very much for sending some time with us here on Fox 26 Morning News Jose thanks for having me appreciate it and we will be right back you

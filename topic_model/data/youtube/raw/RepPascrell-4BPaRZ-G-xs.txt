say whether he would vote for the plan he said he wants to read it first if house republicans do not back the senate leader's plan boehner might have to turn to house democrats for votes i want to bring in democratic congressman bill uh pascal he's a congressman who's joining us now well um you just got out of your own caucus what what do you make of what you think we can deliver between 195 and 198 boats uh and i hope that uh the speaker will be able to deliver at least 100 of his so you have no doubt that brought to the floor this will pass well i have no doubt that we're going to have our votes uh john's got to take care of his speaker's got to take care of his own boss look we're losing 164 million dollars a day in the economy with the government shutting down and i need needless to say just look at the charts as to what's happening to the stock market and what's happening well stock markets up a little bit because they think we're going to do the job today but the interest rates are starting to rise uh anderson and that's not a good sign at all just when the economy's starting to get some lift just when it's starting to get some light or whether we're talking about foreclosures where they're talking about prices of homes going up we don't need this at all how would the timing of all this work out i mean when would you anticipate a vote in the house well we expect to vote sometime late tonight uh the senate we were going to go first and then i think it worked out that the speaker wanted the senate gives him a little more uh weight and what he's trying to do on his side he's got a tough job i think he's tried his best i think john's a good american patriot he let these guys and gals get too much rope in 2011 and 2012. uh he thought he could reign them in they can't you can't rein them in there's about 40 or 50 of them that just want to be on their own regardless of what we do on our side and what john boehner does they're never going to agree to anything and that's proven what do you what is it like to be in there these days i mean is it i've talked to people you know long time serving members who said they've never seen it like this that that even in the worst of the the old days people would talk i i have been here for 17 years i uh i was here in the the iraqi vote on afghan vote i've never seen anything like this in the 17 years that i've been here does it depress you no you can't be depressed and you can't give up the ship you didn't we're sent here to do a job that's why we're getting paid not yet but this is why we will be paid if we do our job and i intend to do my job and i'm not going to let it get me down i've been i've served on a local level i was also in the in the jersey legislature and it primes you for this and yet many of these people never served in local government they don't know what the hell they're doing after time and you have to give them almost a gps to get through the day but that's where we are and we got to deal with it that's that's that's where it's at where do you see the negotiations going now i mean this is this is essentially kind of kicking the can down the road there now actually have to be negotiations what is the give on the democrats well anderson we would not be having this conversation not that i would not want to have the conversation with you if we would have done our job five six months ago the house passed its budget we didn't i voted no on that budget uh the senate voted its budget two days later and our uh congresswoman pelosi our leader named not conferees right away harry reid tried 18 times to name the conferees so you bring the two sides together you buy budget in the house budget in the senate together there's always a difference and you work it out six months later they talk about negotiating we tried over and over and over again the record is very clear on this so now the both budget committees in both the house and the senate are going to have to sit down between now in the middle of december to work out something for the rest of this fiscal year which will bring us to october 1st of next year i think it can be done i think it can be done maybe this is a lesson for everybody look no party is privy to virtue but these guys have made they've written a new chapter in the history of this country it's not pretty congressman i appreciate you being on tonight thank you thanks a lot honored thank you one of the main

for a year since an earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated northern Japan killing thousands of people and severely damaging the Fukushima nuclear plant US Senator Ron Wyden is the first senator to get a look inside of fukushima's cleanup efforts he visited the plant a little over a week ago and joins me now senator Wyden thanks so much for being on the program thanks for having me back so tell us what did you see on the ground there at Fukushima how far along are they in the cleanup efforts and what concerns you the most they obviously have a long long way to go when you go in there you you see hundreds of tons of debris you have huge trucks of storage tankers of thrown about like they were my twins my four-year-old twins toys and it's very clear that there are substantial health questions that have to be addressed now I'm particularly concerned about unit for there are the six of reactors if for example you had an earthquake or a tsunami hit those particular pools those pools could rupture that could mean that the fuel rods I could catch fire meltdown and you'd have radiation in the air that would be a huge challenge to control and senator the Japanese are very proud people they've often been reluctant to accept outside help in the past are they willing to accept international help and just a storing these dangerous fuel rods are they've been keeping it amongst themselves I want to commend them first of all for allowing me to to make the trip I sit on the Senate Energy Committee I've made it clear I didn't think there was enough information getting out about the cleanup this has huge implications for nuclear power both there and around the world I do think that their regulators and frankly their regulators to their credit will tell you that they are not as strong as our regulators here the Nuclear Regulatory Commission I do think that this is something that has to be addressed quickly the utility company was called TEPCO has a 10-year plan for essentially moving the spent fuel rods too dry dry cast to dry storage that in my view must be sped up because if another earthquake or tsunami hits it could be very very damaging possibly more radiation and not earlier what effect does this have the United States could any of the radiation from there get in the water possibly in fish or something that would go over to california in those waters I'm not going to speculate about that certainly these these reactors are very very close up to the ocean in my home state we've long been concerned about tsunamis and earthquakes I think it's time to get this right we need to focus on what kind of design there ought to be for nuclear plants where they ought to be located certainly the question of putting them right next to two oceans ought to be problematic to anyone and those are the kinds of issues that can't be done any longer the Japanese exports you feel are safe for example if you're a green tea drinker like I am and you get green tea from Japan I shouldn't worry about that I'm not going to make science scientific judgments I think they've made it that clear that they have been able to handle much of of the radiation because it stayed within the vessels that's one of the reasons I'm so concerned about unit for that is essentially outside the containment kind of process and that's why an earthquake or tsunami could be so serious i will tell you Luke that when I was visiting and we were getting on the bus to go to the airport people said oh pretty amazing a run that you didn't have a tremor or an earthquake while you're there I mean this is not an abstract question this happens very frequently there mm-hmm Senator Ron Wyden from Morgan dress back from Japan and Fukushima thanks so much for your insight we appreciate it thanks for having me

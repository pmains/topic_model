coming back panel number two is mr. Huizenga from Michigan who is going to talk to us about a bill that he's working on where's my introduction good and I'm pleased to welcome you mr. Huizenga and I have a nice little phonetic spelling of your last name which is cool he represents the second District of Michigan he's a small business owner himself and he understands the issues that this committee seeks to address and his introduction of HR 3630 for the federal prison industries competition in contracting Act of 2011 is especially relevant what we're doing today so with that welcome to mr. Huizenga and that you'd give you as much time as you need bill all right mr. Chairman I appreciate the opportunity to be in front of you and ranking member to thank you for your time and your attention this is something that's very important and on a very very busy day I'm glad we could we could get together and have this conversation because competition with this private sector by federal prison industries is an issue that's important not only to those of us in the west side of Michigan or in Michigan in particular but really across the nation when I was district director for congressman pete Hoekstra my my predecessor we had an interesting experience when Social Security Administration opened up a brand new office building in town and when they did so they they were obviously needed to put new furniture into it unfortunately the hometown that that I'm from two of the world's largest of the three largest office furniture makers in the world are located in Holland area the third one steel case is about 20 25 miles away they were actually not even allowed to compete for that contract and what happened is the the opening of the office was delayed because office furniture wasn't actually delivered on time and the the the the irony was we were literally a rifle shot away from one of those one of those office furniture makers who could have had that there in literally if not the same day by the next day and we could have had that that office opened and it was it not because of the mandatory sourcing that unicore has and that the federal printed prison industries have put forward on this so the impact of it hits communities all over our colleague carolyn Maloney has been a longtime supporter of this initiative and it worked with with Congressman hoekstra at the time when I want to make sure I get the name right it was the glamour glove company on Long Island had its existence threatened by the FBI many of Miss Maloney's constituents were employees of the company and they lost eighty percent of its glove business before compromise was negotiated with FBI ace electronics of Bel Air Maryland and Troy Michigan manufacturers wiring and cable assemblies fiber optics connectors and other products ace will likely lose out to FBI FBI on a 30 through sorry three hundred million dollar contract because of the rule that allows FBI to capture up to five percent of the market share in particular area general linen service of New Hampshire was forced to compete for contract against the prison system that they had previously serviced without incident this tech the textile rental services association member was informed that their service contract was being terminated and awarded to the prison system without any reasons given while the company the company eventually won the contract back the cost of having to recompute the contract was significant burden on the business and unicore I know has been been sort of argued in some hands and some quarters as not really being a significant operation that is not the case at all they occupy more than four million square feet of manufacturing and service space FBI is far from a small business this bureaucratically run corporation competes with private business job creators in over 300 individual products and services it's comprised of seven divisions including clothing and textiles electronics fleet management office furniture industrial products recycling and services and including call centers and data and document conversion as well revenues range from 745 to 885 million dollars annually f guys the 36th largest federal contractor when measured by gross sales to federal agencies prisoners working in unicorn factories are paid somewhere between 23 cents to a dollar 15 per hour can you imagine the uproar in the public or in Congress if we were importing goods manufactured from China and using using prison labor there it's no wonder american-grown companies can't even compete with Ag life like that that's that's paying literally pennies on the dollar where where our companies are forced to pay it obviously at least minimum wage in addition to low wages FBI does not have to pay employees Social Security nor the pay nor the employers share doesn't pay unemployment compensation workers compensation insurance federal state and local income taxes gross receipts taxes excise taxes and sales taxes it's not subject to federal trade commission oversight Securities and Exchange Commission oversight or Department of Justice review it's even has a special statutory allowance for a line of credit through the department of transparent of Treasury for up to 20 million dollars at zero percent interest on a very bipartisan basis I introduced HR 3630 for the federal prison industries competition and contracting Act it was a wide range of support including lead Democrat sponsors Barney Frank of Massachusetts and carolyn Maloney of New York as well as former Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and former Small Business Committee Chairman Don man Zullo of Illinois the bill is nearly identical to previous versions that had passed the House by votes of 350 to 65 that was in 2003 and then again in 2006 when a bill passed 362 257 we must pass I believe my bill this particular bill and work with our Senate colleagues to pass it in the other body as well that had been where the holdup had been previous years I'm pleased to report that in the coming day senator john thune of south dakota and others will be introducing a bipartisan fpi reform bill there my narrowly written bill would stablish market-based government-wide procurement policies for purchases that are based on competitive procedures it establishes competition is the standard for the federal agencies when they do they're purchasing currently FBI is not the buying agency or I'm sorry currently FBI not the buying agency determines if the product FBI offers and the delivery schedule of that it offers meets the needs that's pretty much backwards from any other from any other procurement that happens our bill puts the purchasing decisions in the hands of the buying agencies requiring them to research which products are available on the market not just to flip through an FBI catalog and know that they have to they have to take what is being offered specifically our bill requires FBI to compete for business opportunities by removing the mandatory source status of unicorn that unicore enjoys it requires FBI to complete a probability impact study and private industry before entering into a brand new market so at this point they're able to just basically say hey that sounds like a good idea we'll start expanding into this new area or that other area and this would require them to do an impact study it forces unicore to gradually pay competitive hourly wages for prisoners performing the work and makes OSHA standards mandatory at prison factories and then also prevents unicorn from selling products in commercial settings and from entering new interstate or foreign commerce contracts so HR 3630 four is mindful of idleness of prisoners as well I don't think anybody wants to see these guys are and these these women sitting around not learning a skill or not being kept active and it does actually address recidivism it creates new opportunities for prison workers that do not result in excuse me unfair competition with private business particularly small business and the employees and companies that lose out to FBI but it allows up prisoners within FBI to work for tax-exempt charity religious organization or even local got local units of government and I know in Michigan when I served in the state legislature there we had kind of a similar situation where there was a bit of a state version of this and we went in changed the law and I was aware of it because having prior immediately prior to being in the state legislature I had worked as the district director for for congressman hoekstra and so I was aware very much aware of our efforts on the federal level with FBI so I went into the state legislature looking at if we did anything like that and was we discovered that we were so one of the things that we did is we said okay we worked with Habitat for Humanity and we now have state prisoners building modules and components of homes for Habitat for Humanity and then as those would then get shipped off to those building sites it was saving a tremendous amount of time and cost while we were giving prisoners skills that hopefully we'll be able to use on the outside but it also authorizes private businesses to participate in work training and apprenticeship programs for prisoners as well it establishes an enhanced in prison educational and vocational assessment and training program to help people with release readiness preparation the Bureau of Prisons own studies have shown that vocational training programs have historically been the most successful in decreasing recidivism by giving prisoners the training they need to find and maintain a job once released we are providing them their families and our communities with the greatest of services i believe taking jobs away from honest hard-working americans in the pro in the process though is not how we accomplish this goal so again i thank you very much for the invitation the opportunity to be with you this afternoon and we're looking for all the support that we can get from for HR 3630 for and would love to have your participation as we move forward on that so Thank You mr. chairman thank mr. Zanger miss Chu recognize you for as much time as you would consume I've just got a couple bill thanks very much oh um I want to recognize mr. Flores is here you don't ask I tell you what is I was getting ready for this this hearing I wasn't really aware of the scope of the of the federal prison program I knew it existed and I had folks would used it and competed with it both back home but that number you throw that stuns me that it's you know 750 800 million dollars a year so this a big big company are you telling me by the way that story about the Michigan that we actually bought the furniture for the Social Security ministration building in your district from prison industries correct yeah when you all make it locally what we all make it locally yeah and it's it's all the aeron chairs that people sit in or literally made in my district and i'm not i'm not saying we necessarily want to have social security administration flooded with aeron chairs but that's the scope of it i mean all of the systems furniture is centered the the the biggest three but also probably out of the top ten office furniture maker 7 of them are located within the within the West Michigan area I had no idea as you go forward in the bill something came up with the first panel today that encourage you to consider which is and I think you have in this impact study that you're requiring them to make as they go into new industries you know I've got industries in my district they can't get people they can't finally were specifically agriculture and it would make sense it would seem to encourage the prison industries to go where there's a shortage of Labor and not where there's a surplus of Labor like in textiles earn in your circumstance furniture so if that's contemplated in your bill I commend you all that if not I'd encourage you to consider adding something like that the competitive wages by the way I thought was interesting as well what's the pushback on the Bill of you heard any yet or not well other than unicore the they're obviously not real interested in moving in that direction they'd like to have as much flexibility and freedom as they possibly can I can tell you that when we explain it especially for for a number of the freshmen that are coming in who haven't dealt with this in the past you kind of get that same reaction where it's like really I mean we got three quarters of a billion dollar industry that's getting run through our federal prisons at 15 2015 and hours of like yeah yeah 23 cents to a doll or 15 an hour and we ought to want to maybe take a closer look so we've gotten very positive feedback on that and and obviously by those votes it's rare to see 350 plus votes for anything but you know this was this was a culmination of many many years of work that 2003 vote the the congressman hoekstra had started working on this back in the the mid-90s about 97 96 and where it came from frankly you know the office furniture industry is a multi-billion dollar entity and the dot-coms were going on well I mean when you had a good idea but it was all based on internet what did you do you went and rented some of the most cool office space and bought the most expensive furniture you could find all right and so the office furniture industry was just going nuts and when that when that dot bomb happened the dot-com bubble burst suddenly they were looking for business they had ramped up to a tremendous amount of output and they were looking for new areas where they could go well at that point unicore was doing about 100 to 125 million dollars a year in office furniture not insignificant but when you're a multi-billion dollar industry it was kind of like okay we knew it was sort of happening over here and they were playing some games they would they would import parts from certain manufacturers and then they would assemble them in the prisons and they would you know they would they would call it prison industries and or they would try to you know come up with some of these partnerships but when when they started looking around for four new areas and new avenues to to expand their business a hundred-million-dollar target was was a significant so that was really what prompted congressman hoekstra and Congressman Frank and miss Maloney and others to sort of get engaged and my understanding i believe it was also textile related when mr. frank and mr. Hoekstra came together on this they were sort of coming at it from different industries but with the same outcome which was seeing private-sector jobs disappearing because of a mandatory sourcing through through unicore like I'd ask you one last question I did get a chance to ask the previous gentleman who was here on our first panel would your bill ban unicore from receiving future stimulus money from future stimulus money that is one of the questions that we have is whether it has or not and I need to go back so I'm not sure I can answer that accurately so i can double check on that for you and in we'll get back to you mr. chairman thanks mr. Huizenga unless built for the questions thank you very much for your testimony today and we'll go ahead and panel the third group thanks great thank you appreciate it

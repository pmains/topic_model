mr. chow all my constituents care about and want to know so when they log on is there data all their personal identifiable information is that as secure as if they do online banking it was designed implemented I mean that's a yes or no question it was designed implemented and tested to be secure so it was fully tested in best practices under the federal government standard for IT proposal recta security a white holes assessment testing conducted by by mitre in another company ok so it's fully tested as the other IT projects you have overseen into that same standard I trying to understand what do you mean by fully tested it was tested in the quarterly tested holy cow this is like a new low ok but then let me use the best practices are a complete integrated testing is that correct it is tested prescribed under the FISMA framework and NIST controls that are specified as a standard ok so why did your office what well then why did your boss resign he didn't resign ok so I dude it I think you're my readiness issues he decided to make a career change which I speak I think is a fantastic time to hightail it out after I have this great roll out so let me let me ask another question so Marilyn Tavenner signed the authority to operate memorandum traditionally under would your office sign a memorandum or have you signed previous memorandums on authority to operate myself I have not I as your boss or previous boss not that i know but i do not manage the ato sign-off process that's done between the chief information officer and the chief information security officer okay and they would traditionally do it not the CMS administrator I think you would have to ask them okay fantastic we plan to do that so let me ask you mr. Park you said on USA Today on october six quote these bugs were functions of volume take away the volume and it works referring to healthcare.gov is in the fourth paragraph do you still stand by that statement thank you for the question what I was specifically referring to no no do you still stand by Jesus well mr. Chairman I ask unanimous consent to submit this for the record have you seen this USA Today without objection so ordered and the question is on the statement not on what you would want easily bugs were functions of volume take away the volume and it works do you still stand by that so I stand by the fact that the bugs that the reporter was referring to which were issues users were experienced an account creation upfront were in fact functions of volume what I will say now based on additional understanding is an addition to blind which was a challenge the account creation process was we later on also affected by particular functionality bugs which have been fixed most of which have been fixed along with volume capacity expansion and other mr. Park cisne configurations actually let me tell you a story I've got it I've got a woman named Sue who logged on she filled out everything else she did not fill out her middle initial she got a processing error she went back to try to fix it put in the middle initial she had to wait 48 hours to get another update turns out that her income was not verifiable because she put in a monthly income she calls a navigator the navigator says yeah we've got some problems with that maybe you can do it on an annualized basis well unfortunately she couldn't get back into the system so then has called back for another navigator and and the navigator says gosh I'll we've got some we got a little issue here so let me try and realized income and put it in on the back side the back end navigators can do she's still waiting she started on october first she's still waiting to be successfully logged in to this website you said as a these bugs were functions of volume take away the volume and it works this is such a deeply flawed data rollout and my constituents are most concerned about trying to sign up much less when they do sign up that they don't have their data stolen and so mr. Chairman I yield back I think that I mean mr. perky you could answer

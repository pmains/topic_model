on the phone with us this morning congressman tracy mann big first congressman our congressman for here in hutchinson though he lives in celina good morning tracy how are you i'm great nick how are you this morning i'm doing good so are you out east because they're in or are you back here in kansas today you know what i've had to fly back to washington so dropped the kids off to school yesterday in salina um hopped a plane and in washington dc for most of the rest of the week that's what i thought but you know sometimes these these schedules especially with legislative stuff change a lot so that said wanted to talk about a couple of things that have happened since the last time we spoke one of them is a letter that was written late in january along with senator marshall you and a lot of your colleagues sent a letter to the biden administration regarding regulation of the oil and gas industry gas prices here in kansas have hovered around three dollars which frankly is good relative to the rest of the nation but what you're trying to say is hey listen let's not make it worse right well that that and also you know there seems like there's this war on fossil fuel for the administration right now and they're making it difficult for our local independent kansas-based oil and gas providers to to drill get permits do what they need to do instead you know there's there's been an effort to rely more on foreign oil or um to switch towards electric which is just not realistic right now so that's what that letter was about and uh it's so important nick that we are advocating for our local kansas-based oil and gas producers well and relying more on foreign oil is a difficult proposition at any time but particularly with some of the geopolitical stuff that's going on with the ukraine and russia um that kid that could change those overseas oil markets a lot couldn't it that's right it makes no sense you know we are we're clamping down on our domestic oil and gas producers meanwhile the president has asked opec to uh increase their production that makes no sense and then we stopped the construction which was about done but of the keystone pipeline that would bring low-cost you know oil from canada into the u.s meanwhile we have provided funding and have helped the north stream two pipeline that takes gas from russia bypassing ukraine into germany you know these policies are backwards they make no sense exact opposite of all in my view we ought to be doing all rights and there was a bill that basically the democratic majority decided they were all going to to get through the house that happened here is since the beginning of february uh that frankly you have a lot of issues with uh it's they called it the competes act you called it something else oh yeah the concedes act so what this is this came up last week it was released on monday and and basically nick realized this is a 3 000 page bill i guarantee that no one voted for it read the whole thing and what it does you know it was under the guise of helping us to compete with china it would actually weaken our position with china so i call it the concedes act get this the word coral reef is mentioned more than the word china in this legislation this is a lot about climate initiatives it's a lot about funding the u.n it was 325 billion dollars we've got to get serious about the threat that china is but unfortunately um the the joke um that was last week's legislation um does not do that and that's why it's not supported so i mean i guess what should giving china its proper place in the world look like from a u.s perspective it feels like to me and i've talked kind of off the record with some other members of the kansas delegation about this before but as long as we are given we are feeding them and they are providing us goods it to one degree or another it's a symbiotic relationship how do you how do you keep that going while at the same time understanding some of the human rights stuff that that china has done yeah well i just think we have to realize that china is not our friend they're our adversary and you look at what they're doing around the world you look at how they're unabashedly promoting their interests um you look at their human rights abuses i think we got to acknowledge that really for less this century nick um the debt and china are our two big adversaries and so we got to call it for what it is now that doesn't mean that we can't have a good trading relationship with china um that doesn't mean that we can't import some of the products that they produce and that they and we can't export to them or ag products really i'm frustrated to see that the phase one genuine try to trade deal has now transitioned uh to phase two but you look like our last two years and they were short 16 billion dollars on their commitments to buy our ag products and there's got to be accountability there there also has to be accountability on the intellectual property that they steal and uh and some of the things that they're doing on the world stage well what i'm trying to understand because i've been talking to economists a lot lately is relative to the rest of the world because of inflation and the weaker dollar agricultural products in kansas are relatively cheaper when china goes to the market to decide between suppliers so why on earth haven't they spent the money they said they would well that's the question that we're asking so we've been raising this on the floor we've been raising this at committee that's exactly the question we're asking um and and what is the administration's plan to to work to make up that difference now every indication is that you know as china's economy um transforms that they are moving towards commercial hog operations uh confined hog feeding which is a good thing for us which means they're going to need more sorghum and then other commodities that we grow here but why they've not met their commitments those are the questions we're asking right now to try to get to the bottom of it congressman what is going on in washington now while you're there this week that maybe kansas should be paying attention to at least so to some degree some of this process particularly the bill that we were just talking about with at some length um the majority party is in control of but what's happening that people need to know about well i think big picture you know the buildback better bill um which i strongly oppose you know it started what would start 150 new programs and cost five trillion dollars over the next 10 years it did not it passed the house i i'm surely opposed but it did pass the house it did not pass the senate but now what you're going to start to see is you're going to start to see bits and pieces of that you know you know there's 150 new programs get stuck into other pieces of legislation that's moving forward like the concedes act last week that passed the other thing nick that you're going to see is the current currently the government funding expires next week february 18th and uh and so you'll see likely an extension of that you know unfortunately there's efforts by the majority party just keep kicking the can down the field which is really no way to a two governor we need annual budgets we need to return to normal order uh in the congress okay forgive me tracy you are the third first district congressman i have talked to about this i talked to jerry moran when he was congressman before he became senator i talked to roger marshall and now i'm talking to you and all we ever seem to talk about when it comes to budgeting and it didn't matter who was in charge in the white house by the way it didn't matter which party's administration it was we're talking about continuing resolutions and continuing resolutions and continuing resolutions now i'm going to try to explain what that is and if i get it wrong please fix it for me would you tracy what what a continuing resolution is is we're gonna pay all of these things plus some given percentage and but the only way that congress has an opportunity to get people in front of them and hold them accountable at least this is what jerry moran told me several years ago is that budget process they have people will come to talk to you whether it be in hearings or personally when their budget's on the line that's how that accountability happens when you do cr after cr that doesn't happen is that still the way it is um to some degree yeah and so what should happen is on an annual basis you know the fiscal year of the government ends on september 30th every year so you know it seems like this comes up as a surprise to some people in congress but it happens every year what should happen is the appropriations committee and all the committee submit their budgets work out differences the congress agrees the house and the senate side by the president with what the budget should be and what the spending of the government should be for the year now in truth that only happens once in a while uh it did happen under the trump administration and so a cr is a continuing resolution it just continues the previous budget that was in place so instead of doing the work coming with a new annual budget it just continues now you could argue that if you just continued it for a year maybe that's the right thing to do but the continuations recently have been for just a few months so we're looking at maybe a three week continuing resolution voted on later today it makes no sense to just you know extend government funding for three weeks i mean congress needs to do its job and uh and this this kind of haphazard budgeting is not the way we should do it in my mind well and is part of this because frankly tracy it is an election year and people want something to fight about um i don't know about that i mean but potentially but see the budget expired september 30th of last year which was not a budget year this is happening because the the leadership of the congress isn't doing this job and and putting for putting forward the budgets for every one of the individual committees to then talk about hash out to senator brandt's point um to have a robust conversation about reach agreement and then move on that's not happening and so we we're in this legislated by emergency uh which is no way to to run the country or from the government okay is there anything that actually is getting some um some bipartisan work together that isn't an emergency are you actually getting something accomplished for the long run particularly when it comes to the ag committee because i mean obviously we aren't in a farm bill year yet but that's coming up relatively soon well yeah yeah so the farm bill uh you know comes up next year it's a five-year bill expires 2023 which is the next congress this congress should be having hearings should be talking to producer stakeholders really listening on what's working and isn't working on this current farm bill that really hasn't happened like it should i'm optimistic it will i've been going to the floor of the house and talking about the farm bill what i'd like to see in it um you know did that last week i'm actually going to do that later on this morning because getting it right in our ag policy critical for the big first but it's also critical for the country nick we we are the free country we are in part because we've never had to rely on another country for a food supply we've got to get ag policy right for a whole host of reasons and we're working to uh to provide leadership and do all we can do to make sure that that happens well and that swings back to the china topic we talked about before doesn't it tracy yeah yeah i know that's exactly that's exactly right that's that's spot on so a lot of these things are interconnected end of the day you know the world's better place when america is exhibiting strong leadership and uh and and we're not seeing that over the last few months you know kind of we saw what what happened in afghanistan weakened our position um those kind of things have consequences so it's in bolded emboldened vladimir putin in russia as we're looking at potentially a takeover invasion of ukraine and other bad actors around the world all right tracy

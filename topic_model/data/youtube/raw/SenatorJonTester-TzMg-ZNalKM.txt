mr. president will associate myself with my good friend from Tennessee senator bob Corker well i would say good friend but the truth is is that senator corker has truly been a good friend we came to this body together and he is exhibit uncommon common sense in this body time and time again and once again you have today and I want to thank you Bob here she remarks about this bill you know mr. president time and time again over the past year I've been here on the Senate floor raising my concerns about the direction that this body is heading secret backroom deals on a health care bill take it or leave it tax bill it was dropped on our desk literally hours before the voice vote and the floor time that has been wasted just to score political points and quite frankly this dysfunction has turned this world's most deliberative body into a shell of its former self folks in Washington have shied away from the big debates refused to tackle the tough issues that are facing hardworking Americans every day but this week this week I'm hopeful this can change today we begin the debate on bipartisan economic growth regulatory relief and Consumer Protection Act this bill is a product of year's product of years of bipartisan negotiations hearings and compromises and under the leadership of Chairman Creepo and my good friend senator heitkamp Donnelly and Warner we have struck a bipartisan agreement that is needed to provide an economic boost for rural America folks from both parties put their differences aside we negotiated from our points of agreement and we emphasize common ground and we kept working towards our shared goal of strengthening America's economy by providing common-sense regulatory reform to small and medium-sized banks to community banks and the credit business during the committee process this bill was marked up and debated for seven hours we voted on 36 amendments during an open amendment process the Chairman handled that committee process incredibly professionally since this bill was introduced in the Banking Committee last year it has been strengthened by senators who were not on this committee and it has been endorsed by regulators veterans group and job creators from both parties this bipartisan bill has the support from folks of all walks of life and it's co-sponsored by more than a quarter of this body because they know that reform is desperately needed in my home state of Montana prior to the financial crisis in 2008 there were 72 chartered banks today that number has dropped to 49 what we have seen in Montana is not unique throughout this country across rural America bank consolidation is leaving communities underserved community banks and credit unions didn't cause the financial crisis back in 2008 but they have suffered under a one-size-fits-all set of regulations specifically designed to rein in the behavior on Wall Street as a result of complying with these regulations many of our community bankers are hanging up their hats and our local banks are being swallowed up by bigger banks and ultimately they will be swollen up they will be swallowed up by the folks on Wall Street furthermore when a community is bought out by a big bank their business model changes and it's no longer tailored to fit that community despite being a small portion of the banking industry community banks provide listen to this 48% of the small business loans in this country 15% of the residential mortgage lending 43% of farmland and farm lending 34% of commercial real estate loans these banks are designed and built to serve their community but since the passage of dodd-frank the number of community banks a number of banks in this country has declined by 14% and in our state of Montana with some quick math it's closer to 30% if you're a product of rural America like I am you know full well the consequences when a bank leaves town it is just a matter of time before that community shrivels up folks something must be done eight years ago during the dark of the financial crisis I proudly supported dodd-frank dodd-frank was needed to credit to crack down on the risky behavior and for the most part dodd-frank has been successful but like all major bills dodd-frank had some unintended consequences since its passage small business lending has declined by 41% that is why our bill is needed to bring more capital to Main streets across the America and to protect community banks from further consolidation our bill provides smaller mid-sized banks and credit unions with more flexibility to meet the unique needs of communities that they serve it also provides our community banks with much-needed regulatory relief and cuts the red tape to keep our local banks competitive and it includes critical consumer protection provisions to better protect our veterans our seniors and tenants this bipartisan bill makes it easier for young families to purchase their first home it helps family farmers and ranchers secure the capital that they need to survive a tough year when Mother Nature doesn't cooperate it helps small businesses and startups secure the funding that they need to grow their businesses and create more jobs and it protects the small banks that serve as a cornerstone of rural communities from being elite eaten alive by the big boys on Wall Street in addition to banking reform this bill strengthens the rights of consumers it provides consumers with unlimited free credit freezes and unfreezes it prevents mortgage companies from legally kicking tenants out of their homes if a landlord is foreclosed upon it increases safeguards against fraud for veterans active duty service members seniors and children but over the course of this debate there going to be some folks who come to this floor and peddle misinformation so let me be clear about what this bill does not do it does not roll back the regulations on Wall Street fat cats it does not make structural changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau it does not weaken or repeal the vocal rule for large banks it does not change the way the Federal Reserve regulates foreign banks it does not weaken efforts to combat lending discrimination I've seen a lot of falsehoods claim out there about this bill already so I hope this debate stays grounded in the facts and the fact is that folks in rural America need this bill take for instance a community bank impulse in Montana Polson's population 5,000 and that might be generous the community bank had faithfully served this community for decades but the regulations from dodd-frank were so burdensome on that small bank and so constantly they were forced to sell out to a larger bank but it's not just Polson here's what other folks in my state are saying about the bill small credit union in Britain in Billings Montana a small credit union and I quote as a small credit union we spend ridiculous amount of time complying with complex rules and I'm pleased to see a bill that would eliminate some of this red tape so that I can focus my resources on serving my members that was from Sidney xboxone and L Baca and I'm sorry manager homestead Federal Credit Union and big in Billings Montana another Bank Bank in Jordan Montana I quote dodd-frank has disproportionately affected small banks like mine who have limited staff and resources to comply with the regulations created by the bill prior to dodd-frank package passage my bill was able to keep up with compliance regulations with one staff member now in addition to that one staff member we also have outside compliance consultants that cost us over $23,000 a year last year alone I'm going to get back to that figure in a second I have talked to many of my fellow bankers who decided to sell or merge with another bank almost every one of them has told me that the regulatory burden was one of the main reasons that caused them to sell or merge the loss of small community banks is not good for our country our consumers or our economy this bill provides many remedies not all remedies but many remedies to lessen the regulatory burden on small banks which allow us to remain competitive viable and able to serve the needs of our communities the reason I bring up the $23,000 because there are some out there that may be listening and it gets go 23,000 dollars that's not even a rounding error in a lot businesses Rex Phelps Rex Fitz is the CEO of Garfield County Bank in Jordan Montana their total asset is 86 million bucks this is a small bank that's getting pounded that this bill is going to help in a big big way and I'm going to tell you I could go on reading words of community bankers and credit union leaders and businesses in Montana who support this bill but the bottom line is this folks sent us to the Senate to do something to help out the folks we represent for too long this body has been dragged into the mud and as a result we've had partisan and zero-sum policies and zero-sum politics this function has kept this Congress from doing its job and part of that job is to fine-tune laws to ensure that regulation fits the risk and that is enough already we must do something and I am proud to work with 13 Republicans 12 Democrats one independent who works so hard to compromise on this bill that I think works very well for rural America the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act is a jobs bill and it is a much-needed solution for the folks who power a local economist you know I look forward to this week's debate and I cry and it is encouraging to see that the Senate is back here doing its job that we were sent here to do is encouraging that we have a bill here that has gone through the process to gather public input together by our partisan support and is now on the floor so that we can debate it and I look forward to that debate and I hope that debate is based on the facts with that I just want to say one more thing before I yield the floor we would not be here today without chairman Crapo chairman Creepo has done a fine job getting everybody's opinion respecting everybody's opinion in walking that line to allow for negotiations and having a good bill as the final product I don't know what's going to be in the final managers packet I hope it doesn't change this bill dramatically because I think this bill really fits the needs of our economies especially in rural America right now so it I would just say look we've got some work to do hopefully we can do it in a timely fashion and get this bill off to the house hopefully the house doesn't screw it up and we can get it to the President's desk for his signature with that I yield the floor

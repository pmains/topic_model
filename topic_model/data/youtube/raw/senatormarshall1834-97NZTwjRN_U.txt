welcome back progressive democrat lawmakers introducing legislation yesterday to increase the number of supreme court justices from 9 to 13. house speaker nancy pelosi was asked about it here's what she said do you support jerry nadler's bill to expand the supreme court by four seats and would you commit to bringing that bill to the floor no i i support the president's commission to study such a proposal it's not out of the question it has been done before but uh it answers your question i have no plans to bring it to the floor joining me right now is kansas senator and senate small business committee and senate agriculture committee member roger marshall and senator it's great to have you this morning thanks very much for joining us your reaction to this bill and you heard pelosi's response well maria first of all it's great to be on with you i listened to your show every morning on my commute to work and i always learn something but but look this is an attempted power grab by the extreme left this is an example of president biden cow towing to his his extreme left as well the president himself once upon a time said this is a bonehead idea and ruth bader ginsburg herself said nine is just fine but what the far left is trying to do now is weaponize the supreme court they're trying to use this legislation to hold it over the head of the supreme court and tell them look if you don't do what we want you to do if you don't make rulings the way we want it then we're going to dilute your power so i think that's what this is all about a big fight going on there in their own party it's kind of fun to sit back and just watch them throw popcorn at each other well it's pretty incredible and thank you for the compliment i'm so happy that you listened to the show every morning senator do you think this has any chance of passing i mean look the democrats are working on you know getting rid of the filibuster working on their hr one bill this these things will fundamentally change the way america operates is there any chance that these things get through well there's always a chance everybody has their price but so far senator manchin and senator cinema have been standing tall and i want to encourage them to keep standing tall but every example you've given there is one more example of a power grab hr1 filibuster those are all power grabs you know one of the greatest tests of leadership is do you try to grab more power when you have the opportunity to do that and that's what the far left is trying to do right now is to grab more power but there's no way that they could do this through budget reconciliation that i can see so therefore the only way this would pass is to lose the filibuster and americans need to remember the purpose of the filibuster is to force democrats and republicans to work together for long-term solutions uh without this we have uncertainty uncertainty as businesses worst enemy looks what's going on now with our tax policy it's so hard to make a plan i have all these accountants all my friends calling me say what when are they going to implement all these tax changes right now so if this tax policy changes every two to four years your listeners won't be able to plan for their future yeah that's absolutely right i want to ask you about the tax increases that are coming but first let me stop at the border because vice president kamala harris announced this week during a virtual roundtable that she will travel to mexico and guatemala the vp also called climate change and the lack of agriculture as the reasons for the surge of migration from central america senator you recently visited the border you saw up close and personal what's going on your reaction to what you're hearing from the vp wow you know i guess maria ignorance is bliss if the vice president herself would go to the border talk to the border patrol officers even talk to some of the migrants and ask him what what's the surge from and she would learn right away it's about the policy it's about the moment that she and the president were sworn in a policy of an open invitation open borders and mass amnesty that's why people are coming across here and they can just they can flip the switch the other way but they don't want to do that because they want this crisis they want the crisis they want these voters and also they want america watching what's going on at the border not watching what they're doing with the with policy as well they're their mach leveling policies their far left extreme policies and you know you and i have studied the situation we know why central americans is having economic troubles number one is they don't have law and order that's why law and order is so important in this country and also think back to the to the wto and when china came in to the wto and i don't remember 2001 or so it didn't just take jobs from here it blitz the jobs in central america yeah senator you make so many important points please come back soon we would love to have you back as soon as you can senator roger marshall joining us this morning and we'll be right back

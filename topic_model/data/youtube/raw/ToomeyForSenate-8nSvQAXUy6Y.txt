pat toomey is our George candidate for the United States Senate committee leaders members of the Republican state committee of Pennsylvania it is with gratitude and humility that I accept your endorsement of my candidacy for the United States thank you I have to say it's over the last several months I've really enjoyed the chance to renew old friendships and continual friendships and make new friends as we've gone through this process and i really look forward to working closely with each of you as we work successfully to bring back this seat for our Commonwealth in our party now I know that convincing some people to entrust our party with governance again could be a tough sell in some places some people were understandably a little bit disappointed the last time republicans were in control but i believe that pennsylvania and I hear this from people every day I believe that people across Pennsylvania are ready to embrace us if we convince them that we are willing to live by the highest ideals and founding principles of our great party to do this it's very important that we not allow ourselves to be divided over the small differences we can't be divided over individual policy or issue differences as long as we agree on these fundamental principles we shouldn't have any litmus tests on specific issues because good Republicans and good Pennsylvania's can differ on a whole range of particular items and a great party such as ours has to always have room for a large range of opinions on these policies but on the fundamental principles of our party on that we can and we must unite you see what while the left believes in a large powerful expensive government that controls the economy redistributes wealth and forces the kind of social and economic output that their elite prefer we believe in something very different now we believe in the limited government and and so less spending and lower taxes a free enterprise system respect for the traditions of our heritage and a society in which everybody gets a chance to succeed and to enjoy the fruits of their success and I'm here to tell you we're going to win this election because most pennsylvanians agree with our principles not with theirs so we're going to beat whomever the Democrats decide to nominate because we're on the side of the ordinary men and women who make this state and make this country work we're on the side of the people who pay all the bills and this November the people of Pennsylvania will have a clear choice I believe they will choose to return to the principles of our great party really the principles that made this country the greatest most successful most prosperous most wonderful country in the history of the world and I believe that the 21st century will be another great American Century because we'll remember who we are and what made us great and I firmly believe that it is our birthright as Americans to dream great dreams and it's the responsibility of elected officials to defend and preserve the freedom that allows us to live those dreams that will be my mission I am very grateful for your support thank you very much god bless pennsylvanian god bless america thank you you

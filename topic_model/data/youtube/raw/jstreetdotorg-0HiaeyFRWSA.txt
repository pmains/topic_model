[Applause] Wow thank you it's so great to be here with you today and to see so many people supporting Israel supporting peace supporting two-state solution supporting Israel's democracy supporting our values so it's great really great to be here with you 70 years ago the State of Israel was established and just few hours after ben-gurion read the independence scroll another another rabbi the rabbi of tel-aviv LED another school and this was the ketubah of my parents that got married the same day the State of Israel was established they had just left till gone the underground fighting for the existence of the Israel and became the first couple of the State of Israel and the next day my father joined the Army in order to defend the newly born state so my parents fought to make their dream of a Jewish state come true and today our responsibility is to keep the same vision alive this vision is not only about the existence of the State of Israel but it is also about the nature of the State of Israel and our values what are the values of the State of Israel this is something that I would like to speak today with you and the key words are a Jewish Democratic state now thank you but these are words that we are all using saying yes Israel is a Jewish Democratic state but frankly what does it mean and the different meanings of the words Jewish and democratic are tearing Israeli society apart and have created attention with Jewish communities around the world so we need to understand what happened since the State of Israel was created and what was obvious in 1948 is not obvious anymore you know when the State of Israel was established Jews all over the world cried with joy years later their children were horrified when Israel was at war existential war in Yom Kippur War and they felt that they need to protect Israel but today many of their grandchildren feel alienated toward Israel and we need to turn this crisis into an opportunity but first we need to create a new relationship a completely new dialogue between Israel and the Jewish communities around the world let's put aside the old dialogue that was when Israel is there for you as a shelter in case of anti-semitism and you will support Israel we'd love the nation support no matter what and I highly appreciate your support but I believe that our relations are deeply over more deep than that and the relations between Israel and the world Jewry should be based first and foremost on the shared values and understanding what it means for Israel to be the nation-state of the Jewish people and what does it mean to you to have Israel as a Jewish state so my vision is based on the school of Independence and the most important principles are and this is part of the greater vision first principle a Jewish state is not is not a religious state it is it is the nation-state of the Jewish people this is the result d'etre of the State of Israel it was created as a national answer for the right of the Jewish people for a state and therefore the nature of Israel and its definition as a Jewish state is not and should not be the monopoly of the ultra-orthodox parties in Israel the State of Israel the State of Israel should represent and respect all different streams of Judaism and should give space for everyone to express their faith in the way he or she feels is right and when talking about space let's literally make sure that every Jew no matter how they choose to express their faith has a space literally a space and a place to pray at the western wall it is also means that conversion should be something that unites all of us and these words should welcome and recognize all those who convert to choosing those who want to be part of the Jewish people regardless of whatever they converted was whether it was auto dogs reformed or honor or other liberal rabbi second and this is not less important and this is the second principle we need to cherish and preserve the nature of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people with equal rights to all its citizens without discrimination based on religion gender or nationality equal rights for every Jewish Muslim Strait of LGBT LGBT Israeli this is not some kind of favor that we should do to the Israeli Arabs this is part of our values and equality is a Jewish value love thy neighbor love thy neighbor the hostile aha all these are part of our Jewish values we were not looking at the American Constitution to find out what equality means and this is also part of what need to be the basic value of the State of Israel so these two principles the right of the Jewish people to a sovereign state and the rights of its citizens to equality these values will define 70 years ago and these are the values that we should keep and in two words this is the true meaning of a Jewish Democratic state these are the basic values of the State of Israel and this should be also the basic values that guide every Israeli decision-maker and talking about decisions in order to keep Israel as a Jewish Democratic state and to have these values living in harmony and not in contradiction we need the Jewish majority in the State of Israel this is a must and therefore the most important decision is also may be the toughest decision that anging over our heads for the past 50 years and this is to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians on the basis of two states for two peoples when each state gives an answer to national aspiration of different peoples this is the only just solution and this is the just solution for us as Jews for the Palestinians and well but this is the only way to pick to keep our vision of a Jewish and democratic state alive and therefore my friends two states for two peoples is an Israeli interest and therefore any American president who supports the idea of two states for two people is not pro palestinian and aunty israeli he represents the Israeli interest our shared interest the only interest that can keep the values of Israel staying alive so those who love Israel must fight for peace as you do and I would like to thank you for not giving up because these are days and speaking the truth these are quite difficult days for those supporting peace and frankly peace is the reason why I join politics frankly I hate politics but I believe oh yeah I was quite a good lawyer when I decided to join politics in 1995 but I watched my two sons they were five and eight at the time and I decided that I would not forget myself if I would not do that something that I believe is the only thing that is needed to keep Israel with its values and to leave them a secured Jewish Democratic state so I would not promise that peace is just around the corner it's not but I believe that we should not give up hope and instead of entering to this blame game we are blaming the Palestinians they are blaming us let's not forget what is our national GPS and since our national GPS is Jewish Democratic state it's our interest throw up in a station to reach an agreement with the Palestinians but if we have problems on the way it's a kind of a traffic jam problematic so we can wait we can continue and find other ways to move forward but we should do everything to keep the road open and the meaning is not to build new settlements not to inventing the old settlements because settlements activities is part of another vision for the state of Israel it's another national GPS and this is the vision of Greater Israel I respect this vision it's not mine and those who are taking Israel with this greater Israel GPS for them democracy is a burden and they'll stop in the way is to act against the nature of Israel as a democracy and therefore we need to move forward and don't forget why and why and where we are heading with our own values and GPS now there are new opportunities for peace in the region we have our Upstate's Muslim States they understand that Iran is the threat not Israel they would like to have better relations with Israel even peace with Israel but they cannot say yes to peace with Israel as long as the israeli-palestinian conflict is open and the good news is that if we achieve peace with the Palestinians the meaning is really a regional peace and this is not just peace you know in terms of fairytales this can really change strategically Israel security and that you would like to say few words about Israel's security because I know that as you support peace you also support Israel's security and I would like to thank you for standing for the idea of two states for two peoples and standing also against though that are trying to abuse the situation and the image of Israel and attack Israel and especially against the BDS they don't represent the idea of two states with who people's trust me they are just against the existence of Israel and I know I know my friends that sometimes it's not easy to advocate for Israel I know that Israel is being criticized over our military actions and I highly appreciate the fact that you are doing it even in times that it's not easy and believe me I wish that the situation in Gaza had been different when Israel dismantled all the settlements and completely withdraw from Gaza we didn't hope for Hamas to take over and continuing in targeting Israel with rockets and with terror tunnels but the situation is very complicated but I feel I don't want to speak you know in on Israel's security but I would like to share something with you because I'm leaving tomorrow for Israel and I learned in these were just at the beginning just in time for the memorial day for our fallen soldiers and I would like to say a few words about the Israeli soldiers not only those who sacrifice their life for the security of the Jewish Democratic state but also who serve now in the Israeli army I know who they are I myself was an officer in the Israeli army my two sons served in combat units and trust me they are exactly like you young people who sit here in the audience they come from different parts of Israel Society left and right they are trying to do their best to defend the State of Israel I know thinking about my two sons what I stand for and what the values they believe in and I also know the ethical code of the IDF so if a soldier breaks that ethical code or violate the law is posited and punished and I want you to know that because the State of Israel with the values that it represents does not and should not tolerate it and I share this with you because I'm familiar with criticized I know what the pictures that you see here and I know that sometimes it difficult to stand for these values and to stand for Israel security and I just want wanted to share this with you personally but talking about Israel security there is one thing that I would never never do and I would not use under the name of security I would not use it in order to act against freedom of speech in Israel I would never never use the name of security against civil society organizations democracy is not only a system of election where majority rules and unfortunately these are things that I hear these days in Israel they are the majority we can do whatever we want no they don't because democracy is also a set of values that we must preserve and fight for the whole of law freedom of speech if we press an independent legal system that keeps Israel values even when the government don't like it or doesn't like it because those that are trying to overcome our Supreme Court are those that would not accept the values of democracy and this is time to fight for democracy in Israel and not only in Israel because this is a phenom that we see all over the world and it's time for liberals to unite and to fight for these values in Israel here in the United States and all over the world and let me be clear when we see trends of the legitimizing political opponents or civil society activists I will fight for the right of all people even those that I don't agree with their views to speak up to demonstrate and to fight for their views because this is the nature and the values of Israeli society this is my responsibility this is our responsibility and I would like to promise you that we are not only share the same values we are fighting for the same value for the same values and democracy is not something to be taken for granted and therefore we need to fight for it so when journalists criticize leaders are called traitors when we are told not to trust our judges or law enforcement officials when civil society activists are the limit D legitimized in the end it's our liberal values that are put on the line and therefore we need to unite in defending them so today my friends I'm here with you to speak up for the values that we believe in democracy equality human rights peace these are becoming dirty words sometimes in Israel and in other parts of the world and we should stand and speak up and fight for it so you know every Israeli leader who comes to the United States usually they start by saying that the ties between Israel and the United States are unbreakable unshakable and based on the shared values which is right this is what made the u.s. America is very great but it's not enough to speak about these values it's more important to keep them and to cherish them and to fight for them so I believe my friends that these are the values that Israel is based upon these are the values of the scroll of Independence these are the values that we all believe in these are the values that if we adopt and fight for these are also the basis for a better relationship close relationship between Israel and the world Jewry and thank you for being here thank you for being with us [Applause] [Music] [Applause] well we couldn't see anything why start now yeah Wow that's hard to see up here but I suppose we're all experiencing a little difficulty and watching our discussion today is about the relationship we're going to analyze the relationship between the American Jewish community and Israel the Jewish state I want to take it apart and look at the degree to which individuals in both communities understand and relate to the other community what does it mean how do we act on our identities and how do we influence who are we trying to influence now I've been watching a lot of MSNBC and Fox News so I am going to try and do my job as a moderator and interrupt you and cut out over you and probably insult you a lot I'm kidding let me start off by asking Janet oh I guess let me just start this is Zoey go boom who is as some of you know she's the president of a street news she's a senior at Stanford this is nada Nadav Tamir is a former Israeli diplomat a courageous one and he's currently the director of political and government affairs at the Paris Center for peace and to his left is Janet Aronson who is the associate director of if I get this right the Cohen center and the Steinhardt Center and Institute at Brandeis University you'll note that there's three names there Cohen Steinhardt and Brandeis one of the three is not a donor you can guess which one and Rick Jacobs is the president of the union of Reform Judaism now Janet as a researcher in demography and sociology trying to get what people think what do you think Israel means to American Jews okay that's not the question I thought you were gonna ask so sorry I think one of the questions about American Jewry is this narrative of declining attachment to Israel and that's been on everyone's mind I've heard it discussed to the earlier today so when it comes to just emotional attachment to Israel to people who do American Jews feel like Israel has some place in their lives if you review the data from the last 20 years that's about all I'm going to say about data specifically if you review the data it's clear that as that attach some kind of attachment to Israel is strong consistent and pervasive in the Jewish community something like 70 to 80 percent of American Jews for the last 25 years have said either Israel is somewhat or very matura very attached to Israel emotionally or caring about Israel is an important part of my being Jewish now to answer your question more specifically we don't know from demographic data from surveys we don't know what people really mean when they say that so that's the big caveat do they mean that they have some vague attachment to Israel as some sense that it's important to their Jewish identity which might in itself might not be too strong to them or are they in J Street you and taking their time and money I think money take time money energy to I should make this a huge part of their time their their college experience so we don't know what that means we also don't know if it means that they know anything about Israel what's clear is that many American Jews are just checked out of the conversation so they might say that they're attached but it doesn't compel them to do anything it's just ok I'm attached Rick you have been together with your predecessor kind of at the forefront of bringing Israel into the lives of American Jews what is that supposed to mean practically speaking what do American Jews do with an attachment to Israel in their daily or weekly lives what to do well I think the attachment Israel is a deep long-standing part of Jewish identity over millennia not just the last two decades and yet obviously we're living in a moment when a whole lot of Jewish people who are attached are asking what is that attachment is it the core of my values and can I bring my values to my views about Israel my relationship to Israel my sense of what government policies mean or don't mean to me so I think you know at this moment we're we're also trying to unpack what we actually are talking about and I hear conversation regularly particularly from Israelis and particularly from Israeli politicians that the attachment is declining because Jews in particular in North America in particular have little Jewish identity which is why they are less attached I would make the case that they are not actually in a moment of feeling less Jewish identity but more Jew and those values inform how they see Israel how they see the United States of America how they see their local community and I think for us to have this silly conversation frankly are the policies of the current Israeli government pushing many away from Israel the answer is yes and how I don't believe that's a debatable point and how do you Forge and this is my predecessor and our movements deep commitment is how do we actually find a deep place of a bond an attachment that's not only about the headlines of any particular moment what's the relationship to the core values upon which Israel was built what are the relationships to the people who are across the political spectrum and frankly the religious spectrum and how can we anchor our sense of progressive Zionism to not just the reality of what is but a commitment to what was always supposed to be and to build towards that together now Doug let's turn this around for a second what is America what is the diaspora or American Jewry and specific meaning to the average Israeli first of all I want to say that I'm very happy that Jay Street is having this kind of conversation because I think it is very much connected to the goal of Jay Street to bring peace to the Middle East I think that the old paradigm the Jews come together only around crisis and gevalt is no longer sustainable and I think Jews will come together better when Israel will be in inspiration and share their values rather than a place of horror I think unfortunately for most Israelis they see you American Jews in a very instrumental way they see you as a source for lobby for a Schnoor and for Aliyah and they I think this is this is dangerous for the concept of Jewish peoplehood because Jewish peoplehood means that we're kind of an extended family and if you treat your family in instrumental way you're not going to have a good family life so I believe that we have to do something to change it and I believe that this audience can help change it because those who tell you stay back you're not in Israel you don't send your you know kids to to the IDF you don't have a voice or going against the concept of Israel being a homeland for the Jewish people if we truly the homeland for the Jewish people it means that you guys have a voice and you should be engaged and you should try to make Israel what you want Israel to be because it's your state as well you may take a second of privilege before I ask Zoey a question which is um as a journalist I found that over the last 2025 years the number of American Jews murdered by Islamist terrorists and the number of American Jews murdered by far-right American terrorists is about equal which is to say it's not simple one way or the other it's also to say that the idea that we don't pay a price we pay a lower price as many many fewer than Israelis but we the fight is here too which brings us to the college campus do you feel like you're swimming upstream fighting against the current to the Jewish students that you deal with that you interact with seem open to the idea of this subtle I support Israel but not this policy's definitely I think the fact that there are 1,200 students here represents up for clarity and I think I mean my personal sort of backstory how I got involved in J Street you a lot of it had to do with being told growing up and going to Israel twice that Israel was my home and I had some really remarkable experiences emotional experiences at the Western well Masada that made me feel that way and the way that my relationship to Israel started to change was when I started reading these policy headlines about Sudanese refugees being turned away at the border and then shot down by Egyptian military at the Egyptian border and I was like it's really supposed to be the in gathering of exiles but like people who are fleeing from genocide go for safety like what does this mean for a Jewish state what does it mean for the Jewish people and then I start learning more about the occupation what I am asked to do on college campuses every day as an American Jew is to defend Israel but right now the current government of Israel isn't defending me after the Charlottesville protests after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville I was unfortunately unsurprised by the fact that Netanyahu was not condemning neo-nazis yelling Jews will not replace us I should be able to expect that somebody who said is that Israel is my home is going to defend me when neo Nazis are marching in the streets and our president is saying nothing about its value [Applause] let's go step further um Netanyahu has been elected I think four times so far he gets reelected last time he got an impressive 24 percent of the vote but the the parties in his coalition do represent a majority of Israelis most Americans you seem to have a hard time with a lot of the decisions that Israel makes is it possible that we're becoming took one community based on Jewish values and the other community based on Jewish identity and safety yes right it has to be I think that we still share a common history and we always well I think that the idea that there's sort of two different groups splitting off and that there's still no comment but there will never be any common ground anymore and it's in right like we have is really we haven't an Israeli here on this panel who's telling us like this is how we can engage with Israel we can say these policies we don't agree with that seems to indicate to me that there's still room for us to all get along as one big family we don't have to split off we don't have to only have like two different opinions on this that will never ever mesh I once heard Leon Wiesel to give a speech and he said Oh somebody asked him from the audience do you think there will be one Jewish people in the year 2000 this was in the 90s he said I don't know the answer but I'm happy to hear the question because it wasn't so long ago people were asking if there would be one Jew in the year 2000 but Janet take the same question that Zoey had values versus identity so I think that that is the crux of a lot of this issue that this concern about the security of Israel and the and progressive values I think that many people are caught in the middle now that that they really both of those are important to them and they don't want to see them in tension and I think that's one of the reasons that this is so complex and I think it's one of the reasons that it's hard for people to take a stand I do want to point out and I kind of alluded to this earlier that the people in this room the people who are active in the issue engaged reading the headlines are actually a small portion of the Jewish community and the majority of a Jewish community is myslef not knowing what to think and and I think that the that there's a real disconnect on some of these issues between the majority of the community and the leadership of the community and that's complicate things even further rabbi on Jewish values I sometimes get the feeling that the problem with the relationship between the communities is that American Jews are basically allergic to guns so the question is how do we well to what extent do we understand each other at all as what makes the two communities tick I think that actually is a big category I don't think we actually understand ourselves very well and the Israelis do not have a clear sense of who we are I think the way in which you hear Israeli politicians regularly I'll just name one in particular Yariv Levine who's the tourism minister who says and he said right after the Kotel Agreement was officially passed by the cabinet 15 to five a couple of weeks later he said you know why are we bothering to give non-orthodox Jews a place at the Kotel because they'll be gone in ten twenty years anyway and and the the Frank point is that they're ignorant of our community is to miss our strengths our dynamism our vitality and frankly our deep commitments to Jewish values which are not shared and I think there is listen I don't want to compare who's less knowledgeable and understanding the other but I think there's a deep gap but the question of Jewish values I don't think is versus identity I'll actually say Jewish values versus Jewish values so let's say for example in Israel we're having a debate for what public Judaism is is it the Robin Newt the Chief Rabbinate s' I'll give you an example we just had Pass ox the chief rabbi it pays home its inspectors to go around and find huh mates during pissah well honest I keep Passover I assume a few other people do I would I would rather the chief rabbi or anybody who's expressing Judaism in the public square it would address the core values of Jewish tradition I just heard CP levy talk about equality tax a Jewish value justice is a Jewish value respect for the other is a Jewish value so I think we're actually having a value debate but we don't actually have the same Jewish values undergirding our community as we have in Israel and I think it's a fight for the soul of the State of Israel and it's frankly a fight for what Judaism could meet in this 21st century and that gap is growing and it's very very concerning [Applause] Guil I'm gonna dive I'm gonna ask you to do something kind of hard which is to separate your experience as somebody who's fought and paid for the implementation in Israel of the sort of values we're talking about here and what do you think well first of all do can we have an influence can we change what's going on in Israel from here in America and what do you the passion that we're hearing on this stage today how does that make Israelis feel attacked or and reinforced well it's a great question I think that Israelis in general not just from Jews but also from other countries when I will speak about influence need this combination of embrace and push if you only push us we antagonize if you only embrace us we complacent so to show the love the empathy understand there are fears and aspirations and at the same time to also fight for the values that you believe in and be very hard-nosed about it I mean I could guess that most people here in this room don't like Sheldon Adelson's but you have to give but you have to give him the credit that he's putting his money where his mouth is and I think that Jews should be involved and should be engaged in Israel and don't let anyone tell you that you have no say as I said before so I believe that you can have an influence but you have to be less polite about this you have to remember that the Israelis don't see for lightness and manners as a great and important thing it's a different culture we respect hard argument and they and I think you have you guys have too and and and of course from out of love I'm not talking about we're not fighting each other we're doing it because we care so I think that showing that you care about us but also showing that you have a values and you want to influence I think you could have an important role and also to empower Israelis liberal progressive Israelis to understand that they're not alone that we're actually the majority in the Jewish world and if we come together if we empower together if we know more about each other if we have people-to-people connection rather than financial transactions I think we could empower each other and do many things together the you know the especially yerushalayim film Allah you were salam LaMotta heavenly jerusalem the jerusalem up there and the earthly Jerusalem the Jerusalem down here one often hears Israelis questioning Americans use knowledge of the Israel here and now because they're involved with the Israel that we've been promised that we read about in our myths and our prayers is one better than the other is um do you feel is there a conflict to do American Jews even understand what the Israelis are talking about I think so I think the problem is that there can be a universe in which like our values are lived out through the actions of the Jewish state do the actions of Israel that's not the universe that we're living in right now but like the work that I do with J Street U is aimed to actually bring those two things closer um I think that like when we're thinking about like more like spiritual or like like these other experiences like those were the experiences that I was talking with that I had when I was at Masada those were the experiences that I had when I was at the Western Wall they weren't the experiences that I had when I started reading about the occupation and learning about it those are the experiences where I was like wait Israel's is deep Israel takes actions in its self-interest the people who are in power in Israel are taking actions to keep themselves in power and I think that when the dog just said actually is like a really good bridge to a point that I want to make which is that like people in G Street you have an opportunity to be partnering with progressive partners in Israel in order to make it so that there are people in power in Israel who actually want to live out our values as well so it doesn't feel like there's as much of a conflict between like my spiritual experience which I feel it's like really tied to my Jewish values of justice and equality and what I actually see is the actions that the Israeli state is taking Janet um but pick up on this but also the the point you made earlier about the gap between the Jewish leadership I'm not sure that's the right word for cuz nobody follows them and the Jewish masses the Jewish the Jews on the street can that be overcome um well America the American Jewish community is amount of democracy so the question of how do people get selected to be leaders of the sort of the organizational Judaism is a question of politics and power and money and who is in the institutions and how how is it that those institutions have have power but can I go back to the earlier this earlier question about your showing Shamala um I think that we should add one other dimension to to that which is the the Israel of I'm going to say the Israel of the movie the Exodus and the Israel of faoud us and to me that those those two israel's really represent a complete cultural shift and a generational shift in how american jews relate to israel so neither one of those is the spiritual it's the spiritual Jerusalem but the Israel of the 1960's was a combination of the heroic Israel at the same time the Israel that we could support but feel sorry for feel sorry for we were the rich you know the rich cousins in America and our job was just to support people didn't very few people traveled to Israel then people didn't really know what was going on in Israel the sources of news were very limited and they came through Jewish leaders institutions they you knew about what's going on Israel through your rabbi through your Hebrew school teacher through your through the Federation that asks you for donations and people gave and that was a time of tremendous unity in the American Jewish community about Israel and now we're in a completely different place so now we have access to all this other information it's not that those problems didn't exist in the nineteen in 1948 before 1948 but people just didn't think about them so there was kind of this heyday of Israel attachment that I think was where many of the Jewish leaders the generation of Jewish leaders got their start they were raised and they are frustrated about not being able to impart that to your generation because we we my generation just wants you to love Israel just love is real the way I did and and it's about that fantasy Israel and the little the details of what's going on in the state that's that's a separate question so I think we have this huge generational divide attitudinal divide and that and that is one of the pieces that's reflected in that in the leadership Rick you live in both worlds your Jewish leader and you're also well you the leader of the largest Jewish movement and you're in touch with average Jewish more than probably the head of the clas so what do you what's on the minds of you I don't know of the Jewish representatives of Jewish insiders when they speak so out of sync with the people that they claim to represent well first of all I've actually in a lot of those rooms where Jewish leaders are talking definitively about what you know the Jewish community believes and I very often you know we'll just do a time out I said that may be true inside of your head or inside of your circle but I can tell you that the overwhelming of Jews in North America actually do have ideas we we have surveys we ask them questions they answer them and I think to be honest the question of you shal I'm Michele mala you should I'm Sheryl Mata the idea of this kind of a the idea that North American in and world Jewry gets stuck in the the usual I'm shell mala we're just floating we talk about ending the occupation we talk about things that are really you know Israelis will tell us those are just not real what's real as we face security challenges and we're surrounded and the question is can you have your feet on the ground of the Israel that actually is and can you also have a vision of what Israel ought to become I hear so many people here in North American Jewish life in Israel they know what we're against we know we've got to fight BDS we've got to fight the you know the this group that opposes like okay okay I fight those every day what are we for what are we building what's our vision of Jewish life what's our vision of Israel so so if we only have our feet on the ground we're gonna just get stuck in the mud and we're not gonna actually have a sense of where we're going we have a lot of leaders here and there who are endlessly talking about all these issues many of them are urgent but if we don't have a sense of where we're going and what we're building I think we're lost completely and I think that's what the question you're asking us and I think we're allowed to have our heads above the fray and not a to yearn but to also in a constructive way because I think what Nadav said is real first of all you know it's good spot to tell Israelis you know that that we understand everything more clearly you know this week we're gonna observe yamazaki roan and then you'll Mott smote the in Memorial Day and then Israeli Independence yeah III visit friends in the cemetery you know there's not a separate Senate arey for the merit soldiers for the by dudy soldiers or the Likud soldiers they're kind of all they're all resting together and I think that the question of can we understand the realities which are really challenging but we can we also understand that some of the security challenges that Israel faces are not only with military they're also about the essential values that Jewish Democratic core of Israel is a security it's about the well being about the ability of Israel to not only defend itself but to be the country that not only us only we want it to be but frankly that Israel has set for itself so I think we are you know we're kind of talking around these but I think it's absolutely critical that we can articulate in also in Judea clear ooh today I know many of us secular we have different relationships of Jewish tradition I'm sorry the Jewish tradition has a claim on what kind of society we build wherever we happen to live and we're building not not a society like all of the societies you know I know that was an ideal of the early Zionists that you know we would it was a ben-gurion said you know we have prostitutes in Tel Aviv will be great because we'll be just like all the other nations honestly let's build a society that reflects the nobility of the Jewish tradition I think that it's not just about articulating what we want to see it's also about acting on it and I think that that's something key that J Street you is bringing to the conference the Sox emotional peace campaign is very much rooted in the dynamics on the ground both in relation to obviously like Israel's security concerns but also about the ongoing demolition of housing communities that threatens the future of a two-state solution in Palestinian rights every day and I think and I think that we do have to be rooted in the understanding of both sort of like the high-level thinking and what's happening on the ground but we also have to be putting our values into action each and every day that's through policy and ups through politics and that's what we're here to do this weekend so let me throw up in 2005 I think Israel withdrew from Gaza Hamas took over in 2007 at the beginning a year later and what followed was a heavy barrage for several years of Rockets non-stop Israel went into Gaza in 2009 and temporarily stopped the rockets that went in again in 2012 and then in 2014 it went in and there was a massive loss of Palestinian life and the Rockets stopped how do you reconcile those two facts that we are offended by what we see is real doing but it works yeah you have to live with it well I think that if you ask most of the security people in Israel then about those issues they'll tell you two things one is that it was the right thing to do to move out of Gaza even if we didn't do it in the best way that also empowered the moderates on the Palestinian side and the other is that the most important thing for Israel's security is to arrive to a two-state solution you're hearing from the head of Mossad the head of shabak most of the generals are living there the IDF actually the IDF today is the most progressive arm of the Israeli government because I think they understand better than the politicians the limits of hard power and they understand that most of Israel challenges are more on the diplomatic arena than in the security arena so I think that of course I'm not you know I'm not a pacifist I I was an officer in the IDF but I believe that we're strong enough to make peace and a lot of this feeling that we're all they're always under threat is is because we were able to get the Jew out of the shtetl but not necessarily to get this turtle out of the Jew where we are a strong country the strongest country in the region and with all the problems of terrorism and stuff it is still much much more dangerous to drive on Israeli roads than they let me reframe that for just a second the I see and read and hear a lot of American Jewish progressives celebrating the fact that the Israeli military establishment is sort of on our side but feeling very uncomfortable with the fact that they're praising generals and it becomes they go numb they lay their mouths quiver and if 14 of the 15 living ex heads of the IDF the Mossad and the Shin Bet are all in favor of the Arab Peace Initiative yeah along is the only one who's not if 14 of the 15 are in favor of keeping the Iran deal why don't why doesn't anybody that should be a slam dunk that should be the end of the discussion well Rick I was gonna just pivot back to Zoey's comment which is about action what what do we do people are not at this JC conference just to hear thoughtful discourse I look around the room there are activists here and I would just give and I agree that it's about you know discussion that leads to really effective strategic action I'll just give one example I was in Israel the end of February and we had a remarkable protest in south Tel Aviv on behalf of the asylum seekers who are being tossed around like a political football in Israel and were threatened be deported and I was there with a group of young leaders from the reform movement not only in North America but also from UK and from France and they came with me to the Jewish Agency board meeting and the Jewish Agency uncharacteristically was having a debate about whether it should take a stand on the question of what what would be a just resolution of the açaí seekers you know cause in Israel and we were having the usual Jewish debate you know the wonderful Orthodox leader said this and Rick Jacob said that and then the UJ leader from New York said this and then two of our young leaders said can we speak and the answer was well you're not actually credentialed which was no no no that's not a good answer please give them the microphone and Celia Teddy who is a past nifty social action vice president and religious affairs vice president said and Rachel Wolfe was a wonderful reformed Jewish leader from her congregation in California said excuse us this is an urgent matter of Jewish values if the Jewish Agency and the Israeli government and the Jewish community can't find its voice on this it doesn't deserve to be in leadership and and what happened they weren't shown the exit they weren't said you know nice nice leaders nice leaders they actually carried the day and the Jewish Agency voted it wasn't as strong a statement as many of us wanted but they voted to express themselves on behalf of this asylum seekers now of course we know what happened recently that all of a sudden the Prime Minister found his moral voice and with the UN and frankly with support here in North America from not the left or the center but also some pretty strong voices from the right and then hours later walked away from it so I got to say that action is about putting pressure and taking stands and not backing down when you don't get a immediate response that you were looking for and I also think this is a moment where young people are leading our community they're not they're not waiting for their time this is their time and we the Jewish community [Applause] though is an example 1200 liters these are not you know these are not people waiting for their moment they are everyday leading our community let's let's broaden who we think are Jewish leaders today I feel that we have a new time left but I really want to get a sense from all of you of whether that image of what happened in Jerusalem with the Jewish Agency why doesn't that happen more often well the I think that the question of why there is what should leaders have or organizations have at stake to maintain negative narratives that it's not just a question of staying in power and you you mentioned this at the shtetl Jew it's the ever dying people it's all these things we've heard that that that there's so much of the Jewish community that is based on fear it's fear of assimilation fear of of dying out fear of being be killed and fear of BDS and OH all of these fear driven positions are so are so unhelpful that way and I think that and as you said about you know trying to turn that into a positive view about Jewish life and frankly I as someone who's been involved as deeply involved in my whole life I am so tired of that and those negative messages and I really would like to I would like to see them turned around not just about Israel but about a lot of aspects of Jewish life and a lot of this line drawing of your who's legitimate who belongs in the tent who doesn't belong in the tent and I think you know we could just there's a lot we could just open up open up the conversation and open up the community as I can also circle back a little bit to the question both of Gaza and of this element of fear I think another element that I see a lot in the American Jewish community especially with our relationship for Israel's hopelessness I know that after the 2014 war in Gaza like part of the reason that I felt compelled to join J Street you it was because over the summer I was watching as the death tolls of civilians in Gaza just climbed ever higher and I was looking around at my community I was like where is the compassion where is that empathy why aren't we speaking out about this why don't we seem to care I know that the situation in Gaza is really complicated I understand that Hamas is ruling the Gaza Strip and I know that there are rockets that are threatening Israeli lives but I think that in the American Jewish community especially we've almost become like paralyzed by the sense of hopelessness of there's no solution for Gaza there are over a million people there who don't have access to consistent water to electricity and have no freedom of movement and we consistently turn a blind eye sounds like Flint Michigan yeah no it actually really does that's yeah okay but I think that we have to acknowledge that the American Jewish community has a Gaza problem and that problem has continued to this day I feel that we've actually we have a moment to not be hopeless right now because there are nonviolent protests that are being led by people in Gaza that have been happening for the past three weeks I want to be clear that I know that there have been some violent elements to them but they have been mature like the majority of them have been nonviolent that's something to feel hopeful about in a politics between Gaza and Israel des has been dominated by violence for so long how can we not look at non-violent protests and be uplifted by that how can we not grapple with it even if we don't agree with the ideology behind it and I think that we should all like I feel horribly to know that the Israeli military has been using live fire against these nonviolent protesters that over two dozen people have been killed but over 1300 people have been injured by it I think that we should see something but I think it's microfarad chief have said this isn't just about seeing something and about having a clear image about what's happening in Gaza it's also about putting our values into action and as a community what are we going to do about Gaza what is our plan we need to figure it out and I think that if I've learned one thing being a part of G Street it's that when I see a political problem there is a political solution to that problem and it is up to all of us to the people on this panel answer the people in this room to figure out what is our political solution to this political problem going to be how are we going to organize so that we don't have to see another war in Gaza I I think that's the answer to the problem potentially but I also think that yeah we have to be acknowledging this more the American Jewish community has to be responding when we see a humanitarian crisis that is just getting worse and worse in Gaza I hate to be the only one here who's fighting with you guys but the idea of Palestinians waking up one day and figuring out that if a hundred thousand of a march on the border nobody can stop them I think that the government and the army which are usually at odds on these issues look at what's going on in Gaza now and they think oh it's happened Israel's worst nightmare how do you stop 30,000 people from walking over the fence and it's not I don't think it's cut and right and I think to the point I was saying earlier I mean I'm not from the community organizing model but what I say is if people have legitimate fears you can't just say to them don't be afraid because some of it as a non-violent if most of it is not violent that's I don't see that how that would be an effective response and it's effective strategy to change people's mind and because it's look there's there is there is fear that is that is the community we build on we build up and hopelessness and the generations and it's not founded and then there's legitimate fear and it's often hard to tell the difference so I don't know how how you respond to that strongly help you in the commit but how do you save that sort of thing in public without losing your public the people here are so passionately worried mm-hmm alarmed by what they're seeing in Gaza and Israelis feel like I think there's nothing much else we can do first of all I do want to move the conversation back to the Israel Jews relations because we have many panels that are dealing with a political issue but but I think you know you mentioned hope and I think we have to remember that hope is actually the name of our national anthem and sometimes we forget it and they I think I learned from one of my professors at the Kennedy School that a leader need the combination of hopeful hard and critical mind so we have to put that and somehow to also the relations between Israel and the US diaspora and I think there are several things that we can do one of the things is that there are many organizations including also here Israeli organizations that are doing work including in Gaza the organization that I'm with the / Centre for example that but many others I just have the opportunity to do some propaganda and they and they I think that it will be great if if American Jews could be part of those efforts that would be very empowering another thing that I think we could do is that Israelis we learn more about you because many Israelis are completely ignorant they don't know the power of this community they don't know the power of pluralism they don't know the power of philanthropy because in Israel we think that if we pay our taxes and we serve in the army that's all the rest the state should do so I would do certain things to connect between the communities one of them very critical is what I what we call reverse birthright I think it is amazing that almost every child in Israel during high school is really visiting camps in Poland the Nazi comes and it's important to visit becomes even though I would shape the message a little different and not only in strengthening the trauma and the victimization but I think it's important that we will also visit live Jews in America and every child in Israel is fooled we spent some time in an American community and learn about you guys because that will be a life-changing experience secondly I think that we should have much more connection between organizations progressive organizations because most Jews just not that Israel is its government they don't know about so many things that are happening maybe we should have a fund that gives seed money to joint ventures between organizations here and organizations there that are doing work for tikkun olam and and thirdly I think that it will be great if we ever have a constitution that that there will be someone in Israel maybe the president because president's supposed to be not political but it will have the power to cancel any Knesset resolution if it works against the connection with the Jewish world because we need someone see the connection of the Jewish peoplehood and not just the political you know that politicians care about their constituencies so they don't care about liberal Judaism because it's not a majority in Israel and they don't and they usually see you in an instrumental way because by definition that's their job if they are from the foreign ministry they want to have help in Congress if they're from the absorption ministry they want you to come we need someone some institution that we're looking at Jewish peoplehood and how we could help Jewish peoplehood and whenever the Israeli government is taking decisions against Jewish peoplehood we should have this kind of institution that calls calls out and make sure that we keep on being together I've been doing this for a very long time I just went on Medicare I think this is the first time I've heard anybody from either side urge more cooperation between the american-jewish left in the Israeli left the Orthodox and the right are very comfortable with each other and very cooperative but the left on the both sides of the ocean seemed not to be aware of each other but let me go on less question just quickly each of you the word hope and the word despair despair is a word you hear a lot these days how do you measure the two how do you live with one how do you live with the other can one be turned in to the other that theory what do you feel what do you do with what you see in the world and what you hope for in the year activism yeah I mean I think that's it like for me is that it feels like when I am in a moment of despair when I see things that are happening on the ground when I hear that sucia is receiving more demolition orders when I know that chronolock my face with the prospect of complete evacuation just this month um I do feel that despair um and all sometimes I sit with it for a little while because I'm not sure what to do about it um but again I've learned how to organize I've learned how to get my book my fellow students organized so that we can find a way to respond to the dynamics that we're seeing and not feel so powerless like we can actually like Robert Rick Jacobs talked about how the people like the young people are leading we're leading right now and I think that the way that we're leading is through actually taking responsibility for creating the change that we want to see and we're doing that every day we're doing that this week with the the the letter by representatives Aramis and Schakowsky by advocating for that on the hill we're doing that by dropping off a thousand letters to the Israeli embassy advocating against demolitions that's that's what makes me feel hopeful is that there are so many students behind this who are staying in the face of a politics that would aim to disempower us every single day we're gonna take back that power we're going to speak up and let our voices be heard we're going to advocate for something different hope and despair okay so in my life in in in diplomacy and in government I noticed that one of the strongest phenomena out there is self-fulfilling prophecies when you say you have we have no partner for peace eventually you'll behave in a that you have no partner for peace when you say the whole world is against you eventually you behave and so I believe in the power of optimism I believe in the power of hope my boss president Paris used to say two things about why it's optimistic the first was that he said optimists and pessimists die the same way but they live very differently I think it's much healthier but the second thing that he said that I want to remind all of you with all the criticism at Israel which I share he used to say I am an optimist because I have a license to be optimist I was here when Israel was nothing it was a doubt we were out bound outnumbered no natural resources and look what we made of this place so he said the same optimism I have for peace because I remember the days when people say we can never have peace with Egypt or Nika never have peace with Jordan so up until his last day he was very hopeful about his peace with the Palestinians and I want to remind all of you that people that optimism is not just a way to perceive the world it's also a way to affect the world so let's keep hope so I do have to answer this on a really personal level and this is not my researcher hat this is just my excuse my trajectory as I said I was I grew up you know very attached to Israel I've never been an advocate I've never been an activist I just was interested in in living my Jewish life and I would say that has all turned around through my children who have tried one of whom is here and I that I have learned so much from them and I hear this up from a lot of my peers that going through how much they loved Israel and then going through that period of despair of finding out it's not what we always thought it was and that was the despair and and and I think that the only hole and and so this has been a long period of rethinking what I always thought was true and it's been very difficult but I think that I I believe in the truth and I think that you can't move forward unless you know the truth and we all have to take our heads out of the sand and see what's actually going on in the world in our community both in Israel and here and and I think that that gives me hope because that's the first step [Applause] they're just so much despair here in the United States it's outside it's inside of us I think we can be paralyzed by the despair that threatens to consume us I don't I don't think that the despair should have even the slightest impact on our ability to dig deep the poet Yehuda i mcai in his poem by erotica talks about us our people being niju a tikva em from plagues or infected said we as a people we are infected with hope meaning it's inside of us we can't be cured of it and it's not a kind of a naive i hope things will get better that that kind of hopefulness is not what our people actually have built not only our jewish state on but our lives but the sense that I actually am obligated to move the project of my people forward and I see my hope is when I see the activism that is coming together in this country I see it also in grassroots in Israel and I see it in other parts of the world I think the hope is that people are standing up finding a backbone finding a voice and finding concrete things to do to not be consumed by the despair but rather to to live out the commitments that we as a people have always put front and center and I just think also that even the conversation today there people who would say you know to pro-israel I heard this at another conference a few weeks ago that to say pro-israel automatically means you're Pro peace I actually don't hear that very often and I hear sometimes people telling me and telling Zoe and all of us that if you're pro-israel you're Pro settlements that you are someone who if you if you hold these these commitments you have to at the same time you know hold this set of ideological attachments above all other values and I think that we have to find a way to say that pro-israel is about pro-peace it's about pro pluralism and we can't have a shortage of empathy if I have only empathy for the people who are just like me I don't have empathy I have to have empathy and if I can feel the pain of what it's like for the people of Gaza to live in an impossible situation and the the sort of the responsibility for that is not on one other party it's not entire line is if there's a whole universe of people who frankly have responsibility to make sure that that that impossible and degrading human you know kind of footprint on the planet that we address those and that's part of the hope to see in the most impossible the most intractable challenges facing our people and our world that there are places for us to to not only yak about but to act about and that gives me hope [Music] well this thought agonizes me lately and there's an old saying I am optimistic in the sense that I fully expect things to get better I'm pessimistic in the sense that I fear my optimism is ill-founded let me throw out a thought that may either be shameful or a source of pride I think it is a source of pride but I'm a little ashamed of that why was the response to the parklands shooting so different what happened this time that turned into a national movement where in the past had simply been depression and despair and I would suggest without being too serious about it that this is the first time the shooters picked a school that is half Jewish there's something about Jewish mobilization but there's also the thought the story about the Jew in the shtetl who walks down the street he sees his friend sitting on the roof of the mikveh under those ritual baths he says what are you doing up there he says the community is paying me to look out for the coming of the Messiah and there's one on the ground says what kind of a job is that is the painting good he says the page stinks but it's a guaranteed future thank you thank you I guess we're done

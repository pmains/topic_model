thank you madam chairman I'll try to do this in six minutes but miss Harrington will have a discussion here a moment I won't let the the chair women the ranking member know about my concern about the mobs program back in the 1990s under the Clinton administration South Carolina agreed to accept thirty four metric tons of plutonium weapons-grade plutonium and excess of our defense needs there is an agreement negotiated between the Clinton administration and the Russian government where we would take thirty four metric tons of plutonium in excess of our defense needs weapon material and the Russians would take thirty four metric tons and we dispose of it we've been dealing with this issue for over a decade now well over a decade and the Obama administration comes along and they actually begin to build a box facility and I'm sure you're aware of it because of duke power but in case people are not there's a technology that's been tested and it works where you can take weapons-grade plutonium blend it down and make commercial-grade fuel out of it so you're taking a sword and making it a plowshare and the Mocs facility at savannah river site is somewhere toward halfway being completed in last year the statute that Senator Thurmond wrote when it was in the Senate now was in the house because there was so much pushback in South Carolina about accepting this plutonium the fear was we're going to hold this stuff and no have no way forward well guess wat Yucca Mountain shut down so mocks gives you a way forward it becomes commercial grade fuel but the statute will wrote back in in the early part of this century I believe 2000 required a hundred million dollar a year fine to do if they didn't stay on track well last year there were off track in terms of the timetable but i sat down with the obama administration said listen we don't want the hundred million dollars we want the Mocs facility and so we extended the time period for two years i can assure you i would not have done that if I this year and the President's budget they would be suspending the Mocs program for study we have studied this thing to death is now time to get on and getting it built miss Harrington we do have an agreement with the Russians regarding the thirty four metric tons is that correct yes sir that's correct and in 2010 the agreement was amended to say that the disposition path would be mugs is that correct that is correct we rejected vitrification because if you're going to vitrify all the stuff we're not going to store it in Savannah River we're not storage site so if we do something other than mocks how can we meet our obligations under the treaty first I'd like to clarify that in this assessment pause that we we have included in the budget box remains clearly on the table it is not that we are disregarding mocks as Harrington I just option I don't mean to be rude now you're a very smart lady it's not on the table it's the pathway forward it's not subject to debate I wouldn't ahead I wouldn't have done anything I did last year if I thought there was one chance in a million that would be debating a year later whether or not machs is the way to go I don't want the hundred million dollars I want to get this stuff off the table in America and particularly in Russia given the times in which we live in so what I would suggest to you is that the two billion dollar overrun concerns me too I met with the W Secretary of Energy and here's what I'm willing to do I'm willing to sit down with the department of energy in the contractor to try to get the cost down below eight billion dollars now it's Savannah River Site the pit disassembly facility was going to be a third separate building this is where you take the pit I have the warhead and that's what's blended down into MOX fuel it's the plutonium bullet we were able to avoid building that facility and save 2 billion dollars right there over the past decade savannah river site has been very forward-leaning when it comes to saving money in a responsible manner we've got 54 tanks on a full of Cold War residual material high level toxic waste and we're agreed back in 2002 i believe it was to leave a portion of the waste in the bottom of the tank in the hill of the tank rather than scraping it all out and that saved sixteen billion dollars we thought we could close the tanks up with some high-level waste that would be treated and that safe sixteen billion dollars so Miss Harrington we in South Carolina and Georgia have tried to be good stewards of the taxpayer money and I'm just here to tell you that I will work with the administration I talked to Dennis McDonough about this last night to get the cost down but I will not entertain for one minute a disposition plan other than mocks we're halfway through there is no other way to do it we have an agreement with the Russians and now's not the time to break that agreement given the world in which we live in and is surely not the time to break faith with the people of South Carolina and Georgia so when it comes to lowering costs count men when it comes to studying another way to do it count me out have a good day

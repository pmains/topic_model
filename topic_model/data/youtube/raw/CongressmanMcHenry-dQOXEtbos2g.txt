mr cordray thank you for being here um you authorized did you not the creation of the academic advisory commission or council it's i think it's called academic research council but yes and you authorized this before i became director but it's something that exists has existed the bureau for some time okay now did does that uh council report to the assistant director of research who was until recently sundhill uh malinakum yeah i wouldn't say report to it's an advisory council that's meant to assist us in our work and give us broader perspective on on many of these issues but in the org chart where would they report they would work well they're not it would raise the bureau they're they're folks from outside who are willing to spend some of their time helping us think about these issues okay but this is a group that you gather in and you decided this was a good good idea to have this this board again it's existed since before i was the director but i yes it is a good idea okay so uh have you heard of the company called ideas42 i believe i've heard that name okay um what do you know about it not much okay um are are you aware the cfpb awarded a research contract for five million dollars to ideas 42. i believe i knew that i'm not familiar with all the details of that and was was this a process it was a competitive bid process or was this more of a single source contract so all of our procurements at the bureau go through the regular federal laws and contracting guidelines uh and we've been audited on that uh okay okay but and i i don't know off hand whether that was a single source contract single source right but it was it was done according to government proceedings i understand but single source contracting exists right and that's i believe i believe okay um so if you let us know whether or not that was competitive bid how many bids there were and for what from what companies okay and then furthermore um you know uh you know that that full process for this it's a five million dollar contract and um that's important are you aware that uh sundhill uh malinakum it was a co-founder of the company ideas42 uh i don't know if i was familiar with that or not i don't believe so okay but he was the former uh research uh head of research right our assistant director for research that's correct he was he he's no longer employed by the bureau uh but he's he's a well-regarded uh economist macarthur grant winner and well known in the field yes and and the question i ask is about your policies and procedures yes um for a former staffer of yours to get a five million dollar uh contract without any apparent bid he is a co-founder of this company and go ahead please respond yeah i i don't know that uh the details of that are are all accurate i don't i don't believe as far as i know that sendel is involved in the uh management of that company but he's a co-founder of that company at one time yes yes and are you aware that four of your six members of the academic research council have direct connections to ideas 42. again i don't know what you mean by direct connections well number one one is a is a founder and uh board member of ideas 42 one is an advisor and two are affiliates of that firm i i don't know what you mean by advisor or affiliates and when you say founder are you talking about sendel well this is yeah this is yes okay happy to have our staff follow up with you i'm quite confident that everything done there as has been true of all of our procurements was done properly in accordance with government procedures do these connections raise any question about conflicts of interest when you have an advisory board four of the six members have a connection to a company that gets a direct contract from the cfpb for five million dollars again um and furthermore uh that you have a founder who is a formerly with your employee and we're not sure of the circumstances of his leaving but he's apparently departed in the ensuing amount of time between you know in the last year it appears that's correct look uh i'm quite confident that everything was done uh properly that we have carefully vetted these kinds of conflicts of interest happy to have my staff work with your staff to go through it in detail we'd like to have some answers on that because it appears it will be a concern to me so it appears to us an enormous conflict of interest and it raises greater concerns that we have with the policies and procedures you have to avoid conflicts of interest with your staff and former members of your staff who have enormous connections both with policy making without much in the way of a cooling-off period of any sort before they come back to either receive a no-bid contract uh or maybe even a competitive contract we don't know so i'd like to have answers to these questions they'll be fine thank you time of the gentleman has expired

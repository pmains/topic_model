back it's time for our weekly Common Ground segment where we bring lawmakers from both sides of the aisle or people from different perspectives CEOs celebrities to see if they can find some common ground joining us this evening Delaware Democratic senator Chris Coons and Ohio Republican senator Rob Portman Senator thanks for being here I do want to start with obviously the news this week about the midterm elections which actually are continuing as races are continuing to be counted and the control of both the house and the Senate up in the air I just want to get 30 000 feet you're all what your perception is about the midterm and the message sent by voters as you see it from both your perspectives Senator Portman first to you well what the voters have said is pretty clearly uh Brett we don't want to see extremes on either end and so once again our very divided countries ended up kind of in the middle I mean it's extraordinary to think about this but we are literally going to be either 50 50 in the senate or 4951 probably one way or the other and in the house the majority luck cycle will shift to the Republicans which I think is a positive thing for the country but it's a very small majority so it just means that the voters have spoken once again and said they they are not interested in the extreme candidates or the extreme positions by the way I think the Biden Administration should pay attention to that and the President should begin governing more from the middle which is what he promised of course in the campaign and pledged in his inaugural address and this is an opportunity for a reset Senator Coons your take 30 000 feet well Brett I think uh President Biden and the Democrats in Congress have succeeded in pushing back against history typically in a first midterm election the incumbent president's party loses between 25 and 30 seats in the House and typically four seats in the Senate so this is a positive outcome I will agree with Rob that I think this is It's striking that after 10 billion dollars spent on this campaign it looks to me like we'll end up right back where we started at 50 50 Senate and more than ever a need for us to find common ground and to work together to move the country forward Senator Coons you know I'm going to play a little composite of some sound bites from from president's past and President Biden in this traditional news conference after midterms Nicholas I'm not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like they like I did last night today I had a chance to speak with John Boehner and congratulated Mitch McConnell on becoming the next Senate Majority Leader speaker Nancy Pelosi and I give her a lot of credit it really could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation what in the next two years do you intend to do differently to change people's opinion of the direction of the country particularly as you contemplate a run for president 2024. nothing that was President Biden yesterday Senator Coons but I guess definitely he beat expectations and Democrats beat expectations heading in and there was no Red Wave it was a ripple maybe except for Florida but nothing is that the message that that Democrats are taking from the midterms well Brad Rob and I worked very well together on a couple of big and important bills we got bipartisan bills passed in the Senate on infrastructure uh on bringing uh investment back to the United States on reshoring the chips and science industries that are critical to the 21st century and it's my hope that going into the next Congress it's that sort of work that will get priority and we'll get emphasis well first let me say so much for the reset in terms of uh President Biden's comments that nothing's going to change something should change and we should figure out a way now to work together it is divided government you will have a majority in the house which is different we'll see what happens in the Senate I tend to agree with Senator Coons we're likely to end up back where we are but with regard to the elections and who was um you know a Maga candidate or or who wasn't uh I I think it was not a good night for Donald Trump there are critics Senator Portman of Senator McConnell and how he orchestrated things he took money away from New Hampshire and Don bulldog and took money out of the race in in Arizona with Blake Masters and actually gave money to Lisa murkowski who's running against another Republican a trump supported Republican in Alaska and so is that criticism Fair of the Senate minority leader no I'd say just the opposite uh you know some some people say that uh the 100 million bucks or so on that uh that President Trump had was not was not used very much in terms of these races and there's you know there's a fact basis for that you can look at how much money was put in but as an example in Ohio JD Vance was behind at some points and then he was tied it was a tight race it was Senator McConnell who stepped forward and provided over 30 million bucks for Ohio which is unprecedented and got him over the top even though he was you know he was uh Senator he was former president Trump's candidate in the primary not Senator McConnell so Senator mcconnelly stepped up all right let's talk about uh foreign policy you all just returned uh from a trip overseas and the stop being Ukraine and the focus on Ukraine and what's happened putting on the ground in in with Russia well Brad it was a real blessing to get to travel with Senator Portman and to go to Kiev to present the Liberty medal from the national Constitution Center to president zielinski to have a chance to visit with our Embassy and the great folks who are working representing the United States in country in Ukraine and to get to see how our Aid is being distributed they are determined they simply want our sustained support Rob and I made a number of important inquiries about the traceability and the transparency of our assistance and I think going forward we should continue to be reliable and robust supporters of Ukraine's fight for freedom and what about the negotiation possibilities look I agree that um president zielinski and the ukrainians have to be open to the possibility of negotiations but on their terms not on Russia's terms Senator Portman there are some inside the Republican Party who are concerned about the money flowing there that uh that is going to be never ending well I think it's appropriate to have a debate it's it's a lot of money on the other hand it is absolutely essential that we continue to support Ukraine during this pivotal moment I think we can provide the ukrainians what they need to defend themselves I want to end where where we began and talking about uh the possibility of politics changing in the U.S senator Coons Democratic representative Alyssa slotkin in Michigan she won her race and uh but it was a tough one and she talked about how she thinks people are changing and and the ideology is changing take a listen our state voted for Donald Trump in 2016 but I think at this point people are just looking for someone who plays in the center and is a pragmatist they don't like the extremes on either side of the aisle is there a rise of the center that is possible both of you are obviously Senators who reach across the aisle to try to get things done well Brett I'm here in Georgetown Delaware for a very Delaware celebration called returns day it happens two days after the election and the folks who win and the folks who lose in the election uh March down the main street here or ride down the main street in a wagon together and we have a bearing of the hatchet literally uh the folks after the elections get together here in the county seat of our southernmost County uh and Barry a hatchet in Beech sand I think it's a good symbol of what I think the American people are looking for and Senator Portman your thoughts well Brett I I attribute to all this movement toward more common sense finding common ground to you you know you put people on your show and try to talk about that um I mean my view is pretty simple I think the American people elect us to get things done well Senator Portman we appreciate it uh Senator Coons thank you very much and we're going to keep doing this pass the word up on Capitol Hill maybe more of your colleagues will come over and talk to us about what they're working on thanks a lot thanks Brett thanks

today congressman john lewis is being brought to the capitol where he will lie in state so we were blessed to have folks like martin luther king and john lewis who advocated for change and they did it in a peaceful manner we think of what happened at edmund pettus bridge where john lewis is beat up to the where he almost lost his life it took that kind of courage to change our country you know i often look at our soldiers and our servicemen and women those who wear the uniform as defenders of our country but frankly folks like john lewis and others who defended our country using peaceful protest defended our country's values and pointed us the right way so we became a better country it was leaders like john lewis who moved us forward to a higher level of perfection we have more work to do but we are still the best country in the world and john lewis helped us become their country thank you

that thank you from the day the Affordable Care Act became law my friends around said that empty handed on the other side of the aisle have done everything in their power to repeal it this is very unlike what happened when we passed planned plan V the prescription drug plan we lost you guys won that by that vote we went back to our districts and made it work and then we made a commitment if we ever become the majority we would fill in the doughnut hole that is you don't pay premiums you get no benefits between twenty three hundred thousand fifty two hundred dollars we were very different mr. chairman than you work I mean yes the house has already voted 56 times to refill it repeal the ACA we shouldn't be surprised that your budget once again assumes the ACA is appealed however today's market is another opportunity put into real terms exactly what the repeal means mr. chairman my amendment would restore the AC A's premium tax credits which helped millions Americans offset the cost of their health insurance bring why are we against this credit but we want to talk about and defend the credit for the one percent into those corporations in this country I want you to be arguing in behalf of the American people this year eight million people received premium tax credit next year 15 million received these tax credits according to Greta Budget Office my home state of New Jersey 250 4316 people receive a tax credit worth an average of three hundred and six dollars per month the budget is a tax hike on every single one of them repealing the ACA take away these tax credits of millions of middle-class Americans will only reverse the progress that this law is made and expanding quality and affordable health science I way to stand the foot of those people in your state and tell them you no longer have that tax credit if you have it and I'm taking it away and we're going to raise your tax beside and I hope you'll vote for me the United States uninsured rate has continued to decline reaching a low of 12.9 sent the uninsured the uninsured rate for working-age adults has dropped from 20.3 percent to 13.2 percent since october of 2013 I think that's progress now maybe you don't consider that progress I consider that progress when the ACA marketplace is open their business a thirty five percent drop in the uninsured rate the CBO projects that with the out the ACA there would be a 17 million more uninsured people this year and 23 more uninsured people next year and what is your plan to help those people tell me Americans waiting to hear this we're waiting we're waiting I said this afternoon the curtains coming down after two days this curtain doesn't even go up for crying out loud you have no plan before the ACA many people were paying for plans that didn't provide them with the coverage they needed the plans they purchase at high out-of-pocket costs and artificially low caps on coverage barricades were denied coverage for pre-existing conditions and insurance companies arbitrarily increased their premiums to the point where they couldn't afford insurance people were charged more because insurance companies decided they were too old too sick or even the wrong gender Wow what do you know about that you just discovered that and yet what was my republic of friends answer repeal repeal repeal repeal drill drill drill drill repeal repeal repeal you think that if any Republican colleagues cobbled together all of the time they spent trying to undermine the ACA they should have been able to come up with an alternative for this law they can't find anything good to say about but again the budget provides no alternative we'll get to that gentleman's time has expired oh I think I free yield back to you now I appreciate that now i think i'm correct that the gentlelady

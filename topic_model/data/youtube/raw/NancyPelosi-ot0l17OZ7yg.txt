hello I'm congressman Eric's wawel I wanted to talk to you about the devastating effects president Trump's education budget will have on the hopes and dreams of all Americans I'm at Dublin High School in the heart of my California congressional district where I chased my own dreams growing up I'm the son of a father who was a police officer and a mother who worked multiple jobs to raise four boys my parent's dream was that of most parents that their children do better than they did my parents chased that dream across America I lived in eleven different houses and attended nine different schools before settling here I saw them work hard sacrificed constantly and saved religiously because they wanted me and my brothers to attain something they never did a college education I achieved that dream for them and racked up a lot of student loan debt I still owe today but I went on to become a prosecutor a city councilman for my hometown and a congressman this dream of a better life for our kids through education and hard work is at the heart of our national identity it's in our DNA it's what unites us and defines us no matter who we are or where we come from yet today and especially with president Trump's budget the American dream is becoming further out of reach for too many Americans colleges cost has grown to prohibitive and for those who get to and through college the crushing burden of debt leaves millions in financial quicksand making it harder to start a family buy a home or turn a good idea into a business that's why two years ago I started future form a group of 26 young House Democrats focused on issues and opportunities for millenials America's largest most diverse and best educated generation we have visited almost 40 cities across our great country to listen to young people where they gather at community colleges and universities workforce training centers startups and established companies we've learned that the issues facing our generation from college debt to not having enough good-paying jobs they affect every branch of the family tree at one of our events with 200 brilliant young biotech scientists and to my surprise the first question came from a woman in her 50s she said she felt like a party crasher at our millennial listening tour but she told us she had come to the event for her daughter she said her daughter with the help of loans was the first in the family to go to college and after graduating she told us her daughter couldn't find a job and her daughter's debts started to mount her daughter had to move back home and the kicker this happened at the same time that her daughter's elderly grandparents were ailing and had to move into too many families like hers are squeezed from both ends too many families are struggling not even to get ahead but just to get by so we propose ideas like free Community College letting student loan borrowers refinance their debt like you can do with the home loan and doubling the tax deduction on student loan interest but as we strive to move forward president Trump's education agenda raises barriers the Trump budget and loan forgiveness for teachers social workers police officers firefighters nurses and others serving our communities often in low-paying jobs this budget freezes Pell grants without indexing them for inflation making it much harder for low-income students to get the aid they need and it would nearly cut in half the work-study program which makes college more affordable for millions of students while giving them valuable job experience on our tour we have seen the hopes and aspirations of the next generation rising in classrooms like this president Trump's budget deflates those dreams fortunately we in Congress are not powerless to save them in 1941 President Franklin Delano Roosevelt outlined four freedoms on which every man woman and child should be able to rely freedom of speech freedom of worship freedom from want and freedom from fear our challenging Congress now is to restore a fifth uniquely American freedom the freedom to dream the dream that our parents dream for us and that we all dream for our own kids with all of our hands and all of our hearts House Democrats are committed to expand your family's freedom to dream thank you

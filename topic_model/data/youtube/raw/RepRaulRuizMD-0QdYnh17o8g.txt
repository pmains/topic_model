vistas a gentleman from California mr. Lewis seek recognition mr. Chairman I have an amendment at the desk clerk will report the amendment amendment offered by mr. Ruiz of California page 31 line 9 after the dollar amount insert reduced by five million dollars increased by 5 million dollars pursuant to House Resolution 223 the gentleman from California to member opposed each will control five minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from California I would like to start off by saying thank you to chairman dent and ranking member Bishop for your hard work on this appropriations bill I rise today to offer an amendment to HR 20-29 the military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations act for 2016 this amendment is for the brave men and women who have served and sacrificed for our country our veterans California is home to almost two million veterans and I am proud to represent more than 54,000 veterans in my district alone there are forty thousand veterans expected to return to California every year for the next several years including the fastest growing group of returning veterans women as our troops come home and assimilate back into civilian life it is critical that we do not abandon our veterans when they put down their weapon instead we must ensure they have timely access to the critical benefits they have earned and deserve unconscionably thousands of veterans who have sacrificed for our country are struggling to access benefits they have already earned due to lingering claims backlog at the Veterans Affairs administration veterans across our nation are waiting for pensions prescription drugs and even life-saving medical care veterans are still waiting for the VA to process four hundred and forty eight thousand benefit claims and 176 thousands of those veterans have been waiting longer than 125 days for a decision our work to clear this harmful backlog is not finished and we owe it to these courageous men and women to do so as soon as possible these figures are staggering but the people this is affecting are not near statistics they are men and women like retired force master sergeant Andrew Walker and his family from Beaumont California mr. Walker and his family waited years on end without receiving the critical care he was promised earned and desperately needed well I am heartened that I was able to help resolve mr. Walker's claim the backlog remains an enduring nightmare for too many veterans across the country reduced to a claim number and a seemingly endless line veterans experience pain frustration hopelessness and despair although the backlog has shrunk since Congress last passed a similar appropriations bill we must not lose sight of the importance of getting veterans like Andrew Walker their hard-earned benefits as soon as possible as a member of the VA committee I am fighting to change the culture at the VA from the inside out by focusing on veteran centered care and ensuring that the VA continues working to eliminate this backlog we can take much-needed steps in keeping faith with our veterans and getting them the benefits they've earned that is why i'm offering this amendment to advocate for an additional five million to fund the digital scanning of health and benefits files to reduce the backlog by redirecting funding within the general operating expenses account of the Veterans Benefits Administration this amendment simply directs funds towards the digital scanning of health and benefit files that will reduce the claims backlog without any new spending as an emergency medicine physician I understand the importance of efficiency in health care and I know how dangerous such tribulations can be for a person with PTSD or depression by committing resources to digitizing health and benefits files we will further increase VA's capacity to tackle the Kings backlog ensuring veterans receive the benefits they have earned in a timely manner let us continue to bear in mind that these men and women have served this country and they have put their lives on the line we must serve them by making certain that Congress focuses on eliminating the claims backlog for good I encourage my colleagues to stand up for veterans and support my pragmatic amendment to reduce veterans claims processing times mr. Chairman I yield back the balance of my time

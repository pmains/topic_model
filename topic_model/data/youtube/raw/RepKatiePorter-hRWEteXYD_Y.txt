mr gonzalez how much did you spend did abby spend on litigation and settlements from 2013 to 2018 uh i i don't have that number off and we'll be happy to give it to you okay 1.6 billion dollars 2.45 billion on r d 1.6 billion in litigation and settlements what about marketing and advertising how much does abby spend on that uh well marketing and advertising we spend about four billion dollars a year yep 4.7 1 billion how about executive compensation 2013 to 2018 2013 and 2018. it's probably on average about 60 million dollars a year try 334 on for size now how much did avi spend on stock buybacks and shareholders start stock buybacks and dividends to enrich your shareholders from 2013 to 2018. well stock buybacks if you actually look at just poor stock buybacks it would be about 13 billion dollars stock buybacks and dividends is the question sir uh dividends that have to come back with a number for that over that period of time 50 billion dollars so mr gonzalez you're spending all this money to make sure you make money rather than spending money to invest in develop drugs and help patients with affordable life-saving drugs you lie to patients when you charge them twice as much for an unimproved drug and then you lie to policy makers when you tell us that r d justifies those price increases the big pharma fairy tale is one of groundbreaking r d that justifies astronomical prices but the pharma reality is that you spend most of your company's money making money for yourself and your shareholders and the fact that you're not honest about this with patients and with policy makers that you're feeding us lies that we must pay astronomical prices to get innovative treatments is false the american people the patients deserve so much better i yield back

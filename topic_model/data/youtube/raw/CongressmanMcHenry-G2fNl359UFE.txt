the Democrats joining us now congressman Patrick McHenry Republican from North Carolina concen I don't understand the Democrats silence on this because I've not heard anything from them if you can't stand up and support people being shot in the street by a tyrannical dictatorship there's something wrong with you know it's it's it's completely bizarre I mean this is the question I've been asking myself which is why are they silent when we got bin Laden when President Obama made the decision to get bin Laden we cheered it as Americans as Republicans as Democrats it was a good decision it was a right decision he had actual intelligence to keep American lives safe and he took it likewise when President Trump made this decision to get a terrorist like Soleimani who was on Iraqi soil at the time and he took that that effort and made that executive decision as commander-in-chief to protect our troops and to make a decision that keeps us safer we should Harold that we should we should cheer that and to me it's just absolutely bizarre that every action of the president this president of a president Trump has to get a unified no from Democrats it's not rational it's it's just arrangement syndrome that you're seeing a lot of it's the it's the emotional contempt for the president which has taken over he cannot do anything anything at all without being severely criticized in the worst possible terms but okay I think we straighten that one out let me know think about the national security question and the economic real question right so to keep us to keep us safe is is a the major priority of our president and to keep our economy strong major priority of any president and this president study in an unrivaled job of taking action and engaging internationally to make sure that we're safer and to make sure here at home that were growing our economy and growing our markets it's it's it's a great record to run on Thomason you couldn't see it I don't think but on the left-hand side of the screen whilst you were speaking we were showing video from Tehran of demonstrators walking around the American and Israeli flags refusing to trample on them as the mullahs wanted them to do and our president is backing up those brave people and I've not heard a word from the Democrats but that let's wrap it up with that comes from Patrick McHenry thank you very much for joining us sir we play clefairy many thanks indeed some Democrat in fighting

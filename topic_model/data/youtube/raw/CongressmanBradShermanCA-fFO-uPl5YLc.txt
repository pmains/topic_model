the chair now recognizes representative Brad Sherman from the 30th district of California and who serves on the Financial Services Committee for five minutes for questions thank you the homeless issue is a combination of issues some are homeless because of substance of use and psychological problems in trauma some are mostly homeless because the rents too damn high they can't afford it and I'm gonna focus this on this panel on that second group people who would be in an apartment if we had Wichita rents but we have Los Angeles rents and I'd say that this group of homeless people is just the tip of the iceberg for every person sleeping in their car or sleeping in the park there are 10 people who can barely afford their rent there are 10 people who have an unlawful detainer that they're worried about or at a at a at a payday lender trying to there are 10 people who are cutting back on their medications so that they can pay their rent there are 10 people sleeping on their friend's couch we only see the folks that are absolutely homeless but for so many people their rents too damn high the and it's a problem that we face in a number of big cities but particularly here in the United and a lot of and some of it relates to you relatively unique factors here one is we're the biggest city in the world without a grade-separated rail system so anytime you try to build something the first reaction is not that person is gonna be with me on the train no that person is gonna be in a car in front of me on the freeway we've got NIMBYs who won't let you build or people who think that my property values will go down unless the people who live near me are richer than I am you've got the fiscalization of land-use planning where every city is told if you can attract an auto dealer you get more money and it cost you almost nothing if you accommodate housing and that same property you get no extra money for your city budget because the property tax goes elsewhere and it's gonna cost you some money for police and fire but what I want to focus on here is impact fees you want to build a bill an apartment and we need runni to run the government if we should tax people based on their ability to pay we have something that does that's called the state income tax instead in part we're taxing people on their ability to build and those costs are then passed through to tenants LA Times had an art had a headline one reason housing is so expensive in California counties and cities charge developer fees local impact fees impact whether a project gets built and if the law of supply and demand one of the few laws Congress cannot repeal is operative if we can get more supply that will influence not only the people who live in that new unit but it'll bring the supply-demand cost down so what is la done to mitigate impact fees as a barrier to development particularly the development of low income of affordable housing yes thank you for your question I will start by saying the city of La is committed to removing regulatory barriers to building housing at a at a cheaper rate and keeping costs low particularly so they don't get passed on to tenants and I can talk about three areas in which we are working to streamline the development of new housing here in the city of La and the first thing I'll start with is the mayor's executive directive 13 this is a streamlined measure that puts the building for any of four housing project at the essentially at the top of the line and and it it let me interrupt I know you're talking about streamlining things if somebody wants to build an apartment unit in the San Fernando Valley how much of a fee is imposed per unit for them to be allowed to build that unit what's that what what is the impact fee sir I I could sir I can get that information to you more detailed in terms of the exact breakdown of what the feasts are what I can tell you is that through the streamlining measures and I do want to comment rarely do this to somebody it's not that these fees will be passed on to the consumer it's that the building won't be built and then everybody will pay a higher rent because the supply of units will be down while the demand is still up so you'll you'll try to you'll try to tell us what this fee is

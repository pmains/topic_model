and our next guest will call on the fda the food and drug administration tomorrow to fully approve the vaccines it's an effort to stop vaccine hesitancy and move along approval of booster shots kansas senator roger marshall who is also a physician is joining us now thank you for being here sir appreciate your time you bet jillian glad to be here and you're right we need to be focused right now on getting vaccines in those 20 of american adults that don't have immunity and protecting the most vulnerable and that's why why i am calling on the fda to get full approval for the current vaccinations that's going to kill two birds with one stone about a fourth of the people that have not been vaccinated say they would get vaccinated if indeed there was full approval and then also focusing on those uh most mostly at risk this would free up doctors get that third vaccination the booster shot in people's arms and i would just reference some real world evidence from our friends in israel who showed that 95 of the people who have died from the covid recently have comorbidities our friends in the uk study 220 000 people with the delta variant and what it showed is that 80 of the people were over the age of 50 and then two-thirds of them had some type of comorbidity and had the vaccine as well so let's protect the vulnerable and get the vaccines in the people's arms who we can it's it's that simple this could have the biggest impact of all things that the federal government can do to help america right now when backing up some of what you were just talking about we'll go ahead and pull up this graphic here this is from the kaiser family foundation this is a survey that asks people if they're more likely to get vaccinated if and one of the the things you'll see on here is one of the vaccines currently authorized for emergency use received full approval from the fda 44 of those are in the wait and see category so you know to the point that you just made i think a lot of people are waiting to see if this is going to be fully approved so keep us updated on where you go with that in the meantime you know the white house has put a lot of blame on republicans for uh creating this vac vaccine hesitancy if you will nancy pelosi has said certainly the republican party has been delinquent in embracing the science that people need to be vaccinated so point blank is this republican's fault yeah of course not you know it's incredible that the president trump developed the vaccine a warp speed at record time all president biden had to do was drive the trump train that was full of the trump vaccine and there are a group of democrats that are hesitant as well i don't care what party you are uh if we can get this get uh full authorization of these vaccine that's going to help and there's something else the fda could do as well that they could give an emergency use authorization for the more traditional vaccines the non-mrna that are out there and that will help some people as well look america is doing incredibly we're kicking this viruses but right now we're down to only 20 of american adults without some type of immunity thank goodness that the children do really well this is like the common cold to children so let's focus on the people that that are most vulnerable that would be our senior citizens and those people with underlying health care conditions if we can get the third vaccine in those folks you're going to see the morbidity the mortality fall way down we need to be focused on hospitalization and death not the number of people that are carrying an asymptomatic virus and before we move on to the next topic just to prove the point even more we can pull up this information here showing americans who want to wait and see before getting the vaccine nearly split 39 democrat 41 percent republican so that right there tells you a lot in the meantime let's talk about what's going on on capitol hill because it is a busy weekend in the senate we'll start off here with this bipartisan 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure package um senator schumer has said that the text is being finalized that's what we heard griff jenkins say just a few minutes ago have you yourself seen any of that text julie and i can only wish you know my staff's been texting me about every two hours since sometime yesterday afternoon and still no text any hour now is what what they're telling us but but regardless look um you know my hat's off to all the people bipartisan senators that have worked so hard you know probably two-thirds of americans want some type of an infrastructure plan that paves the way to our future but what they don't want is one that's going to uh you know is going to mortgage our children's future and and tax current hard-working americans to oblivion so i look forward to the final text we're going to see if we can take a decent bill and make it even better right now i'm a no but i would love to see some type of amendments that can get me uh to be able to support this infrastructure bill real quick because we're running out of time multi-part question why are you to know um senator susan collins seems to think there are enough republican votes so do you think ultimately this passes and how much of a win would this be for the president then well i think it will be a win for america that's what my focus is senator collins has done an incredible job she's one of the sharpest people i've ever met nobody is better prepared when she walks into a meeting uh so i think that this is is a good bill i bet she's right she probably has the votes to get it across the finish line you know i think how we paying for it right now there's about 550 billion dollars of new money about 200 billion dollars of it is going to come from unused copied uh relief dollars i would like to see a bigger a chunk of that i'd like to see more regulatory processes improved environmental processes several other things as well so there's some opportunities to improve this bill and we're going to keep fighting to improve it okay we will keep an eye on it and see what happens senator roger marshall from kansas thank you so much for your time appreciate it have a good night thank you jillian

thank you madam chairman chairwoman uh dr fauci i believe you have testified that uh that you didn't give any money to the wuhan lab to conduct gain of function research is that right that is correct how do you know they didn't lie to you excuse me sir how do you know they didn't lie to you and use the money for gain of function research anyway well we've seen the results of the experiments that were done and that were published and that the viruses that they studied are on public databases now so none of that was gain of functions so how do you know they didn't do the research and not put it on their website there's no way of guaranteeing that but in our experience with grantees including chinese grantees which we've had interactions with for a very long period of time they're very competent trustworthy scientists i'm not talking about anything else in china i'm talking about the scientists that you would expect that they would abide by the conditions of the grant which they've done for the years that we've had interactions so you don't think the chinese would lie to you well when you say the chinese the chinese are a rather broad group i know the scientists that we've dealt with have been trustworthy you think all the scientists uh have told the truth in terms of the origin of luhan virus and not been influenced by the communist party of china do you i don't have enough insight into the communist party in china to know the interactions between them and the scientists sir right why are we giving you money in the first place well that's a very good question and thank you for giving me the opportunity to to answer it well sars kovi one started in china in guangdong province and it went from a bat to a civic cat to a human yes and excuse me doc for interrupting you but our time is so yeah no no i'm going to be real quick time is so limited why are we giving money to the labs in china to study virology well i'm i'm going to give you a rather succinct answer to that sir i appreciate that and that's why i was saying the sars kovi one clearly the bats that have the viruses that are the coronaviruses are in china as i said a couple of times it's not in fairfax county virginia or is it in new york it's in china so if you want to show and study importantly the animal human interface that's where the bats are yeah the bats i want to be sure i understand your testimony you didn't give money to the wuhan lab to do gain to function research that is correct and you believe they didn't do gain of function research because they told you they didn't we've seen the results of the studies that they conducted and they were not including any private studies excuse me including any private studies i'm not sure what you're getting at sir here's what i'm getting at you gave them money and you said don't do gain-to-function research correct and they said we won't correct and you have no way of knowing whether they did or not except you trust them is that right well we generally always trust the grantee to do what they say and you look at the results have you ever had a grantee lie to you i cannot guarantee that a grantee has not lied to us because you never know yeah can we agree that if you took president xi jinping and turned him upside down and shook him the world health organization would fall out of his pocket i don't think i can answer that question sir i'm sorry what do you think that the uh president xi jinping has undue influence over the world health organization do you i have no way of knowing the influence of the president of china over the whole okay so you think the who is a completely independent body level playing field call it like you see it and they really want to get to to the bottom of the origin of the virus do you believe that my interaction with the w.h.o and for dr tedros the director general has been one that i do believe he's a person of high degree of integrity i want to i want to ask one last question why did you guys spike not guys and ladies why did y'all spike the prior administration's uh investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and whether it could have uh come out of the woodland lab sir i i we did not spike anything in the prior administration i'm not sure what you mean by spike but we have no influence the state department spiked the the the prior administration's uh study but that has nothing to do with the national institutes of health they didn't consult with y'all they did not did they consult with you dr collins i read about it in the press this morning doc they just spiked it without talking to their experts you don't want to answer that one do you i just read about it thank you madam chair you

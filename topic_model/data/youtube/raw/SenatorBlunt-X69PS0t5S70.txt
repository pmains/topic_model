well let's talk a little more about how a bill becomes a law the comments have been made speaker Pelosi says she'd like to take their bill to conference well you can't go to conference unless we have a bill I've heard our friends on the other side say 80% of what I'd like to do is in that bill they don't even say I'm for 80% of the bill that's that bill has 80% of what I'd like to do most people standing here at this news event today have never heard something that the members of Congress used to say all the time I'm gonna vote for this bill today and I'm gonna work to make it better in conference that's the way the legislative process is supposed to work if you if 80% of what you want is in a bill that can pass you go to conference and hope maybe 90% of what you want is your second vote you know in big pieces of legislation we always used to have to vote twice you vote once on the House or Senate version of the bill and then you'd vote again on the conference part of the bill everybody here that took a civics class remembers from the civics class it was the House passes a bill the Senate passes a bill they go to conference both both sides then vote again on the conference report and it goes to the president we've gotten so bogged down in making political points that nobody wants to make a law we've gotten so bogged down in getting your way that nobody wants to have the compromise that's the essence of democracy one side has a bill they're proud of we've got a bill we're proud of that can go to conference and that can go to the President's desk or once I can just say are the Democrats in the Senate can just say no we don't want to legislate anymore we'd rather talk about this issue than solve this issue we'd rather in the discussion then advance the discussion there are plenty of places in the future to say no I'm not for the final product I'm not for voting on the Senate laughter debate or I'm not for voting on the bill that comes out of conference there are plenty of times to do that and frankly that is our job

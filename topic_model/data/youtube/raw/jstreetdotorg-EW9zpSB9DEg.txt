my name is Laila own I'm a retired brigadier general form the israel israel defense forces i do believe that the equation of a palestinian state is absolutely urgent and i hope it's not too late and this is the only way because there is no military solution for this conflict this is an interest of Israel to live together with a Palestinian state I believe this is a condition for the existence of the State of Israel otherwise Israel will not be a democratic state or it will not be a homeland for the Jewish people it's very important that they will understand everybody in the United States will understand the Jewish people and other people that this is absolutely essential for Israel the creation of a Palestinian state and it's very urgent and if I hope that we don't miss the train

all right let's bring in Arkansas Republican senator Tom Cotton we'll get his reaction to North Korea in just a moment but let's start out with this OPEC Fallout I think Senator you can make the case correct me if you see it differently I think you can make the case that the average American voter no matter their party Republican or Democrat is not going to be happy if they're paying four dollars average for a gallon of gasoline in this country and we have the ability to produce more oil we have the ability to refine more oil but we're turning to Venezuela now for help potentially no Sandra I don't think many Americans are going to want to pay five or six dollars a gallon of gas as they are in some states out west um even though we have the ability to provide the oil and the gas and the coal we need in this country to power our economy you know we used to be a lot more dependent on foreign oil and OPEC had a lot more power but over the last 10 or 15 years thanks to the Ingenuity and the hard work of our petroleum engineers and geologists and Roughnecks out in the world fields we don't just have the opportunity for energy Independence but energy dominant supplying our needs and the needs of much of the Free World but the Biden Administration and Progressive Democrats in Washington have waged a war against fossil fuels and it's not even that they are worried about four dollar five dollar gallon of gas in its own right they want that to happen remember Joe Biden promised to eliminate fossil fuels during the campaign they want you to pay that much for your uh traditional gasoline-powered car because they don't want you driving it they want to force you into an electric vehicle which really should be called called a co-powered vehicle or a natural gas or nuclear-powered vehicle because the electricity has to come from somewhere however they recognize that's politically inconvenient but rather than unleashing American oil production rather than celebrating American Roughnecks they go to Communists in Venezuela or they go to radical ayatollahs in Iran hat in hand in a humiliating display begging them to produce just a little more oil so they can say that they're doing something about the price of the pump that is hurting so many American families well surely they don't Democrats want this oil and gas prices to be as high as they are heading into a midterm election which we're now just weeks away from certainly the Republicans are making big promises that they can bring gas and oil prices down if they're able to flip control of Congress in November so Senator what's the plan for Republicans how do you do this and how fast can you promise that you can get those prices down well Sandra the oil markets like many markets are based in part on expectations and predictions there's a reason why the price of gasoline started grow going up almost as soon as Joe Biden took office uh that's because the oil and gas industry knew that he was going to try to strangle them through a death of a Thousand Cuts there's no one silver bullet that he shot to strangle the oil and gas industry there's no one single solution but we can use our legislative powers especially our powers over federal spending to force more lease sales or Force accelerated permitting of the infrastructure we need to put a stop to this practice of using the Strategic petroleum Reserve as the political petroleum reserve and to generally make sure that the oil and gas industry in America understands that they're not going to continue to see this Avalanche of anti-fossil fuel laws passed by an extremely liberal Congress it's amazing to see that move from OPEC uh just months after President Biden went over asking the Saudis for help to bring those prices down the way the Wall Street Journal put it the Saudi snub Biden again I want to ask you now about this second missile launched into the EC what is the intent do you believe of North Korea and these exercises well in the past typically North Korea has fired missiles or tested nuclear weapons as a way to extract concessions from the West especially from the United States to try to accede to their demand so first off it's vital that we not make the mistake that so many past presidents have made frankly in both parties of viewing a missile launch is another reason to get more concessions to North Korea but second it's also vital that we make sure that we have the weapons especially the missile and the air defenses that we need to protect our troops which in a happy coincidence is what we would need to protect our partners in places like South Korea and Japan those are things like more Patriot missile batteries more advanced missile defense set technology to neutralize this threat from North Korea I'd say third as well Joe Biden needs to stop making concessions to dictators in places like Venezuela and Iran if you make concessions to dictators there Kim Jong-un of course sees that and believes that the store may be open to get more concessions from the United States so it's always important that we do not not Grant concessions that we don't project weakness to one dictator because anti-American dictators around the world will smell the weakness and they'll begin to demand concessions on their own well they certainly are getting the attention especially with the second missile launch in just a matter of a week Senator I appreciate you joining

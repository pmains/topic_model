thank you madam Speaker this is a frustrating time in Washington which most of us have been focused on the ongoing government shutdown but I want to take a moment to talk about some of the positive the house is doing to protect everyday Americans across this country my colleagues and I have passed a motion to intervene in the Texas versus United States lawsuit if allowed to stand this lower court ruling would pull the rug out from under millions of Americans who rely on the Affordable Care Act for health coverage many of whom were denied coverage in the past for a pre-existing condition 133 million Americans are living with chronic illness serious medical conditions or even minor medical histories that used to qualify them from all but the most expensive insurance coverage we cannot return to a time on a cancer survivor or a child with diabetes is rejected for coverage because of a pre-existing condition affordable quality health care should be a right for every American and we should be making it easier not harder for everyone to get insurance they deserve that's why I'm proud that the house has taken the action to intervene in the lawsuit demonstrating our steadfast commitment to fighting back against those who seek to dismantle the fundamental protections no person should be denied I will continue to work tirelessly with my colleagues to uphold Ellen's time as expires - American health care thank you madam Speaker

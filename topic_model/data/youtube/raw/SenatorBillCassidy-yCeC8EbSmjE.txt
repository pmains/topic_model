uh here to talk about biden's middle east trip and share his views on the white house's approach to energy louisiana senator bill cassidy is a member of the senate energy committee and we're so well well-versed senator in all the arguments on both sides and the talking points on both sides i want to approach it a little bit differently i mean we did have the pandemic and a lot of um of the majors and the oil companies kind of pulled in their horns rightly so oil went negative at one point then to reopen um there are supply chain considerations it's hard to get labor it's hard to get rig guys back there so there's all kinds of externalities negative externalities that make it very difficult for us to to get back to peak production in this country so i don't know if everything can be blamed on what joe biden said president biden before he became president about shutting down fossil fuels this might have happened anyway but is there anything right now domestically that the president is just too stubborn to do in your view and is instead headed over to saudi arabia and venezuela not headed there but asking them for more production yes so first we can say that the rig count in the united states has increased 58 over the last year not on federal lands but on private lands and that's good but but now we have refinery capacity at 95 percent so companies that buy out of the strategic petroleum reserve don't have the refinery capacity by which to put it in the gasoline so the administration by their regulatory environment and other discouragement we have we have refineries shuttering or converting to other products and it's estimated by the way that this coming year there'll be another 400 000 barrels of our gallons per day of domestic refinery capacity going offline now the administration i've called for an operation warp speed if you want a lower price at the pump you don't just have to look at oil you have to also look at every step in between think refinery capacity one thing that they could do they're requiring smaller refineries to purchase rents your audience knows what those are that's driving up the price beyond their break-even point despite these high prices and so they are closing the administration has things they could do to take advantage of increased supply to now increase the refinery capacity or at least hold it even well that seems like they could do that right away and it would have an immediate effect i can't imagine that that they wouldn't do that uh with an election coming up and and with where the price at the pump is although it's come down quite a bit what and and then you can answer that but then also the refinery problem goes back how many years uh senator and it's not the biden administration it's esg it's the green lobby it's the whole environment that we've been in where oil companies and refining companies don't want to spend any money on five and ten year projects or even two-year projects because they're under attack by not not just the body administration but but globally by people worried about climate change i'm totally with you on that it's estimated that there'll be a 2.2 million excuse me there's been about 2.2 million gallons a day offline in europe but on the other hand they're increasing capacity in asia i've always said if you're concerned about the climate you want your fossil fuel derivatives done in the united states because our environmental standards are the highest when you go to valero's refinery in saint charles parish louisiana you're so impressed by how much they do to control emissions that's not the case in china so if our greenies want to have uh the fuel that everybody in the world needs international energy agency by the way predicts increasing need for oil and gas through 2050 we should be refining in the united states as regards the wrens it's also a double-edged sword they're using ethanol made from corn to dilute the gasoline when we have a worldwide food shortage now some would say that corn used for ethanol is not going to be used for food stuff nonetheless that some way could be infused into the into the grocery supply chain to begin to lower the price of groceries i think their policy on wrens is way off i even just saw a chart of coal usage globally senator and after not hitting record use a couple of years we're back to record uses for coal not here but in china and india so a lot of these things we're doing it's hard to really to really see whether we're going to uh have a benefit any time soon on it and if we're going to 2050 with increasing oil that none of this really makes sense and there's going to have to be some 180 degree moves across a lot of different industries and i think government is going to have to do that and just face the fact that you can't get to zero emissions next year or the year after that yes so this administration lacks a strategy they will focus only on emissions but not on the economy uh the climate uh excuse me the energy supply and upon upon national security we need us we need a strategy which recognizes the nexus between climate energy the economy of a country and of a family and our national security if you ignore if you ignore any of those you don't get any of them but if we had that coherent strategy then we would have lower emissions taking place globally we would have a better economy for the family and for our country would have a better national security situation again as i don't want to sound partisan i think you can objectively say this administration lacks a strategy which addresses those four intertwined issues okay so we have an election in november we have one in in 2024 but if you were a a company that builds refineries or operates refineries why would you have the the confidence to risk your capital on a multi on a billion dollar project that that goes out five or ten years is there anything that the next there is a what a republican congress or a republican president do to ensure that you'll get a return on capital and that the rug won't be pulled out from you under you the next time we get a democratic administration well first let's recognize that a lot of these companies might be invested in asia asia does not enforce asian countries often do not enforce their environmental standards and so your cost your regulatory cost of compliance is much lower in asia and then you can ship to international markets including back to the united states we need to shut down that incentive one thing i've argued for is a carbon border adjustment in which you would say okay china if you're not enforcing your environmental standards then you are going to pay us the delta between that which we have to pay for compliance and that which you're not paying for compliance that evens the playing field by the way it began it changes their incentive to not comply with environmental standards to comply now if we have a well-performing company again i mentioned my how impressed i was with valero uh they would not have to pay here either it would be only those who were out a certain kind of comfort zone uh that would that would uh be required to pay a carbon border adjustment now i can go further into it on another session but i think that's something that would change the incentive for companies to locate here to actually come to our environmental standards as opposed to taking their jobs elsewhere and polluting the global environment more than otherwise senator we've got pat gelsinger the the ceo of intel joining us in just a little bit to talk about the chips act it's been held up in congress at this point in senate by mitch mcconnell who doesn't want to take that vote without some other concessions being given away on other issues there is talk at this point i know to split out just the semiconductor portion of that just the chips act itself and have a vote on that how would you vote on that there's this argument that it's a lot of incentives from asian countries to build those uh those those plants overseas is it important to have that here and is it worth spending billions of dollars of u.s taxpayer payer dollar to try and have those incentives i actually think so if you look at our military complex we use a lot of chips in our military now you've got to certify through a supply chain integrity that those have not been corrupted as chips have allegedly been corrupted in china before now we also see taiwan being uh being threatened and so there is this kind of china's attempting through its asian hegemony to influence that which we are doing here for our national security sake if nothing else and i think there's other reasons as well we need to have a robust domestic supply it needs to be a lot of these industries need to be re-short or near shored as part of a kind of a global strategy as we regard china which is seeking to undermine our national security but also to increase our national security so if that vote comes to the floor you will vote for it uh if that comes up as a separate bill absolutely i will vote for it right senator cassidy uh yeah let's talk again at down the road and um try to figure out you know if you were an oil company executive you you you need to think long and hard about about deploying assets anywhere considering that you can't really count on um you know what's going to happen five or ten years down the road i don't know what's going to change uh i agree with that one thing that could change is regulatory certainty i think we're on the same page there okay all right senator good to have you on thanks

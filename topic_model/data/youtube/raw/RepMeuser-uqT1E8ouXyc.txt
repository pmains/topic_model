and now recognize representative dan muser of pennsylvania for five minutes thanks very much chairman i appreciate it and thanks to ranking member mccall uh folks uh thanks for being here with us so a lot of us know uh these staggering numbers uh just in the last year alone 684 000 uh individuals left their countries from the northern triangle and illegally entered the united states that doesn't count they think the so-called got away is rates of irregular migration have surged during the biden administration um and while the bite administration is talking about root causes which i want to discuss this is very challenging for the united states but it's also challenging for these countries in the northern triangle and elsewhere since their population one third of it is under the age of 20. this exodus of working-age people creates a cycle of irregular migration and will be the root cause of persistent instability and economic stagnation stagnation if it is not addressed so we need to get our border under control because it's completely out of control for our sake and stop encouraging this long dangerous and costly journey um because of what what i believe is a reckless and completely disorderly border policy and the numbers certainly make my statement correct um you know last no uh december let's put it this way december of 2020 there were 32 000 uh illegal immigrants crossing the border uh december of 21 there were 174 000 the november of same numbers 33k in uh 2020 and 178 000 in november 21. so my first question is to assistant secretary of state nichols is there a plan to to mitigate this situation correct it because we know hundreds are dying along the way we know uh that they are coming here under false pretense we know the administration has secret flights flying them into my district and everywhere it's just it's just it's just embarrassing uh or at least it should be um is are you doing anything i mean we have act 42 uh title 42 we have you know remain in mexico under the previous president we did have cooperation of the mexican uh military and their their government and just just quickly without are we doing anything to suppress this or we're just we're just going along the same same way and causing hundreds to die along a treacherous trek on a in an unprecedented manner is that the plan we're engaging in intensive diplomatic efforts to address these challenges we are working with countries throughout the hemisphere on migration issues it's not just a u.s issue it's an issue that runs from the tip of south america all the way to canada i had the pleasure of joining secretary blinken for migration ministerial in colombia in october why was it one-sixth as much uh 13 months ago well uh right now we're seeing things like uh what's going on in nicaragua where uh the ortega mario regime has been uh dismantling all of the uh the uh i think everything's gonna be minimized i think it's gonna start reducing anytime soon this we didn't get into where we are overnight it's not going to get resolved overnight true we got into about 13 months ago yeah okay no we got it this is years and years in the making it's not 13 months if we don't want to face the problem accurately and pretend it's not there i don't know how we're going to fix it let's then talk about the root causes there there's is you have a plan okay because there are economic plans that could create tax incentives and other investment opportunities in the northern triangle and elsewhere that could encourage products for instance being made in eastern asia and brought to central america there's a lot of things that can be done as opposed to just handing over four billion dollars of the taxpayers money as as i read as your only plan is there actually a plan for root causes and can we see it for a solution root solutions do we have root solutions yes as i said earlier uh the vice president's call to actions already generated 1.2 billion dollars uh in investment for the northern triangle in central america thousands of jobs have already been created there we'll have trade missions to honduras and guatemala coming up in the in the next couple of months depending on the ability to travel with the omicron variant we're working with small businesses around the hemisphere using usaid funds we have security programs to address the community violence challenges we're working on issues like climate change respectfully i'm out of time if we could receive that in writing i'd love to see it and i'd also welcome the opportunity to go on such a trade mission i yield back uh mr uh

thank you and as the ranking member of the tax subcommittee here on ways and means I hope that we can take a moment to put the cost of not only of Medicare for all but other other costs that have been proposed as well to put that in in the appropriate context as we know that the efforts to raise taxes on all Americans including middle-class Americans to pay for a new federal benefits as many of you know we started in February with a proposal to increase the social Social Security taxes that proposal would increase the tax burden for example for a single mother making $50,000 per year by 1200 dollars annually and that was followed by hearing on infrastructure needs that also proposed an increase in the gas tax after that we had a hearing on paid family leave which would also raise that same single mom's taxes by about fourteen hundred and fifty fourteen hundred and fifty dollars per year and provide a benefit that she would unlikely use if she would be running her own business the following week we had a hearing on climate change that that proposal would cost between 51 and 93 trillion dollars or over ten years even at the most conservative estimate 51 trillion dollars works out to more than $15,000 per American per year over the next decade and now we are meeting and to discuss this proposal medicare-for-all representing another tax increase of roughly 10,000 dollars per year that each American is going to have to pay as a representative of one of the most rural districts in America I'm very concerned about the impact that any any proposal would have here out of Congress now we know that Medicare for all represents a thirty two trillion dollar expenditure to the federal budget and it also represents an immense risk for rural providers under the proposal a single unelected bureaucrat acting as Regional Director would be given broad authority to negotiate payment amounts for all health care providers in its region these payments capped an arbitrarily determined capacity to provide care would be prohibited from being used by hospitals for capital expenditures to improve patient care these are very important topics across world America especially rural Nebraska rural hospitals so we know are already struggling today and we see uncompensated care because of high deductibles high co-pays that is impacting us so many since 2010 more than 100 rural hospitals have closed their doors and many rural hospitals are operating in the red and yet one estimate regarding Medicare for all projects a 40% payment reduction for these hospitals it was discussed earlier this proposal would exacerbate the current a healthcare provider shortage we see in rural communities and I truly believe that rural America deserves better mr. nur can you explain how a single payer system would impact rural Americans and the rural hospitals that serve them I think rural hospitals would be much like vulnerable patients they would be those who struggle the hardest they they would most of them could not tolerate 40% cuts in their their non-government compensation right now many even more would close than are closing now and it would significantly impact the access to care also physicians finding it very hard to keep their doors open people in rural communities have to drive a hundred miles sometimes to see a doctor or a specialist in particular I think those problems would be would be exacerbated as we lose more and more physicians right thank you and just in closing I hope that we can have discussions about reducing the cost of health care before we actually implement drastic new changes to how we pay for healthcare and I think we can have a very very thoughtful discussion and exchange of ideas as we might proceed thank you I thank the job

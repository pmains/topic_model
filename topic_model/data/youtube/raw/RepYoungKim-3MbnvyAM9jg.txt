americans are seeing the impacts of inflation every day with rising costs everywhere from the gas pump to the grocery store california workers and families are bearing the brunt of this nationwide 13-year inflation high prices of everyday goods in my state are in many cases higher than the national average for example the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in california's 39th district is more than one dollar higher than the national average additionally these higher costs come in in addition to high state and local taxes cost of living and astronomical housing costs june statistics showed the median housing price in my district rose more than 20 percent with the median price of a single family home being more than eight hundred thousand dollars that's why i'm disappointed that instead of working with republicans to address inflation get americans back to work and support small businesses democrats are moving forward with trillions more in federal spending on a partisan wish list that will cause increased federal debt even higher costs of living and more money out of pockets of hard-working taxpayers we should be making life more affordable not less with that i hear it back

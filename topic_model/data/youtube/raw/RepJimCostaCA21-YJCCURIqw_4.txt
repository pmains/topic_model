117th Congress I believe will go down as one of the most successful uh congresses in modern history we have passed over 200 bipartisan bills provided funding for vaccine relief the American Rescue plan 1.2 trillion dollars bipartisan investment in infrastructure efforts to deal with our veterans focusing on reform on the Postal Service the inflation reduction Act and the list goes on and on we have not passed such successful legislation since perhaps the Great Society in the 1960s and so as we reflect upon that and the historic speakership of Nancy Pelosi we reflect upon the success of the last two years with a four vote majority and a 50 50 tie in the Senate certainly her speakership is historic in so many different ways and I look on to the next Congress the 118th hopefully notwithstanding our divisions we can find ways to work together on infrastructure as we continue to invest in America in water extreme drought conditions facing the west and California much necessary for the long-term future because where water flows food grows investing into transportation to compete around the world Broadband I want to get a medical school in the San Joaquin Valley we have shortages of Physicians and we need to increase the amount of nurses to improve better health care for all Americans and Rural America we need to focus on Rural America I represent a great deal of it yes there are divisions in this country but I hope the 118th Congress remembers that we are here to serve the people this is the people's house that is our purpose to work together and solve problems and oh by the way my alma mater Fresno State Bulldogs we we hope they're going to be successful in Saturday's game go dogs I yield back the balance of my time

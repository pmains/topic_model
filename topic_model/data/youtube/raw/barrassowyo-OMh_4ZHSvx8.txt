Sandra let's bring in Wyoming Senator John barrasso he's also the chairman of the Senate Republican conference and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee let me play just a little bit more of what President Biden said in terms of what his goals are for his visit to Saudi Arabia listen here we've made a mistake of walking away from our influence in the Middle East I'm going to meet you with nine other heads of state I want to make clear that we can continue to lead in the region and not create a vacuum a vacuum that is filled by China and or Russia against the interest of both Israel and the United States Senator what he said at the very beginning there we made a mistake of walking away from our influence in the Middle East who walked away from U.S influence in the Middle East certainly not president Trump he was fully engaged in the Middle East yeah it's it's Joe Biden and the problem is you see him there he is a weakened president going overseas representing the United States as commander-in-chief but yet he's weakened the headlines every newspaper in America today soaring inflation every headline last weekend in the United States sinking poll numbers for the president you want him to go over from a position of strength but he brought this on himself he's taken us from a country of energy dominance to energy dependence so people know around the country why he's really there he's looking for oil to bring back to the United States to try to bring down the cost of energy when we have plenty of it here we ought to be exploring for that energy offshore on public lands and in Alaska that's what I'd like to hear the president of the United States say to the people of America you know back on this idea of walking away from our influence in the Middle East during the 2020 election campaign then candidate Obi Biden then candidate Biden not oh Biden vowed that he was going to make Saudi Arabia a pariah that would seem to be the the very definition of walking away from our influence and strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia I agree completely that's the way I hear it is well we've had a long-term relationship with Saudi Arabia in terms of security in terms of Iran in terms of energy and one of the real challenges in foreign relations and I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate is if you have a country and a relationship with a country where your interests are the same but your values are not necessarily the same and that's the situation with Saudi Arabia so they have a new Crown Prince he's young I think 36 years old and they have been more aligning with Russia with China in terms of weapons drones from China in terms of bringing Russia into OPEC so we've had this long-term relationship and the president goes and decides to call him a pariah and now he wants to become a partner I would just give one bit of advice to President Biden 79 years old with a 36 year old Crown Prince please do not say Let me give be a little fatherly advice that will not go well all right so there are human rights concerns with Saudi Arabia to be sure the killing of Jamil khashoggi was abhorrent but on the other hand Saudi Arabia as you point out is a very valuable and important strategic partnership so how do you take into account all of those things in the relationship well as I said that is the most challenging part of Foreign Relations doing those things working your way through the relationship you want to maintain the long-term relationship in spite of terrible Behavior by one partner on an issue and the entire United States Senate hundred nothing condemned that activity against press conference this morning in Israel with the Ireland the caretaker prime minister in Israel and the president where there appeared to be a real split over the approach to Iran listen to this exchange here made it absolutely clear we will not let me say it again we will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome words will not stop them Mr President diplomacy will not stop them the only way to stop them is to put a credible military threat on the table prime minister lapid was schooling him there this is the way it happens in the Middle East Mr President well and rightly so we know Iran we know their activity we know that they've cheated on the former Iranian agreement with the and president Trump was right to pull out I agreed with him uh now President Biden has been even working through Russia to re re-bring on the Iran agreement which I think would be a terrible mistake in the united for the United States to go back into it seems that the president is so eager for a relationship with Iran and Iran deal he's willing to pay the price of paying Russia and Iran to take a deal no matter how bad it is for the United States all right well we'll watch Leslie see how it goes in Saudi Arabia we'll be watching you and some of your colleagues as well you're headed to the Border tonight heading to the Border we're going to be with the border patrol thanking them for the work that they're doing trying to keep our country safe you know the president of the United States would rather scold the Border agents or condemn them when they're out there doing their job and he is not doing his job protecting our country and really it's a dereliction of Duty at the border by the president of the United States he needs to go to the Border this will be I think my fifth or sixth trip he hasn't been there till since 2008 that has been just a drive a drive-by he needs to get there to see the Havoc that he has caused well we hope to catch up with your group tomorrow good to see you safe thanks

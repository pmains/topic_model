senator rand paul is now calling on falchi to apologize to every single parent and school age child in america spring and senator paul member of the health education labor and pensions committee he joins us now senator good morning to you so what is it exactly that you want to hear from dr fauci well i think this illustrates the danger of centralizing power and decision making in one person or in washington because when one person is so wrong as dr fauci has been it has grave effects for millions of school children the evidence has been clear for six months evidence from entire countries in europe and in asia that schools do not lead to a surge that kids are poor transmitters of this countrywide studies were showing this six months ago and he wouldn't listen and i tried to convince him of this and now he sort of flippantly says oh we're going to let kids go to school we're just going to close the bars well we should also look at the evidence on that do lockdowns you know prevent the spread of this right now we have more mandates and more lockdowns than we've ever had and yet the incidence of covid is rising exponentially it may argue that none of the things we are doing are working and we at least ought to be honest and assess it from an honest perspective not a biased one you you you used the words you tried to convince dr fauci back in june this is an exchange with him on the schools that again were shut at that time listen all of this body of evidence about schools around the world shows there's no surge all of the evidence shows that it's rare but i hear nothing of that coming from you all i hear dr fauci is we can't do this we can't do that did you get the sense then that he wasn't listening that he had some other reason why he wanted the schools to remain closed and what are you suggesting or can you he make the case that more data points were needed to come to this conclusion or months of studying and observing kids in the classroom well you know we went to a two-hour hearing back in june we've been through several of these and not one person brought up from the so-called experts that the mortality rate among children was about one in a million so i brought this up with dr fauci and immediately his defensive response was what about kawasaki's disease well kawasaki's disease is a rare rare complication of viral illness and yes it does exist and it's not to discount it if your child gets it but we shouldn't be closing schools because of it because we get it every year and it's very very rare but he wasn't really listening and i think the reason is is that with dr fauci i think his belief that we should submit that we're all members of the hive we're all members of the collective that submission is more important than the facts for example in the spring he said masks don't matter and don't work new england journal of medicine also said in an editorial that they're basically a talisman that they don't work outside the hospital setting but then they change their course over time but they're not really looking at data we have mask mandates in dozens and dozens of states and countries and every without fail every time we've instituted a mandate the actual incidence of the disease has risen so there's no evidence that these mandates are working and we're crippling the economy so maybe we ought to reassess what we're doing i think we should also be very clear here's dr val fauci in his own words and now saying the school should be open listen we say it not being facetiously as a sound bite or anything but you know close the bars and keep the schools open the default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school or to get them back to school senator also to be clear on where you stand on this you're saying the students are safe in the school as long as they're maintaining social distance wearing masks and engaging in these safety protocols correct i think there are reasonable things you can do in school for the small children i wouldn't have him wearing masks i don't think it makes any difference and really we ought to reassess what we're doing on this trying to take some precautions is reasonable but there are now people saying dr fauci included that when we have a vaccine you're still going to have to wear a mask so people do need to push back i'm one of those who are immune and i keep pushing back 13 million americans have had this we don't need to tell them they have to wear a mask the thing is is immunity is working it's working as well as the vaccine works and when we get the vaccine hopefully we can all be free of these encumbrances senator i've got to leave it there but are you suggesting there should be some sort of accountability when it comes to dr fauci or others who are advising that schools be shut as long as they have now learning that children really aren't spreading the disease well it's the same people who predicted millions and millions of people would die from this they've been wrong at every turn their models only work when they continue to adjust them with reality but they never have been accurate from the very beginning it turns out that this is a a terrible difficult disease for the elderly and for the kids this is the truth it actually is less deadly than the seasonal flu for children and we should acknowledge that this is a disease that is different depending on your age group and in a free society everybody should get to be able to analyze the data and make their own decisions senator appreciate your time this morning like to follow up with you on all of that soon thanks thank you

now recognize the congressman from cape canaveral uh mr posey uh thank you chairman beyer for holding this hearing on space nuclear propulsion for enabling deep space exploration uh mr french in your written testimony uh you mentioned policy improvements have already taken place for launching nuclear payloads with the national security presidential memorandum 20 in 2019. now why was the national security presidential memorandum 20 so important ah thank you sir uh what it did is it looked the it updated a policy that had essentially been unchanged since the late 1970s uh and in that time we've certainly had quite a bit of experience launching nuclear space systems what it does is it's very important that it doesn't change the overall safety and regulatory requirements that would have to take place to approve a launch but what it does is it shifts the the final approval for certain launches including uh likely what would be a nuclear thermal propulsion launch from being led by a presidential approval to won by the nasa administrator now again it doesn't change the safety and overall regulatory requirements but what that would do is if in nasa mission it would allow more focus in driving the process uh and ensuring that all the gates were met in a timely fashion and so so that's that's that's the primary uh positive thing there did i add to that response i would i would just like to add to that that everything mike said was absolutely accurate but i think one big innovation in the presidential memorandum was that the analyses are based on the characteristics of the system the levels of the potential hazard and national security considerations and all of those are made quantitative so the process that existed before since the 1970s was very open to interpretation and and a lot of discussion and it was just very expensive because there was no sort of level of safety to which you were trying to to aim for with this update there are quantified risks that we we aim to to address and that's that's a good thing all around that makes safety better it makes costs lower and it increases the speed at which we can achieve our comp our objectives thank you mr french how would that policy change be an important enabler for uh thermal propulsion systems that would be needed for deep space uh yes sir so uh under the under the as dr law talked about there's three different tiers under the new policy and as the policy is designed a flight demonstration of nuclear thermal propulsion system would fall likely under tier two which would gain the benefits that dr law just discussed okay is there anything congress could do to expand upon the uh the memorandum to keep america the preeminent leader uh yes sir i i'd say that on the policy side um affirming these positive uh improvements uh through authorization activity would be very important as well as uh you know affirming uh the the nuclear uh the language that the committee a subcommittee considered last congress would be a very positive step thank you uh mr maholic whenever a launch includes a payload with the nuclear reactor there's a huge process of safeguard threats to life and the environment uh in your written testimony you stated fission-based smtp space nuclear propulsion and power systems are manufactured and lodged in the off state that would dramatically reduce any threats to the environment or life can you give us an example of how that might protect lives let's say on the space coast for example sure um thank you for the question yeah so um as i mentioned in the in the in the um in my earlier words here you know rtgs are always hot given that the nature of plutonium right that's always radiating there always has to be shielding and so forth and if there was a launch accident you know those that that material inside of that reactor would still remain in that active state and you know would would uh fall down into the oceans and in the into the uh onto the land depending on where the accident occurs uh and potentially have to get it you know analysis and assessed for what kind of damage would be would be produced with a uranium-based nuclear fission system the uranium is actually not fissioning it is very very negligibly radioactive at the time uh during manufacture during the fuel formation during its uh insertion into the reactor um and basically is a giant chunk of metal that weighs several tons not unlike a normal spacecraft uh so you know if an accident were to occur this metal would come down you know possibly as a single piece um but unless there is some form or or or command or significant consequence that would cause it to go critical it would otherwise remain as a giant chunk of metal and just splash down into the ocean with no uh with note with no results uh but obviously the analysis would have to be uh done for you know the criticality analysis and everything that accompanies any kind of a normal launch when you're when you're dealing with this type of this type of thing so that would that would still continue thank you mr chairman i yield

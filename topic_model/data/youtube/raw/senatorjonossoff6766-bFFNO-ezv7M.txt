MICROPHONES ARE ON AS INDICATED BY THE RED LIGHT. THANK YOU, MS. FANO. >> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN OSSOFF AND RANKING MEMBER JOHNSON -- AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE STUFF, MADE MY APPEARANCE -- NO AMOUNT OF TIME CAN TRULY HEAL WHAT I SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. JONATHAN LUIS FANO'S MY BROTHER. HE WAS SO KIND. HE FELT GUILTY SO MUCH IS KILLING A BUG. HE WANTS TOOK THE BUS DOWNTOWN JUST TO BABYSIT OUR COUSINS KIDS, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS HIS OWN BIRTHDAY. JONATHAN WOULD SPEND HOURS UPON HOURS LISTENING TO MY PROBLEMS AND WOULD DO ANYTHING TO SUPPORT ME. BUT AT THE TIME, HE NEEDED THE SAME SUPPORT, NO ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS CARE, CUSTODY, AND CONTROL GAVE IT TO HIM. JONATHAN SUFFERED FROM BIPOLAR DISORDER AND DEPRESSION, FOR WHICH HE SOUGHT PROFESSIONAL HELP AND SUPPORT FROM HIS FAMILY. HE WAS NEVER ANY TYPE OF THREAT OR DANGER TO US OR TO OTHERS. IN OCTOBER 2016, JONATHAN WAS ARRESTED AND BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA, WHILE HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN, AND TAKEN TO EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON. IN HIS TEN WEEKS IN PRETRIAL DETENTION, JONATHAN NEVER RECEIVED A MENTAL EVALUATION. AFTER CUTTING HIS WRISTS, HE WAS PLACED IN ISOLATION. DESPITE OUR FREQUENT PHONE CALLS, OUR FAMILY WAS REPEATEDLY TOLD THAT JONATHAN DID NOT WANT TO SPEAK TO US. IT WAS ONLY ON CHRISTMAS THAT WE HEARD FROM HIM. JONATHAN TOLD US HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO CALL US. DURING THAT PHONE CALL, WE LEARNED ABOUT JONATHAN'S ATTEMPT ON HIS OWN LIFE. WE COULD NOT GET THE DETAILS BEFORE THE FOR PROFIT PHONE SYSTEM CUT OFF OUR CALL. EVEN THOUGH WE PROVIDED MORE FUNDS, WE WEREN'T ABLE TO CONTINUE THE CALL. E WE TRUSTED THE SYSTEM. MY FAMILY TRUSTED THE SYSTEM WHEN IT PROVIDED US JONATHAN'S COURT DATE. MY FAMILY FLEW ACROSS THE COUNTRY ONLY TO DISCOVER WE WERE PROVIDED THE WRONG DATE. WE TRUSTED HIS PUBLIC DEFENDER WOULD BE ADVOCATING FOR JONATHAN'S MENTAL HEALTH, CARE, AND RELEASE, AND THE ADVICE TO WHICH IS A LITTLE LONGER IN CUSTODY TO RESOLVE THE CASE. WE TRUSTED THE BATON ROUGE SHERIFF'S OFFICE WHO CONFIRMED JONATHAN WAS RECEIVING THE CARE HE NEEDED IN DETENTION. ON FEBRUARY 2ND, 2017, JONATHAN HANGED HIMSELF WITH A BEDSHEET IN HIS CELL. WHEN WE FINALLY SAW HIS LIFELESS BODY, THE FIRST TIME IN TEN WEEKS, HE WAS HANDCUFFED TO AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT BED. IT WAS ONLY THEN WE REALIZED HOW WRONG WE WERE TO PLACE OUR TRUST IN THE SYSTEM, WHICH TOLD US THERE WAS NO FAULT AFTER THEIR OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION OF JONATHAN'S DEATH. IT IS ONLY THROUGH OUR OWN INSISTENCE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT WE HAVE COME TO LEARN HOW HARD JONATHAN TRIED TO RECEIVE HELP. HOW BELITTLED HE WAS. HOW NO ONE BELIEVED HIM HOW SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE SAME JAIL, UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS. EACH TIME I TELL JONATHAN'S STORY, HE FEELS FARTHER AWAY. I WORRY FOR THE DAY WHERE I CAN'T DISTINCTLY REMEMBER HIS VOICE OR HIS -- OR EVEN HIS FACE. I TELL YOU JONATHAN'S STORY FOR EVERY FAMILY WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THE SAME. AND I HOPE IN DOING SO WE CAN IMPROVE OUR BELOVED NATION AND PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING TO

my name is Julie Van Zandt and I proudly second the nomination for Jim Hagedorn for US Congress I'm a delegate for Martin County and this is not only the first candidate that I have volunteered for but also the first time that I have made a public speech as the mother of ten children I know that we must have people like Jim Hagedorn in Congress to protect the future of the next generation I will not sit by idly and continue to watch the erosion of the judeo-christian values that our nation was founded on Jim Hagedorn will protect those values having been married to the same man for 33 years I know a thing or two about commitment I have known Jim for four years rarely have I seen a man with such commitment his dedication to winning this race so that he can serve us inspires me he works tirelessly day after day he stays strong for conservative values and the views of southern Minnesota Jim has already proven to all of us that he is not afraid of hard work Jim started this race when the work was the most difficult while success still seemed far away when no one else wanted to take on a five-term entrenched incumbent in 2016 Jim did and through his determination grit and ceaseless effort he came within 61 votes per county of defeating Tim waltz Jim has already done the most difficult part he readied the field he walked in countless parades attended innumerable events and county fairs shaking hands and meeting people from one end of the district to the other Jim has done the rock picking weed pulling plowing and planted the seeds it is now time my conservatives for us to rally behind Jim match his tireless commitment and working together to reap the harvest thank you

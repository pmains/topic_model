i'm not sure what it's like in washington d.c but perhaps we can find out right now from minnesota congressman tom emmer who joins us on the line congressman how are you today i'm doing well thomas it's uh blue skies and smooth sailing here in washington right is isn't it always smooth sailing in washington i mean isn't there's never a hiccup or a bump in the road is there if you believe that tom i've got a bridge to sell you well uh it's good to talk to you i know we uh exchanged messages the other day about hockey uh did you watch the game the the double a game on uh saturday night and over and over i tried but people should know tom that i you know i got home from my uh work uh and it was uh i can't remember it was thursday or friday but i was doing what you know most uh minnesotans who grow up uh with taki is one of their uh religion religious experiences i had to watch the state high school hockey tournament and as you know i don't usually do this to you but i sat down with my bride and i turned on the game and it was like jackie jackie where's the voice that i expect to hear on the darn games and so i had to uh uh text uh tom houser uh which i never do and just said where are you it's not the same without you there but you ended up working now it just happened to be a game i wasn't working but yeah i was i worked a few a few of the games and it's always fun it's always i know you're a huge hockey fan and you have been uh forever uh but it was just a great tournament and again it is part of the fabric of and do you represent is andover in your district yeah i do i represent andover and maple grove we can see it from the uh from the border of our district that happens to be in dean phillips district but uh the andover huskies you've got to give them a lot of credit tom i mean that hill murray team was loaded and they were really good and andover not only takes out the favorite in the tournament but then comes right back the next night against a very very strong maple grove team and pulls it off it's it's one of those great uh storybook finishes i think everybody who participated in sectional playoffs in the uh state tournament this year as we get back to something more normal tom i think it was uh really a great experience not just for those kids but for all of us that were paying attention yeah and you had the andover girls who also won a state title just uh phenomenal and then the andover boys there number five against uh number three there was so much parody in that tournament it wasn't the number one seed against number two it was number five against number three and number five one and that's what it's all about you like there to be some unpredictability well you do but let's not leave about the class a tournament because i've got to tell you the level of skill and compete at the class a level i rivaled the the double a uh war road in hermantown what a great game that was and uh you know got a lot of those kids who are going to go on and play a few more years whether it's in juniors or at the college level it's going to be fun to watch him advance it's once again a testament to minnesota and i did i did work the class a championship game and you're right uh 20 years ago uh there may have been a difference or 15 years ago between a and double a or more of a pronounced difference not so much now i mean you've got guys from class a that go on to the nhl uh frequently and so it is it is fun to watch well we should probably talk a little bit of politics uh since that's primarily what you and i both do these days let's talk about president zielenski he's going to address congress uh tomorrow uh in kind of the way we do things now virtually uh what's what are you expecting to hear and what role can congress play in this situation in ukraine i i expect president zielinski who by the way may just be our winston churchill of the 21st century the way we see him uh taking a leadership role uh and we this world tom and my humble opinion lacks uh leadership in many of these highest posts uh people who inspire others to uh to want to achieve and do better for themselves and their family uh president zielinski against all odds is doing that with uh the ukrainian people and quite frankly he's rallying people around the world where the uh you know the united states and our western allies have been uh have been a little reluctant to uh to deal with uh the uh the tragedy that is uh vladimir putin but that part aside what i expect to hear uh tomorrow he's going to be critical of the west he's going to talk about uh i expect the tragedy that is occurring in ukraine you know we've got victoria sparts she's a first term member republican member from the state of indiana victoria is uh from ukraine and she stood before our conference uh two weeks ago holding back tears telling us the story about her 95 year old grandmother who still lives in northern ukraine who lived through stalin by the way tom and she was talking about the atrocities she made it very clear they are killing women and children this is indiscriminate these are not this is not a war this is a crime that is being committed in crimea and i think that's uh the message that you're going to hear from president zielinski tomorrow uh he's going to encourage uh people uh to aid the ukrainians and uh you know what can congress do well typically congress doesn't weigh into these things uh the way you've seen in the past couple of weeks but uh letters uh trying to tell the administration where we as a collective congress are at bipartisan letters by the way uh talking about making sure the equipment gets there uh that we do what we can to hold this uh russian aggression in check and to protect the ukrainian people and we should point out that there are 17 000 ukrainians living in the state of minnesota we heard from some of them at the state capitol last week and like you said very tearful talking about friends and relatives in miracle and other places in ukraine that they weren't even able to ascertain whether their friends and relatives were dead or alive right tom you know it's the one phrase that i hear more than any other and i i was traveling the district friday saturday at uh political conventions is how can this be happening in the 21st century you know it is it's uh i think we've become very comfortable where we're at and we've had some challenges over the last year and a half but we forget that you literally are days if not hours away from total disruption of the world balance as we know it and vladimir putin seems to be suffering from some major uh mental health issues he withdrew during the as i understand it with drew during the pandemic he's a germaphobe he was already isolated he isolated himself even more and guess what the actions that he is taking right now seem to be one of a crazed dictator that's bent on destroying anything in his way so it's going to be interesting the administration talks about unifying that's great but i'm going to tell you tom the ukrainians in our leadership here in the house were asking to supply defensive weapons back in october this administration said in october in november in december in january that supplying equipment that the ukrainians could use to defend themselves could be seen as provocative which by the way is the same argument they're making right now is uh this crazed leader in russia is driving his forces across ukraine causing unspeakable uh damage and death uh at some point uh it's not about deploying american soldiers they're not asking for that but it's making sure that president zielinski and these brave ukrainians have the ability to defend themselves against this criminal invasion well we'll all be anxious to see what he has to say uh tomorrow and i know you'll be there you'll hear directly what he has to say and congressman tom remember we want to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to join us this morning on wcco morning news thank you tom enjoy that 60 degree weather absolutely you know we will congressman tom emmer thanks for joining us this is tom houser

hi i'm rodney davis and i'm here to talk about something that affects us all throughout the pandemic a financial crisis has really continued unabated that's the rise in student loan debt according to data compiled by education data.org 43 43.2 million borrowers hold an outstanding student loan balance that now exceeds 1.7 trillion dollars on average the typical borrower holds over 39 000 dollars in student loan debt my bill the bipartisan employer participation and repayment act first enacted in the cares act created a unique public-private partnership that incentivizes employers who offer educational assistance to their employees to now pay down their employees student loans under federal law employers they can make tax-free student loan payments up to 5250 per year for each employee who holds an eligible student loan lowering the payroll tax obligations for both you as an employer and your employees just like what many employers already offer for tuition assistance this provision was extended for five years through the end of 2025 in legislation that passed into law last december according to a recent study from the society for human resource management the percentage of employers offering employer-provided student loan assistance as a benefit did not increase in 2020 from previous years despite the fact that this provision became law now the current number currently sits at around 8 percent the pandemic has been brutal on our economy it's created unprecedented workforce issues and hindered business owners hiring abilities implementing this policy at your company really could make the difference in recruiting new employees and as we've seen it will certainly help with retention as well if your company is able i hope you take advantage of this valuable benefit and help your employees achieve the financial freedom they deserve in the process to participate the irs just requires employers to create a written educational assistance program plan for their employees it's similar to the requirement that's existed for years for the tuition assistance benefit in section 127 of our tax code many of you have already done that if you'd like more information about this benefit or if your company currently offers it to your employees please visit rodneydavis.com forward slash student loan benefit i'd like to hear your story so i can better advocate for you and your employees thank you so much for your time and thank you for exploring this new benefit [Music]

it and joining me now is democratic congresswoman from pennsylvania madeleine dean madeline dean excuse me she was one of the nine impeachment managers appointed in the wake of the january 6th attack congresswoman uh thank you so much for being here i i just want to start with the reaction here at john katko republican negotiated this with democrat benny thompson this agreement was announced with much fanfare and now we have the top republican who was involved on that day in conversations with the then president of the united states saying that he doesn't support it what's your reaction well i was listening to your last reporting and i want to echo the sentiments of the gentleman you were interviewing sunlight is the best disinfectant and that's true for the january 6 events i i'm very puzzled by leader mccarthy's now reversal and opposition to the commission not only does he undermine his own member mr catko who negotiated a bipartisan uh equal five and five members with equal subpoena power commission and it would be independent uh i wonder what mr mccarthy's afraid of is he afraid of subpoenas is he afraid of the truth his opposition is troubling evidence uh that he's putting his self-interest which is strangely tethered to trump interest above country above duty above the truth above his own oath what's your sense of of how this happened because i realize you're on the democratic side but you had a negotiator in the room with congressman catco you had to have been operating under the assumption that he would have had the blessing from his leaders to actually crack this deal here that was then of course announced do you understand how this uh how this sequence of events came to unfold no and of course i don't have the privilege of knowing that except it's it's a repeated pattern with a republican conference mccarthy has said one thing and then within a day or two he reverses himself so this is leadership really struggling with itself to figure out who it is but very very clearly i think mr mccarthy does not want to subject himself or his members to subpoenas i was there on january the 6th i was in the chamber i was escorted out with many other members and members of the journalistic community and staff in a gas mask we were all dangerously close to destruction to mayhem and to death and again and again i will say thank you capitol police for saving so many lives mr mccarthy was there he knows how dangerous january the 6th was he should welcome this commission and if it should find any facts or circumstances that lead down other paths so be it but i don't know what he's afraid of and why he's protecting uh protecting us the american public against the facts after all for us to move on we have to know exactly what happened here you can't just brush this one under the rug because if we do that we are dangerously close to suffering this again i mean i've covered politics for a long time i understand when people have political motivations and why they do things for those reasons i've also covered the hill for a long time though and the one thing that really strikes me about this is congress historically has been protective of itself against presidents sometimes even in fights with the courts they protect their own prerogatives at least historically i mean what does it say to you that the institution now can't even seem to figure out a way to protect itself in the future can't even find a way to hold accountable people who attacked your very office is your very building that politics has gotten to the point where congress can't even function in this most most basic of ways i'm stunned by it it's absolutely against why any one of us came to congress we uphold our precious democracy we're sworn to protect and to serve and to make sure we preserve democracy it is utterly baffling to me and it must be about power an attempt to retain power or to grab power in the future it is also a strange fealty to a failed president and to failed policies it's a cultish behavior that i think is in a downward spiral i do appreciate leaders on the republican side like liz cheney who has no fear about saying the truth i don't know why mr mccarthy is afraid to speak the truth and to say the truth and why he would undermine his own member more importantly our own democracy by saying now he's opposed to the commission remember this was a joint session and it was a joint session with the republican vice president with people chanting hang mike pence does leader mccarthy forget those words the folks who came into the capital that day would have killed any one of us they would not have checked my registration they would have killed any one of us well and i mean to your point i mean i think it's important to underscore here that the former president donald trump is now attacking in statements vice president mike pence former his his vice president when he was in office uh who as you say you know wrote that letter ahead of this joint session and said in a straightforward way look my duty is to certify uh this election um congresswoman what is the if this bipartisan commission plan falls apart if it becomes clear that it's never going to become law are there any alternatives uh to for for democrats to move forward with or ideally democrats and perhaps the the few republicans that have said that this is necessary liz cheney uh john catko among them uh what other alternatives are there to a special commission that could still be possible i i don't know again i guess i go with the idea of sunlight so that if for some reason this legislation does not move forward i hope leadership both on our side of the aisle and on the republican side of the aisle not mr mccarthy obviously he's failing to lead will demand that we have a commission and make sure that we know what happened here all right congresswoman madeline dean i think we just lost her at the very end of that interview there but we really appreciate her time we're now going to bring in mike emily white house correspondent here at nbc news because we are waiting for

foreign [Music] welcome to ladies of another view on Beck I am Mary and today I'm joined with Carmen and Jan and we also have Senator Kramer here in the studio welcome to the show today it's good to be on on women of the Right View I'm just trying out new brands right now when we have Trent Lewis who's always been dude so you're already ladies and a dune so today Senator Kramer is going to talk a little bit about um well the special report that we all just watched um he was also in town for the Lincoln Day dinner last night but then later in the show we're going to visit with District 39 chairman candidate out in the Dickinson area and he's going to tell us why he's running and then for our Lighter Side we have a huge announcement and it's going to be a lot of fun but let's just jump right over to Senator Kramer again welcome to the show we always appreciate it you're always so approachable and you're always so willing to come in and sit with us ladies I can't imagine why somebody turned down this opportunity to be honest with you but I sure enjoyed um I watched several of Laurie's pieces in this in this series what is 1226 or whatever it is but there's a lot to talk about and I I hadn't seen this one it's very good um and I have to admit I share a lot of the frustrations that some of the people at Grand Forks are sharing right now with a city council that was seemed completely disconnected for over a year and now suddenly they're sort of I I don't quite get the positioning of it all um but the important point in all of it is that they finally made the right decision albeit it took them too long and and they seem to need somebody else to make the decision for them which by the way the Air Force really never did the Air Force only wrote a letter saying it poses a significant security risk which is not new news that was like not a new point that was obvious to 5 000 people in Grand Forks and a whole bunch of others including the secretary of the Air Force or the the chief staff the Air Force who in a in a hearing that ice was at in the arm of the armed services committee said I can't I don't want to talk to you about this publicly we need to go into a secure setting if that wasn't the most obvious signal to the leadership of graph works is that we have concerns and then how you somehow read that the cepheus review that get delayed because of a lack of participation information from the applicants that created a rebuttable presumption of guilt that somehow that turns into a green light wow it's really so to me there I think Lori is on to something with this report I had not seen it um and not surprised several constituents and and you know regular people in Grand Forks saw what was obvious to them but took a long time for city leaders to figure out there's a lot of local people that are are kind of looking like Heroes at this point right but you know there's there's some thought out there it's like you know fufeng still has offices at UND and the like and it's like does that go away now will those be vacated how do we find that out sure well that would be a UND question of course you know you could call the president I suppose with the school or depending on or at the University or depending on what school that they're hosting I didn't realize they had they had spot there maybe they maybe it's in the um you know in The Innovation Center I'm not really sure but they should be removed I mean as you know over the last several years I've been on legislation to remove um these Confucius centers from universities throughout the country yeah you guys here's the best news of all of this is that these these Heroes as you call them and they are the the the people that stood up for their for their Community excuse me they really they set the tone for the country they're going to change the way we do this in the country they sure did and you know go ahead um no go ahead I've been in that position more than once and I know it happened last night too so we'll just chat a little bit I've been talking too much lately right he really has he's been busy he was at the Lincoln Day dinner last night and I and Carmen was there as well and it was just an awesome speech that he gave and it was very very patriotic and I I congratulate you for that because it was really um it just hit home how there are those of us that are still very patriotic no matter what's coming at us from all these different angles we just have to still go back to our founding fathers I think it's really important that um but I know Carmen you had taken away some good points last night too just what was your favorite part of his speech all of it no just the whole um you know the quotes from Lincoln because I've had it hanging on my wall for many years um when you know I have gone to my knees because I had nowhere else to go and you know it's so true in my world anyway of of how I'm no I can I can beat this I can do this and pretty soon and that's all that's left you know what's for Lincoln though it was interesting Lincoln was not a Christian yet yeah Lincoln although he was exposed to Faith as a very young boy very Pious mother who who made him commit on her death but that he'd pray every day and read scripture so he became very learned in scripture and became a man of prayer before he knew the Lord and what was so fascinating about Lincoln of course was that between his first inaugural address and second inaugural address his first inaugural address had no reference to God his second one had 14. he quoted scripture a couple of times he prayed he talked about prayer three or four times um so you saw the growth of this man doing the most difficult of times also during this presidency as you know he lost a couple of sons um and he he grieved a lot he was Melancholy but he never lost his Joy or his optimism and ultimately he did become a Christian of course but and didn't you say that second inaugural inaugural speech was like only 700 and 701 words and 14 of them were referring to God yeah that's amazing but charity for all you know with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation's wounds and at that point I said this could be a speech for the Republican party as well as for our country yeah bind up the Nations was that to uh to care for him who shall have borne the battle and it's uh it's a many people and I agree I think it's the most inspired the the most inspired words since the apostles was his second inaugural address yeah that's amazing it really is you know he and so many of our founding fathers they had such excellent points that people are just tearing apart nowadays you know what I'm saying it's just it doesn't we don't even look like we did back then so Mary he he saw that coming remember Lincoln I referenced his speech when he was 28 years old 1844 it's called the lysium speech is on the perpetuation of our political institutions 28 year old lawyer 1844 which means he was like a generation removed from the founders and he recognizing that worried that as the nation drifted further away even leaders from the founding of the country and now my roots go back to the Mayflower at my 10th grade grandfather was was William Bradford who wrote the Mayflower Compact and was the governor of Plymouth Colony for 32 years the further you get from that he makes this point at 28 you guys leaders never want to plow some other Leader's ground we don't like to stand on the shoulders of our predecessors we want to plow our own ground and he he knew this and he warned about this happening at the age of 28 in Springfield Illinois and then of course he became Abraham Lincoln not by accident right right not by accident not by accident you know there's just so many things too um going on up at the Capitol right now some of these rights you know whether it's the transgender or are um just covid all the different things that they're just talking about it doesn't seem like a lot of Republicans are even standing up for it I mean some are some aren't but there's it seems like even the Republican Party itself is splitting up there's the establishment there's the far right and then there's us right in the middle and that's what scares me you know we need to we need to come together I saw something the other day though that came out of legislature on the transgender issue and I don't remember exactly what it was it was an overwhelming vote and I was so I was so pleased by it because I thought getting back to Lincoln Lincoln became a republican he wasn't one he was awake he became a republican became our first Republican president because the Republican party was the only party that took a moral position opposed to slavery not opposed to just expansion of it or post it tinkering around the edges opposed morally to it and and there are certain things there are lines you shouldn't cross and when you do that you'll you'll attract people including God's favor and I I was I was pleased anyway to see the house take a strong position I mean you guys can you imagine we've come to a time when instead of helping children we just add to their confusion and Chaos amen all right so hang on to those thoughts we're gonna have to take a quick break and when we come back we're going to talk a little bit more about the legislation as well as who runs this person we do all right we'll be back right after this there's more on ladies of another view on back [Music] welcome back to ladies of another view on Beck we are with Senator Kramer welcome to the show again it's good to be with you as always and you survived the break survived the coughing spell so we're we're back in business so let's jump back into Grand Forks okay all right so tell me a little bit more um is cypheus really doing what it's supposed to do like like why it's like this should have been done at the beginning of the project why did they wait till the very end of the project why did the citizens have to push for it well cepheus it largely exempts agriculture that that's the first problem it's not completely exempt but it's it doesn't have the prominence that other more what what seem to be more obvious National Security issues Investments it's more of a Commerce thing agriculture you know this you're in the business agriculture is always carved out a special place for itself it's not like other you know free market capitalist sort of you know Commerce that we think about and partly because we've always protected our food supply ironically and so now you have the cyphus process that that where the the sector of Agriculture is only a a part-time or a situational participant we have legislation though to change that to make agriculture a permanent member of the of cypheus I personally believe that agriculture while it represents the most important um critical infrastructure and critical supply chain we have and that's our food and that that for that reason alone should be under safetious but I think we need to go further Mary I I'm actually on legislation there's two pieces of legislation that I'm on this year one that does that strengthens ago cultures part of sypheus and then there's another one that that does that and then some but that also carves out exempts for countries from even purchasing not just farm land but agricultural investment in the United States and that is China Russia North Korea and Iran because if we can't protect in times like these and especially having been through now a pandemic where critical Supply chains have been their vulnerabilities have been exposed food being one of them as well as Pharmaceuticals energy critical minerals all things that we've we asked to not just other countries but to adversaries but if I may say there's a lot of companies out there that are coming over and they might be from Switzerland or another European country until you look at who's investing in them they could be a chinese-owned company with a European front that comes into our our country that's right and again this is why cyphus needs to be strengthened cities is still relatively new and it's as you know it's a committee made up of agent he's not just not just one agency it's led by treasury but it's made up of about 15 agencies it needs to have more teeth for sure so on our program we always try to leave all of our viewers with some kind of actionable item and you know like the the people up in Grand Forks they dug and they dug until they found the answers do you know of any way that people can kind of take a look at what ownership is sure that type of thing from the beginning so that's a great point so the appropriate due diligence would identify ownership but if there's a if there's multiple layers to the front it could be very difficult for average people which is why we need to strengthen ciphius which is why um why you need to have uh the secretary of agriculture on the safest board from the beginning and you just need I think it needs to be mandatory that all of that's done prior to an investment made and so I think the City of Grand Forks is right to con to to when they say in the early going we just we don't have the the expertise to know these things but then you don't make an affirmative decision until you get that expertise and that's on them I mean you cannot shed that responsibility and the last thing you want is a federal government making your decisions for you right right right so is that correct excuse me just a quick follow-up so is that correct am I understanding correctly that the egg there's no Ag Department representation only situational okay and they were brought into this one okay but remember that after the first 45 days that first segment of review cypheus had to ask for more information because they weren't forthcoming with the information that alone how us remember the Grand Fork City Council conclude from that that somehow that's the green light yeah when that happens what kicks in something that's contrary to how we do justice in the United States usually it's a it's a rebuttable presumption that means a presumption of guilt what are they hiding from us right and that's what ultimately then they LED them to a non-jurisdictional point which was not a green light it was just the opposite and yet they tried to read it the other way because they were waiting for somebody to make the other decision for them sure well isn't is there something in what you're discussing and looking at at your level that would tie you know because I kept hearing cypheus in hearings passing you know they're passing the ball back over to dni the Department of National Security or whatever intelligence intelligence yes and you know well dni is the one that takes care of all that and then they we feed them then they feed us back and tell us what to do that's kind of what they were saying so is something being addressed on that level so interestingly bringing that bring dni up because you know the the National Intelligence the department of the Director of National Intelligence oversees the intelligence community and that includes the CIA that includes defense intelligence there's a lot of too many really intelligence agencies the intelligence agencies do not share nicely in the sandbox sure they have silos I mean the Spy balloon the intelligence Community knew about that program they watched they knew when that spy balloon launched who didn't know was the military until it gets to become getting closer and becomes a threat they should have known that long ago and by the way they should share that data like these previous ones from previous years that we now know about in retrospect looking back at what we know now know dni has known that for for years they just don't share that data so we have mechanisms in place but now it's the it's the way it's enforced it's the way it's executed by the agencies and um what good is information if you don't share it and then you get to the bigger problem and that is sharing it with the American public the reason there's so little trust and this is what I talked about last night about Lincoln Lincoln wandered around Abraham Lincoln used to go to the offices of his cabinet secretary he didn't call them to his office he had open Office hours in the White House anybody on the street could come and talk to them we've gotten to the point where we only let people know when we think there that they should know and even then we're not so sure right right and so that leaves too much the imagination and uh we've got a lot of work to do in in the executive branch in particular on how well we inform the public of the threats and frankly the Securities that right they should have come because if they don't know they're going to assume the worst right right now we only have about a minute left so that hardly ever happens to me and so I guess one of the things you know China has always had this belt and Road initiative they've been working it's a hundred year plan and they're about 50 years into it they are they are they own a large portion of the United States of America how did that happen and how can we stop it but Belton Road I don't know they own a lot of land in the United States it's as a percentage it's you know less than a percent but any is too much right their belt and Road initiative is designed to buy influence wherever the United States vacates in parts of the world and this is an important discussion for conservatives because we we tend to be well America first which for some becomes America only and you know we can save a lot of money helping developing nations that remain loyal to us and maintain some form of legitimate government whereas China comes in no strings attached and just buys their favor it's called Soft power and we we we need to have a family discussion about how to use it more effectively all right so we're going to have to invite you back on to finish up with some of that and if you have a snow day tomorrow yes so we can maybe get you in to be honest all right we're gonna have to say goodbye for now but we do thank you for spending your afternoon with us it's my pleasure always thank you all right and we'll be right back after this with more on ladies of another view on back

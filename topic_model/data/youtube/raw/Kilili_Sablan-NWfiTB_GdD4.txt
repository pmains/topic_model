what purpose does the gentleman from the Northern Marianas seek recognition mr. Chairman I have amendment Sablan amendment number 55 at the desk berkel report amendment offered by mr. Sablan of the Northern Mariana Islands page 36 line 8 after the dollar amount insert reduced by five million dollars page 38 96 after each of the first and second dollar amount insert increased by 5 million dollars pursuant to House Resolution 333 the gentleman from the Northern Marianas and a member opposed each will control five minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from the Northern Marianas thank you very much mr. chairman I'm mr. chairman my amendment increases funding for territorial assistance initiatives managed by the Interior Department the assistance benefits the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands which I represent but also the United States territories of american samoa guam and the united states virgin islands as well as America's allies the Pacific the Republic of Palau the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands the assistance will continue our commitment to help all of these areas to develop economically and become more self-sufficient but much remains to reach these goals the 2010 census revealed that poverty levels in the islands remain three to five times the national average and median income in the northern mirnas is only 20,000 compared to the 53,000 nationwide the most recent gross domestic product data for the islands reported by the bureau of economic analysis founded in the Virgin Islands real gdp decline 5.4 percent in 2013 and declined by two-point-four percent in American Samoa in contrast the real gdp for the United States excluding the territories increased two-point-two percent in 2013 so we've got a lot of catching up to do and interior has been very responsible in recent years including technical assistance once in a way that really helped our areas economically I'm thinking in particular of the empowering insular communities program which is helping us move from important fields that are costly and take money out of our economies to greater use of locally available energy sources I'm thinking about the insular areas assessment of duties and classrooms initiative just like the preceding amendment and this program found that only thirty-eight percent of insular schools are in acceptable condition and identified specifically those schools where they are safety hazards for students the ABC initiative is systematically upgrading that infrastructure so our children have schools that are conducive to learning and safe developing those human resources it is the surest way to raise our economy we need to give interior the resources to continue and finish that initiative and the additional five believe my amendment provides can be used for this or any of the other territory assistance programs such as the coral reef initiative brown tree snake control or compaq impact two areas negatively affected by the United States immigration policies all of these programs are works in progress we should provide more funding for them and technical assistance funding should remain focused on programs that are that the department has already begun and invested in and I appreciate the past support for the program and even in this challenging fiscal times I urge your support for increased funding for assistance of territories for fiscal year 2016 I thank you mr. chairman and I reserve the balance of my time the gentleman reserves his time what purpose does the gentleman from California secretly like lame time in opposition and I rise it was recognized for five minutes Thank You general I rise in reluctant opposition to the gentleman's amendment I went to gentleman to know that I understand that the territories would benefit greatly from additional funding we funded the assistance to territories at the fy15 enacted level so we level funded that because we know that the money is needed and we know that we have responsibilities in the territories however the offset right now we've we've cut backed the that particular operation considerably so I would oppose that offset but I would be more than happy to work with the gentleman as we move this process along along with the ranking member to to see if we can't get additional funds as we move this process along but I certainly appreciate the gentleman's intent but we would have to reluctantly oppose this amendment at this time the gentleman reserve and I reserve the balance of my time gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands yeah mr. Chairman I I'm very I appreciate very much the Chairman's offer to work with me because I will look him up and work with him and he's examining but let me just make up a small point here what these technical assistance monuments means to us and these states have access to and are eligible for what tens of thousands of federal programs that help States and do one thing or another from social to educational to infrastructure projects for the territories just only 700 some programs where the territories are eligible so there's that huge difference and so this small part of technical assistance money is our is a program that provides grants to help the territories pick itself up you know wipe off the dust and everything and it it's just more money it's a small way five million goes a long way in seven whether it's it's fixing the schools that that are the Army Corps has already identified this I understand 1500 school be school buildings are and only thirty-eight percent of that is is sixty-two percent of that are not safe and only 38 / safe percent are declared safe so is it we just like we do for the Bureau of Indian education we're also asking that we increase this money and I'm so I will also work with the chair mr. chairman and I I you back my time gentleman yields back his time gentleman from California I yield back and I oppose the amendment gentleman yields back his time questions on the amendment offered by the gentleman from the north marianas those in favor say aye those opposed no opinion of the chair the noes have it the amendment the gentleman from the Northern Marianas mr.

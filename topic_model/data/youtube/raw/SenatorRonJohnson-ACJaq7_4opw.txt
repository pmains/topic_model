let's turn now to the chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee Republican Senator Ron Johnson senator I want to start with Sarah Huckabee Sanders reading the statement from President Trump this week explaining why he was revoking the security clearance of John Brennan and reviewing the clearances of nine others here she is as the head of the executive branch and commander-in-chief I have a unique constitutional responsibility to protect the nation's classified information including by controlling access to it question sir how does the president's action protect the nation's secrets what evidence is there that any of these ten people have misused classified information well good morning Chris and I'm not sure there is evidence that anybody's have misused it but I do believe that former CIA director John Brennan abused his privilege when you're an ex-cia director and you're going on all the cable news shows and acting as partisan as he is in accusing the president of treasonous behavior high crimes and misdemeanors well last time I checked treason was punishable by death you've just crossed the line and you know that there's a difference between ell being eligible for first even classified information and gaining access to it let's face it nobody was going to be consulting with John Brennan he didn't need access to any classified information at during this administration so I have no problem that the president pulled his is clearance but as I just discussed with Admiral Mullen we're not just talking about John Brennan there are nine other people who were on the list that Sarah Huckabee Sanders read in the White House briefing room ten people at all including Brennan and the one thing they all have in common is to varying degrees they all have been critics of this president here's what Senator Mark Warner the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee had to say about this these people were being singled out to have either differences revoked or in the process of being revoked to me smacks of next Sounion type practices of trying to silence anyone who's willing to criticize this president and he compared it as admiral mullen did to an enemies list if you want to clean this up why not reform it and take away all the security clearances of all former officials why go after your political critics well first of all I don't want to see this become routine I don't want to see be politicized and the reason you don't want to pull security clearances exactly what Admiral Mullen was talking about is be able to you know provide access to those individuals that you want to consult with so the best way handling this is if you don't have confidence in former CIA officials or other government officials then you're not going to be consulting with just don't gain them access you know you gain access when you have a need to know if you're not going to be consulting you just don't have the need to know so again I don't want this becoming your routine but again John Brennan really did cross the line he's one of the leaders of the resistance movement I understand why President Trump is pretty frustrated I've never seen him I in my lifetime a president not given any chance no honeymoon you know massive protests of the weekend after the inauguration so I understand president Trump's frustration but again security clearance is really split between eligibility and access and the best way to handle all this if you don't have confidence people just don't give him access to the classified information well I was going to say but that doesn't mean that they would lose their security clearance just because you have a security clearance doesn't mean you get access to the interaction I and I want to follow up specifically on that you say you don't want it to be routine there's a report in The Washington Post this weekend that President Trump wants to and in fact the White House has already drawn up documents to revoke the security clearances of some of those nine other people on the list and is in fact being advised to do so at specific times when there's bad negative news coming out and to try to disrupt the news cycle if he goes after some of those other nine people on the list are you gonna support them are you going to oppose that no I don't want to see implies this listen when you fire people form agencies their clearances are yanked but again when people retire honorably I think let them keep their securities clearances in place and if you don't want to consult them just don't give them access to classified material but that's the best way handling it just don't give them access to the material I just want to put up one more thing here and that is the backlash which really spread through the intelligence community and a lot of very senior officials let's let's start here more than a dozen senior intelligence wrote this it has nothing to do with who should and should not hold security clearances and everything to do with an attempt to stifle free speech some 60 former CIA officers wrote this the country will be weakened if there is a political litmus test applied before seasoned experts are allowed to share their views and retired Admiral William McRaven who led the special operations command that killed bin Laden wrote this I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well so I can add my name to the list of men and women who has spoken up against your presidency I'm sure senator do you agree an awful lot of people on this oh they go back to the Reagan administration in the case of bill Webster they bleed red white and blue absolutely these are honorable Americans I don't agree that we're straight that the President Trump is stifling free speech I don't want to see an enemies list and again I'll just repeat the best wave Hanley's that any administration if you don't want to consult with somebody don't you don't necessarily have to answer your security clearance just don't gain give them access to the classified material it's pretty simple senator Johnson thank you thanks for joining us today always good to talk with you sir have a great day

Thank You chairman Nelson and thank you Chairman Bernanke I want to ask you a little bit more about the shocks to the economy that you have been discussing you talked about the pace of the recovery being slow and particularly for the millions of people who are hurting unemployed underemployed and that all of this really comes together as part of a sluggish expansion that's left the economy vulnerable to shocks so I can see plenty of shocks the payroll tax debate bogging down into a quagmire and talking about two months or another short term effort we mentioned Europe as another one mention the question of sequestration and you know to me that alone puts a very negative spectacle you know out because it would mean that in a lame duck session of the 2012 you know Congress you'd see again the same sort of flailing that you did after 2010 so my first question to you on the shock issue is doesn't it serve to shock our economic system just to have all this delay and week after week bickering and inability to get decisions on us payroll taxes or others in isn't that in and of itself a shock to the system in terms of what it does to business confidence and predictability and uncertainty well policy uncertainty is certainly one of the things that businesses complain about makes it harder to plan you know we face the same issue as regulators with regulatory uncertainty and obviously the extent that greater clarity can be provided it would be helpful to the economy and it and it is it fair to describe that as yet another shock to the system because to me everything I've been trying to do am asked you about tax reform here in a minute has been to try to figure out how to force action early because when you don't what's your most likely at a time when you have the sluggish expansion to see these shocks and and a reduction and confidence and predictability and like so is it fair to say that delay in this kind of climate when it comes to getting the payroll tax issue worked out and others that that in and of itself is a shock to the system well I would cite the example of the debt ceiling debate last summer which was clearly a shock and if very probably affected consumer confidence and financial markets more generally loss of confidence that agreement will be reached or uncertainty about what agreement will be reached is a negative 44 confidence let me ask you about the question I mean to me that the antidote to economic shocks are the cushions the kinds of cushions that start us on the road to predictable more certain kinds of opportunities to promote economic growth and tax reform strikes me to be right up at the top of the list and as you know supercommittee we have senator Portman here has done very good work on this get it in the super committee a lot of that work has been done now I mean there are tough tough political calls to be made of course to address tax reform but the principles are pretty clear much of what was done in 1986 clean out a lot of the junk the special interest breaks to hold down rates and keep progressivity wouldn't long-term predictable tax reform be the kind of cushion that would help address the shocks that you're concerned about for the economy predictability is good and also a good tax code itself is promotes promotes growth I think most economists agree that a simpler fairer broader base tax code would be constructive for growth yes and and on the converse of it all wouldn't piecemeal changes where again we go through another round of temporary credits temporary extensions modifications to this provision that that provision wouldn't that contribute to the uncertainty and the lack of predictability that would make it hard for us to grow well senator as you fully appreciate politics is complicated and sometimes not everything is feasible and from a political point of view but from an economic point of view obviously more comprehensive and clean the tax reforms or spending reforms can be the more likely they'll be a good efficient from an economic point of view and the more likely they'll reduce uncertainty I think your points are points are well taken mr. chairman my my concern is absent the kind of comprehensive reform that I think would be a strong a cushion to the shocks that you're talking about I just hope that the country will see how important it is to steer away from yet more piecemeal kinds of changes that make this broken tax system even more dysfunctional and don't give businesses and consumers the predictability they need to generate the growth that you are talking about famous journal

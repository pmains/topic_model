wars were fought movements were launched and constitutional amendments were passed to give every american of every race and gender full citizenship and the right to vote but last month the supreme court released a shadow docket ruling reinstated louisiana's gop drawn unrepresentative congressional maps this sends louisiana back to a tarnished history of diminishing the votes and voices of african americans it's shameful that the court review refused maps that fairly represent the population of louisiana we need maps that follow the simple math and give black louisianians their rightful representation per current population the supreme court is out of control in so many ways but this and other most recent rulings make it clear that this supreme court will stop at nothing to silence the voices of black and brown americans this ruling shows that many of these justices are committed not to the constitution but to the far-right political agenda that includes further attacking of the voting rights act together we must fight against the age-old pattern of silencing black voters while the forces of injustice may have won the battle we will win the war i yield back

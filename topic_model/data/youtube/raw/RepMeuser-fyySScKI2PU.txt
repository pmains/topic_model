woman i thank our ranking member very much lukemi for bringing us all together very interesting subject um thank you for uh for all being here so um i want to just talk a little bit initially about the general business concerns that your industry has and you as proprietors and entrepreneurs and and uh stakeholders you know obviously education uh to to create your your your best workers your staff your talent education these days is unbelievably high both both very expensive both public and private so the skills development it must be a challenge taxes certainly in new york and other cities are crazy um and the idea of increased increased tax on small businesses doesn't in my view help at all um keeping your employees happy healthy uh but as well safe you know because i want to want to ask about that a little bit how public safety uh maybe uh where that weighs in here access to capital very important your cash flow you've all been all been talking about that um technology i made a note of but that's something a little bit different capital investment it was mentioned about the ventilators just came up briefly um what sort of additional capital investments were made to handle covid and and um just matters moving forward i think people are just generally more probably more more health conscious um you know and uh your your product of course uh creating that and your customers uh now i understand see you folks um were shut down or or broadway i'm i'm relating this somewhat to broadway i can't speak for branson shut down for about 18 months i believe um now japan was shut down for six months uk was shut down for 12. and yet even with with that build up uh your level of customer or um you're getting about 60 uh 60 66 of capacity now so and and and japan was very big on the whole ventilator uh plan um uk to an extent they were trying to catch up afterwards i'm not so sure what was being done uh on on broadway and branson and la and other places but you know the thing is this i mean look we probably everybody on here has seen the phantom seen hamilton seen you know wicked jersey boys and loved the theater so we're very much advocates and proponents of doing what it takes to help bring this extremely important industry back i mean i have a daughter that lives and lives in manhattan and and all that's very important so the um the thing is i want to ask what would you like to see what besides additional ppp and or even if that's necessary or the the shutter venue uh program what would you do differently i mean monday morning quarterback is easy what would you do what are we gonna do what is your plan moving forward and what where can we be of assistance because it's also notable that for instance the nhl indoor larger arena understand but they they've had a record year and yet you know our entertainment industry uh is struggling big time so i'll ask uh miss presley i know you're brent branson and mr elrod i'd like to ask you what what what do we what have we learned and what should we do moving forward that would be favorable to to you all and to your business well thank you congressman i appreciate the question it's a difficult choice there's no way around that i think consumer confidence is really where we're focused as an association with neva as we've talked about my business is uh here where we are looking out for our guests and our our customers and our employees we're encouraging mass and we're encouraging vaccination but that is um where we are here in missouri uh for other venues across the nation there are multiple multiple um rather different um views of this and of course going forward with covet it's very hard to know and mr president i'm sorry i i probably had too long of an opening mr elrod can you speak upon new york yeah thank you very much i think the short answer is wouldn't it be great to have a secretary of arts and culture you know when we have agriculture and it is in trouble there is a secretary of agriculture to say okay this is what needs to be done let's take a deep dive analysis if we had a secretary of the create a creative economy or arts and culture somebody at the executive level on the domestic policy council who could say all right look at this 919 billion dollar industry in this 5.2 million dollar uh 5.2 million person workforce look at the jeopardy they're in let's develop together the guidance of what to do right off the top of my head obviously continuing a robust unemployment uh thing for for the nation's arts workers would be familiar thank you i'm running out of time i will make that recommendation to our governor of pennsylvania and i do believe in the film tax credit so and your industry so thank you very much

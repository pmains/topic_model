and he said the reason why we need NAFTA and other trade agreements is not so to allow other countries to sell their stuff to us but to make sure that our businesses have the opportunity to sell to them and he they put that nafta and note that the context and was it everything we hoped it would be no I like to say if it isn't perfect make it better it wasn't perfect and we need to make it better when our friend Robert light Heiser was nominated to be the trade rep he came to see all of us and this is going through the nominating process and I suggested to him but he reached out to Michael Froman trade rep during the Clinton administration I said Michael had been involved in negotiating something called trans-pacific partnership they had already negotiated a pieces of that trade agreement with Canada and Mexico twelve nations in all 40% of the world's trade and I said to Alice Dwight Heiser I said before you go reinventing the wheel find out what was negotiated in the last administration I heard you had put Michael Froman on his speed dial and as we went forward and to to his credit they have communicate a lot in the last couple of years I think it's been good for for those negotiations I wish we'd has not walked away I wish the last administration had this administration hadn't pulled us out a TPP I think that the idea that we were leading a 12 nation group for trading we were the leader 40% of the world's trade China on the outside looking in and why we walked away from that agreement I'm not sure but we did and now we have us mc8 before us and is it better than than NAFTA you you bet it is and we're we want to commend those who worked hard to make it better especially want to commend the trade rep or trade rep / does work hard I want to commend all of our colleagues sheridan and our ranking member ron wyden and others Democrats and Republicans who worked hard I want to thank especially Ben Cardin is not here yet shell is not here yet but they work with with me and others on the environmental provisions to make sure that they are enforceable not just words on a piece of paper but they are enforceable I i understanding the house in the house that with whom we worked on these a number of these provisions the house passed this bill by 3385 to 41 bipartisan support and I think this measure deserves that same kind of bipartisan support here thank you thank you senator

mission texas as gop officials held a press conference on the border crisis representative steve scalise called on the biden administration to address the policies which created the crisis at the southern border and they also asked for president biden to visit the border and have some compassion for those risking their lives to reach the country they finished by thanking those men and women that keep our borders safe but also warned the situation could get worse we're going to move on down with more today's top headlines as the border crisis is growing as we mentioned there in that pressure and scalise is also sharing the real experience at the southern border and he shared a video from that visit that we also heard him speak about in that presser and you can actually see that video here where an estimated 100 unaccompanied miners freely crossed into the u.s and you can see him there sharing that video and scalise also said the procession was nonstop as migrants were ushered from mexico straight to a customs and border protection processing facility probably over 100 people right here just in the last hour that are waiting now to go off to a processing facility and they're coming into america because joe biden has created this magnet where he said the borders open and look at what's happening this is out of control and fellow gop lawmakers that we also heard from in that presser that visited the border have shared similar videos as the crisis continues and republican lawmakers are commenting again on this border situation with jim jordan from ohio saying wednesday the surge of illegal immigration is indeed overwhelming cbp officials jordan and those lawmakers that inspected the border earlier this week reported chaos in every corner including dozens of migrant children last month was the busiest month in the history of border patrol since they've been keeping records we saw one pod that is supposed to have 33 kids in this in this this confined space area and they had 527 so that to me is overwhelming that's chaos that is that's what our good border patrol agents are having to deal with some reports claim federal authorities are using a large play pen with mats on the floor as betting alternatives this comes as the dhs reported a record surge of migrant children crossing here's more federal authorities are working to crack down on the surge of illegal immigrants at the u.s mexico border after recording the largest monthly number of unaccompanied children trying to come into the country illegally on thursday the department of homeland security said there had been almost 19 thousand apprehensions of migrant children in march which marks an increase of 71 percent from february those children were among the more than 172 000 migrants that were encountered along the southern border last month five times more than in march of 2020 and the highest number since 2006. immigration data obtained by the washington post says it is costing the department of health and human services over 60 million dollars per week to house a surge of unaccompanied minors that amounts to about 290 dollars of taxpayer money a day on each migrant child according to mike howell from the heritage foundation the biden border crisis is growing out of control as the white house continues to ease policies on immigration well it's it's obviously terrible it's tragic the numbers represent a massive crisis that is human in nature um and so it's you know with great sadness but unfortunately not with any surprise howell says the crisis should not come as a surprise to americans after the biden administration abruptly halted progress on president trump's border wall and rolled back his strong immigration policies all of our scholars of the heritage foundation knew that if you stopped building the wall shut down ice uh set the green lights south of the border that we are open for business in terms of illegal immigration uh remove a host of other you know numerous uh immigration enforcement and border security measures there's going to be a mass crisis and so i'm not surprised when we see the record-setting numbers today not not in the least despite the new statistics neither joe biden nor kamala harris have taken the time to visit the border or at the very least acknowledge it is a crisis the governor of iowa is rejecting a federal request to help bail out the biden administration amid the crisis during an interview on thursday kim reynolds said that she declined a request by the hhs to house around 300 undocumented immigrant children reynolds said that she needs to protect the health and safety of residents noting that iowa doesn't have proper facilities to house those minors criticizing the white house for the lack of response at the border saying the crisis is the president's problem we will not do that we don't have the facilities we are not set up to do that this is not our prior this is not our problem this is the president's problem he's the one that's opened the borders he needs to be responsible for this and he needs to stop it so at this point no and jeff we have i mean we have kids that we're having trouble placing right now that are iowa children that need those fosters after home

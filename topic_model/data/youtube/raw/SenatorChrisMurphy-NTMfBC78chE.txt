my name is Michele Mullins and I am the president and CEO of Charter Oak health center I am pleased to be joined this morning by United States senators richard blumenthal and chris murphy along with the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health for the state of Connecticut commissioner Coleman Mitchell this morning we are here to highlight the importance of flu shots as well as our open enrollment period which ends on December 15th Charter Oak is a federally qualified health center we serve patients regardless of their ability to pay we are open 7 days a week and available to administer flu vaccinations please come down get your flu shot is very important especially this season in addition to that we have case managers on site who are available to assist with open enrollment and without further ado I'll turn it over to Senator thank you thank you so much for having us today I'm always proud to be at this great Health Center which serves so many people so well and thanks to my colleague senator Murphy and the Commissioner for being here today and all of your staff there were yesterday announced two deaths two deaths from the flu is two too many but it's only the beginning there have been already 47 hospitalizations last year there were 88 deaths and this year promises to be another severe season but make no mistake if you get the flu it's a severe flu season and flu is preventable needless for you to suffer through it missing work potentially infecting family and others so if you get the shot you will avoid the flu it's really pretty simple it takes a few minutes and it is costless if you have insurance there is no excuse for anyone to avoid getting a flu shot and if you get the flu it will be the most severe season ever for you regardless of the overall statistics and that is why we are here today to urge everyone to come to clinics pharmacies wherever flu shots are offered and they are offered all around the state and they are free as long as you have insurance now the administration is doing everything possible to sabotage and destroy our health insurance system the Affordable Care Act right now in the courts it is seeking to undercut and eviscerate it it's undermining advertising during the current open enrollment season it is taking other steps that would sabotage the ACA in Connecticut we are better protected for example and cutbacks on protection for people suffering from pre-existing condition but still we will feel the effects the effects may be devastating to Connecticut if the administration succeeds in its effort to repeal and destroy the ACA so we're calling on the administration to stop these efforts we're suggesting to people you should get a flu shot because it is covered by insurance it can avoid needless costs pain suffering loss of work and I am also hopeful that this Congress will again appropriate money for research to do a universal flu vaccine a bill that I am advocating it's called the flu vaccine Act would provide a billion dollars over ten years for research into a universal flu vaccine shot that would cover all strains and kinds of fluids you know every year the flu vaccine has to be in effect reinvented based on predictions about what the specific types of flu will be rampant that year and this kind of research would help develop a vaccine that is applicable to all strains of the flu I'm hopeful that we will pass again leged legislation appropriations as we did in 2018 100 million dollars in 2019 one hundred and forty million dollars next year I hope we will pass another hundred million dollars but the 1 billion over 10 years if it's authorized would provide a steady stream of funding and with that let me turn it over to Senator Murphy great thank you very much senator Blumenthal thank you to our friends at Charter Oak for having us here today it's wonderful to be back at a health center that is serving so many families here in Hartford and in the surrounding areas amongst our to do list for the final few months of the legislative session is to extend the funding for health centers all across the country that allow for these doors to be kept open the lion's share of funding that keeps community health centers in business is federal dollars those federal dollars expire in November and if we don't pass that legislation then they're going to be consumers here who aren't going to be able to get access to care for the flu or for whatever medical emergency they are coming here to get service for senator Blumenthal is right two deaths are too many we've already had about a hundred people in Connecticut who have been hospitalized for flu symptoms we expect once again this will be a difficult flu season there are two things you can do to protect yourself from the flu you can get the shot and you can make sure you have health insurance that shot is most important right now but if you end up coming down with a version of influenza then you need to be able to get healthcare and the only way to get healthcare without a bankrupting you is to have insurance open enrollment it closes down December 15th and if you don't have insurance through the exchange by December 15th then even if you get diagnosed with the flu you can't go and sign up after December 15th so it's imperative that people go to access health CT and shop online for a plan before December 15 that will provide them health insurance for the season getting the shot is important but getting insurance and making sure that you and your family are covered before the middle of December is incredibly important as well plans are affordable in Connecticut the majority of people who go on to the website qualify for subsidies and the average subsidy in Connecticut is about $500 per month so people can find affordable health care by and large if they're going to shop for health care on the Connecticut exchange the premium increases have been small this year so you're not gonna see a big jump in this year's premiums from last year's premiums on these change that's a real benefit to Connecticut consumers as well but as senator Blumenthal mentioned the Trump administration for the last 2 and 1/2 years has been engaged in an effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act many people in Connecticut don't think that the Affordable Care Act still provides them options for insurance that's affordable because of the attacks that Donald Trump has launched and he has launched devastating attacks he's pulled money for marketing he's pulled money for navigators he's shut down payments to insurance company he's launched a lawsuit in court to try to overturn the entirety of the Act but the affordable care act survives it's still there despite the way that the president talks about Obamacare on TV if you go to access health CT today you will find health care available to you and healthcare that for most people is very very affordable so those are our two messages here today obviously our job is to fight hard against the president's sabotage campaign in Washington our job is to stick up for our great health centers to make sure that they have the funding that they need but your job as citizens of Connecticut as parents as Grandparents is to make sure that your family gets a flu shot by as soon as possible and to make sure that your family has health insurance we're really glad to be joined here today by somebody who knows a lot about the provision of health care and health insurance and that is our great Commissioner of the Department of Public Health Commissioner Coleman Mitchell well good morning everyone as your Commissioner of the Department of Public Health this message is for every Connecticut resident get your flu shots I did have something to say in terms of Statistics and the data but our illustrious senators took that from me and so I think more than anything is to really set the example and the example that I want to set is that I am getting my flu shot as the Commissioner of the Department of Public Health today at a federally qualified health center Charter Oak my words are going right into action and that's really all that I have to say for our Connecticut residents get your flu shot it's imperative thank you we're going to do it side by side yes we are hope I don't we happy to take to take questions I had a question and that is a lot of people want more information you know when we hear about those deaths people we don't know did they get a flu shot what strain of the flu so those are all things that I new people are concerned about when they hear about these deaths so is there any way to have more transparency when it comes to that kind of information I can only add to the fact that we have to always protect individuals confidentiality in terms of health care we do have our subject matter expert here if you have more particular questions that we can bring up so we are only allowed to make full book from the state immunization program we're only allowed to release certain information so the only information we can release at this time is that they were residents of Fairfield County and Litchfield County and they order 65 years of age and older right now I understand an undercut on for this it would be beneficial don't you think in some way because people don't know if they have flu shot that's the only information we can release of this well correct me if I'm wrong the flu shot is standard it's not like you shop around for different kinds of flu shots right it's the finish we're gonna get here it's the same as everywhere in the car right I think what she's asking is it whether or not they were immunized or not oh well they're you know I'll give you the layman's version which is no vaccine no preventive action is foolproof and the numbers are very high whether it's 85% or 90% effective right the point is you know the flu can be deadly for people who are seniors for children they are most vulnerable so if you fail to get a flu shot you are potentially taking your life in your hands especially if you're older or younger and whether these individuals got a flu shot or not I think the basic lesson here is you substantially protect yourself and lessen your chance of getting the flu if you get a shot after health plans this year they went up on an average three point six five percent but the part of the reason why they went up is because of the federal health premium tax was assessed this year and it hasn't been assessed in past years are you doing anything - I mean I know the president hasn't put forward any sort of plan yet as far as his proposal are Democrats working on their own well I was a 3% increase is a pretty reasonable increase right and so you know I I I don't know that we should expect that we're gonna do a lot better than two or three percent premium increases in the exchange you know I think it I have not talked about our positions on the health insurance premium tax but there's a there's a suite of revenue generators in the Affordable Care Act that pay for the subsidies that provide health insurance for people that are in need and so there are all sorts of people that want to wipe out all the taxes in the Affordable Care Act but if you do that you will ultimately lose all the revenue that pays for the subsidies so the idea was to spread out revenue collection over all insurers all drug companies all medical device companies and use that revenue to help people in need that had lower incomes that couldn't get insurance without without the subsidies so I will just say I have been skeptical of gutting the revenue in the Affordable Care Act nobody likes to pay a single tax but you need to be able to come up with the money to help people buy to buy insurance and I you know frankly think across the country we've been you know seeing some some very small increases and some decreases in premiums in the exchanges here's what I view as the most important fact today in American health care the costs are rising astronomically the most important goal we should have in health care insurance and health care generally is to bring down the costs or at least prevent the astronomically rising costs of healthcare particularly pharmaceutical drug prices and there are various proposals senator Murphy and I are supporting them to bring down the costs of healthcare but 3% looks good only because the passed increases have been so high and as you know I have fought those increases as Attorney General I went to hearings that resulted in reducing some of those increases 3% or 3.6% looks good because the pass increases have been so high and there is no free lunch if the cost of healthcare continue to rise costs to consumers and to insurers will continue rise as well so the dynamic here what's driving these increases is the cost of healthcare and we need to do more to bring it down down on average 5 percent like in North Carolina but in Connecticut on access health they continue to increase yeah I mean this night every state has different as different dynamics and different companies have a different sort of internal decision making processes when it comes to rate increases listen we have a problem in Connecticut and then we only have two insurers that are offering in the exchange you know part of the reason why dick and I both support adding a Medicare product every single exchange is because one of the things that will drive prices down is having more competition states that have more competition unsurprisingly have more pressure on insurers to lower costs and with only two and I'm very glad that we have two ensures offering in Connecticut and I'm grateful to them for continuing to offer products in the exchange but we want to see more competition and that's part of the reason why you know we're hopeful that after this presidential election we'll get to have a conversation about putting a Medicare product on the Connecticut exchange that will immediately provide a low-cost option for consumers here and we'll put pressure on others to drive costs down proposals some being floated by the presidential candidates or would you be okay with the public so I have my own piece of legislation that is a universal medicare buy-in that would allow for individuals on and off the exchanges to be able to buy Medicare but also to allow businesses to buy Medicare so I would like to see a robust Medicare product to be available to every single American every single business or not just on the exchanges in the past we've talked about just putting on these changes I'd like to see medic the Medicare program open up to everybody and and I've supported similar proposals I've also supported a single-payer system that would in effect be Medicare for all in some form and I think ultimately we're going to have consensus assuming a good outcome in the next presidential election that we will forward with health care reform to provide that option for everyone the question if no one else has anything on that this before but the most common excuse we hear from people who don't get flu shots is that years past they've gone and they've gotten sick on someone a dress huh from the flu shot so you know I am so glad you asked that question and I mean that because that's been an issue for me I stand here today and this is the honest truth I remember getting a flu shot years ago and I got deathly ill and I have the signs and symptom that the clue would but give you everything that was years and years ago and I remember vividly thinking wow this happened hours after I got the flu shot I have talked to many physicians I've talked to many people who have experienced similar reactions and it still remains the fact that the best thing that we can do in terms of Public Health is still get the vaccine there's about the 40% issue of being able to prevent it is the key in terms of Public Health people have said it's been coincidences people have said that that just happened to be at the same time that I got the shot that I was going to be getting the symptoms and having that that still remains out there we need to debunk that right we need to talk about public health and its essence of getting shots and preventing illness there are people here in this Lobby that I've had conversations with right before this press conference who have said that they are not interested in doing i I understand that but as a commissioner for public health in the state of Connecticut it is imperative that we always try to protect the public's health and so I'm always going to be down that road of saying that prevention is the best key and to have a vaccine is the the key to doing that and so I wanted to say as a person who went through that right as the Commissioner I want it to be really proactive and literally say people need to see me get the vaccine today and the vaccine takes how long to be effective three weeks seven to ten days okay let's be clear there's no there's the flu vaccine does not make you say yes there's no evidence that the flu vaccine makes you sick that is a myth if you're sick after getting a flu vaccine it is not because you got the flu vaccine so that is just that's that's not true yeah or to put it a different way there is only upside in getting the flu vaccine it may not be foolproof it may not be a hundred percent effective but it certainly doesn't cause the flu or any other kinds of diseases and it takes a while to be effective so that's why we're urging people to do it now rather than waiting until the height of the flu season listen I um I sit on the health committee we've we have the legislation that would keep the Health Center funding flowing um I I hate to say it but it's a fight we have a lot of Republican colleagues that don't want to reauthorize funding for community health centers we have a president that does not want to put money into community health centers and so this is unfortunately a fight right now Democrats are very strongly in favor of funding community health centers and making sure that these doors remain open to the hundreds of thousands of patients who come through it but we are having trouble convincing our Republican colleagues I think we will get there I think that we will eventually get to a compromise in which we get the funding flowing to health centers but this is not unfortunately a consensus issue in Washington you know as you remember every year it's been kind of Perils of Pauline reaching the precipice almost over it and then at the very last moment the funding comes through mainly because as you see here thousands of people in Connecticut in some cities the majority of people depend on federally financed health centers like this one and that's true across the country so at the point where funding is about to end our Republican colleagues kind of get religion and go along with it but it takes a real fight and so I would predict we'll have another nail-biting precipice nearing fight where we come close to the end but then it's funny I think so you for Charo Kelson tore our funding expires Jane I'm December 31st so that means as the CEO I have to start looking at how many staff on my cousin layoffs around the holidays unfortunately it's a huge factor because if I if I am looking at laying off potentially laying off between 40 to 50 people I have to think about how many patients that will impact because there's still the need for the the community and we won't be able to meet that need anymore miscible flu shot this year Hall effect the visit so we we won't know the effectiveness of the flu shot until probably January CDC does Studies on that and we usually don't know that until January historically historically it's it goes year to year so last year was not a very good match it was about 29% effectiveness so when CDC has that data we'll certainly share that with everyone but usually that information isn't available until January drain each year typically they change at least one strain every year it depends on what the World Health Organization comes out with they look at what typically goes on in the southern hemisphere and what they predicted comes out in the northern hemisphere which is the purpose of the research that were funding so that we have a universal flu vaccine that will apply to all potential strains and we won't have to develop new one every year with possible shortages at the beginning of this flu season there was the specter of possible shorter kids Kayson had so far or being good it's just too early to tell right now it's still way early in the flu season but when we talk about the vaccine and the vaccine effectiveness it's still the vaccine even though it's not a perfect vaccine like the senator I mentioned it's still the best tool that we have and so that's you know we talked about 20 percent effectiveness or 30 or 40 percent effectiveness that's still better than no effectiveness at all and it is going to give us some protection and it will prevent severe illness and it will prevent hospitalizations and it will keep you alive it's pretty much mirroring what we've seen in the past so far southern california and i understand your work if you could share that as well well you know I was we were on the on the floor together we went to the floor seeking unanimous consent to move forward with the bill that's already passed the house for universal background checks and I spoke about that bill and about emergency risk protection or citing Connecticut's experience with both as I was speaking I was passed a note saying shooting in school Santa Clarita California and for a moment it took my breath away because I flashed back to Sandy Hook and Newtown most prominently and other mass shootings that we've seen on schools this one is the seventh just this year on campuses as I said on the floor of the Senate it goes beyond a political responsibility or a legal mandate it's a moral imperative that we stop these shootings and the sin of the United States our Republican colleagues are going to be complicit in these shootings if they fail to act I've continued in conversations with the White House even after impeachment at a staff level my colleague senator Graham of South Carolina and I have a proposal it is just about complete on emergency risk protection orders which trying to couple it with a proposal that Senator Murphy has helped to lead on universal background checks this sensible comprehensive program is perfectly doable more than doable it is absolutely necessary and the good news is we are winning this fight at the grassroots level through all of the groups that have mobilized and become a movement that has political weight even beyond its numbers and it will be an issue in the next election history will haunt our Republican colleagues if they fail to act but even more immediately voters will haunt them in the results of these elections and that's the point among others that we were making on the floor of the Senate but I will tell you as I stood there speaking for a moment took my breath away just to think of another shooting on a campus loved ones searching for their children panic uncertainty grief heartbreaker and we have been through it so many times we have to prevent ourselves from regarding it as the new normal I am you know what we were asking for yesterday was a vote on a universal background checks bill that is supported by ninety percent of the American public and Republicans objected to our request because they said they wanted input into the proposal well they've had years to have input into this proposal Republicans run the United States Senate at any time they could choose to bring this proposal or a proposal of their own making before the Senate to try to save lives and they haven't done it we haven't spent a minute of time debating legislation to reduce gun violence in this republican-controlled Senate and that's an abomination I would just say this is well last night I was at a gathering of Hartford parents mothers United against gun violence and you know they remind me that well these school shootings rightfully get media coverage their shootings going on every single night in neighborhoods not far from here or down the street from Yale New Haven or around the corner from st. Vincent's there's a hundred people every day that drive to die from guns and most of them don't make the national headlines and so well you know our heart goes out santa clarita it does we need to remind people that this is a daily epidemic that largely happens to young african-americans and to poor people and those shootings don't get the headlines but they deserve just as much attention and you know Connecticut's experience is really important and both senator Murphy and I have talked about Connecticut's laws they work they bring down the rates of homicide and suicide and other shootings on our streets every day a hundred every day in this country a lot of them people taking their own lives and these two proposals keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people they prevent dangerous people from buying them and from keeping them and Kinetics experience shows they work but even with the strongest gun violence prevention laws in the country we're still at the mercy of states with the weakest because guns guess what have no respect for state boundaries they cross those boundaries they find their ways into the hands of criminals and punks and gang members and people who suffer from mental illness so you know we have continued this fight and we will continue this fight alright thank you very much thank you well I thought the testimony from George Kent and Bill Taylor was absolutely devastating further confirmation that the president was at the center of this extortion campaign you just are not allowed as the president of the United States to use the power of that office and taxpayer dollars to try to pressure a foreign government to destroy your political opponents you know the difference between a democracy and the tin-pot dictatorship is that in a democracy you're not allowed to try to convince foreign nations with taxpayer dollars as leverage to help you politically and so I thought the testimony was absolutely devastating I was glad that the country got to see these two Patriots I got to know Bill Taylor during my trip to Ukraine in early September I was able to talk to him about Rudy Giuliani's subversion of American foreign policy he was concerned about it when I met with him in Ukraine and I'm glad that he is now chosen to tell the truth about what happened obviously we will wait for this process to play out the house will have a debate over articles of impeachment and if they those articles they will come to the Senate for a trial but I've been pretty clear I think the behavior that the president has engaged in and that over a dozen administration officials and witnesses have testified to is impeachable III would have to wait to see the exact articles of impeachment before I decided my vote but I think this is absolutely devastating testimony you'll hear more of it today and next week and hopefully over time our Republican colleagues will realize that they are Americans first and Republicans second they swore an allegiance through their oath of office to the Constitution not to President Trump and I hope that they figured that out very shortly well I'm gonna speak like a prosecutor or a former state attorney general the key word here is bribery bribery offering a service in return for a thing of value the president United States used our taxpayer dollars military assistance to Ukraine which was fighting for his life a partner of ours in return for a personal benefit a thing of value to him that's bribery and the most damning and devastating evidence is the president's own words we should never lose sight of that July 25th conversation there's a transcript of it an official one where in effect he commits the crime of bribery and all of this very powerful testimony from career non-politician civil servants who by the way have everything to lose and nothing to gain by being there is simply to confirm and corroborate the president's own words and it's part of a pattern all around the world it's his MO offering and using official power for personal gain and that's what he did in that instance bribery is one of two crimes mentioned in the United States Constitution as impeachable the other is treason bribery is specifically set forth in the Constitution as a reason for impeachment so the Republicans are going to argue well it may be wrong but it's not impeachable on the contrary the founders meant for bribery to be impeach bull and we're going to be jurors I will listen to anything the president has to say on his own behalf that's exculpatory but so far we've heard nothing from him that in any way alleviates the responsibility and accountability that ought to be imposed here and we're gonna continue to hear more witnesses these witnesses have been so damning because they are all about the facts in a world that is politicized beyond belief these witnesses are talking facts and they're doing in a very non-political way okay thank you everyone thank you thank you

all right i think we'll go ahead and get started as folks are continuing to log on thank you for for joining us it's a great opportunity right now to have this discussion that i think is is so very important it's it's about opportunity it's about the future it it's about building relationships and partnerships that create a stronger ties geopolitically and but what i like about the trade topic is that it brings things home of opportunities for nebraskans to make or produce a product to to ship to places all around the world and that that spells opportunity so with us today we have the honorable ted mckinney usda under secretary for trade and foreign ag services now this is a position that is very important to us agriculture so secretary mckinney thank you for joining us prior to the under secretary's time at usda he served as director of the indiana department of agriculture under then governor mike pence also joining us is norm krug the founder and ceo of preferred popcorn of chapman nebraska a powerhouse in in nebraska popcorn and and exporting uh just a fantastic and growing operation there outside of grand island finally we have kirk zeller he kirk is the founder of the silicon prairie center of ravenna nebraska located in ravenna and he's a subject matter expert in market development brings an expertise uh on japan as well and the the opportunities that exist and strategies that can be employed as we as we do see i think more and more opportunities with trade i think that the advancements in trade policy over the last couple of years are probably the best kept secret certainly under reported uh when you look at kind of the the um the views three four years ago about what could be done and then what did get done uh tremendous um when you look at usmca and the fact that it was done in a bipartisan fashion and and that wasn't just by chance uh but the fact that the usmca got done uh is a huge testament that yes we can work together in washington yes we we can sort through some some tough issues make no mistake and and to look at where we are currently where we need to go i think now with the pandemic and what i will predict is some return of u.s manufacturing ppe and other products as well supply chains in general i think that we are well poised now with better better trade policy and tax policy incidentally uh that we can see more u.s companies do better moving forward rather than having policies that just kind of chase our producers and our and even companies as a whole um out of our country and so as we do move forward you know i'm glad that we've we've had some advancements in trade with with japan china obviously usmca now we're looking at the uk kenya is another opportunity as we engage kenya as a precursor to hopefully other trade agreements uh around the continent of africa i think trading goods and services can can build not just a better political partnerships but it can increase the standard of living without us sending a check in foreign aid to a a country per se the will will have a an opportunity to help help our own economy theirs as well and oftentimes resources end up in better places when there's increases in in the trade of good goods and services rather than just a check coming from the the federal government so uh we'll uh have each of our panelists here this morning and share a little bit of perspective as as we do move forward and basically trade and the pandemic and in building our our uh communities uh through trade and so with that under secretary would you like to begin uh tell us just kind of give us uh your insight moving forward literally am i coming through okay yes okay very good sounds good well congressman this is a real honor and i mean that i have known of and heard of the famous third district of nebraska for a long time and to meet with many of you i've actually been through it it's been a long time i was back in the private sector then but at one point i wanted to understand what the heck these great big circles looked like from the air and i got to see and kick some dirt and understand how that works the same with some center center pivot irrigation systems and then not to mention a long-time relationship a very strong relationship with uh under secretary ibaba my good friend and colleague and my wife with his wife teresa who is just one of the best of the best so it's just great um i want everybody listening to know that i tried to make a deal with the congressman and he didn't give i wanted to say if i did this would he say something to the nebraska football team to just let the boilermakers have a victory on december 5. and he hung in there tough he didn't give an ounce and so we'll just have to do battle on a level playing field even though he's in west lafayette indiana so he's hanging in there for all of you well listen what i've found works well i'm going to just take a few minutes because i really would rather take questions and try to do that way because it's tailored better to you but let me just do a quick whirlwind around some parts of the world and many of those areas mr congressman you already have mentioned it is not lost upon me that that district is number one in cattle and cavs i think it's it's both for sure in fact a lot of the cow calf operations will send cabs to your part of the world i think the rise in your beef industry i think mr eyeball had a lot to do with that maybe some of you as well has cause for a lot of our cabs that might normally have gone to texas or oklahoma to to stop short and go to nebraska so number one there certainly number one in corn we know that very very well and then not too bad in soybeans and wheat and other crops and so i know this district very well because of the prominence in agriculture so i want you to know that when i get up and this is the way i grew up i grew up on a large farm north of indianapolis indiana by about 45 minutes my twin brother continues to manage the farms we've been in seed corn seed beans a swine finishing operation for about 45 years so i feel like i've been there and done that de-tasseled seed corn mostly through the pioneer brand in fact my brother and i put ourselves through college we had about 300 kids uh out there for about 15 years so i know i know what five a.m mornings are like and 10 p.m evenings are like and and so there's an affinity to what you all do in agriculture and i take that through processing as well i don't want to forget you norm because you know the farmers do a great job producing it but a lot of that gets processed whether it's animal feed or popcorn and then is exported so i'm thrilled to be in this position and and and congressman you're right um we're a humble lot here we're proud that it's you all that are benefiting from the sales and i think we're going to be up we'll set some new records this year in beef pork uh and poultry i think and so very pleased for that and if that's a result of some of the activities that the team and i and all of you have done we'll just let that happen and be be proud of that quick spin around the world china we're very very pleased with phase one so far uh do i think that they'll make and achieve by december 31 the 36.5 billion they committed to probably not but there's reasons for that kovids set in in china it then migrated here containers were all caught up in ports in the asia pacific area but when all that started to get straightened out we saw sales pick up significantly about april 1 april 15 and they've been on a real run particularly for i think the things that you all produce and sell norm i can't say that i know how popcorn has been going but certainly commercial corn sorghum pork my goodness it's been on a terror run and soybeans and the like and uh just looking at the price i saw yesterday i think was a new high if i if i have my record straight so we'll take that and remember they have till december 31 and that's when we count we'll not know until a month after that we always look back in arrears but about february 1 we're going to know exactly what they brought into their ports and thus what was paid for we cannot forget phase one is a two-year program and a lot of the purchases now are for delivery after january 1 after december 31 so i don't mind that there's a head start on sales into the next calendar year so we'll see how it goes but so far so good for at least a lot if not all of the products that are that are produced and processed in your uh very well noted third district they're congressmen i don't know what to project after uh after this year i hope beyond hopes that phase one will continue i hope the purchase commitments will be honored well into and including all of 2021 i can give a ledger sheet that says on the good side we know that china likes and respects the quality the safety and the quantity of our products they need that particularly as they rebuild those herds i'll point out that as they rebuild those swine herds it's no longer four five six eight ten pigs in the backyard in part fed with scraps from the kitchen table no no no no they are going as modern as we have and then some i have seen some six story swine production facilities i saw a 12 story swine production and i think i don't know this but i think they're going to want very high quality soybean meal ddgs and the like and so i hope hope that bodes well my hope that maybe they and we can both say you know what food for livestock poultry and humans should be compartmentalized over here to the side and we'll let the disagreements that we have on so many things exist over here and just let things involving food and sustenance for people sustenance for crops and critters let's just hope that goes on but we'll see we'll see but so far for this calendar year i'll take it i remain hopeful hopeful that we can see some ethanol and maybe some ddgs get going we're running out of time because it's about a six-week boat trip over there but we'll see if we can't get some more a product into china so i'm bullish right now i am not pollyannish and i think you know the difference let me move to the uk uh i do believe that the uk and the us will come up with a good deal it's not done yet the really heavy lifting has yet to occur but a very significant decision was made and announced yesterday of the day before where the parliament did not accept the crazy amendments that would have called for all of our exports notably on beef and pork to have to meet those same fictitious high golder than gold standards that they claim to have i do not doubt in fact i support the fact that they have very high standards what we have continued and repeatedly tried to communicate is we have just as high standards it's a myth that came out of brussels primarily it's a protectionist myth we've invited so many people to come over point in any direction we'll take them to whatever barn we see and we'll let them show we'll show them that our animal welfare standards would rival theirs they're different of course but that doesn't mean they're any less humane or more humane so i think we're going to have a good deal and i just i'm drooling at the possibility of the uk getting out from under the brussels control and being able to speak as their own voice it is significant they're a g7 country for crying out loud as optimistic as i am about the uk i am equally as pessimistic about the eu never mind that they claim proudly to be the largest food and ag market in the world and maybe that's true the self-righteousness exceeds anything that they've seen and i've seen it started when the precautionary principle was introduced 20-25 years ago that led to the no biotech we're concerned about the safety well we proved that long long long ago like maybe 20 25 28 years ago and then came along the change in how they do risk assessment where essentially there can be no residues of any sort nothing and just ask our nutcrop folks mostly the almond teams out of uh california it is just a site to behold we've tried for seven years to add to our market share over there and we're still flat meanwhile theirs continue to grow here so so uh and then now they have the eu green new deal branded as farm to fork where the intent is to ban 50 of the pesticides force a reduction in in fertilizer usage by a third and oh by the way not allow any crops or critters that come into the eu to have used antibiotics and i don't mean for growth promotion i was in industry when we led the charge to get rid of antibiotic use and growth promotion i'm talking about if the critter is coughing you can't even give it an antibiotic and i think that is just draconian so we've drawn a very bright line in the sand a very bright line and said no we're not going to go along with this we're not going to try to accommodate this and i think we are right to do that because what it'll lead to is the maximum residue level will go to zero and anything that might have glyphosate or anything else even in a part per quadrillion can no longer be exported and they're worse they're exporting this philosophy so i'm very very concerned about our friends in europe because it's it's just going off the deep end you mentioned kenya we are very excited about africa not just because we want to go there we've always wanted to but now in a very major way they're wanting us to get there why well a lot of the graft and the corruption at the ports has subsided it's still there but it's significantly less and many of our companies norm i don't know if you had that experience but many wanted to sell there but when they were faced with the decision of keeping their ethics or losing their ethics they said i'll pass i'll just grow my business elsewhere so a lot of that has been resolved not all but a lot of that and furthermore i think they are seeing that china is playing a much larger role there some of that is good you know there's trade going on but the ious that the chinese are imposing on them is a pretty nasty and long tailed barbed wire tail and so they're saying we want to diversify we do not want to cozy up with any one or two countries and they're also complaining a lot about the heavy hand that the eu has been putting on them you will not use this technology you'll not use that one this is how you'll grow your product and they want to try some of the same technologies that we have so we're working on a free trade agreement with kenya the intent is to not stop there now we're not expecting any country to do a cookie cutter approach if they want something different than kenya that's fine we'll talk to them about that we want what they want we want to win win but at the same time i suspect the deal with kenya will be an outstanding model uh that others might look at and and then we can go from there the western hemisphere it's outstanding oh my gosh there is such like-mindedness in the adoptions of technologies it's very exciting venezuela and cuba might be the exceptions and we'd love to see particularly venezuela come around and be a democracy again but that's a longer term play and then finally i'm very very excited about the asia pacific area uh if you're not tracking vietnam philippines indonesia oh my gosh are we selling there not to be sure no four or five of those countries will make up for the size and magnitude of opportunities in china so we do want to keep a harmonious sales in food and ag with china but vietnam has been buying and buying big the philippines has come around buying and buying big we're now working i was just with at lunch the other day with the indonesian ambassador good man he's a purdue boilermaker for his undergrad and he understands what trade both ways not one way not a we win they lose two-way trade can do so we're very excited in fact i've spent more of my 450 000 international air miles in the asia pacific than anywhere else so those are a few and then i have to conclude with usmca i will admit i was one of those saying don't blow it up don't blow it up it's been good for us mexico and canada agriculture and it was but i was being a little selfish it was not necessarily good for the auto and the auto parts industries and so many more and there were things we had to straighten out with both canada and mexico dairy in canada and by the way it looks like they're trying to replicate those nefarious ways of keeping out any and all dairy not fair and we're watching that very carefully so usmca is a better deal it's a better deal i think for everybody because it was agreed to by all and i think it sets us up for another 15 20 years with regular reviews of that so i'll stop there mr congressman and just say that i'm very excited about the future i'm not polyanish trade is not fair and recipic around the world but i am so appreciative for president trump and secretary perdue giving me and others the permission to be tough not unfair not unfair we seek win-win and i mean that i live that but uh but but there was unfair trade and we have straightened or been straightening out a lot of that and that's why i think the prognosis looks good i just hope that no matter who comes out with the victory v in the presidential election that that this kind of thing is sustained because it's fair it's fair and it's working and it's straightening things out so i'm going to stop there and say thank you mr congressman well thank you i appreciate that norm you want to give us your insights sure and and i would want to begin uh also was saying thank you for the opportunity and uh congressman smith has always been a leader in trade since we began our business and i can always count on him to be consistent and helpful when it comes to trade matters and and under secretary mckinney week banter samba i also want to thank you and compliment you on the great job you've done the last time we met personally you were just beginning to work on the usmca agreement and you're optimistic about it and you were heading into that what turned out to be a long negotiation but a very successful one and you've been very consistent you what you just outlined is true as what you said then and uh and you're saying it again now and at that time you knew it was going to be hard uh trade with china and that's been a long hard-fought battle and yet uh you've done a great job so my compliments to you and your team and the administration for doing what you said you were gonna do it's really quite remarkable that i think it was four or five years ago when we last had a chance to have lunch actually together and uh been very consistent and worked very hard for our country for agriculture and so thank you for your efforts and all those air miles i know what those are like and that's pretty exhausting as you bounce around the world and represent ag so we appreciate what uh congressman smith and his team have done and and what uh the federal government has done in order to promote trade uh one of the i echo your comments as you bounce around the world there uh a lot in what you talked about in each country to give the viewers a little background about preferred and why how we got into trade i'd like to say as a result of a brilliant strategy but it was more a result of desperation when we first started about in 1998 and we were just farmers who had a desire to add value to agricultural products and add a marketplace for local farmers at that time and still today we're very good at production and we're the the u.s farmers are among the best uh for sure in the world at a production and so is our goal to add value and so we started out and i'll always remember setting a little tiny office it was not much bigger than it was actually kind of a remodeled chicken house and uh where we started and here comes in over 200 trucks of popcorn of which we thought when we when we raised planted it that it was sold but it it wasn't and we're a small company domestically we had no name recognition and we weren't having great luck at selling our popcorn so we knew that we had to do something beyond nebraska and you know just to get some perspective i always tell the story but it's a pretty good one because we're all familiar with the huskers and the university and so here are these 200 trucks of popcorn coming into our plant and and i'm just originally started out as an investor and and one of the farmers and because the need ended up being one of the salesmen but i called the university in nebraska i thought well maybe i can sell all 200 trucks maybe they'll need it you know they've got all the sports venues and and i had had some contacts there i believed and so we we had a good talk and they were very sympathetic but the whole university of nebraska only uses one truck per year and that was being donated to them so i knew i was in a little trouble i wasn't going to sell my 200 trucks to the university and i knew that we had to think outside of the state in order to to move that much popcorn so we began going to trade shows meeting wonderful people around the globe and so we make our our first sale happen to be to indonesia and again i was quite excited i had a load of popcorn but when you go into the local bank and you say well i finally got things going we made some sales we're going to be shipping indonesia while the local banker is scared to death he's not interested in that kind of a risk or exposure selling popcorn to someone all around the world and you start talking about trade and then a man always be grateful to his name was barry dent and he was involved in the export import bank of america visited our little office and explained that there was a program that was available where you could export and encourage exports and you could get insurance so that you could send popcorn to those other side of the world and they would give you a guarantee that you would be paid if the customer failed but that would be one of my first points uh in general we've had great success in collection and export so don't let that scare you we we export now to over 70 countries around the world and in the last 22 years we've had insurance with the export import bank of america and we've only used them two times in 22 years so in general when you export they know that they have to pay and there's there's good tools to use to ensure a letter of credits documentary collection at site and other tools that do make it safe so don't let that scare you away when we started there were a lot of naysayers and oh you don't want to sell popcorn to someone in japan or indonesia or in the middle east or the many places you get opportunity but there are tools and and the government has stepped in there and done a great job together it gave us a confidence to say to our local banker don't worry that's 90 percent covered because we have export infor bank insurance and to to this day it's still important because american farmers can land grain not only popcorn but as as as mentioned already soybeans and corn and other ag products beef and pork we can produce that as efficiently as anywhere we're proud that we can land popcorn in downtown shanghai for less money than they're able to produce it themselves in china and so that's pretty that's pretty impressive upon american farmers part we can land grain in tokyo japan we can land it in dubai all at a very competitive price if uh we have free trade and i remarked several times if we have a level playing field and that's why ambassador mckinney under secretary mckinney is out there working on that and he's also right in that we also know it's not quite that easy it'd be easy to say let's just remove all tariffs and all trade barriers and american farmers would benefit from that but each country by nature wants to protect their own farmers and so it's a continual negotiation which we've done a very good job in improving i would agree with the eu we'd love to be selling more product there and have immediate opportunities again we can land it in europe for nearly the same price as we can landed all over the united states and because of a very efficient container system that we have because there is some imbalances of trade and they want to get those containers back to those countries and so we actually did a study we can hit the european ports for nearly the same price as we can head and distribute throughout the united states which is amazing but they aren't logical uh they as far as taking a look at things like gmo it was really entertaining to me we had some good european people here in our office but they're uh we've got to do a better job of communicating i believe with them because their understanding of gmo they don't even believe us we can be at a trade show and talk about uh genetic modification and all popcorn not just for fruits but all popcorn in the united states is non-gmo we haven't even created a genetically modified hybrid in the united states and yet when we're a traitor and we say non-gmo they just flat don't even believe us they just think oh it's america your product must be must be poisonous in fact one a group of visitors were visiting a farm and uh to give them a tour and show them american agriculture and they were so concerned about genetic modification that they one person raised raise their hand up and go well when we get to the farm you know could that be gmo and i said well it's possible that's that's uh they're picking seed corn you know we're not sure of the hybrid but it could be genetically modified then we go on to talk a little bit about the tour instructions and that same person raises their hand back and said is it okay if i just stay in the van while you get out so she was so concerned about genetic modification she didn't want to get out of the van as if that was going to be something that attracted her like like the coven and uh so we have a lot of education to do a lot of communication to do to let people know about how safe and good american agriculture is and that's part of the process and that's part of the challenge of what we do and and all the more reason though to trade and and do trade sometimes all people say well do you trade with that country and why would you trade with them what about their um their policies and why would you trade with china for example but my belief and preferred popcorn's belief is we have more impact by trading than we would if we just said we're not messing with you guys we don't agree with your trade with your policies or your human rights policies but yeah i have had those people in my home in central city nebraska and they've been around our table and they've seen our mission statement preferred popcorn's mission statement is that we strive to honor god by producing high quality products and serving our customers with integrity and we have it we have it on the wall and our chinese customers come in and it's really exciting to me uh one of our chinese customers uh who was here and representing uh kafko and and the chinese government chose us that day because of our mission statement so we have an impact on other countries by trading with them and that's our belief and there are great people in in every country uh what's been amazing because i'm the nebraska farm boy chapman nebraska has a population of of uh 295 300 people on a good day if nebraska is playing is probably only about half of that that population so because uh because about half the town goes to the game but it's uh it shows that you can accomplish anything if you if you have a positive mindset then and have the goal and faith and uh so i was a farm boy who hadn't been hardly out of the state much less out of the country and we went to mexico first because that's a great partner so i am really appreciative of the usmca agreement it makes so much sense for us to trade with with mexico and there's a lot of great people there they have their challenges and problems but uh but they don't like those guys either that that most of them are really great wonderful people so and we found that all over i have great friends in japan i have great friends in china canada and it's a really privilege to know people around the globe and in the end it's really about relationships and doing what you say you're going to do they aren't looking for uh high powered sales people that have a big story they're looking for people that will that will do what they say they're going to do and if you're going to ship 10 containers of popcorn and and you're going to ship it with these particular specs and you do that uh it works out very well and and it's not without challenge uh certainly there's challenges of documentation and tariffs and a lot of times there's some non-uh tariff barriers of trade that that you have to work through but collection has not been a big problem people around the world know you're not going to continue to sell them grain if they don't pay you for it and we've had a great luck with that and that's what stops a lot of countries a lot of companies from exporting is the concern over payment and that's certainly a hurdle that can be crossed and and then it's just about after that relationships and and being willing to to travel some but again during this time we've done things virtually as we're doing now and that's a that's effective also so i would encourage the panelists of people that are on to use the tools that are out there from both federal government state government we have a local organization in nebraska called meda that that does a great job so i guess uh i've probably said enough there might be more stories than you want the letter said encourage some stories and that's dangerous for me because i can i can tell stories all day but uh is that kind of what you're looking for adrian i think so yes thank you norm for specific questions like sure sharing your perspective and and your journey in in exporting let's go to kirk zeller kirk thanks for joining us thank you very much thanks for having me so like norm i'm a i'm a farm boy from uh from nebraska a small town north of kearney uh called ravana which uh one of our colleagues on this call knows well um so i think you know for me um ag and trade were really kind of um you know at the at the really to the start of my career i mean i grew up here um in nebraska at a very very different time which uh the top three folks on this call uh uh which which under secretary mckinney and and and norm will will definitely remember when um we'd be you know in the tractor and and in the truck listening to talk radio and it was dominated at that time by the u.s japan trade friction um you know kind of the attitude that it was impossible to sell american products in japan and uh and after uh listening to that uh working on the farm i became very determined to go to japan and prove them all wrong so there's just kind of this undertone that it was just impossible there's nothing we could do about it i'm like i don't accept that i'm gonna go there i'm going to study figure out how to do do business in japan i think i went uh very much with with an attitude of um you know of kind of working to to balance trade um but in the course of going to school there and and studying there um it became really clear to me that it was important touching on something that under secretary mckinney said of really finding kind of the win-win and things um i think you know that's an important you know uh aspect of of conducting trade is is to find some some common ground and win-win and don't go in with an attitude of you know of how you're going to uh you know how you're going to win go in with the kind of a a mindset of how can we find something that's uh that's very much win-win um and then um as my career developed in japan and right at the same time the the eu is coming together and so i kind of set my sights on uh on the eu and learning how to do business in in europe um and had the opportunity to go to europe and work and and do uh do a couple degrees in europe and research for my doctorate on on uh now you know developing the european market and getting into the european market um and i i wanted to kind of echo another something that norm had said and i think you know a lot a lot of people when it comes to trade there's this kind of with some people this kind of attitude of oh you shouldn't go to china you shouldn't do business with china i very much agree with with with what norm said and i think that um you know by engaging with other cultures um you know we have an opportunity to to learn from each other and influence each other in in very positive ways and so i think with you know through these commercial activities there's you know there's ways of of uh having you know having an element of diplomacy in it if you will and as you build relationships with uh you know with folks in in uh in these different countries um so you know now now with covet things have changed quite a lot to be honest um you know after all you know those years of doing stuff overseas when i give advice to people um looking to to go overseas particularly to asia i would always tell them now you can't expect to get things done by sitting in your office you know you got to get on a plane get over there meet people learn about the culture learn about the local environment build the relationships don't expect really to get anything done for two or three trips you know invest that time well with covet it's a little bit hard to give that advice i've kind of had to change you know kind of you know to change the advice a little bit um but i think one of the silver linings of the situation we're faced with now is it levels the playing field a bit you know because if you're a small scrappy company uh you're trying to do business globally you know if you're norm you know it's it's expensive to go and travel to 50 different countries in a year um but right now with covid you know you're kind of on a level playing field with the better resource larger organizations because everybody's doing zoom right now effectively the cost is is nothing to do with zoom meeting and engage with you know potential customers in in other markets and and so um i feel like that's uh you know that's been one silver lining of it um you know for me i had years where i'd you know be in 25 countries in one year and honestly i've kind of enjoyed being on zoom and and uh showing up uh two minutes before a meeting instead of uh having to leave two two days before the meeting um so i think it's it's i think a lot of people probably are a little bit uh disheartened by this and i'm sure have found challenges in it but i think you just kind of have to um you know look at things a little bit uh differently um and uh you know and and and find ways of of uh you know leveraging these kinds of technologies to to really to reach out to potential customers around the world so i'll keep my i'll keep my comments brief uh congressman smith and and happy to you know take any questions sure well thank you very much and as our participants come forward with questions uh just to type that in there and i'll i'll share your question with the panel uh again thank you to our panelists i mean when you consider all the expertise that you guys have this is this is a rockstar panel and i really appreciate your time norm remind me what percentage of your product roughly is exported uh we're at least 50 percent uh that we export in and interestingly um it's been that way since the beginning but it's not like we've built the 50 we started out at 50 because of our situation of being a new company and it started to trend back to domestic a little bit but the covet has made exports just as important today as they were when we first started you can imagine with the shutdown of the cinema industry and just the general all gatherings where popcorn is consumed due to football stadiums and soccer stadiums and it's in general been a incredible challenge to continue to be in business when you take a big sector of your business of your customer base away due to covid uh trade once again has stepped up and there are lots of parts of the world where they consume popcorn at home and they don't only rely on the cinnamon industry to to market popcorn and uh you know happy to say that just recently after you know pretty big cut back throughout the summer we're currently at back to capacity shipping uh containers out around the globe and we're shipping in the countries i always was teasing our group we're shipping places i can barely spell much less money but that's what's uh keeping us going we're we're back at full capacity and we're exporting so once again exports really really important as you look at any situation whether it's a time of prosperity or a time of challenge having that balance having the whole world to sell to as a potential market is has been very beneficial and uh coming in again to help save the day very good kirk what kind of observations have you had in you know you you've obviously worked in a lot of markets around the world um what what would be example of what you've observed from you know i say a mom-and-pop operation um of course norm started out a lot smaller than he is now even with the 200 trucks um but you know they're they're even smaller exporters than that so what what kind of observations have you had and then you know how that has equated to opportunity for growth moving forward well i like to talk sometimes i like to give us an example this popcorn company in nebraska but somehow i feel like somehow i feel like we've covered that one today um you know one of the businesses that we're incubating here is you know is going to be an example so you know we've developed these products for um you know for mobility devices and and we're working towards tracking mobility and and this is a product we're developing right here in nebraska we're about to launch a website to sell them uh here in nebraska one of the things we're going to do is to grow nebraska website as well but the next step is uh one of my interns who here from from unk is going to be going back to japan in a few weeks and working with my business partner in japan to to get that business up and running so within you know months of of launching in the us we'll be launching in you know in japan as well and that's that's a scrappy business that was started and funded by myself and my my business partner and and i think there's other ones like that um in this era where you can sell online i think there's a lot of uh even you know folks with you know etsy type businesses that expect you know a significant portion of their revenue selling to uh to folks overseas uh through the internet i think the internet has really changed that uh that dynamic you know quite a lot um in the past if you were a little company a lot of times you know you'd have to find you know go to a lot of links to find some kind of distribution partner in all these markets around the world but with the internet and the ability to ship you know ship directly you know it's really enabled some of these small you know uh you know family mom and pop you know husband and wife type businesses to to really be able to go global almost almost immediately secretary mckinney what um what do you think you know i've i've been saying a lot lately that although i would not prefer to be in the situation we're in with a pandemic there's a lot we can take away from it moving forward more than a vaccine even what in terms of trade policy do you think we can take away from uh the the pandemic and i mean i i also make the point that you know uh all the ppe being made in china china doesn't even have to act maliciously for that to kind of be a problem during pandemic outside a pandemic not as big of a deal but during a pandemic believing me it's it's very problematic what and not necessarily just on that but what what do you think we can take away from from the pandemic moving forward with with production and exports and trade sure well one of the valuable things about being in the food and ag business is it's it's this you heard me say earlier it's the sustenance of life it better be moving i mean hardly any country very few around the world are self-sufficient and so trade must continue and i think most people agree with that so that's the first thing so that that automatically puts a spotlight on making sure trade goes we were thrilled when kovitz set in no let me repeat that we were not thrilled when covet set in but when it did set in we were thrilled that most of the world learned the lessons of 2008 2009 with the big recession and did not follow some of the hoarding the shutting off the border practices that that was fairly draconian back then some of it occurred a few countries did but by and large people got the message keep the borders open now if that had continued in a draconian format i could have i could believe that some countries that did not close borders would have so without any doubt trade will always include people getting on a plane going to those very large and significant trade shows where as i like to say from my sales days you can be belly to belly with a customer you can show your wares particularly applicable for popcorn our wines and and distilled spirit companies are finding great value and here try this taste what i've got so that's not going to continue or that that is going to continue but by golly we have learned a lot of lessons about the value of the technology we're on now let me give an example we had eight very significant in person get on a plane ag trade missions plan for this year and those those deliver very significantly i mean not just a few million i mean tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars in sales well worth the effort it also gives me a chance as leading those to go in and work one-on-one with government officials to try to break down market you know break in on market access and i'll repeat again two-way i want to help them as much as i hope they're helping uh helping me so there is that but we're going to end the year with four four virtual ag trade missions we're already two down and the test run was pet food sales into china the one difficulty was all the electronic they have a lot of border controls you can only imagine if we think we're tight on security man try doing a virtual but it worked we got it done and they were very very happy and so we're going to ramp that up and that will be a major tool in our toolbox from this point forward because there are some that just get it they got to go there meet the customer and there are others that are less prone to do that and i think where we're going to go is people doing a blend mormon kirk you have your customers you know them they know you trust is established this is a great mechanism to sustain that you don't always have to get on a plane so if there's anything good coming out of cove but it might be this new tool or more accentuated tool and my gosh the technology we've got i've seen it i've participated in it you have on your screen walking into a very nice hotel you see the coffee stand you see the q and a corner where you can go on any questions you look right you look left you see the private rooms that you're actually going to go into for discussions the value about the foreign ag service and just a little quick because our team is there to help dumb down make it easy build trust in this process we are now in 97 embassies or consulates around the world and and we are by virtue of our local organized our locally employed staff in 35 more they are there to take you by the hand and help you through it and they are outstanding you talk about servant leaders they are the best of the best so you have them we have the market access program the foreign market development program and now with covid we have the ag trade promotion program and yes they go to all the big commodity groups but we topped off in a nice way the groups that really help these folks this is the ag trade promotion funds that would go to the food export midwest group based in chicago and they help all the branded companies the smaller ones these are people that may be in the soybean business or the distilled spirits or all that but aren't meant to work through a large commodity group that are so effective for our large commodities and so they got they got a topping off and they've got plenty i mean they've got an excess amount to spend next year just because this year they didn't spend as much on travel and expenses of hotels and exhibitory and all of that kind of stuff so the congress is in love with market access program and fmd funds they really are many presidents never mind the politics i'm not this is not a political statement many presidents zero those out because either they don't understand it or they're trying to make a statement about budget cut and fiscal responsibility congress always puts those back in the return on the taxpayer dollar is like thirty to one thirty dollars for every taxpayer dollars enormously successful so when you marry up the foreign ag service who know this and know the market's cold throw in some matching funds then rely on experts like these people to give some coaching been there done that here's how you do it it really makes what can be a complicated fearful at times venture and makes it much much much easier and then we have a program that backstops those loans i'll just tell you my son is vice president for asia pacific at xm so norm i know the program you're speaking of very well we have a similar one for the large commodity i mean the neopanmax shiploads of corn soy wheat etc and so there is insurance that can guarantee payment so for those that have not done so and feel like they want to put their toe their ankle their knee in that water i strongly advise trying it there's a lot of help from the financial from the insurance and from the advice categories i just had to get that out there congressman because a lot of people don't understand all the tools that are there right congressman smith can i make one comment on under secretary mckinney's uh um uh discussion there so a few weeks ago for the one of the nonprofits i'm on the board of we did a virtual trade mission to japan now this wasn't ag it was it was healthcare related but i think a number of people were a little bit pessimistic about what could be achieved by it but you know due to the tech kinds of technology that he just mentioned we were able to have a very productive meetings we had breakout sessions you know where you could like like we were discussing you could actually walk into the room you could see the faces of all the people that were at each of the tables you could jump from one table to another table and a number of people commented about that they felt like the networking was almost as effective as an in-person meeting so i think there's a little bit of an attitude right now if i can't travel i can't do anything with my business i can't forge forward in trade but that doesn't necessarily need to be the case there are great tools out there that can help you know uh can help us still be able to to push on and and do what we need to do even if we can't jump on a plane and travel to the other side of the world right right so knowing that man there has been so much done in terms of trade in the last two three years um what what do you think what dynamic there has the most staying power for and and i think probably all three of you could answer this um we do have a couple more questions as well but um what what do you think um is is the new normal uh for for trade that has been leveraged through usmca and and the most recent trade developments under secretary you want to take that one first make sure sorry well i think it has to start with the quality of your product i mean people figured out pretty quickly if if you don't have a product that meets their customer demand and it doesn't always have to be that really really robust quality but boy it better be good and except for the eu who loves to diss our products the world knows knows the quality of us product and safety and so forth so that's got to be the first thing i think the integrity of you as a business person is there and i don't worry about that with the us i sometimes other cultures you know maybe not as faith-based don't know the golden rule their theme is get or gets you know gets you know screw somebody else first before you got it yourself so i think there's that but let me also say that and this is not easy to say because we have been through some difficult times these last two or three years but the permission that we were given to finally call at a time out and say fair is fair or it's not and not be undiplomatic not be unfair but but to force compliance uh you know until we told indonesia we're going to take away your six billion dollars in tax credits it's a program called uh uh globalized system of preference it's designed for developing countries indonesia india many you know five six seven billion dollars that we give them in the form of tax credits well they were taking those and then they were still buying all their product from some other country so so we said we're going to take them away not this because we don't like you it's just you're not playing fair with the intent of the program guess what we're now doing great business with indonesia better business with india and so we got tough if i can say that and i don't mean that in a negative way we got tough and said come on we're partner here you know take korea i'll just given a great example i did not understand when the president was uh was very angry at south korea and this was at the time that kim jong-un was taking rockets into the sea of japan later i understood how many thousands of people how many military men and women have we had on the 38th parallel protecting south korea since 1953 millions i'm guessing and yet they're buying all their their aluminum and and and steel from uh from china who is subsidizing with the deliberate attempt to drive countries out of business how fair is that so uh i think it's rounding the corner the intent has never been to be angry and mean uh forever and a day no no no it's just to say come on dudes let's straighten out let's be fair with each other and i think we're achieving that and i think we're seeing the results and phase one is a great example i think some of the things we're seeing with umca are a great example little to really declare victory because we're still seeing canada god love them back to their nefarious ways it seems with dairy but at the same time the wheat that was so inappropriately treated our wheat going across the border was treated as fee as a feed grade less expensive the same variety of wheat coming south across the border was food grade what's equal about that so even though i love our friends north and south of the border you've got to call timeout and say look come on let's be fair about this so that is i think the biggest change that we're experiencing and no matter who is uh confirmed as the presidency i hope that kind of behavior continues because you've got to be firm but fair correct very good kirk do you want to add to any of that no i'm not i don't have much to add i think um just wanted to to mention you know that i do i do agree that we need to you know we need to make sure that it's that it's a fair and equitable and that and we hold our trade trading partners accountable we do need to extend some um courtesies but we also need to be tough you know when it's necessary and i think building on something that that norm said i think you know i think you know we in representing our companies and our country you know i think we need to you know do what we say we're going to do i think norm said it earlier on and um and and i think we need to set an example of an an expectation of how we want our trading partners to behave you know if they're going to define our wheat one way then it's got to be it's got to go both ways and i think you know if we kind of take the lead in in setting a good example i think i think that's a good way to to do trade um and if they don't you know if they don't follow that lead then we need to hold them accountable right yeah and i think you know i hear a lot in terms of the environment in which i serve that standards-based you know that everyone understands what needs to take place and and that's a mutual understanding can really leverage i think a lot of opportunity moving forward uh let's see we have a question from cindy allen i believe cindy does your is your mic open by chance do you want to ask it or do you want me to uh i can read it here too [Music] um can you hear me adrian yes yes go ahead cindy um under secretary mckinney could you tell me what other countries are interested in the outcome of the trade agreement in process currently with kenya you said what other countries in africa what what other countries in africa are watching the outcome of the trade talks with kenya well i don't know the exact count so i i can't say that but i can say generally speaking uh if the africa union which represents nearly all of the countries of africa they are the spokesperson and that's who we visit with and work with a lot they all are very interested now to be sure there is there are questions maybe even a touch of skepticism from some of the countries that we are not negotiating with you know why can you why not me but but we try to reassure them that we want to tailor it for each country but they themselves will admit that if there is something that is uniform across africa it helps with flow if there's regulations that are one way in angola and different in south africa and yet different still in kenya that makes flow between those countries very difficult so um so i think they're ver i think they are much more optimistic than not but to answer your question many many of the countries of africa want a trade relationship with the us they many of them do and many of them have said that to me and they have echoed that through the africa union right thank you so much thank you and by the way we are pursuing that aggressively as an all of government approach it's called prosper africa so i talk frequently with my friends at commerce at usaid certainly my team here ustr for sure and i'll add one more when ambassador greg dowd the lead ag negotiator from ustr finally got confirmed he and his ag team at ustr rostered a priority list of what countries they'd like to do some sort of a deal with in ag my team did the very same thing but it was independent you'll be pleased to know that if either we or they switched vietnam or um the philippines the lists would have been identical so imagine that two agencies of the us government thinking alike and fully aligned i was very proud of that moment very proud very good very good well gosh i wish we had more time i i could probably have a good uh half a day uh a line of questions for for each one of you i i do want to encourage everyone to maintain the communication maintain the dialogue if you have questions please let us know katie morley is on the call today she's my trade staff out of the washington office she brings some great uh insight and perspective uh and experience with with the trade topic a few others as well uh even in more than agriculture but as you know getting to serve on the ways and means committee has been a i think a great opportunity to really focus on trade and and what can come about from that uh i i'm very excited about leveraging what we have now in our hands in terms of trade leverage leveraging that moving forward it it's it's just um i think a great great point where we are now and we're seeing some of the benefits and and i think you know but it is a high maintenance issue we have to stay on top of enforcement we have to stay on top of uh the the fact that some will we'll try to kind of uh squeeze things in another direction and we need to be mindful of that and we we can be appropriate uh with that and and we don't have to overreact at times but just to remind the world that yes we are open for business we expect a level playing field if you want access to our markets you need to give us access to yours that's what trade is about and imagine if we conducted uh domestic commerce uh with with some of the trade the international trade policies that are currently on on the books that that just wouldn't work and it would stifle innovation it would just stifle creativity and and above all it would hurt consumers so i i think there there's not enough told about the impact of good trade policy for consumers and certainly workers in addition to that so i just want to thank everyone for your time here today and if you do have further questions feel free to let us know my website adrienneth.house.gov if you want more information or certainly we can pass on your your questions to the panelists here that we have today if you have further questions so again thank you to all of our panelists thank you to all of our participants i appreciate this opportunity and and i hope we can gather again hopefully in person that would be nice it would be nice meanwhile it is a a little more convenient and more cost effective to do zoom but it doesn't replace the uh in person meetings right no it doesn't so uh again i say thank you and i look forward to uh hopefully seeing all of you soon take care take care you all very very much thank you thank you

always appreciate my colleague from louisiana's leadership on these important issues and i appreciate the time that he's yielding me madam speaker as my colleagues have shared the biden administration has been defined by a series of self-inflicted crises these include these include failed leadership on the world stage runaway inflation and a deliberate failure to secure our borders in fact you could say they're having a record year record high inflation record violent crime record gas prices record numbers of illegal immigrants seizures of illegal drugs all at our southern border the common denominator and each of these disasters is the president himself the president listened to the state department over the recommendation of his generals which led to last year's disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan he shut down american energy production which led to skyrocketing gas prices long before russia invaded ukraine he catered to the radicals flooding our economy with trillions and free money and that's created rampant inflation that we're experiencing today on the border his reversal of president trump's policies has led to nearly two million migrants pouring across our southern border since he took office that's more than the population of 15 of our states think about that the equivalent of creating a state or two every single year with a number of people crossing the border these disasters were completely self-inflicted and american families are paying the price despite our political differences i take no joy in watching this administration fail when our president fails america fails madam speaker the american people need and deserve a true leader if the president is incapable of leading he has a duty to surround himself with smart people willing to give him good counsel and in the best interest of our nation listen to the smart ones and not those with a track record of failure and then act on it the president should focus on american energy independence which will bring down gas prices here at home and help our allies abroad he should not be talking to a venezuelan dictator when we have reliable affordable energy right here at home he also needs to stop the out-of-control spending and reinstate tough border policies to protect our communities for the sake of our country this administration must stop administrating and implementing the worst ideas of the d.c political class and lead decisively i yield back

Mr Speaker I rise today to bring attention to the urgent crisis facing dairy farmers across my district the low price of milk labor shortages and dwindling access to new markets are just some of the many challenges faced by the hard-working family farms in my district additionally the margin protection program has failed North Country dairy farmers by providing little to no return on our farmers buy in recently I was pleased to support the bipartisan Budget Act which contained many urgent reforms to this program such as raising catastrophic coverage for the 1st tier of covered production for all farmers reducing premium rates to help farmers buy coverage and waiving costly administrative fees for underserved farms agriculture is truly the backbone of our North Country economy and generations of farmers have helped make dairy production a way of life for many families that I represent in Congress I'll keep fighting every day to strengthen our family farms for future generations thank you and I yield back

president biden and the democrats not only do they have to own this they have to wear this but the american people are having to wear it with them you know it is just such um their motive to blame someone else and they're trying to blame this here and instead of acknowledging we made a mistake we need to correct that mistake and i mean after a year of these anti-energy policies and having their heads literally in the sand you know they're finally turning their attention to high gas prices and they're finally looking at you know whose fault is it you know we talk about taking ninety dollars to fill up our cars that's just one time it doesn't last very long when you're taking kids to school when you're going to work and then you have to fill up go to the pump and fill up again but it has been so much it's far more than a year that the waged war on american energy has taken place and the best they can come up with is an election driven political gimmick a gas tax holiday which by the way it ends after the election so this isn't helping anyone we need to come up with solutions and force this administration to actually help americans we all drive we all eat we all have a car to get us to where we need to be in most circumstances and in mississippi mississippians are hurting just like the rest of this country so i just plead and beg with this administration step up do something that's going to actually help with american people instead of just help for an election please just do that for the american people thank you

all right Rick I'll hand things over to you hi uh I'm Rick Olson and I'm the president or vice president of the Washington State Alliance of uh retired Americans and I represent the retirees here in Eastern Washington um I also represent the steel worker organization of active retirees here in Eastern Washington also I just want to say how much of honor and a pleasure it is to be a part of this group and be a be a part of the campaign that uh is pushing to see Patty Murray return to her position as Senator representing the state of Washington um we're talking about prescription medicine here today and and I just want to uh maybe you relay a story that I have that's personal to me um my parents are elderly um you know when I was younger they never took pills they were healthy as a horse and and as they got older they started to rely on more prescription medicine and and uh my dad is 95 my mom is 93 and my dad's got a pill box that's full of pills and and my mom takes a certain amount of medications also I know that my mom's diabetic and um so this insulin uh the measure that Patty Murray got in uh in relation to the insulin is is very very important to her they're on a fixed income um they're they're comfortable but there there are on a fixed income and so every penny counts to them and so uh when this got past it it was a real Plus for them and they're really appreciative of of uh the work that Patty Murray has done um and and in relation to uh all the retirees here that I represent um they're all you know excited we had a meeting on Tuesday and or yesterday about and I relayed the information that I'd gotten with the group with steel workers organization of active retirees and they were all excited and they were all uh very very appreciative so let me pass that on to you um that's kind of all I have I'd like to uh turn this over to Leslie sather thanks Rick good afternoon and thank you for having me here today my name is Vivian sather I usually her pronouns and I was born and raised in Spokane Washington where I continue to live and work as a health insurance Navigator so I did not receive health coverage until I was about 18 years old when the Affordable Care Act was passed and Medicaid Eligibility was expanded so I know firsthand how important it is to have access to affordable health coverage um and how important it is to Once physical and mental well-being something to this this day disproportionately impacts communities of color and the lgbtqia plus Community I'm a huge proponent of the ACA because as an insurance Navigator I help individuals and family every day get connected to health coverage on Washington Health Plan finder I see the positive impact it makes in people's lives and for our community as a whole our Network in Eastern Washington has helped enroll well over 150 000 residents in health insurance since the Inception of the APA lowering our counties in unsure uninsured rates reaching 4.7 in mid-2021 and with the copin 19 pandemic we saw folks who lost their jobs and in turn lost their health coverage um with the American Rescue plan act or arpa this made it possible for people to enroll in health coverage with more tax credits being available to lower their monthly premiums I assisted someone about a year ago who lost their job in pondery County they were a single parent juggling child care and finding income to support their family they were able to find part-time work and enroll in the health plan on Washington Health and binder for about 40 a month with the savings firm from arpa with the help of Senator Murray and championing the extension of these benefits with the inflation reduction act the people I help every day will be able to continue accessing affordable health coverage you won't have to worry about putting off a doctor's appointment or missing important moments in their lives these benefits directly support Working Families and people who don't have access to health coverage traditionally through their employer people's lives are at stake when Access to Health Care isn't available this affects communities disproportionately and will further exacerbate disparities across different impact groups impacted groups I think Senator Murray for supporting legislation that puts individuals and Families First and we need to continue supporting the leadership that puts self-equity and access to Affordable Care at the Forefront okay we'll now turn it over to Leslie dock who is the chair of protect our care thank you and thank you for um all that you do every day to get people makes a big difference my name is Leslie Dock and I'm the chair of protect our care which is a Washington DC based Healthcare advocacy group with staff around the U.S and before I found and predict our care in 2016 to protect the Affordable Care Act I was the senior counselor to the Secretary of HHS in Washington D.C the inflation reduction Act is a landmark and historic legislation that will dramatically lower the cost of prescription drugs reduce Health Care insurance premiums for Millions saving families thousands of dollars a year keeping them healthy and addressing systemic inequities and access to care it's particularly needed at a time that even though inflation is showing signs of slowing down Americans are also grappling with Rising costs and tight family budgets it's no surprise that this legislation is incredibly popular with the American people no matter what party they belong to or where they live and it's a victory over the special interests particularly over the large pharmaceutical companies that spent close to 200 million dollars trying to defeat this bill we all know how being sick takes over our lives imagine being sick when you can't afford the care you need can't see the doctor you know you need to see what that does to your life your family and obviously to your health unfortunately that's the reality for millions of Americans and this bill will help end big parts of that and it's important to know that the help is coming soon because of the IRA in 2023 13 million Americans will pay less for their health insurance costs including almost 170 000 washingtonians beginning in 2023 just a few months from now the monthly cost of insulin will be capped at 35 a month and Senator Murray and others try to extend those savings to people below Medicare age and on private insurance Republicans refused beginning in 2023 for seniors on Medicare vaccines will be free including highly expensive vaccines like the shingle vaccine beginning in 2023 seniors will begin to be protected from egregious annual price increases on drugs they're already taking simply because the companies can get away with it the bill guarantees that seniors no longer will have to pay more than two thousand dollars a year and out of pocket costs for their drugs today many spend tens of thousands of dollars a year on drugs they need to stay alive and finally finally Medicare will be given the power to negotiate for lower drug prices so Americans no longer have to pay three to four times more for the same drugs in the United States than people do in other countries as the previous speakers have said this bill will make a real difference in the lives of real people I'm a Medicare beneficiary and I know exactly what that means people who work hard every day and but simply can't afford the drugs they need to stay alive people who work hard every day but can't afford to pay for their health insurance and die before they should because they haven't been diagnosed in time you would think this would be easy you this is you would think this would be as close to Motherhood and apple pie and common good common sense as any legislation you can imagine but the reality is that every single Republican in the U.S Senate voted against this bill they voted for higher health insurance premiums for 170 000 washingtonians they voted for higher insulin costs they voted for higher prescription drug costs and we know that if Republicans take control of the Senate that they will attempt to repeal this day this bill starting on day one why do we know that because they've said so because the head of the Republican Senate Campaign Committee has said so because the Kevin McCarthy has said so we know this is their agenda and then they'll be gunning for the Affordable Care Act as well that's why Senators like Patty Murray are so important I've worked in Washington DC in politics for a long time and we succeed in doing good things when there were Champions and leaders like Senator Murray leading the good fight people have the guts the fight people who have the judgment to do the right thing and people who care about their everyday constituents instead of their special interests Senator Murray I've seen firsthand embodies all of those skills and all of that dedication with a genuine kindness and caring for her constituents I've seen her employ all those skills to be sure that government works for the people whether that government's run by democrats or by Republicans she's a leader we can count on the leader who truly leads she's a leader we truly need and trust me there are very few like her Senator it's a pleasure and an honor to turn the microphone over to you well thank you so much Leslie I really appreciate that Rick and Vivian thank you for sharing your personal stories it really means a lot to me and and I so appreciate everybody being here today to talk about something that is so important to me and that is lowering the cost of prescription drugs and health care and how we can build on that progress we've made this November at The Ballot Box you know for years I've heard from countless patients across Washington State who cannot afford their prescription drugs and every year in Congress I fight for policies to hold giant pharmaceutical companies accountable and lower costs for all of us this year when we passed the inflation reduction act patience one we beat big Pharma and made enormous progress especially for our seniors that's why the inflation reduction Act is such a big deal it finally gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for our seniors we're bringing drug companies to the bargaining table and patients everywhere are going to benefit we're going to cap seniors annual drug costs at two thousand dollars a year and we're at cap insulin for Medicare at 35 a month and protect Medicare patients from Drug Company that are jacking up prices just just to make a quick Buck this is really huge for the more than 1.4 million Medicare recipients in Washington state who will save a whole lot on their prescription drugs because no one should have to empty their savings account just so they can fill a prescription now I made sure we also moved the ball forward on strengthening and expanding the Affordable Care Act when we pass this bill as well the inflation reduction act expands the health care tax credits from the American Rescue plan that helped millions of people save thousands of dollars on their health care this year that Vivian just talked about these tax credits helped lead to record enrollment in the health care exchanges bringing our nation's uninsured rate to an all-time low in Washington thanks to the tax credit more than sixty thousand new people signed up for Health Care coverage this year I mean last year two and fine five found coverage for less than a hundred dollars a month and forty thousand people in Washington state were eligible for coverage that cost less than ten dollars a month this isn't just about saving people money this is going to save lives right now we know that patients are rationing their prescriptions or afraid to see their doctor not because they're scared of a diagnosis but because they're scared of the price tag the inflation reduction Act is the biggest step Congress has ever taken to lower prescription drugs and health care costs and I'm very proud to have worked to get it across the finish line but here's the deal Republicans have no health care plan they have no plans to lower everyday costs for people in Washington state the last time Republicans controlled Congress their plan was to repeal the Affordable Care Act and deliver massive tax giveaways for billionaires and giant corporations and they managed to get half of that accomplished we cannot give them a chance to finish the job and take us all backwards I am determined to build on that progress as are all of my Democratic colleagues I want to cap the cost of insulin for everyone not just on our Medicare patients I want to help deliver a strong Federal public option to help bring down health care costs and to expand coverage and that will not happen if Republicans control the Senate here is the fundamental difference Democrats understand that life-saving medicine doesn't do any good if people can't afford it and we're doing something to make sure everyone can get the care they need today Republicans are more interested in siding with big Pharma France but I'll tell you what we can build on the progress we just made on the inflation reduction act I know we can but we have to vote and we have to win in November thank you all for being a part of this and I think we have some time for questions alrighty thank you so much everyone um I'm going to open it up for questions please use the raise hand function and say your name and Outlet when I call on you if there are any questions

thank you mr speaker i'm proud to join several of my colleagues tonight to recognize our former colleague mr paul mitchell paul was recently diagnosed with cancer and so many of us wanted to send our well wishes that we decided the best way we could do it was from the well of the house some place that paul mitchell really loved and spent so much of his time paul represented michigan's 10th district in our state's thumb from 2017 until his retirement just this year in that time he proved himself to be the kind of principled practical leader that michigan is known for paul knew that the path to good government runs through reaching across the aisle the proof is in his record paul was an intent was intentional about ensuring key legislation that he was about ensuring key legislation be introduced in a bipartisan fashion and the folks he drew to his legislation ran the gamut of the political spectrum he was an advocate for students for investing in innovation and for economic development whether you were on the left or on the right paul worked with you to get things done these days some might call that behavior an independent being a maverick but to us that was just paul when he announced his retirement in july of 2019 in order to spend more time with his family we of course wished him all the best but i also felt a twinge of sadness in losing a funny charming and humble servant leader he charted his own course in congress as both a legislator and a friend his presence is deeply missed in this chamber earlier this month we received the news that paul had been diagnosed with renal cancer weeks before he had had emergency surgery to remove a mass and a blood clot that had moved to his heart his doctors at henry ford mccomb hospital estimated a 10 percent chance of survival but true to form paul pulled through i'm happy to announce that last night paul went home to his family in dryden he got he has a long road of recovery ahead of him one that will require things like physical therapy and immunotherapy but paul is approaching his recovery with the typical can-do approach and we wanted to send him all of our love and all of our strength for recovery for someone for those of us who spent so much time with him here the assembled we have members of the michigan delegation members of the problem solvers caucus two groups that spent um just a ton of time with paul mitchell and mr speaker it is therefore my privilege to turn the floor over to some of those friends to recognize him in the place that we know he loves so much so with that mr speaker it's my privilege to yield a couple minutes of time to another colleague from michigan mr andy levin thank you so much congresswoman slotkin and thanks for organizing uh this uh special order in honor of our dear friend paul mitchell i represent parts of macomb and oakland counties and during my first term in congress paul and i shared representation of macomb paul represented the northern part i represent the southern part and while there are plenty of policies we disagreed on there were a lot of things we connected on to we wanted to bring better water infrastructure to macomb and paul i'm still working on it and we're going to get there we talked about our shared history in the workforce world paul was a real leader in workforce policy through his company and i used to run the state workforce system in michigan and he was a real leader and a thought leader in that area and paul i'm trying to carry that on as best i can too as we look towards wioa reauthorization and when we did spar over policy positions it wasn't mean-spirited and in fact it was really close to my ideal of what it means to serve in this body it was real honest debate the kind i was happy to have and honored to have paul and i now share one more connection and it's one i wish we didn't share as a two-time cancer survivor i know what it's like to get that diagnosis and i know the stress and the pain that paul and his family are facing it's something i wouldn't wish on anyone and i'm devastated that they have to go through it i want paul to know that mary and i are thinking about you and praying for you as your treatment begins and that i'm here to lend an ear or even talk through this experience the same way that you did for me when i was just coming to congress and you were one of the most generous colleagues i knew i was lucky to have a neighbor like paul mitchell and i look forward to the day that we can celebrate your remission paul and joust happily once again over the issues of the day god bless you and i yield back to my time to representative slotkin mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members have five legislative days to submit notes for the record without objection uh thank you mr speaker i'd next like to yield five minutes to my colleague from virginia miss spanberger thank you to my dear colleague from michigan for putting together this special time for us to talk about our former colleague and for so many of us our friend representative paul mitchell i first had the opportunity to meet representative mitchell on the floor of the house when his youngest son was visiting and we were on the house floor entering our cards in for a vote and paul's son wanted to help push the voting button for different members paul at that time was a republican i am a democrat and if you gave your card to paul's son he would invariably press the republican or vote with the republicans regardless of who you were so there were quite a few engaged democrats who thought they were being so kind letting a child vote who had to run over to the well right behind me to change their vote because indeed i believe he was 10 at the time a 10 year old had somewhat mischievously voted incorrectly paul was simultaneously delighted by what was a bit of a funny experience on the house floor uh but also a little bit embarrassed that people were running over um but that was paul he would bring and does bring joy to every meeting he is a serious person focused on policy focused on truth on reality on the things that matter to him on his incredible career in business on his wonderful family imminently proud of his children and particularly um always willing to draw in his personal experiences in business as a parent as a parent of a law enforcement officer to find commonality and to advocate for the things that he believes in and during our time in congress i was so grateful to serve uh on the problem solvers caucus or to be part of the problem solvers caucus with paul where invariably during our weekly meetings uh he would be a jovial part of those meetings focused on the hard work of legislating but also on bringing a bit of humanity and commonality to the people gathered around the table sometimes engaging in very very difficult conversations paul made the very hard decision to retire after his terms in congress it was one that as a friend i heard him talk through the the pros the cons whether he was ready to leave this place a place that while he was here he's so deeply loved in a place where i believe as a colleague i saw him make a significant impact but ultimately with a young child at home a beautiful farm with lots of sheep and a uh and a renewed interest in a love of racing uh paul did decide that it was time for him to retire um and so since his retirement i have been a friend who's been on the receiving end of so many photos as i'm sure many of our colleagues here have been of uh you know snowy days on the farm in michigan beautiful views of the water and race cars as a as a virginian we have a a nascar racetrack just on the line of my district i generally like to claim it and paul was scheduled before his diagnosis to come to virginia for a race and so i just thought how hysterical is that that a man i used to talk hard policy uh issues and debate policy and disagree sometimes very fervently with is now going to be literally racing uh through my district or just adjacent in his race car and so i i look forward to the time when paul because he is a fighter and regardless of any diagnosis i think we know that he's in his intent on getting back in his race car back to his farm uh and certainly uh continuing to um uh be engaged and focused i look i look forward to the time when we can welcome him in virginia for him to race around the track i'm unsure whether or not i may choose to enter into that vehicle with him but i may stand on the sidelines and cheer paul is an incredible friend he was an incredibly good member of congress because at every moment he just was focused on what was right i know that's how he was in business in his personal life before he came here i know that's how he continues to be but certainly as a new member of congress witnessing someone who always genuinely showed kindness and heart every conversation he had here in the halls of congress was it was a great example to me and i am so proud uh to have served with him during his time in congress uh but far more than that i am deeply honored to call paul mitchell a friend a real friend um and and deeply honored to know that he is someone who will always stand up for truth who will always stand up for what is right who will always stand up for his family for his friends and for his country and so uh my dear friend i wish you the very best as you continue uh in your uh recovery we are all thinking of you and i am so grateful for your friendship and i yield back all right well in in honor of mr mitchell we will now start going democrat republican democrat republican to demonstrate our bipartisanship so mr speaker i'd like to next yield a few minutes to my other colleague from michigan mr meyer thank you to my colleague from the great state of michigan um and and i guess thank you for all of the service that paul has given this body that has given our country has given our state the morning when i was supposed to first meet paul uh was the same morning that he announced that he was not running for reelection and he defined um that that spirit of making a decisive uh decisive moves um you know it's no secret that for the freshman class who have entered the past six months have been uh less than normal um i take the assurances of my colleagues who've been in this body for more terms that what we've seen so far has been atypical but um i cannot thank paul enough for um the example that he set for the the wisdom that he shared and for his perennial if uh ever blunt honesty um all too often especially politicians can walk and dance and and do a jig around the truth um and paul was always incredibly clear about where he stood and what he believed so i am i'm grateful for the friendship that i've been able to develop with him as a freshman and and i look forward to many more of those moments and i want paul and his family to know that he is in our prayers my wife gabrielle and i keep him in our prayers um the challenges that he's dealing with are being felt by too many but i'm proud to call him a friend as he continues to fight on and with that i would like to yield the remainder of my time to my colleague miss lochen thank you mr speaker next it's my pleasure to yield two minutes to another colleague from michigan mr upton well thanks for doing this and i'm sorry to sort of jump people in line but we're in a full committee markup so i got to get back but yeah i have to say that my friend paul mitchell grew up the eldest of seven kids literally a natural-born leader of the pack he was the first of his extended family to graduate from college he's noted that his mom raised him to believe that those with talents and resources were expected by god to make a difference in the world and by god he did tenacious and focused like a laser beam he set and met goals a scrappy fighter he's now met his most formidable foe that is for sure and he's all in for that fight and in a text that i got from him a little bit earlier today he said as you know i'm one tough cuss yes paul you are and you know what everybody knows it not only your republican and democratic colleagues but certainly the former president and probably all of your constituents back in michigan as well you are a tough cuss yesterday uh my colleague diana degette and i introduced a discussion draft called 21st century cures 2.0 392 of us in this chamber including paul voted for the 21st century cures enacted in 2016 which expedites the approval of new drugs this bill that we're working on now 2.0 could well indeed speed the approval of new drugs even so it indeed could be the very lifeline for paul and so many like him thousands of americans in around the world that somehow are impacted by this terrible disease that we all want to survive paul's life is characterized by exceeding expectations define the odds and we know that's what he intends to do now for sure and if anybody can it's paul so we're with you paul we may be watching every step of the way all of us and would ask unanimous consent to put his farewell address that he uh stated back in july of uh 2019 into the record as part of this tribute and i'll say thank you again for organizing this time for many of his friends that would like to see a few words tonight and push him forward to get to that finish line and come back god bless you without objection thank you fred it's now my pleasure to yield a few minutes to another colleague from michigan miss stevens well thank you to uh my my colleague congresswoman slatkin for organizing this tribute session to our friend and former colleague paul mitchell it is very symbolic of what it is like to be a member of the michigan delegation there are 14 of us seven democrats seven republicans representing a state just a little over 10 million people and yet we come together time and time again to champion matters and issues for our state if it's the great lakes or veterans issues or our automotive industry and that is exactly what we are doing here today we are standing up for our friend who is in a fight a fight against cancer and we are doing it on the floor of the house of representatives before this man loves the floor of the house of representatives so there is no place more symbolic than this to tell paul you have got this sherry you have got this and to your kids who i know you love dearly we are standing by you every step of the way paul was certainly a champion not only for the legislative process and the the business of doing government right by people but he was a champion for michigan and if you hear his words as he's talked about his experience his recent diagnosis you hear paul saying this was a gift from god this was a gift from god even when it got scary because he's getting a little bit more of life he's getting a more of a chance to continue to push and and to stand up for what he knows he's worked his life for which is the creation of his wonderful family and being in the state he loves so dearly and paul i'll just tell you i have so many fond memories of you i have fond memories of learning from you on this on this very floor i have fond memories of being at chrysler with you which was really exciting for a first term congresswoman to be alongside you seeing the new vehicles and having discussions with with the the workforce at chrysler in my district but i know you have many chrysler employees in in the michigan uh 10th district as well and so those are the memories those are the things that we celebrate with your service but also with your continued dedication so it's a real privilege and honor to be here with my colleagues uh telling you paul you have got this you're gonna keep going and we are gonna keep fighting another day thank you so much and with that i'll yield back my time to congresswoman slacken thank you mr speaker next is my pleasure to yield a few minutes to a colleague from new york mr reed well thank uh i thank my colleague and i i truly do thank her for organizing this special order uh this evening for uh our friend paul mitchell you know mr speaker i come here uh this evening no with no prepared remarks other than to make some comments as shared by my colleagues about uh this great man paul mitchell is truly a friend uh paul mitchell is someone i've gotten to know over the years here in congress and watched him develop in his own right watched him become a very serious and astute legislator i watched him join the problem solvers caucus that we started and many of the colleagues have talked about the problem solvers caucus and he came to us from leadership and in in that uh process uh he did some things because that's a very special club and we have some very special rules and commitments to each other and in order to fulfill those commitments and those terms of honor in serving in that caucus with our colleagues he demonstrated publicly privately and to our fellow members of the problem service uh what it means to be an honorable member of congress and i will tell you that for that i was forever grateful to been in position to encourage paul to join the problem solvers caucus and when he uh in particular one day exhibited that very limited leadership quality that is so lacking here in the united states house of representatives today in my opinion he showed true courage true statesmanship true leadership and i just have to tell you as we got the news uh paul about your diagnosis and i'm speaking to you directly here from the floor paul we all immediately came to your side we all immediately in our thoughts and our prayers in our bond of friendship stood with you and your family and we are standing with you and your family as you go through this next chapter of your life and please know that you're not alone to you and to your family as a member of this body and as a member of the problem solvers caucus as a member serving your country as a great citizen that we all stand with you and your family as you go through this ordeal that you face that being said i joined with my colleagues and saying we know paul mitchell we know your heart paul we know your tenacity and your perseverance and we know you're going to get through this and you're going to get through this in a way only paul mitchell can get through it and so as we come here today to give some fine words on behalf of you paul and on behalf of your family no we are also sending more than words we are sending our shoulders to cry upon our shoulders to lean upon and as you have exhibited over the years even a shoulder to laugh upon during this difficult time and it's those lessons of life that you taught me serving with you here in the house that you cannot take life too seriously that life is too short that is why as my colleagues noted he retired to be with his his young family and his other children to make sure that he kept his priorities straight and you did paul you put your family you put your health you put your future first in regards to the time in your life to make that decision to retire from this body and so i am just humbled to be here with my colleagues i truly thank my colleagues on the democratic side i thank my colleagues on the republican side for coming together here tonight to honor uh one of our best from the u.s house of representatives paul and that's you and for that we'll be ever forever grateful to be able to call you a friend a colleague and in the end a survivor and with that i yield back to my friend from michigan thank you mr reed for those heartfelt words mr speaker next it's my pleasure to yield a few minutes to a colleague from minnesota mr phillips another member of the problem solvers caucus thank you to my colleague from michigan and to all my friends paul you might not know this but you're an important mentor of mine one of the most important mentors i've had in my brief career in this chamber and you represent the very most precious and sometimes rare of attributes in the u.s congress and that is principle you are a man of principle at a time when our country needs that and you more than ever you're a man of great intelligence and success and decency and empathy and honesty and integrity i remember my first conversation with paul and we were speaking about education higher education and it was that conversation that reminded me that we can learn so much more from people of different perspectives than we do from those who are cut from the same cloth and when paul made the difficult but very principled decision to become an independent at the end of his career here in congress he wrote a letter to the house clerk to announce the change in affiliation and the last line of the letter read and i quote while admittedly symbolic we all know that symbols matter we all know that symbols matter and when you retired from congress paul you said and i quote again i can't begin to express to you how difficult it is to say something like i'm done because i've never been done before and let me tell you my friend you're not done yet and we sure as heck are not done with you we love you paul and america joins me in sending our love to you and yours as well thank you thank you mr phillips well in conclusion paul as you can imagine we of course had our schedule changed 12 different times today there are many many more of our colleagues who are submitting official notes for the record and who are stuck in various places and will reach out directly but to you and to your family um for the legacy that you left in this place please know that we see you we recognize you we believe in your will to fight and we're behind you a hundred percent so um with that i thank you to my colleagues for joining i'm on both sides of the aisle and i thank you mr speaker and i oh i'm sorry i'm sorry perfect perfect i now want to recognize in the nick of time i'm sorry about the schedule changes my colleague from michigan mr wahlberg i thank the gentlelady and i wouldn't miss this we have energy and commerce markup that continues on but i guess through the chair to paul i wouldn't miss the opportunity to encourage you and express through the chair paul my deep appreciation for you as a friend as a colleague as a fighter and i although i've not heard all the comments of my colleagues i'm sure that they have said to you we love you we're pulling for you for sheri for the family uh we're in your corner but we also know that you're the one that has to fight this and friends sometimes feel that in a very unique way that it's a helpless feeling that as we think about you and pray for you and as a co-chairman of the congressional prayer caucus you probably ought to expect that i'm praying for you and i will i'm praying that god will give you strength god that will give you patience endurance and even a joy in the process of what you are modeling to your family as you go through this i know you're a tough guy we've had our verbal battles together all the time and i'm not even going to admit today that you may have won on a few occasions i know that you race cars and you race cars not to lose and you race cars to take that victory lap after you went through the checker flag and right now we're expecting you to race to give it your absolute best to use all the resources necessary to continue on because your life is important to your family to your friends and to those of us who look on if we admit though you're going through a physical challenge that none of us are going through right now but in the reality of life none of us on the floor right here and now have any more certainty about any longer time given to us than you have i might not make it tomorrow so it's important that we buy up the day that we have my prayers are that you're doing that in the challenges that you face paul in the disappointments and the discouragements that come in the dark hours at night yet there is someone and i'm not saying to you this to you simply because i'm a preacher even though i've gone to the dark side i'm saying it to you because my relationship with a savior makes it possible for me to look to the future whatever that future means with hope with certainty the jesus who i hope is a spirit i exube exude to my colleagues my friends my neighbors and you tonight paul is the same one who said i'm come that you might have life and have it abundantly he's the same one that came to die for each of us and understands our needs he's the same one that said i'm the resurrection life he that believes in me though he die and we all will yet shall he live for whosoever lives and believes in me shall never abide in death that's an eternal thing and paul you and i have talked about those spiritual things as well pull onto your faith you and sherry pull on that faith let it strengthen you let it encourage you let the loving loving savior who gave himself for you and me and everyone give you the strength to battle on to go on that racetrack of challenge and whatever whatever to find a certainty that in him there's an eternity there's an attorney that begins here and now paul we love you i love you i'll be praying for you i'm counting on you to do everything you can i'm counting on your family to be blessed because of the example you're setting but i'm also saying to you that we're going to keep on supporting you god bless you brother thank you mr wahlberg for those kind words paul i hope you know um the strength that we are sending you all of us on both sides of the aisle we feel it we've been talking about you and sherry and the kids constantly um and we hope that from our convening on you you feel that strength and the power to fight back and beat this thing um with that i thank you to my colleagues and to you mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time gentlemen yields back

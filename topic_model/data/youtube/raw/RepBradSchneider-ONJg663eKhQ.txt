men would ensure that our Great Lakes and the Ogallala Aquifer and the tremendous economic benefits that come from them will remain protected and safe from toxic chemicals as stewards of the health and safety of our communities we should take sensible approaches to protect our most valuable assets this amendment would safeguard our drinking water in 16 states for millions of our constituents in Illinois Minnesota Michigan Indiana New York ohio pennsylvania wisconsin South Dakota Wyoming Nebraska Kansas Colorado Oklahoma New Mexico and Texas the Great Lakes provide 56 billion gallons of fresh water it's correct the house the gentleman will suspend the house is not in order the gentleman is reck the Great Lakes provides 60 56 billion gallons of fresh water per day for agriculture municipal drinking water and electricity production over 30 million Americans rely on the Great Lakes everyday for their safe and clean drinking water this amendment would protect the Great Lakes from being put at risk by preventing the department of state from approving projects that have the potential to contaminate the Great Lakes and their aquifers we owe it to our future generations to keep the Great Lakes healthy and to use the resources we have in a responsible and sustainable way this amendment also ensures that the owners and operators of pipelines who have been responsible for major spills in the past that resulted in contaminated community drinking water supplies will not receive special treatment to build additional pipelines across our borders when accidents occur in our Great Lakes it is not a simple fix to restore the ecosystem and return to business as usual the time it takes our Great Lakes to naturally rid itself of pollutants can take up to one hundred and ninety-one years this is why we must take every single precaution now to make sure the health of our Great Lakes and the health of our economy are not put at risk for short-term gain energy independence remains one of the primary drivers of our economy and will continue to have a major role in our future competitiveness and the health of our future generations by eliminating common sense environmental regulations and evaluations for projects with the potentially massive public health consequences it is a dereliction of our duty to protect our families protect our communities and protect our businesses that rely on the Great Lakes instead of assessing the impact of the full project the underlying bill would limit environmental review for new infrastructure projects to only the cross-border sections we live in an interconnected environment and the Great Lakes system is not an isolated resource but rather a complex ecosystem intertwined with the health and vibrancy of countless communities across two countries States what happens to one has an impact on all the amendment would ensure the proper planning and environmental impact evaluations are complete and that the total scope of projects are known and assess the Great Lakes represents more than 1,000 miles of border between the United States and Canada it is irresponsible to take on all the environment environmental risks to our drinking water are four billion dollar fishing industry and the 200 million tons of shipping that occur on the Great Lakes including ninety percent of the nation's iron ore and fifty-eight percent of the automobiles produced here it is irresponsible to put at risk the millions of Americans who rely on the Great Lakes and the Ogallala Aquifer for their basic human needs it's irresponsible to take on the risk of chemical and toxic toxic contaminants permanently changing our environment for the worst without doing our own due diligence for all Great Lakes and Great Plains communities I ask that you take this common-sense step with us to protect our safe access to clean drinking water and to deny companies who have a track record of contamination from given being given the opportunity to do so again with that madam Speaker I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back the balance of his time you

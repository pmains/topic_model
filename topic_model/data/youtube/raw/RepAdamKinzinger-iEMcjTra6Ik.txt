  FOUR-STAR GENERAL BARRY  McCAFFREY JOIN US. >>> FIRST, IN JUST TWO DAYS THE  HOUSE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING  THE ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAPITOL  WILL HOLD WHAT IS LIKELY ITS  FINAL PUBLIC HEARING. THE COMMITTEE'S CHAIRMAN, BENNIE THOMPSON, SAID LAST WEEK THAT  THIS HEARING'S FORMAT WILL BE A  BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES IN  THE PAST AND WILL NOT HAVE A  LIVE WITNESS. JOINING US NOW, MEMBER OF THE  JANUARY 6th SELECT COMMITTEE,  REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE FROM  ILLINOIS, ADAM KINZINGER. GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW  THIS MORNING. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. >> WHAT'S HAPPENING? >> IF I TOLD YOU, IT WOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE. THE BIG THING IS WHAT YOU'VE  SEEN OVER THE SUMMER, MAKING  SURE PEOPLE ARE REMINDED OF  THAT, AND BUILDING MORE DEPTH  AND HAVING SOME INFORMATION. THE BOTTOM LINE IS BY THE END OF THE SUMMER WE HAD PROVED OUR  CASE. THOUGH WE'RE NOT OUT AS A  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT-TYPE THING,  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REALLY TOOK A LOT OF THE CUES WE HAD PRODUCED  AND SAID THERE MAY BE AN ISSUE  HERE. SO I THINK IT WILL BE A GOOD  HEARING AND WE'LL HAVE A REPORT  COMING UP IN A BIT. >> CONGRESSMAN, LOOKING AT NEW  INFORMATION HERE, NEW WITNESSES, OR DOES IT AMOUNT TO A CLOSING  ARGUMENT? YOU SAID IT'S BEEN SINCE LATE  JULY, A COUPLE MONTHS SINCE THIS ISSUE WAS REALLY FRONT AND  CENTER FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,  MIDTERMS IN A MONTH. ARE YOU MAKING ONE LAST CASE TO  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEFORE THEY  GO TO THE POLLS? >> YEAH, I THINK, NO, IT HAS  NOTHING TO DO WITH NOVEMBER. IT REALLY DOES HAVE TO DO WITH  HOW DO WE GET THIS REPORT DONE,  HOW DO WE GET THIS INFORMATION  DONE BY THE END OF THIS  CONGRESS. WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE ELECTION  IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO GO. I THINK IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A  DEADLINE ON THIS. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE  ELECTION. AGAIN, I THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S  ONLY A FEW DAYS AWAY. LET'S SEE WHAT WE PRODUCE OUT  HERE. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY SECRET  SAUCE AWAY, IF YOU WILL, OR ANY  OF THE INFORMATION WE HAVE,  BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT WE  PRESENT IT TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE WHEN WE HAVE THEIR  ATTENTION. >> CONGRESSMAN, SPEAKING OF THE  MIDTERMS, YESTERDAY YOU  ANNOUNCED A NEW LIST OF YOUR  ENDORSEMENTS, AND THERE IS A  THEME HERE, A LOT OF THEM ARE  DEMOCRATS, JACK SHAPIRO,  GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA, KATIE  HOBBS, GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA, THE  LIST GOES ON AND ON, THE THEME  BEING THEY'RE RUNNING AGAINST  ELECTION DENIERS. WAS THAT BEHIND YOUR DECISION? >> IT WAS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DEAL WITH IN NOVEMBER THAT WE  CAN VOTE ON IS BASED ON DO YOU  ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY. WE'RE GOING TO ARGUE TAX RATES  FOREVER. WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO ARGUE  ABORTION FOREVER, EVEN SOME OF  THOSE HOT TOPICS OUT THERE. BUT THE ONE THING WE CAN'T  CONTINUE ARGUING IF WE LOSE IT  IS ARE WE GOING TO BE A  SELF-GOVERNING NATION. AND YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE OUT  THERE THAT ARE CONVINCING HALF  OF THE COUNTRY OR TRYING TO  CONVINCE HALF THE COUNTRY THAT  THE ELECTION SYSTEM DOESN'T  WORK, THAT THEIR VOTE WAS  STOLEN. DEMOCRACY AND SELF-GOVERNANCE  CANNOT SURVIVE WHEN THEY LIVE IN A BED OF LIES. SO, YOU KNOW, FOR ME IT'S  LOOKING AT THIS AND SAYING,  OKAY, IS THE TAX RATE THE MOST  IMPORTANT THING? IS SOME FALSE ALLEGIANCE TO A  PARTY THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW  WHAT IT STANDS FOR ANYMORE, IS  THAT IMPORTANT? OR IS IT DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY? THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF  DEMOCRATIC SECRETARIES OF STATE  BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT  OBVIOUSLY RUN ELECTIONS, YOU  HAVE TWO CASES, BOTH IN ARIZONA  AND PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE YOU HAVE MASSIVE DENIERS RUNNING FOR  GOVERNOR IN A VERY IMPORTANT  STATE THAT COULD CHANGE THE  OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. THEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE  EVAN McMULLIN IN UTAH RUNNING  AGAINST MIKE REID. THIS IS A REAL SHOCK FOR AN  INDEPENDENT TO BEAT A REPUBLICAN IN A VERY REPUBLICAN STATE  BECAUSE MIKE LEE HAS BEEN PART  OF THIS WHOLE ELECTION DENYING  GROUP. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO STAND UP, SMITH IN ARIZONA AS WELL. >> LOOKING AT THE LAST HEARING,  NOT LOOKING FOR YOU TO GIVE AWAY SECRETS OR NAME
NAMES, BUT THE  HEARINGS YOU'VE HAD BEFORE BUILT ON THEMSELVES, WITH EACH  PROVIDING NEW INFORMATION. HAVING THOSE HEARINGS IN THIS  HIATUS FOR YOU GUYS, HAVE MORE  PEOPLE COME FORWARD, MORE PEOPLE WHO SAW THE INITIAL HEARINGS,  THEY RESONATED WITH THEM, MORE  WITNESSES, MORE INFORMATION  YOU'VE LEARNED BECAUSE OF THE  PREVIOUS HEARINGS? AND WILL WE LEARN THAT ON  THURSDAY? >> WELL, FIRST OFF, YEAH,  ABSOLUTELY. WE'VE HAD MORE PEOPLE COME  FORWARD. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FILL IN GAPS  THAT MAYBE WERE THINGS WE  SUSPECT BUD DIDN'T FULLY KNOW. NOW WE HAVE, YOU KNOW,  CONFIRMATION OF THAT. YOU ALSO THINK ABOUT THE FACT  THAT, LOOK, HERE'S THE REALITY,  THOUGH, PEOPLE LIKE MARK  MEADOWS. DAN SCAVINO, WHO WE KNOW WAS  DONALD TRUMP'S KIND OF TWITTER  WHISPERER, IF YOU WILL, HE WAS  THE GUY DIRECTLY COMMUNICATING  THROUGH TWITTER -- THESE PEOPLE  REFUSED TO COME TO TALK TO US. IT'S HARD TO GET INFORMATION. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THE BEST  WE CAN AROUND THAT, BUT IT'S  VERY EVIDENT NOW THAT THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I THINK  LARGELY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE  WORK WE'VE DONE IF NOT ALL OF  THE WORK WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO,  REALIZED THAT THIS IS A BIG  ISSUE THAN THEY THOUGHT OR MAYBE HAD EVIDENCE FOR, AND SO THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION  MAYBE THAT WE WEREN'T. I THINK WE'VE MADE A COMPELLING  CASE. WE'LL CONTINUE TO. BUT OUR JOB IS COMING TO THE  SUNSET AS WE PRESENT THIS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND IT'S UP TO  JUSTICE TO ACTUALLY DO JUSTICE  HERE. >> ILLINOIS REPUBLICAN

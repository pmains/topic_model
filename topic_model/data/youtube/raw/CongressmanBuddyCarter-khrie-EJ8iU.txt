meanwhile the United States is vowing more Aid to Ukraine 10 billion dollars more of it and is also planning to send 300 million dollars in energy assistance Aid to Moldova a small country sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania this to help them wean off of Reliance on Russian energy Congressman buddy Carter joins me now with his thoughts on this Aid Congressman it's great to have you on the program thank you so much for for being back with me what do you make of this uh additional 10 billion dollars 300 million to Moldova Americans are are pretty torn on on the the exhaustive aid that we've been sending to Ukraine where do you come down on the issue well you're right Americans are torn especially after what we see happening in East Palestine and and the the response there or lack of response if you will but at the same time look we need to make sure that Europe is doing their part with Ukraine as well I'm all for helping Ukraine but at the same time I want to see Europe and what they're doing not only that but you know it is so hypocritical of this Administration I mean we're concerned about Ukraine's border we're concerned about taiwan's border what about our border what about the Southwest border I was there two weeks ago it is a crisis down there we've got to address that as well so the American people there you know look we get it we understand what's happening in Ukraine we understand the importance of it but we also understand that Europe needs to do their part and that if we're going to protect borders we need to protect our own border as well yeah that's uh that's that's been the frustration I think most Americans share is uh no matter where you stand on Aid to Ukraine uh Aid to someone to another country should never take precedent over Aid to Americans in need American aid for Americans in need Congressman Carter East Palestine Joe Biden has already announced he's not even going to bother visiting uh the the the just wrecked City there in East Palestine Ohio uh despite Donald Trump even showing up and and originally wasn't going to provide any Aid to them at all so what does that say about our current Administration where we give no Aid to to distraught cities in America but hundreds of billions of dollars in Aid to to distract countries overseas no question about it that's what's got Americans so upset you know we I again we get it we understand what's going on with Russia and with Ukraine we understand the importance of Taiwan and China but we also want to see that our own people are being taken care of not only in East Palestine but what about what's going on down the Southwest border yeah he went down there after they cleaned it up and he's not this is the sixth time I've been to the border and the eight years that I've been in Congress and Joe Biden's been down there once in the last 40 years while he's been in public service it's just ridiculous well and and you are representing Georgia's First District you know I remind people Georgia's not down at our Southern border so it shouldn't be your responsibility to go down there God bless you for for doing so for at least someone in our government uh is pretending to care but it shouldn't even be a incumbent upon you to go down there yet congressmen and governors from around this from around the nation are having to fly down to to the southern border to assess the damage because our own president won't Congressman I've also got to ask you a lot a point people have been bringing up lately is that we've we've we spent about 2.26 trillion dollars in Afghanistan and that ended up basically being for nothing a lot of Americans concerned that this Aid Ukraine not only could it be used to meet Americans needs like in Ohio also raise the question of how much money would we hypothetically have to spend for this to pay off to to Ukraine's benefit where is there an estimate of how much will be enough has zelinski given us a figure that would would be a cut off to my knowledge he has not and and that is a valid question I think a question that that deserves to be answered um you know does this Administration have any idea how much it's going to take and you know at what point do we say okay that that's it that's all we can do Europe you've got to step up you got to do your part we've done our part all of those are are questions that the American people should have answers to yeah and uh Congressman before before we go I just want to get your thoughts on what we're hearing uh or what we've been hearing from The Wall Street Journal over the weekend coronavirus Origins the U.S energy Department the FBI are all getting on board with the uh what used to be what I was told was a fringe right-wing conspiracy theory some Alex Jones nonsense uh now is being adopted as the position of the U.S energy department and the FBI that this did come from the Wuhan lab is there going to be Justice for this I mean we we have been lied to Time and Again by our government by the CCP that part's not not as new what's going to be done about this now that even our government is saying okay yeah it did come from a lab this is probably a bio weapon yeah yeah well the Department of Defense is finally uh admitting to it it's too little too late is what it is and you know the harm that has been done unfortunately is is not going to be able to to be repaired we understand that but people should have to answer if we if we just ignore this and Let It Go by then shame on us and it will happen again no there should be people answering to this this is why I called for the the firing of Anthony fauci early on I still feel like he should have been fired many many months ago but people need to answer for this there needs to be accountability we need to understand what exactly what has happened and we need to make sure it never happens again so we drag fauci back to Washington for another hearing now that we have these these Revelations I'm all for that why not yeah yeah I think that would be still not responsible for what he did while he was in office yeah it's time to time to put him back in the hot seat maybe we can get uh some more concessions out of him that'd be nice to see for the American people Congressman Carter always great to have you on the program thank you thank you

I have to express my dismay that once again the house Republican majority is putting forward an agenda designed to score points rather than address the very real challenges faced by Americans next week President Biden will return to this chamber for the state of the union and under his leadership house Democrats have lowered costs we've created great paying union jobs and we have made communities safer we've spurred a period of renewed opportunity 10.7 million new jobs the lowest unemployment rate in half a century and wage growth that is outpacing inflation but that work has seemed to have ground to a halt here's what we've seen from the majority over the last month the first bill of the 118th Congress was a bill that helps billionaires Dodge their taxes and added a hundred and fourteen billion dollars to the deficit they continued their assault on reproductive freedom and are threatening economic disaster in order to cut Social Security and Medicare and filling our schedule with Hollow symbolic stunts the American people are in the gop's rear view mirror it's politics over people plain and simple and our constituents and the American people are seeing this a recent National poll found that 73 percent of Americans say House Republicans haven't paid enough attention to the country's most important problems the American people don't see themselves in the Republican agenda and I would ask the majority leader what does he say to them

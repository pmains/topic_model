next week the u.s supreme court will consider some of the most consequential cases of my lifetime right here where i'm standing where roe v wade was decided nearly 50 years ago the justices including our fellow hoosier amy coney barrett will hear arguments about america's fundamental rights including the vital right to life state legislators in indiana and around the country have passed pro-life laws which are now under attack from the radical left right now right now lives are on the line alongside of so many pro-life americans i'm praying that these pro-life protections will be upheld and across the street in congress i'm working every day to defend the unborn and to serve as a voice for the voiceless it's so important that we continue to work together to advance our pro-life agenda despite the challenges we're facing i am confident our commitment to life will prevail

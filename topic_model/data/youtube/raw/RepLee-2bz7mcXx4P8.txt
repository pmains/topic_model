I rise in strong opposition to HJ Res 42 which is really another baseless attack on the poor on low-income individuals on the unemployed drug-testing unemployed individuals is downright wrong let me be clear this resolution is another way for Republicans to stop workers from claiming their right to unemployment benefits it also is a scare tactics that flies in the face of facts at first there is no evidence that people who receive public assistance use drugs any more frequently than those in the general population and unemployment compensation mind you is not public assistance by unnecessarily drug testing jobless workers we are throwing them out in the cold when they are simply trying to get back on their feet mr. speaker workers receive unemployment benefits because they worked hard they played by the rules they were laid off through no fault of their own more importantly working people have earned their right to apply for these benefits they pay into the program their constitutional rights should not be violated I also know that people want to work people don't want to be on unemployment insurance they want to provide for themselves and their families and let me remind you there's an opioid and heroin drug epidemic in this country and it not only affects Democrats this drug crisis is affecting Republicans independents everyone and yes once again you're throwing them out into the cold instead of passing this appalling and it is appalling this resolution we should be expanding job training unemployment benefits for all and provide resources for drug treatment it's hard to believe to provide to excuse me hard to believe that you want to punish people in fact what this resolution really does it punishes people for working that's really a shame and disgrace if I strongly oppose this bill I urge my colleagues to vote no and also urge you to encourage people to work to provide those job training resources and drug testing and drug abuse excuse me resources for our mental health centers for our drug counseling centers and for everyone who needs treatment rather than drug testing to keep them from getting a job thank you

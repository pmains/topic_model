Mr Speaker I rise today to address the critical need to pass the USMC a a trade agreement for the 21st century the u.s. MCA would expand our markets add sixty three billion dollars to the economy and create 176 thousand new jobs with thousands of those jobs coming to Minnesota when I'm back in Minnesota's 8th congressional district meeting farmers workers and business men and women alike I am often asked why Congress has not yet passed the u.s. MCA even though it was signed by the president nearly a year ago and my answer is this if we voted on the u.s. mc8 today it would pass the house with strong bipartisan support unfortunately Democratic leadership refusal to bring this critical trade agreement to the House floor for a vote continues and uncertainty remains for millions of Americans pursuing partisan impeachment rather than clinching bipartisan wins for the American worker is not what a majority of the American people sent us here to do enough is enough I urge Democratic leadership to stop playing politics and join the rest of us and working for the American people the time to pass the US MCA is now Mr Speaker I yield back

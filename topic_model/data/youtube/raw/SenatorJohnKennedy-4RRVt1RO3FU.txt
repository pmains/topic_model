senator from louisiana thank you mr president mr president i think as we're all aware president biden has decided to withdraw american troops from afghanistan in september now some agree with his decisions decision some disagree with his decision the bill that i'm about to talk about has nothing to do with the merits of his decision there are about eighteen thousand not eighteen hundred eighteen thousand interpreters and members of their immediate family who helped our troops fight the war in afghanistan against the taliban and against isis they are at risk there was an article in a leading newspaper mr president yesterday i'll read you the headline it says afghan government could collapse six months after u.s withdrawal um these eighteen thousand interpreters and their immediate families who have helped american troops would like to get out we have a visa process which is going very very slowly we will not be able to get all of those 18 000 human beings out before the withdrawal in september that much is clear again my bill has nothing to do with the merits or lack thereof of the war my my bill would direct the secretary of defense and the secretary of state to develop a plan to relocate the afghan interpreters and their immediate families that want to get out and bring them to america now obviously before we bring them to america those that want to come we have to vet them that's part of the problem the vetting process right now is very slow rather than try to put together a bill that would set forth a specific plan to address this this i consider it a crisis if you're one of those 18 000 human beings my bill would just direct the defense department and the state department to come up with a plan to present to us within 30 days now my guess and it's only a guess is that the state state and defense are going to come up with some plan to move those of the 18 000 who want to leave afghanistan to a safe third place other than america so that we can continue to properly vet folks before they come into america and i suggest we do need to properly vet them but i also suggest mr president that number one this is about it's about right and wrong these people helped americans and they helped american troops and we owe them and we don't want to see them massacred and number two if we allow them to be massacred i think it's going to send a message to to many people throughout the world that loyalty to america means nothing absolutely nothing so in a nutshell this this bill would ask our defense department and our state department the next 30 days to give a plan to congress to properly vet and allow any of these 18 000 interpreters and their families who helped american troops come to america and with that mr president as if in legislative session i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of s 2216 which was introduced earlier today further i ask unanimous consent mr president that the bill be considered read a third time in past and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table is there objection mr president senator from kentucky reserving the right to object in the first few decades after the revolutionary war america was under siege our capital was ransacked but i don't recall in reading history that any of our founding fathers said that they would flee the country or leave and give up on the quest for liberty the quest for liberty requires fighting by the people who have been given their liberty the people who we have helped to get their liberty you can say the people in afghanistan helped us or you can also say we helped liberate them as well they've been free for twenty years it seems like it might precipitate the overcoming of the taliban if you take eighteen thousand of the most westernized those who speak english and you say flee flee flee the end is coming well guess what the end comes quicker if they all leave so i would encourage them rather to stay and fight i think it would be good to have many english speakers in afghanistan the future of afghanistan could be a bright future but they're going to have to fight for it and ultimately it is their fight and if we offer easy escape and easy plans to leave the country we are assuring the defeat of the people who are our friends in afghanistan so i object to this uh piece of legislation mr president objection is heard from louisiana mr president i respect my colleague and i certainly respect his my right to object um i disagree we're unaware of what's going on in afghanistan the afghan government is in a bitter fight to the end with the taliban and the taliban's winning and the taliban is ruthless and they're going to murder these people they're going to murder them and the blood's going to be on american hands if we don't do something to help them my my proposal would not have required any of these 18 000 afghans who stood with american troops to beat back the taliban and to beat back isis they stood with us at their own risk at the risk of their own kids and their own spouses and we decided to leave i'm not saying that's right or wrong i have my own opinions but that's not what this bill's about and we owe it to these 18 000 people to offer them a chance to live and if we don't do something they're going to be butchered they're going to be gutted like a deer like a deer and the blood's going to be on american hands and the whole world is going to take notice there's right and wrong in this world there's politics there's a time for it but there's a time to do the right thing and the right thing is to help save these human lives who fought for america and their families and their children

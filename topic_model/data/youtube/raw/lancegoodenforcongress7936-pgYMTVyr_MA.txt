Democrats campaigned on doing something and since they've taken office they won't even acknowledge that we have a crisis at the border that's why Donald Trump got elected the last time that's why I think you'll get reelected this next time that's why I think Republicans will take the house back over but when it's important for the American people to know that they have a very distinct choice between more of the same from the Democrats or new leadership in the house of this president said he would protect American lives abroad and American interests and he's done that and executing that general was absolutely the right thing to do it should have been done long ago the president Trump makes promises and he delivers and he's promising that we're gonna win this war with China this trade war and I believe him he has made good on every promise he's made so far he will do the same on this way I wonder if they quit prediction quick correction you got on election night Donald Trump gets reelected and today today today is a milestone that Democrats will regret Thank You Lance [Music]

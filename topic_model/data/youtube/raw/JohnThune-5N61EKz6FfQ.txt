thank you Mr President Mr President is a resident of a rural State expanding rural Broadband access has long been a priority of mine and I'm not the only one over the years Congress has dedicated significant resources to closing the digital divide and that has been especially true over the past three years Congress has appropriated a lot a lot of money for Broadband lately a whopping 79 billion dollars to be precise dedicated solely to broadband related projects 79 billion dollars on top of the billions of dollars the Federal Communications Commission disperses annually under its Universal service fund that is an unprecedented amount of money in fact with that much money we ought to be able to deliver gold and diamond lace Broadband to every household in the United States but Mr President appropriating money is not enough we could throw trillions of dollars at the rural Broadband problem and still not close the digital divide because all the money in the world is useless if it's not being spent the right way as I said we have enough money now that we ought to be deploying gold and diamond lace Broadband across the country but I have serious questions about whether this money is actually going to meaningful is going to meaningfully move us toward closing the digital divide the money that we currently have as much as it is is spread out over 15 separate agencies and 133 programs 133 programs to say that that is not conducive to a coherent rule Broadband strategy would be an understatement now the Lion's Share of the funding does go through one agency the national telecommunications and Information Administration or ntia but it is an agency with a very poor record of efficiently dispersing Broadband funding the last time Congress provided ntia with a big infusion of broadband funding by the way a fraction of the funding it's now responsible for the agency struggled with implementation and ended up over building existing Broadband networks resulting in billions of taxpayer dollars being spent with little to show and I've seen very little to convince me that ntia is likely to do much better this time around in July of last year ntia called for volunteers volunteers to help determine how to allocate one and a half billion dollars that Congress had provided to ntia to improve Broadband access volunteers Mr President and yet Congress has now put the agency in charge of Distributing the 42.5 billion dollars in the Broadband Equity access and deployment program I am deeply concerned that without serious oversight NTI will make and is already making similar mistakes when managing its current Broadband programs which is why earlier this month I began an oversight effort to review the numerous Federal Broadband programs oversight of how Federal Broadband dollars are being spent is necessary to ensure that agencies aren't misusing billions of taxpayer dollars and most importantly to make sure the funding is going to the areas that are actually unserved I've already requested input from a diverse group of stakeholders to identify ways that we can improve Broadband programs and Broadband policy more generally as we head into the 118th Congress and I've requested that federal agencies provide information on their efforts to improve Broadband infrastructure citing which is a key component of deploying Broadband Networks in the new year I will work on compiling these responses and presenting stakeholders concerns to ntia the Federal Communications Commission the Department of Agriculture and the treasury Department and if changes need to be made to the programs Congress has established I will do everything that I can to hold Congress and federal agencies accountable for making those changes so that all of these programs work as effectively as possible and as Congress intended this present to expand rural Broadband access and actually close the digital divide it's not enough to just appropriate money we also need to make sure that money is being spent in the right way and I am committed to doing everything I can to ensure that the money that has been appropriated for Rural Broadband actually goes to expanding access to those who are currently unserved Mr President I yield the floor

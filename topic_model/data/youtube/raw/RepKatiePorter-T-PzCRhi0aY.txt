we've heard a lot about future plans for investment in renewable energy today ms watkins shell's 2020 annual report called for between 19 and 22 billion dollars in near-term spending i'm representing that with this container of m ms each m m represents about 50 million dollars in spending ms watkins how much is shell said it will spend in the near term on oil gas and chemical operations i think you just said we're going to be spending between 18 and 20 billion dollars this year that's near term on total spending how much on oil gas and chemical operations we're going to be spending well according to your annual report you said you're going to spend 16 to 17 billion for oil gas and chemical with another three billion dollars for marketing how much is shell spending to spend on renewable energy this year we'll be spending between two and three billion dollars two and three billion on renewables and energy solutions in your testimony you said quote meeting the demand for reliable energy will simultaneously addressing climate change is a huge undertaking and one of the defining challenges of our time shell has made these promises before shell pledged to spend 6 billion between 2017 and 2020 on renewable energy how much of that did shell actually spend the answer is about half ms watkins does this look like a huge undertaking to you congresswoman what i can tell you is that um there needs to be both a demand and a supply of clean energy which is why we're working very closely with our customers so that that demand increases over time and we are to me this does not look like an adequate response to one of the defining challenges of our time this is green washing shell is trying to fool people into thinking it's addressing the climate crisis for what it's actually doing is to continue to put money into fossil fuels mr summers do you recognize the following statement banning federal leasing and development on federal lands and waters would derail decades of u.s energy progress i do congresswoman that's your statement how many of the department of interiors approved and ready to drill permits are currently unused congresswoman it takes a long time to develop these leases that uh i appreciate that mr summers i'm just asking how many permits are unused congresswoman uh i i think there's a fundamental misunderstanding as to how the claiming mr summers there are 7 700 permits unused how many acres of public land are already leased by fossil fuel companies and not even used yet just available or drilling whenever you decide congresswoman again i i think you have a fundamental misunderstanding as to how this process works and the time and resources reclaiming my time the answer is 13.9 million acres to visualize how much land that is if each grain of rice were one acre that would be 479 pounds of rice the american petroleum institute even opposed pausing more leasing on our lands that even sued to stop it because apparently this acreage wasn't enough mr worth you serve on the american petroleum institute's executive committee do you support a pause on new oil and gas leases on federal land congresswoman access to uh resource in this country is essential to ensure the energy security of our country and um mr waller do you support a pause the administration it's our hope that the that the uh pause ends soon we think it's important to go thank you for your answer the answer is no mr woods do you support a pause on new federal and gas leases no miss watkins do you support a pause on new federal and gas leases no i do not because i think it's important you already have 13.9 million acres this is equivalent to maryland and new jersey combined how much more do you need how much more acreage you have two of our 50 states at a price that makes the louisiana purchase look like a rip-off and you're not even using it what more do you need iowa colorado virginia our public land belongs to the american people not to big oil when you lobby and you sue so that you could take more of our public land you're saying too much is never enough the american people are tired of this charade

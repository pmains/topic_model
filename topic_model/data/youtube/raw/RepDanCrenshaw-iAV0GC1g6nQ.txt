we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw so i'm here with chairman ajit pai you are chairman of the fcc and thank you for coming by the way i really appreciate it thanks for having me on so i'll tell the audience a little bit about you really quick uh you were the son of immigrants from india but you grew up in kansas uh you went from you went to harvard for your undergrad nobody's ever heard of that so who cares and uh the university of chicago school of law to get your law degree i presume and you go there for the weather i can tell you that yeah wise weather very windy and cold um but although boston is not much different so um you were appointed fcc commissioner by president obama and then selected as chairman by president trump uh you've worked for the department of justice a lawyer for the telecom industry the senate judiciary committee you first joined the fcc in 2007 and um you've been working there for several years as a council until and then you returned to private practice in 2011 and i assume at that point you were appointed as commissioner what is the difference between commissioner and chairman it's a big difference every chairman is also a commissioner there are five commissioners of the fcc but in terms of the functions it's vastly different every now and then i think back to when i was a commissioner and you don't set the agenda you don't oversee all of the agencies 1400 staff so it's a much more challenging job being in this corner you're a big deal now you're a bigger deal now than before that's what people need to know yeah for better worse it's a much more prominent position so what's the fcc so the federal communications commission great question uh is was set up in 1934 by congress to oversee the communications industry and over the years it's changed a lot back in the early days it was to regulate am radio and fm radio to get tv up and running now it's satellite cable the internet things like that okay it's a big job so you know i'm a millennial i'm an elder millennial so i have sort of a foot in the kind of gen x generation and a foot in the millennial generation i grew up without computers and internet and but i still have them at a fairly young age and so it's it's kind of an interesting uh place that i'm in and i know a lot of my fellow millennials and to include gen xers probably um we care about innovation right we we want everything on our phones i want my health care on my phone i want to see my doctor through my phone i want to order my food on my phone everything is is surrounding this this sort of innovative capacity the gig economy is something we all like quite a bit want the with the ability to own our own labor and sell it and not have people get in the way so what is the fcc's role in that and and how do how do you guys see innovation what are you excited about and and how do you regulate it and make sure that it well isn't hindered by over regulation it's an excellent point uh so we see our role as twofold we want to put in place the building blocks for uh entrepreneurs to be able to innovate whether it's the airwaves that wireless entrepreneurs want to use whether it's the optical fiber that allows the building of next generation broadband networks that's one piece of it and the other piece of it is from a consumer's perspective we're always trying to think about where do consumers want to use this connectivity it could be telemedicine or precision agriculture online education or gaming we essentially want american citizens to take charge of their own future and increasingly in the 21st century that means access to what i call digital opportunity so making sure that every american has access to these technologies is a really important job for us yeah what about memes are memes part of this innovation they have not yet been although i do tend to use them myself on twitter and i've certainly been the recipient of many of them oh yeah me too yeah they're a hoot it's sort of weird isn't it when you get friends from grade school sending you a meme like hey i just saw you on the internet what's your favorite meme of yourself oh my god so there's one least favorite and favorite my most favorite uh which my staff won't let me put on my twitter account as some guy came up with a caricature of me i know this job would be like yeah but they some guy came up with a meme of me as darth maul from the star wars fields i have you know bright orange skin i've got these horns coming out of my head but i'm still wearing a suit some sort of civilized looking and civilized talking about how i'm about to destroy the internet and all that kind of stuff right that was one of my favorite oh yeah destroy the internet and i want to get to that in a second because that that involves probably your stance on net neutrality right generally speaking so we want to illuminate that for for the viewers because that's a it's it's not as simple as being for free internet or against free internet and this ties into the innovation discussion uh quite a bit but but before we get to net neutrality i do want to i want to zero in on on innovation and i guess my question is what generally works and what doesn't i mean how how can you know we said i'm a republican i'm a very conservative republican it doesn't mean i'm an anarchist okay i believe in some government regulation but i believe in the right touch of government regulations so i mean can you explain what that looks like what's the philosophy that's exactly right setting the broad contours for competition and innovation and then letting the private sector innovate so for many years before i got into office what was in vogue at the fcc across republican and democratic administrations was to pick out particular technologies or particular companies or just sectors of the economy and specifically encourage them uh to get a leg up in the marketplace and one of the things that we've tried to do over the last couple of years is to say we don't pretend to have a monopoly on wisdom three bureaucrats out of five at the fcc should not be setting policy for millions hundreds of millions of american consumers and so instead what we say is let's let all of the technologies all these companies have a full and fair chance to compete and let the aggregated decisions by consumers across the country decide who wins and who doesn't yeah because there's a knowledge problem right i mean you you sort of mention this there's five people how can you possibly have the knowledge of the market and i you know you've been in the bureaucracy for for a while now and is this a broader problem not just with the fcc but this general belief that a that a small group of people can actually have the proper amount of knowledge and you know essentially omniscience to to properly regulate pick winners and losers and you know and drive the market for where it needs to be especially with something as dynamic as technology absolutely right and you probably see this in congress a lot but it's difficult to do because there's always going to be somebody who comes to congress and says hey you know what if you give me the keys to the kingdom we will deliver incredible value and we'll give you all the credit for it but that necessarily means shutting out everybody else from the marketplace that's not what we want to do so whether it is encouraging electric utilities to get into the broadband game through our funding program whether it's encouraging innovation in space we've been the first fcc to approve low earth orbit satellites to get into the internet access game getting more unlicensed spectrum out there for wi-fi innovators to use without having to come beg for approval from the fcc right we want everyone to enter this marketplace and compete that is ultimately when consumers are better off it's not always an easy case to make but we're determined to make it you know what people don't realize either is that the ones making the biggest case for more regulation tend to be the biggest companies is that is that something you see quite a bit i cannot even begin i mean i don't know how long this podcast is but we could give you a lot it's incredible that's one of the things that i think americans need to understand is that heavy-handed regulation tends to benefit the bigger companies the most they're the ones that can throw a fleet of lawyers or a bunch of accountants or a bunch of compliance officers at the problem it's those smaller entrepreneurs who don't have the resources to figure out what the fcc thinks about this or that issue are the folks and you said you had at least a bunch of examples so let's let's go with one or two oh my gosh so many of them so i mean we saw this in the context of net neutrality that some of the bigger companies a couple of them said well okay we can live with these regulations but you didn't hear from say paladin wireless in royston georgia or aristotle wireless in little rock arkansas i talked to some of these smaller companies they said look the same person who's building these networks is the person who's handling the customer service calls is the same person who's gonna have to file these reports of the fcc we have limited resources here and literally every dollar we have to divert to washington-based compliance is a dollar that does not go to connecting our customers and is there a is there a tendency in the let's call it the bureaucratic state or the administrative state or the executive branch it's all really the same thing um is there a tendency to this is this is my take on it as i saw it a little bit in the military as well which is listen you give us a mission so our goal every single day is to add new things to that mission and so it's it's not it doesn't come with ill intent right this this natural tendency to over regulate but it's also not surprising given given human nature um you know you you you put people in charge of regulating something and it's you know and it seems that the the federal agencies in charge of these things at no point do they think well i think we're done regulating let's just monitor yeah it doesn't ever seem to be the case they're always looking for new reasons to add a new rule here and there and uh maybe it's well intentioned and maybe it's even the right thing to do i'm not saying it's not but it just adds to this complex web where again the big companies can figure it out and small companies can't and you know it sort of chips away at the overall you know innovative capacity of the market and ability to enter the market i mean is that is that fairly accurate i think there is something to that and a close cousin to that would be the fact that the most powerful force in government at least in my view at the end the from the administrative states perspective is inertia that rules that are on the books remain on the books simply because they've always been on the books even if the marketplace has changed a lot so we hear from broadcast radio companies all the time for example look we're now competing against google i mean pandora and spotify and google and facebook and podcasts and t all these things are melded together but the fcc's regulations still presume that we're the only game in town when it comes to audio entertainment that's just not the case anymore and so you should get rid of some of these regulations and for many years they were hitting a brick wall but i approach it as somebody who embraces technology and dynamic change and we want our rules to reflect where the marketplace is not where it was in 1975 right um and so speaking of using older regulations to to i guess implement new policy let's talk about net neutrality yeah when you hear the words net neutrality that sounds like something we should all be in favor of that's a fantastic marketing i mean yeah i'll give it to the democrats they're very good at this um but it's it's not exactly a debate between free internet and not free internet is it i mean so just tell us tell us what they mean when they're when they're talking about net neutrality it's difficult to say because what they mean changes uh depending on what type of argument they're trying to advance but the basic question is how do you want the fcc to regulate the internet do you want it to be regulated like a slow moving utility do you want it to be as fast as amtrak as innovative as your post office as popular as your dmv or do you want it to be a more market-based approach now to president clinton's credit back in the 1990s he and a republican congress decided we're going to take option two the market-based approach we're not going to treat it like mobile the telephone companies and as a result of that decision from 1996 until 2015 we saw the internet explode i mean it's hard for people to remember because we live in the day-to-day but because of that decision companies were able to innovate without seeking government permission and the internet economy in the united states became the envy of the world and so to me at least in 2015 when these heavy-handed utility style regulations were put in place there was no problem to solve it was more of a political decision and that's because so they they chose to regulate it under under different provision can you explain that exactly so uh historically it had been regulated under what's called title one of the communications act a more market-based approach the advocates in the 2015 decided nope we wanted to be regulated under title ii of the communications act and title ii was developed in 1934 to regulate mob bell the 18t telephone monopoly yeah and so whether or not you were a big company like a comcast or verizon or a small company like paladin wireless or aristotle you're going to face the same onslaught of title ii regulations and to me at least that was the wrong way to go if you there's a bad apple in the bunch single out that bad apple but don't presume that every apple and barrel is a bad one and we saw the results of that decision in the subsequent two years this infrastructure investment went down don't regulate by anecdote yeah which is i think a broader problem in the regulatory environment right you see a problem you can tell a really compelling story about it it was so unfair it was wrong it was unjust so we got to revolutionize the whole system and i i think that speaks to a real problem with with gratitude and uh and well and educating ourselves on why things worked in the first place you know there's this real tendency in today's america to to throw the baby out with the bath water right to to you know you want to keep reaching higher right and so let's let's let's look at it like you stacked a bunch of boxes to keep reaching higher towards innovation and then people are mad because you can't quite reach that next level so so you want to so you want to undercut all the boxes that you're standing on i mean you're just you know it's a or the three-legged stool argument and it's very frustrating to watch that's just my general observation anyway but especially in this space if you look at the folks who really pioneered some of the innovations i mean every single person now is walking around with one of these smartphones that is because of the amazing decisions and innovations that were pioneered by people flying by the seat of their pants in the early days of wireless i mean it wasn't the government that sat there and decided okay this is how wireless technologies are going to work this is how lte is going to be deployed company companies and individuals had to do that over time and these networks don't have to be built and these innovations don't have to happen it's private initiative right that makes it work it always is and um but going back to net neutrality then let's let's steel man the other side's argument why why what did what problems did they see that they wanted fixed in 2015 so you can look in the hundreds of pages of that decision in 2015 and you will not find any concrete evidence of market failure they will come up with a case out in 2005 out of north carolina involving an internet service provider very few of any have heard of they'll come up with another case in 2009 but there was no market failure justifying yeah downside of these regulations now what the that order does say is well internet service providers could do this or they could do that and you know to me at least always assume the worst about the private sector exactly and so especially in a sector as dynamic and ever-changing as the internet the last thing we want to do is essentially block off potential uh the marketplace to say okay this is how the internet's going to be forevermore and we're going to regulate it accordingly it's just strange i've always wondered why this became such a rallying cry from from the democratic party you know it's um sometimes i get it right like sometimes i look at what they want to do i think the way they want to do it is wrong but at least i understand the the direction they want to go let's say healthcare for instance all right i think the way they want to get to healthcare for everybody is wrong but at least i understand the end goal right that makes sense to me of course i think we all want that but this one really doesn't and i don't i don't see the i don't never saw the purpose in cloaking this this new regulatory environment as internet freedom when it's actually completely the opposite and i couldn't agree more and what's been especially disappointing is some of the misinformation that was out there that has led many people especially those under the age of 30 to think that the internet really was at stake it might not work if we made this it's incredible to me just they're they're playing to the exact audience that well effectively i started out with right the millennials want more innovation how do we get there yeah and the democrats were quick to say well the internet's under threat there's always this false premise right for for to justify extreme regulation you you need some kind of extreme premise you know the world's ending in 12 years so right have only wind and solar uh you know everybody we're dying on the streets we need medicare for all uh some kind of the internet is at stake we need net neutrality and you know and and people say oh god the internet's at stake what are you going to do about it republicans and we're like hold on hold on we actually disagree with the premise here yeah the internet's been working pretty well for quite a while and here's all the proof but it's incredible at least in december of 2017 when we made this decision there were a precious few who had occupied the public square who even wanted to hear the other side of the debate i mean it's if you told me strange ten years ago everyone from bette midler uh to politicians are going to be hate tweeting you i just like about issues arcane is title one versus title two telecom regulation it's just it's surreal but that's the situation we're in right i'm glad to say that as a result of our decision now speeds are up over 60 percent since we made our decision on average for fixed broadband infrastructure investment is up and as you pointed out that issue is receded i think in part because people have come to realize wow you know what maybe we were so old to bill the goods the internet hasn't ended it's not going to work one word at a time as the senate democratic caucus twitter account put it in february of 2018. we don't have to pay five dollars per tweet and it's amazing to see when i do these college campus town halls now that students i think have a more nuanced view of things right yeah we shouldn't have listened to these tales of woe from politicians trying to peddle something what do you think about so there was some bipartisan legislation that would sort of take some of the goals of net neutrality like limiting throttling for instance um you know i'll let you explain exactly what they are because i don't to i want i don't want to do an injustice to to what the terms were but can you can you get into that for a second say what because there are some things in net neutrality that they claim they wanted to prevent and we actually didn't disagree with it was just the way they wanted to do it was just wrong so this is the dirty little secret about this issue and i'm only going to let you know so don't tell anybody okay this issue could be solved stop recording just kidding this issue could be solved with a one-page bill that would get 99 of support of republicans and democrats in congress no blocking of lawful content on the internet right throttling of content no any competitive paid prioritization transparency every internet service provider has to disclose how it does business i mean i just described a bill that no very few people could reasonably oppose yeah but the problem is that certain politicians are so wedded to title ii in particular because they want all of the regulations that come along with that right and that is very backward looking i mean this is 85 years ago now we're talking about the regulations being developed we really want to regulate that internet just like we regulated uh phone companies in the 1930s i don't can't explain why but that's really what they want to do and it's incredible would anyone say that landline telephones are as innovative as wireless phones it just does but part of the reason is we had a very different regulatory regime over the years yeah i mean most millennials don't even have uh landline phones we don't like the calls that come in speaking of which are you guys doing anything to to to limit robo calls oh it's the number one consumer protection project this drives me crazy i got one today actually and yeah every now and then i you just play along and answer just to see what's going to happen it's just great but uh but so we've been pulling out all the stops on the regulatory side making it easier for companies to block spoofed calls uh we've demanded that the phone industry adopt what's called a caller id authentication framework essentially authenticating every phone number okay and on the back end we've been going after robocallers through enforcement actions but this is a problem that this is actually not an endangered rally this is the number one category of consumer complaints we've gotten for years and so we're really going after some of these folks as hard as we can great good good deal so innovation's going up investment in infrastructure is going up i said the internet's faster than it used to be yeah uh robo calls are going down okay what about 5g where where are we at on 5g and what is that what does that look like for america so we're doing well 5g as your listeners probably knows the next generation of wireless connectivity they're probably familiar with 4g lte 5g if anything is going to be even better 100 times faster speeds much lower latency which is the responsiveness of the network and it's going to enable applications some of which we can't even dream of artificial intelligence uh virtual reality all those things flying cars uh maybe if you're a fan of back to the future part of what's uber is doing with uh some of this so yeah it sounds crazy but know who knows i mean ten years ago people thought you'd be crazy for saying driverless cars so yeah here we are so yeah um but so at the fcc we've adopted something called the 5g fast plan which folks can find at fcc.gov 5g and essentially involves getting more airwaves out there a spectrum for companies to use and also more infrastructure wireless infrastructure and fiber to carry that wireless traffic the early indicators are good we're making progress but part of the issue is that there are other countries china in particular that really want to take the lead in 5g they saw that the success we had in 4g they want to claim that success for themselves so it's really been a pitched battle so far how are you involved in the the issues surrounding china and huawei and zte as we try to limit their investment because there's potential national security concerns but frankly just economic security concerns as well so can you talk about that for a second definitely this is something we take seriously and the fcc has a front row seat at that table in fact about a year ago i proposed to ban the use of fcc funding from being spent by recipients here in the united states on any equipment or services that might present a national security threat and on november 22nd the fcc will be voting on my plan to formally bar them from spending that money on companies like huawei and zte and to me at least given how transformative 5g is going to be it's going to power our industries it's going to light up our appliances and devices we don't want to think about security as an afterthought we can't take a risk and hope for the best and especially to the extent the chinese government has made clear recently that they're willing to use their leverage over things like basketball and taiwanese flag emojis when it comes to our 5g networks some of which might be near sensitive installations we cannot take a risk like that what do you with with trade relations with china the way they are right now what do you see in the technology space happening part of the problem is the chinese don't play by the same rules we do they pick national champions in this case huawei and zte they subsidize those champions when those chant of the companies are bidding on contracts in foreign countries yeah they're also the department of justice has announced numerous cases in which they have stolen our intellectual property and incorporated that into their own companies and so in many cases they don't play uh fairly in the sandbox so to speak and from our perspective at least we're not saying this to advance our own domestic competitors in fact there is no us-based supplier like huawei or cte it's pretty much just erickson nokia and samsung two european and one asian competitor and so our position is simply there's too much of a security risk here and i know there are larger trade issues going on but i'm focused like a laser beam on security i mean if security of our networks cannot be insured there's no way to proceed that's the base level expectation every american citizen should have but do you worry that our some of our telecom companies do you worry that their supply chains are very deeply intertwined into the asian market and what do you see there i do worry and that's why uh looking forward at least we've banned the use of that funding as i described but we're also looking backward to see if they've incorporated any huawei or zte gear in their networks already and to see how we can finance the removal of that equipment the other thing we don't have jurisdiction over companies that do business abroad but one of the things i have pointed out is that some of the same companies especially the silicon valley companies have been advocating for internet openness here in the united states they should think about how they do business in china for example constructing a search engine that doesn't allow chinese citizens to access certain terms like tiananmen square or apple for example removing the taiwanese flag emoji from ios devices i mean those are the kinds of things that you know as somebody who cherishes free speech not just as a constitutional guarantee but as a cultural value that's something that's really important to me one thing one thing we talk a lot about i think it's a bipartisan concern is the rural areas and how they get access to broadband and 5g and all the wonderful things that we have in the city although i would argue that oftentimes i don't have great coverage in the city but that's fine what are you doing about it we're working on it um but so so but when we say that i don't think everybody understands what we mean uh can you explain what would it mean to actually improve capabilities in the rural areas of america it would mean a lot for our country and i say that as somebody who grew up in a rural area a small town of about 10 000 people three hours south of kansas city two hours from wichita there are many places like my hometown that just don't have the same access that people in bigger cities do and that over time creates a bunch of problems it means that farmers can't use technological tools for perceived agriculture that means that doctors can't extend their expertise through telemedicine right that means that teachers can't download and students can't upload their homework as quickly it has all these effects and over time it does create a perception in rural america that they're just two different countries here that we don't have the same rights and potential that everybody else does but what does it mean in practice does it mean putting more cell phone towers up does it mean laying down fiber optic cable i guess you know on a practical level what does it mean it means all of those things it means making sure that there's a business case for deploying that infrastructure that's going to connect people it could be an optical fiber line and parts of alaska where there's permafrost and you can't lay fiber it could mean a fixed wireless or satellite connection right could anywhere in the country it could mean well so what is government's role in that does it require taxpayer investment does it require a different regulatory environment what do we what do we do up here in congress it means both actually those are the two key tools in the toolbox one is updating our rules so that any company anywhere in the country has a stronger incentive to compete but we recognize there's some parts of the country that simply will never find a business case for deployment and there the sec has about a nine billion dollar fund called the universal service fund that we've been we've reformed over the last two years under my administration to target unserved parts of the country so we want to make sure that whether it's a tribal reservation or a rural area that simply hasn't known opportunity we want to make sure that they have infrastructure as well and are we making progress on that we are here absolutely in fact just yesterday uh we announced that we're dedicating about 21 million dollars to connect parts of the idaho panhandle and spokane county done similar announcements around the country and even though it's not going to make the front pages of the new york times and the cable news networks are never going to highlight it right there are thousands more americans and i've met some of them who are getting high-speed access for the first time and it's hard to overstate what a big difference this makes in the lives of those folks yeah absolutely i mean we talked about the gig economy before um the way i think you have a phrase for for that is it wait i had it written down somewhere i'm going to look it up but the democratizing oh the democratization of entrepreneurship there we go yeah yeah it's something i believe a lot in is that there's so many good ideas out there and increasingly in the 21st century for those ideas to gain expression in the wider economy and society you've got to have that digital connection otherwise they just wither on the vine and those have been the most inspiring stories these entrepreneurs i meet chelsea pickner in sioux falls south dakota who started a fashion business now gets customers from all 50 states and around the world i mean those are the that is the american dream in the 21st century but it requires that broadband infrastructure for that dream to find uh finds uh reality right exactly i mean we want the ability to own our own labor sell our own labor not have any anybody else get in the way um and i think that's a really cool thing especially if you're you know if maybe you're outside the norm in some way or outside the cities in some way there's not that many job opportunities you can you can operate within the economy and it's it's it's a pretty amazing deal you can get your health care that way too absolutely right what kind of what kind of innovations are you seeing that we've mentioned it a few times already but the telemedicine market yeah so right now we're in the first stages of the telemedicine telehealth revolution which involves essentially getting hospitals uh broadband connections in order to better serve patients and so i've we've seen for example the cleveland clinic they have a mobile stroke unit that because of 4g lte connections to the hospital they're able to decrease the amount of time it takes to assess and stabilize a stroke patient by several about 26 minutes which is a huge deal yeah i visited some schools that have broadband connections that allow students to get a telehealth visit without having parents having to take time off work but increasingly in the future healthcare is going to become completely inverted by which i mean patients will get healthcare outside of the uh healthcare facility yeah it's at their home at their work using wireless sensors and things like that so we started a pilot program to encourage that kind of innovation so if you're a diabetic and your blood sugar goes down your health care provider could tell you hey look you know you need to take your medicine same thing with heart attack patients that we've seen now that using artificial intelligence and wireless connections you can really figure out if somebody's at risk for a heart attack well before that mi actually materializes right we're scratching the surface in terms of telemedicine and that's good to hear i think we need to promote that more i mean when we talk about the problems with the healthcare market that that the problem can actually be focused on one thing which is price and cost and we we do pay more than other developed countries and last time i checked the only thing that has ever driven prices down without hurting the supply of the good or service that we're talking about is the free market more price or more competition more choice and more technological innovation so exactly you know i i worry greatly about a lot of proposals that would really effectively disincentivize technological innovation especially in the healthcare market uh because we see new technologies coming out all the time that really reduce costs and we have to allow that that kind of innovation to happen i could agree more and if i could make a pitch one of the things that is holding television medicine back right now is the fact that there's state-by-state licensing of medical professionals and i consistently hear that from some doctors i've visited some of these facilities they're doing great work but they'll say we can't serve patients just across the border right can you do something about that and the value is shown in the va facilities i've now visited va facilities from boise idaho to providence rhode island and to me at least the veterans especially who are getting mental health consultations through telemedicine it is a game changer for them because congress passed a law last year to get rid of that va system interstate licensing so if you know anyone in congress who can pioneer a law like that let me know but no it really makes a difference i remember in lacanta florida i met a guy named gordon who was a vietnam veteran and i asked his daughter who took him to this visit what does it mean to you to be able to have access in this rural community to some of these great mental health experts in the university of pittsburgh i think it was and she said it has added years to his life and how do you think there's so many other folks out there who could benefit from those services yeah that's exactly right and again i talk about my generation a lot what do we like to see and i think ideally we would want our health care to be to be really encompassed on our cell phone you know that's what we want i want to be able to choose my doctor on my phone i want to look at my you know we have we have direct primary care systems in america we're trying to we're looking at ways to emphasize that model a lot more get it more widespread because really you're just talking about a flat fee with your doctor you can engage in telemedicine with that doctor and uh you finally have a doctor-patient relationship and you have choice and you have price competition uh you know these models are out there they work and again if we're looking at regulating things properly why not look at what has worked what has driven costs down while keeping quality high and uh and build upon that you know i'm always so i i'm always so taken aback by the by the tendency in washington to throw away what has worked um presume that everything is a disaster and then and then completely revolutionize it uh and put us on a new path which uh with which inevitably has much more government intervention and when that doesn't work come back with an even more we need more power we need more power right we promised to do this for you the other guys wouldn't let us so but now we need more power to get this done it's it's um it's it's one of the biggest problems with with politics is this this i think this tendency and um you know this this seduction by politicians to just promise more stuff right and and then the point of the other guy be like well they're not promising anything they don't really care about you it's like no we actually care about you so much that we're not going to lie to you and i want to build upon what works and uh you know and so that gets into your i think your regulatory principles that that you talk about often can you expand on those yeah there are a few of them one is that and this goes to your point that competition in the free market as opposed to preemptive regulation ultimately deliver a lot more value for consumers at the end of the day it might be more counterintuitive because free coming from the government often seems very appealing but ultimately that's so appealing yeah i mean and the only problem with free over time as you know is that it simply costs too much it costs people things in the long run it reduces innovation and it's it's the number one you know it's the easiest thing in the world for me as a politician to do is to promise you more stuff right exactly right another principle i try to embrace is just technological neutrality going back to our earlier conversation the fcc should not be in the business of picking winners and losers we should give everyone a fair chance to compete and related to that as a third principle is that our decisions should reflect basic principles of economics cost-benefit analysis things like that and finally we should be transparent about our work we want to reform how the agency operates in order to allow people on the street who don't have the ability to come to washington to hire a lawyer to lobbyists we want them to be able to understand our decisions right and you guys have taken some steps towards transparency at the fcc yeah for many many years the fcc we were required by law each month to have a meeting that is where we vote the commissioner's vote on different things that are proposed by the chairman for many years those votes happened and only after that the american people were able to see what the decision was i never understood that i mean can you imagine if you introduced a bill and you called for a vote in congress and only afterward your constituents were able to see what it was you're proposing to do there'd be a revolution but we were routinely doing that and so we changed it my second week in office we had a pilot program in which we published these proposed decisions at least three weeks before we had these meetings and we were getting input yeah and we were told the sky is going to fall it's a terrible idea but now everyone loves it and those are some of the most rewarding comments i get from when i travel around the country i've been in now 48 states and the territories of puerto rico and the virgin islands many people will say hey you know what i've never been to your office but i liked actually that proposal you made on suicide prevention or this idea or that idea i could actually read it on the internet before you voted right and i know it's a small thing given the crazy environment we're in but to build more confidence in our regulatory system we've got to be more transparent with the american people that makes sense and uh but sometimes you're you're punished for it a little bit and so like we already talked about the memes uh but we'll we'll end with this because we have something in common we've both been made fun of uh quite a bit by uh by uh comedians uh me on saturday night live of course but you with john oliver so yeah what did john oliver have to say about a coffee mug i believe yeah so he's a big net neutrality advocate and was not the biggest fan of me and so when we proposed in 2017 to go down the road of deciding to revisit these net neutrality regulations uh he singled out the mug i used it's this giant reese's mug for those reese's peanut butter cup fans out there it holds about six liquid cups of coffee i measured it myself one time so he said well you know this guy thinks he has a big mug check this out and he came out with this giant i mean just ridiculously sized mug so then i came back with a twitter video myself over the top we went to home depot got a garbage can shaved it in half plastered on some effort into this yeah no look we take our public service very seriously at the fcc and so but it's kind of funny now it's become iconic now so whenever i travel around people often ask did you bring them up did you bring the mug and it's kind of taken on a life of its own and some of my favorite emails are from the critics who'll come in and say you know screw you and your mug i always think the mug was sort of an innocent bystander in all of this it had no say in the matter had no agency but somehow it's become this icon of all things fcc and associated with me anyway so you still have the mug is it in the office it's it's a functional mug this is not decorative this is big okay yeah so i mean when my then girlfriend now wife in our day we went to hershey pa and i got this mugs i love you know reese's and i love coffee and i thought hey it doesn't get any better than this and i started drinking it at our monthly meetings when i was a commissioner and yes these meetings can go on for a while and you know i don't know about you but a lot of regulatory talk over time your eyes start to glaze over without caffeine so it's been a blast it's uh i really love the mug and uh it's you know i i don't know it's always kept safe i don't take it on the road good good i mean you don't want to steal it you know these i'm sure there'd be many who'd like to take a cat and whack at it or sell it on ebay or whatever yeah jeez well i think i think since there's been so much success um after the net neutrality decision uh it appears we're on we're on track as americans to sort of i think get off that that anger that the angry train of uh you know pro net neutrality is that are you seeing that or do you still get a lot of hate you know i still get a little bit of it but by and large a lot of the folks who might still disagree with the decision at least have admitted that the world hasn't ended and and so i you know whenever i ask answer questions about this i try to reflect something that i think you've really done much better than most uh certainly me here in washington which is to handle these things uh with grace and with respect and uh yeah i followed you from afar for a while and you easily could have gone down the same road that would have earned you a ton of clicks and you have people egging you on but to handle it the way you did i think reflects uh as president lincoln would have said the better angels of our nature and we could use a lot more of that here in washington i mean you reflect that as well so you know and i appreciate that because you easily we easily could have slammed saturday night live and uh i probably wouldn't have been on the show the next weekend if i'd done that and then we would just be at this kind of standstill and it wouldn't feel very good and that's the norm frankly is to just hit him back uh you know participate in the outrage don't confront it yeah and uh i think he did the same thing because it would have been easy to just uh fact check john oliver show him how wrong he is and and do it in a way that was you know maybe snarky and mean because that's the norm i mean that's what people people tend to do and uh it's it's we tend to win more and i define winning as persuading people uh not just not just making noise and so i think we win more if we if if we actually engage in the discussion in a way that's both humanizing but also gets our point across absolutely i mean the snl is a great example of that had you not gone on that show millions of people who would be predisposed not to like you or your views or whatever would never have seen that side of you and you wouldn't have been able to make your case in a nuanced way and so i i view it the same way and when i do these town halls on college campuses or within critics you know i want them to see that there's a real thought process that went into this decision there's a real human that stands behind that decision you know we these are not easy things to do these are not easy positions to have but at the end of the day our goals are the same which is to vindicate the public interest and whether i'm doing it from the fcc or you here in congress i'm confident the american people have an open mind and open heart to folks who approach the table as we do or try to do any way in good faith i think so and uh on that note i think we've we've hit about everything so chairman aji pai thank you so much for coming on we really appreciate it anytime

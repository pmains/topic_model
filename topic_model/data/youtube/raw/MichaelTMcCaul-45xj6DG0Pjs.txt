i'm here on board the USS harry s truman which is right in the middle of the persian gulf between Iran and the target packages we deliver in Iraq and Syria against Isis now we talk a lot about policy in Washington what we're doing to defeat Isis in Iraq and Syria but to see it in action to see being implemented is truly one of the most impressive sights I've seen as a Congress we have over 5,000 sailors serving on this aircraft carrier it's a team effort to win this war on terror against Isis I was very honored to have lunch with the sailors from my district aboard this aircraft carrier and I can tell you they believe in the mission I thank them for their service in this very important mission that our military is conducting today they just got another extension of 30 days and yet their resolve and courage and bravery is very very strong and morale is very very high and that's why I'm here is to say thank you for your service

now i promised you that we were going to get to dan muser and i want to talk to him about this ukrainian situation and he is on the line congressman muser how are you hey doing great bob uh you're also covering some important subjects there but if you i'll cover any subject that you like no i'd look at your you're right in the cat bird seat i want to get your perspective on uh russia's attack against the ukraine well you know i'll try not to regurgitate everything that we're seeing on on the uh 24 7 news um but you know it's not exactly a news flash uh that putin is a tyrannical thug um why that should be a a surprise to this administration or to anyone uh we we have to be we have to be concerned with i mean the build-up for this has been going on uh russian troops have been building up since july actually since the afghanistanian debacle there was no planning really at all along the way even when our foreign affairs committee made made inquiries um there was very little uniting of allies and frankly a lot of wishful thinking that that you know that they were going to be able to negotiate and have diplomacy and have some minimal sanctions against uh against putin uh to uh to to cease his his buildup and not to invade and you know none of that occurred and then we you know i i i say weak of the united states of america but then you know president biden issues this red line that shouldn't be crossed and not only was it crossed we moved our own goal posts which undermined an already very weak response and and putin putin called biden's bluff um you know congress one of the things i've been pointing out is the leverage we had against them was not necessarily military it was our energy independence and our ability to produce vast amount of energy to offset the leverage he has against europe and we gave it away we gave it away unilaterally right we weakened our national security by letting us become non-energy independent as we were short 14 months ago this is what happens when you rely upon other countries particularly adversaries such as iran china and of course russia it's quite amazing well congressman what what is the foreign affairs committee going to do if anything or maybe you can maybe there's not much you can do you being in the minority in that for now uh what what can you do to try to salvage this situation that biden has created well it shouldn't have been an escalating series of sanctions right i mean two three four weeks ago they should have been hit hard with every level of sanctions so the consequences were going to be clear um i don't know if that would have deterred putin but the idea that that joe biden is going to be coming on on the television in 15 minutes and tell us that there's added sanctions is certainly kind of you know the proverbial closing the barn door after the after the cow got out you know the uk even just issued some pretty serious sanctions and one of them is swift something that i've been calling for we've been calling for the international financial uh telecommunication organization that if you're if you're prohibited from that you've got major financial problems um you know such as sanctioning putin themselves um and and the oil companies and anyone who does business with their oil companies we really could have done a lot more a lot sooner and yet now we have a major invasion uh that's many uh somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 already uh i will tell you this though you know uh our information tells us that the russians thought this would be over in two days and um well right now my understanding is they've got about nearly a hundred russian pows uh they're shooting down the helicopters and um that they're uh putting up one hell of a fight well the other thing congressman i i had uh read a report that they had taken out as many as 12 russian tanks with the tank busters we sent them so yeah they're they're going to inflict some damage but it's going to be a long grinding affair outside of the cities now one of the things the other thing that is i found disgraceful is we allowed russia to jump into china's arms and china is going to be the financial workaround to get around the the suspension of swift the and any other financial damage that we could have done in addition to the fact that he's he's going to get more for his oil and he's he's going to have more money in his hands because gold has shot up so much yeah no question oil is now over a hundred dollars a barrel the uh only almost uh economic factor for the russians is is their natural gas and their oil so uh they're making more money as as this goes um the um you know the issue with with china is perhaps perhaps one of the most serious of all that they are watching uh and they will react to the uh the weakness and the lack of consequences and response certainly just you could say just as russia did with the um from afghanistan and that's that's very serious i mean ukraine is serious taiwan has many uh many much technology and supplies that we need they're a very significant trading partner that that the ccp is circling uh as as we speak and they have been so the world is watching you know bob what it really comes down to is it's just we're in a very serious world we need serious people in charge we must be focused we can't bring all this wokeness to everything in in our lives you know to the police wokeness to the military wokeness uh you know our whole focus is climate change um lowering investment national security um you know an assault on our domestic energy i mean you know we must have law and order we must have a strong economy uh because strong economy is is is your best uh offense and our national security including energy including border security including alliances with with friendly nations so we just we're just doing things wrong in the short term and and the long term and you know very much that comes down to uh to leadership but but right now we must um deal with this issue uh we do have to come together um we have to minimize uh this catastrophe um as uh as you know similar to what had to be done in in afghanistan uh unfortunately because of the poor planning and assure that this doesn't uh extend into other countries you know if putin feels he can just just go into here and um uh without too many consequences he could certainly feel that feel that about other countries but i'll just end with this if there's any silver lining and it's very far hard to find one particularly right now is our nations our allies are uniting nato should be stronger because of it and it's also causing other countries such as finland for instance has asked to join nato uh because they feel if they're if they're a nato member um putin would would hesitate uh before or such an adversary just before invading so and they are very close to mother russia they're very close well congressman muser thank you very much i get to blow v8 for three hours get it off my chest and then go home you have to do this 24 7. so i feel for you and the frustration you must be experiencing well we're it is it is frustrating um but we're going to just continue to weigh in and be as constructive as we can and of course be transparent and truthful to uh to my constituents well we appreciate your service and please keep us updated on this and any other situation that comes across your desk i appreciate it i will bob and i appreciate you very much thanks for the opportunity to speak

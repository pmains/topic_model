madam president i rise today to celebrate the confirmation of now justice kitanji brown jackson as a justice on the supreme court of the united states of america it's an important moment for our country but also a special moment for me because my wife angela and two of our sons are here visiting the capitol this week they witnessed history in the making when we voted to confirm just a few minutes ago when we voted to confirm justice jackson angela and i take great joy in knowing that uh not just our three sons but young people across the country will see justice katanji brown jackson as an example of the great heights that they too can achieve for the very first time in our nation's history the senate has confirmed a black woman to the supreme court of the united states for only the sixth time we confirmed a woman to the supreme court and for the fourth time we confirmed a working mother it's also the first time in 50 years that the senate has confirmed a justice with public defense experience now this nomination represents progress and i'm heartened that it was a bipartisan majority of senators that came together to make history today but i also know that this progress would not be possible without that someone who would who was brave enough to step ahead on her own without someone willing to work twice as hard in order to be the first without someone able to persevere no matter how challenging how difficult or how full of doubt her path ahead may sometimes be madam president it shouldn't have been this hard as you know i'm a member of the judiciary committee so i can attest that when then judge jackson came before the committee with an outstanding judicial record with bipartisan acclaim and historic qualifications she came prepared and she did answer a whole range of important questions and she was forthcoming she was clear and gracious now many senators took the opportunity to engage deeply on issues that will shape the future of our nation issues like the role of technology and innovation voting rights tribal sovereignty and much much more but sadly as has been referenced some of our colleagues chose to fill their time with hostility bad faith and misleading smears they chose to hold judge jackson to a different standard than other supreme court nominees that they themselves had previously supported and in the same breath as they tried to praise judge jackson's character and qualifications they denigrated her motives they questioned her impartiality and made up excuse after excuse for why they couldn't support her nomination it was painful to watch not just for me but for people across the country judge jackson was in the spotlight for days but she continuously met disrespect with calm composure it's an experience that's all too common for those with the audacity to break new ground judge jackson was unfairly tested but she persevered madam president i believe that judge jackson deserved than the treatment she received during the confirmation process when you see senators cast aside their good faith in questioning nominees the threat to the integrity of our justice system is very real the cynicism it breeds for our institutions israel and these are the issues that this senate that each senator must confront but today i want to and i choose to celebrate this historic achievement the historic achievement of this confirmation now over the last few weeks i've received thousands of letters and emails and other messages including on social media from californians who support justice jackson's confirmation the messages came from people of all backgrounds and from every corner of my home states i've heard from californians who admired the tenacity the grace and the integrity that justice jackson showed in committee and i got messages from so many californians young californians who see themselves in justice jackson's story and from californians who say that the court and our country will be better because of her service so as we cast our historic votes i celebrate the better america that we are building where our courts better reflect and understand the diverse country that it serves and i celebrate the joy that judge jackson has brought to people across not just california but across the nation i celebrate the commitment to equal rights and equal justice that she will bring to the supreme court and i celebrate the inspiration that she provides to young people especially young people of color who will write the next chapter of our american story when judge jackson introduced herself to the american people in the course of the confirmation hearing and judiciary committee she said that she stood on the shoulders of the civil rights icon and her personal hero judge constance baker motley for many in the next generation their hero will be justice katanji brown jackson madam president as i've shared with others and i want to share again today this confirmation represents one more step towards making our institutions and our courts more inclusive for all americans and so it is in that spirit that i request unanimous consent to make a few additional remarks in spanish without objection gracias president historical celebration is generation adam president judge now justice jackson has earned her place on the supreme court and i will end by acknowledging that while one person alone sitting on a court of nine equals can't single-handedly create faith in the institution i have every confidence that justice jackson will strengthen the supreme court and help our country progress forward thank you madam president i yield the floor

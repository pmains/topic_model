thank you madam Speaker I rise today to recognize Suffolk County police officer Thomas Wilson in responding to a 911 hang-up call officer Wilson came upon a female victim with severe stab wounds and an armed assailant who refused to surrender thanks to his quick and measured thinking while assuming clear risk to his own life officer Wilson was able to subdue and arrest the armed assailant and provide life-saving first aid to the female victim his courageous actions have earned him the silver shield award from Suffolk County PBA and he'll soon receive the combat medal from Suffolk County PD while this is an extraordinary act of heroism those who know officer Wilson are not surprised this is the same man who worked on the pile in the aftermath of 9/11 for 350 hours and who has traveled to DC dozens of times to fight for the Zadroga act and to fully fund an island Victim Compensation Fund on behalf of our entire community and nation I thank Officer Wilson for his continued service I yield back

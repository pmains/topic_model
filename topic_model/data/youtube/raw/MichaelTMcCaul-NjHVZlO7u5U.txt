to the immigration showdown right now tension continues to escalate as the debate continues over what to do with all of the unaccompanied immigrant children coming across the border joining us now live from washington d.c chairman of the homeland security committee congressman michael mccall good morning congressman now hi jose congress is facing a recess and running out of time just to pass a funding bill what happens if there's no deal reached before the august recess which i think is supposed to begin tomorrow well look this is a crisis that demands action and in being responsible we have to get something done here we have a bill that's on the floor today actually two bills that address this crisis the first one i think fundamentally changing this 2008 trafficking law so we treat central americans the same way we treat mexicans crossing over which means within 72 hours they are swiftly and humanely brought back to their homes we believe that will send a message of deterrence that will stop the flow of future children coming into the united states secondly we we deployed the national guard down to the southwest border jose as you know our governor's already activated the national guard but i believe it's a federal responsibility to pick up the tab for that not to texans i think the federal government should be paying for the national guard down there and then finally by the way there's no new money in this bill we offset it but with fema disaster relief funds and we basically use that to to remove detain remove and repatriate them back to their homes then last piece is uh southcom which is the southern command the general kelly who i met with plans to be in guatemala to help seal that guatemalan mexican border which is where they are all crossing over to stop this flow so we think we have a a very good package here uh that will address the solution and then finally we have an additional vote on this executive action that that's called daca that we believe really started the surge of this these children coming across that executive action was passed in 2012 and since that time you've seen the numbers more than double as a result of that we think the cartels have exploited that and messaged that down to the families to make money off these children that they bring up through mexico now congressman what do we do with all of the children who are already here last october they said 56 000. now they're projecting about 90 000 by the end of this year and possibly more what do we do with them well i think those assumptions those numbers go down once we change the 2008 law once we start sending them back the families aren't going to pay seven eight thousand dollars to send their children if they're not getting anything for their money so we think when the children are start to get sent back they will stop coming and these numbers plummet and that's the i think the the common sense approach uh here the ones that are currently here are in the custody of health and human services but again they they are in the custody we have to treat them humanely but this bill will provide for the swift and humane uh removal from the united states and take them back home sort of repatriation but you are going to push for the federal government to pay for the national guard use near the border right now yeah jose it makes no sense for the state of texas to pick up the tab on a federal responsibility it is the responsibility of the federal government to secure the borders i applaud our governor and dps and the sheriffs for what they're doing but look this is uh again a responsibility under the constitution of the federal government and as such we should be paying uh for that tab and that's what this bill will do we'll provide the resources to deploy the national guard not only to texas but the entire southwest border and i think that is a a step in the right direction to securing that border congressman michael mccall chairman of the homeland security committee thank you so very much for joining us here on fox 26 morning news and hopefully something will become true law either later today or tomorrow thank you sir thank you jose

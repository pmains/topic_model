I love my friends I'm Dennis Prager I'm going to my guests immediately he he has one segment and I am very grateful to him and he is congressman Bruce Westerman fourth congressional district of Arkansas who was a specialist in forest management has written about it has lived it congressman thank you so much and welcome to the Dennis Prager show hey Dennis great to be with you I think this is the first time I've been on your show an honor for me to get to visit with you that's very kind of you sir and I hope it's the first of many so you have a bill before Congress with regard to forest management explain it to us please yeah it's called the resilient federal Forest Act was actually passed it out of the house twice it's gotten nowhere in the Senate we have been able to get a few of the provisions attached to other legislation we've got several provisions in the farm bill right now but we're getting some pushback from Senate Democrats on that but basically dennis is to help us be better stewards of this wonderful resource we have in our federal Forest land and it's been horribly mismanaged for several decades and we're seeing the results of that now in all these catastrophic wildfires and you can look at the data the fires continue to be they grow in intensity they grow in quantity and we're seeing for more loss of life when these fires happen so it's just a practical common-sense approach to give our forest managers more authority to do the job that they've been hired to do and that job would entail what that they have not been doing until now thinning our forests mainly you know forests are living dynamic organisms we tend to think we can preserve them but you can't preserve them you preserve art you preserve cucumbers when you kill them and pickle them and put them in a jar but forests continue to grow and they fill the growing space they start competing for for water nutrients they give weekend you get insects and disease attack and eventually nature takes care of that with fire and we fail to manage our federal lands adequate adequately for like I said three decades or more and we're paying the price for that now who would want such mismanagement well the problem that we they would see is the Forest Service spent all this time and effort putting their management plans in place and they go through a public posting and they get held up in court by usually radical environmental groups that are I think they're more out to make money and make a name for themselves and they are about protecting our forests and and having healthy forests which have benefits for everyone we get cleaner air we get cleaner water and get better wildlife habitat and it can actually help rural communities if those forests are managed properly but we're in a sad state right now with 192 million acres of federal forest land a huge amount of that millions and millions of acres are rated as subject to catastrophic wildfire because we have not used fires to manage that it's more than just using fire we need to thin get a lot of the vegetation out and then use fires on a regular interval to burn up the underbrush what happens in these over stock forests is you get a fire and you have bladder fuel that allows the fire to get up into crowns and then you get crown fires and they're very devastating you get winds bottom dry conditions like we're seeing in California right now and they literally become raging inferno as you've probably seen the videos it looks like tornadic activity creativity's wildfires that's right it's exactly what it looks like the death toll here is up to 48 by the way and I'm sure it'll go over 50 it's as I said yesterday have the those people been shot would have been national news but it happened by fire and which you believe let me let me make this clear you believe this could have been prevented in large measure it could greatly be mitigated now when you look at the fire the wolseley fire in Southern California you're not talking about a heavily forested area this is more to do with what I would call scrub brush you've got these very dry conditions strong winds and forest management probably wouldn't affect that area but up in Northern California around the Paradise fire well you've got these national forests that have been they've been managed they've just been mismanaged you can work in what's called the wildland urban interface to do a lot better job to create buffers around urban areas around structures and populated areas so that when you have fire the intensity of that fire is not near as much and you've got an opportunity to put it out before causes damage to property and unfortunately many lives you said that radical environmental groups but var Mentalist groups were opposed to your bill and to the management that you would like to see two things please can you name any of them and secondly what is their argument well if you look at the way this works and and probably up in region 1 Montana Idaho in that areas where you see more abuse of the system but it's all across the country and these aren't what you would call a lot of times your mainstream environmental groups or your conservation groups that are trying to to do good things you I don't think you'll find the nature conservancy I don't think you'll I know you won't find the conservation organizations like National Wild Turkey Federation Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation those groups understand the benefit of good forest management but we also we have a law in this country called the equal access to justice act that you know individuals have figured out they can start their own nonprofit and they can sue the federal government under the Equal Access to Justice Act and not only are they suing and stopping these management plans the federal government is turning around and paying them their legal fees for suing them so the taxpayers are getting hosed on both directions on that so these are the groups that are advocating against forced management and in putting sound practices science-based practices into place that if I think if they were intellectually honest they would say that you know there are a lot of them are they blame climate change and global warming and all that within in those regards this is a positive feedback loop the more fires you have the more carbon you're putting into the atmosphere so it makes that problem even worse where if we managed our forests trees or natural natural sequester's of carbon if we use wood and buildings you're sequestering carbon there so it's a win-win situation if you have healthy forests and people who stop these management plan plans in the name of sound environmental practices are rights only so in the minimal standard minute we have remaining what argument do they have I can't imagine that one comes out that the industry wants to clear cut the federal forests for profits I mean that's the that's the argument that they have and they say all this is fueled by big industry well that's that's a lot to do because there's more timber in our country now then the industry can use and really the forests need industry much worse than industry needs the forest and we could do a much better job that's it's very depressing for one final thing you said the this Southern California fires are not related to mismanagement only the Northern California fires well when you get into areas where it's more scrub brush you could do some land management practices to reduce the impact of those fires but it's not nearly what we've seen in Northern California what we've seen in Idaho and Montana and over again in Washington and other places across the country where you actually have what you would think of as more conventional forest with a lot of tall trees closely don't get it well congressman Bruce Westerman thank you for your work for your bill and for your time well thank you Dennis and look forward to our next visit good same here one a Prater 776 I really want to keep on top of this issue and he didn't want to name the names of the what he called radical environmentalist groups and I not pushy in this regard but I like to know how the Sierra Club for example came out on this issue it's so amazing the question for these left-wing groups is not does it help but who's behind it so if industry is behind something it is ipso facto bad even if it will do good it's such a morally broken compass all right much to talk about you're listening to the Dennis Prager show 1-8 Prager 7076 the Dennis Prager show live from

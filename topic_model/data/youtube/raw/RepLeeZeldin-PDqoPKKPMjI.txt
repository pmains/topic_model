well thank you mr. speaker and thank you to mr. Donovan as well for your support I rise today in support of HR 2182 to prevent the sale of Plum Island by the federal government to the highest bidder situated at the gateway of the Long Island Sound I've personally had the pleasure of visiting this treasured Island in addition of being a critical resource for research approximately 90% of the land on Plum Island has been sheltered from development offering Long Island a diverse wildlife an ecosystem and a critical habitat for migratory birds marine mammals and rare plants Plum Island is also an essential cultural and historical resource as well with recorded history dating back to the 1700s the island held the US military's for Terry a coastal defense fortification which was used through the end of World War two since then Plum Island has been utilized as a research laboratory and has since grown to become what is known today as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in 2005 the Department of Homeland Security which currently has jurisdiction over the island announced that the Animal Disease Center research would be moved to a new federal facility the bio and agro defense facility NBF in Kansas to offset the cost of this relocation a law was enacted that called for the private sale of Plum Island by the federal government to the highest bidder however because of the costs associated with the cleanup and closure of Plum Island and because of local zoning restrictions the federal government would receive little compensation for the sale of Plum Island also in the 12 years since the move to Kansas was approved the new facility in Kansas is already fully paid for by a combination of federal appropriations and state and private funds allowing for continued research public access and permanent preservation of the island HR 2182 will suspend the laws passed in 2008 and 2011 that mandated the public sale of Plum Island this bill will Commission the Government Accountability Office in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security which currently owns the island to formulate a comprehensive plan for the future of the island it requires the plan focused on conservation education and research and include alternative uses for the island including a transfer of ownership to another federal agency the state or local government a non-profit or a combination thereof in the 114th Congress this bill passed the House unanimously with bipartisan support as HR 1887 my amendment to the financial services and general government appropriations act of 2017 HR 5485 which would have prohibited any of the funding within the appropriations bill to be used to market or sell Plum Island also passed the house as well I would like to thank the other members of Congress who have co-sponsored this legislation and lent their support to this cause especially my colleagues from Connecticut Congressman Joe Courtney and congresswoman rosa DeLauro I would also like to thank House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy for bringing this bill to the floor House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCall for all of his incredible leadership and all the local elected officials groups and concerned residents on Long Island who have taken an interest on this important issue this bill is endorsed by the preserved Plum Island coalition an alliance of over 65 community and environmental groups in New York and Connecticut focused on the conservation of this island I'm proud to work alongside all of these great individuals and groups as we strive to save Plum Island since taking office in 2015 one of my highest local priorities has been to protect Plum Island preserving this islands natural beauty while maintaining a research mission will continue to provide important economic and environmental benefits for Long Island I encourage all my colleagues to vote in support of this critical bill as well as for the Senate to pass this legislation so that may be signed into law this year thank you Mr Speaker I yield back

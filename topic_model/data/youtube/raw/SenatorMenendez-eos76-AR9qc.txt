senator menendez of new jersey thank you mr chairman for holding this hearing and before i get to my questions i want to note that i find it highly unusual that fema sent to congress an unsolicited 17 section nfip reauthorization bill that in my view will do significant harm both to the program and homeowners alike many of the ideas reflected in this proposal were part of a 2017 house republican bill that was rejected by the democratic majority in fact just last week e enews noted the similarities between this proposal and a proposal written by then omb director mick mulvaney during the trump administration a fema's proposal will lead to more people being uninsured and unprotected against more frequent storms higher costs for families and higher barriers to owning a home and a small business and so i would just say to the chair and the ranking member there's already a bipartisan comprehensive nfip reauthorization bill included and introduced in the senate the legislation that i've co-sponsored with senator kennedy and van hollen on this committee along with six other senators is supported by the national association of counties the flood mitigation industry association the international association of structural movers and others and so i look forward to working with the chair and the ranking member on this now according to a report by redfin 84 of majority hispanic communities will face increases under risk rating 2.0 the highest share of increases compared to other racial and ethnic groups historically hispanic families have been underrepresented in home ownership and i believe that risk rating 2.0 will only undermine recent gains the average annual premium in majority hispanic neighborhoods is 495 dollars however cbo has found that fema's new premium methodology may increase premiums by four to seven times more that could go from 495 to nearly 3 500 so in creating risk rating 2.0 equity in action did fema consider whether the policy would disproportionately burden majority hispanic communities so um i think that's a simple yes or no no it did not okay why not why wouldn't that look at the impact across all communities and attempt to control for disproportionate burdens in any community so insurance rates are are based on actuarial science and the manner in which rates are calculated are based on the property characteristics not the owner of the property oh so you mean we should make public policy here uh in such a broad-based area that wouldn't but we don't care what happens to black or african-american or minority communities no that's not that's not what i said that's what you did though that's not what i said at all i know but that's what you did no i i appreciate that fema supposedly supports an affordability program to help policyholders get covered but in order to have an informed discussion around the issue of affordability fema has to fully explain risk rating 2.0 let me be clear no one except for fema knows what the full risk premium rates are under risk rating 2.0 fema has only released limited information on what the first year premiums are with statutory cap supply so mr marsh said will you provide to congress the full risk rates of what your plan on charging our constituents sure so we've provided the information that we can provide based on what we know today you can't predict what the rates are going to be 10 years from now we know what the full risk rates are now and they'll be shown on the on the insurance policies that that people purchase especially those that are on the glide path to their full risk rate well look you're calling on congress to authorize a new voucher program as part of your plan but it's difficult to know how to tailor a such a program if we don't know the premiums you're charging and listen you're talking about 10 years you're telling me you're not going to know what the premiums are the year after please i don't believe that our legislation that was signed into law requires fema to report to this committee when premiums exceed a certain threshold and it has not done so this year or in recent years if fema cannot be more transparent with congress then it will be extremely challenging for us to address affordability you have failed to address what the statutory obligations are now one of the provisions fema proposes is the idea of continuous coverage which would allow policyholders before i get to that let me just say that from independent sources we will see a compounding uh raising of premiums that will ultimately uh range in the double-digit range annually annually now one of the provisions fema now close on this chairman proposes is the idea of continuous coverage which would allow policyholders to keep their nfip discount if they leave the program to go to private flood insurance and want to later return to the nfrp do you know of any property and casualty company that offers continuous coverage not that i'm aware of and there's a reason as i pointed out you know this is a a government multi-purpose government program and that's been indicated to us that that will allow for greater private sector development which has the potential to assist fema in closing the insurance i don't know who who is the private entities that told you that but i have never heard of any insurance company offering continuous coverage if policyholders want to leave their insurance policies for competitors if we offer continuous coverage what we're setting up is the program to be cherry-picked and we'll lose policies that help balance out the program insurance is about pulling risk over the widest group of policyholders and i'm deeply concerned that what you're proposing both in the rate shock that will take place for policyholders which means that people will forego if they don't have a mortgage obligation to have flood insurance they will forego you your own entity says that 20 of the policyholders will drop coverage well that reduces the universe by 20 the smaller the universe the higher the rates that's going to create another cascading effect at the end of the day but then to say continuous coverage so that uh people who are less likely to face the consequences of a claim will go to private insurance but then you'll leave all of the properties that have a challenge in the national flood insurance program and that will only create a compounding effort uh consequence so i have real serious concerns and i would just say to the german ranking member the last time we went through something similar uh there was such rate shock that both democrat and republicans responded to it and i hope we don't have to wait for the rate shock mr chairman to try to solve the problem thanks senator menendez

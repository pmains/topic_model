we are really delighted uh Senators young and poker to have you with us as shy indicated the topic of emergency savings is not a casual interest back in 2016 we had a commission on Financial Security um that delved into this issue at Kent Conrad and Jim Lockhart and Business Leaders and labor leaders and it was a good scrum and we put out some great recommendations and nobody cared right they sat there for two years until you guys came along in 2018 and just so the you know public understands this you met with your constituents you did the research you reached out to your colleagues you brought in interest groups you drafted legislation you redrafted legislation you actually did what has to happen to lead the country to solve real problems and so it's just a delight to have you with us and now I'd like to talk about it I want to talk a little bit about just the why talk about the legislation and then if we have time maybe the prospects and I guess I'll kick it off to you Senator Booker on the why so guys from different states different parties different geographies different interests why'd you get together on this thing I mean what was it about this issue that really motivated uh you to get started and connect with uh Senator Young first of all thanks for giving uh Senator young and I this uh privilege of uh being uh on the same show as we have a as a great Susie Orman it's tremendous and I'm a big fan of hers her practical insights have been benefiting me for years and then of course I just want to thank the bipartisan policy Center and funding our future you all have been incredible and really represent the Spirit uh that I I want to live here in the United States Senate which looking for common ground reaffirming the sense of common purpose we have in America despite uh whatever political difference we might have and Todd young is one of those colleagues that I really deeply appreciate I'm so grateful uh for a lot of the work he and I have done together uh a lot of benefits I've had and responsive on the Foreign Relations Committee just being with him and seeing his Focus uh uh internationally but here on this issue I'm grateful to have him as a partner here domestically and I think he and I both realize how uh vulnerable we are uh as a society not having people being able to withstand just a what some people might call an emergency but these unpredictable expenses that often come up uh whether it's car trouble a visit to the emergency room a water leak at home these kind of things that can happen most Americans uh can't uh deal with more than a 400 expense and that really makes us economically vulnerable it makes our society more vulnerable it could create a really rough economic spirals for families who are doing everything right and it's really an alarming crisis it's an alarm in crisis especially because so many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck uh and uh also a lot of Americans just don't have that kind of savings in fact he and I are both ex-gen's uh folks and we both are part of a generation that compared to any other generation has the least amount of even retirement savings so we have these economic uh uh crises waiting to be triggered and this is one of those ways that we can address that by incentivizing the kind of savings that can make us all more economically resilient uh or economically strong and you know uh Stave off that having an economic emergency uh turns into an economic disaster for our family a great entry so Senator young I'd like to hear just a little bit about you like your experience with your constituents and you know I think we all Focus this has been a issue for America for you know 250 years but the pandemic kind of brought some different kinds of attention to it I wonder if you could just talk about how you saw that play out in Indiana how that's changed the Arc of the discussion well thank you so much I'd thank the bipartisan policy Center as well for hosting this event for your thought leadership uh as as we learned about just how uh grave uh the emergency savings deficit is in this country and and of course it relates very directly uh to our long-standing concerns about uh insufficient savings uh for retirement and you know for me this is uh this is about everything uh that Corey just discussed which is one of the reasons I've really enjoyed working with Corian on this and many other issues but it's also uh the lack of emergency Savings in particular a source of great frustration and even stress uh daily stress for a lot of my constituents uh regardless of of their income level uh across rural urban uh uh you know divides uh black white uh Republican Democrat it really doesn't matter uh there needs to be more attention paid to uh the emergency savings challenges in this country and more tools given to rank and file Americans which is what we're trying to accomplish here so to the extent we can eliminate that stress by providing a very flexible instrument uh to businesses which is uh historically where so many Americans are are used to preparing for retirement uh we we try and also prepare them for uh the the unforeseen crisis which is inevitable in most of our lives but uh very difficult to prepare for oftentimes we wanted to do this you know brass tax [Music] my uh my individual visits uh with constituents is is supported by data the more I started to marinate and some of the facts out there gathered by the bipartisan policy Center and others uh I learned that uh Corey and I and so many others were on to something when you have uh two out of five Americans who have absolutely no emergency savings whatsoever uh and uh roughly a third of Americans who can't cover uh the cost of uh unexpected cost of a 400 expense not a whole lot of money um as we emerge from the pandemic and experience inflation challenges uh these crises only grow more acute and I think the time is now for us to act and and uh set Americans up for success in the future as they try and prepare for uh their own emergencies and their own retirement dig into the legislation in a minute but um Senator you could speak a little bit about the broader ramifications for the economy so as you pointed out there are lots of people living on the edge one broken ankle or you know broken roof away from just having their whole economics unravel I know we don't have CBO scoring on that Dynamic question but how do you feel like this affects just basic Workforce and our ability to kind of have a engage society that is not dependent upon the government for too much of its uh basic survival yeah look I uh when I was a mayor of the city of Newark uh my mentor mayor was Mike Bloomberg and I still remember moving slowly saying God we trust but everybody else bring me data uh and I I just the right left of Washington when I was a mayor I was just trying to fix stuff make things work create opportunity and what we were stunned uh with when we looked at a lot of the data is often we saw people getting evicted from their housing uh for just you know a few hundred dollars they were literally losing their housing but the cost to us as taxpayers uh were many multiples of that uh in terms of suddenly their dependency on a lot of things or they're ending up in our emergency rooms or engaged with our police and that's something our society hasn't really taken into effect when uh people you know every dollar we spend getting a child above the poverty line saves about five dollars uh for uh for the economy overall all and so creating as as I think Senator young stood so wisely an instrument that we know this from 401ks and more that has sort of an automatic enrollment opportunity uh will create people that will be insulated not just to cost to their families but costs that often if they spiral economically or face real economic disaster issues that spiral out and affect all of us as taxpayers we are better in this economy when people are doing better in this economy and success wealth opportunity bleeds into every area we saw this with this remarkable period of economic growth from the time my dad was a teenager in the 1940s after the post-war period uh to uh around the time I was coming into being in the 1970s we had this powerful explosion of of Economic Opportunity median income in the United States more than doubled and it just had a ripple effect throughout our entire economy we have got to start finding ways to have the average American have a better economic experience than they're having right now and these are the kind of mechanisms and tools that not just Empower people uh and help them to invest responsibly but it's also I think the tools that could save us from a lot of the challenges we're still facing in this economy of families in economic crisis or even just as I think Senator young said so well the constant stress economic stress that a lot of families are over that that cortisol constantly pumping into their veins as they worry about will they have enough money at the end of their month or they're going to have find themselves with too much month at the end of their money Jason if I could just uh extend Corey's remarks uh as he spoke I I thought of yet another value proposition of giving Rank and file Americans the tools to prepare for uh their own future uh emergencies and um you know there's an old adage that it's expensive to be poor increasingly is is the cost of goods and services go up it's it's becoming more expensive for middle-class Americans uh to to buy the regular things they need to fix their car to fix their house uh perhaps and and and so in the absence of certainty about the need for future money for an emergency they hold back they'll they'll pay for a short-term fix and that costs them more money in the longer term so if instead uh we can give them uh the tools here to prepare for those crises um they they will live with less stress less cortisone uh going throughout their uh circulatory system as as Corey indicated but also uh we can um enhance their economic welfare as consumers uh which is something that's I think really accessible to all Americans the idea of living with confidence I think is um makes a lot of sense so while while you're talking a little bit about the role of individuals well that's just there's a kind of a governing philosophy behind here that uh is not uh new to my conversations with you this is a little bit more of a nudge than a mandate it seems like it's very much focused on kind of inspiring Innovation but just talk to us about the the role of governments and how you see that kind of underpinning the premise of the bill well one of the things that I think is uh important about this bill as it relates to the role of government is it provides flexibility we stay away from mandates uh we try and provide uh tools um uh so that uh employers can go out there and figure out how to best attract and retain uh their own employees while continuing to make a buck which is uh of course uh essential uh to their their purpose and their continuity so uh we how is that constructed uh in the bill itself well this this whole effort to set up an emergency savings account which is uh something that we allow uh to be stood up by employers alongside an existing 401k account uh that's an optional uh sort of decision from an employer it's also uh optional uh giving employers a choice whether or not um uh what what they establish the limit all the way up to twenty five hundred dollars of that account to be so uh we we give them a choice whether or not to Auto enroll their employees we've seen great success uh from Auto enrollment into retirement accounts uh we leverage that Dynamic and and um Auto enroll employees if they and their employer agree into an emergency savings account but uh once again that that too is in an option uh for the employer uh to implement if they so choose and then you know this is not uh Hotel California so if you enter into this situation and for whatever reason either your employees or the employer aren't entirely happy with it and and don't feel like they can they can adjust how the program works for their employees they can exit uh this this program as well that ought to alleviate any concern that uh any of my colleagues might have in about implementing this solution but also once it's operationalized should alleviate a lot of concerns that folks will have about adopting the solutions we help create so just an educational moment for the 20 year olds on my staff there was a band called The Eagles Hotel California the key line was check in any time you want but you can never leave that was the the reference that Senator young was it's so sad that that's becoming increasingly obscure but uh thank you colleague asked me what ACDC meant so we'll get there um Sarah Booker talking just a little more about the relationship between the retirement uh and emergency savings ideas so there's a little pushback early on people felt like this was going to be competing it was going to be pulling money out it was going to kind of complexify the situation talk about how you've kind of arranged that um that Dynamic so that they really work together well I still think we have a massive retirement crisis in this country especially as I said uh the generation that knows about the Eagles and knows about AC DC uh that this is the first generation that's really going to be a part of the society when we shifted from defined benefit to Define contribution and we have this retirement bubble that could be exploding we need to find uh Common Sense uh bipartisan ways to get some ways to address that issue but um look this is a uh a very smart thing to do when you recognize what kind of Havoc we are seeing in our country in terms of just the economy the kitchen table economics that we don't have enough insulation from what happens every day stuff happens uh you know people have an accident people have to go out from work there are a lot of ways that uh I think we could use incentive voluntary programs uh to to create outcomes in fact government has been doing it for a very long time from our prison systems uh which incentivize the right kind of behavior right kind of Engagement um all the way to a lot of our tax code that now creates savings incentives like 527s and more to help people prepare but this is really one that we should be speaking a lot more Frank about we have a nation that uh we need to do more for the average American worker um I'm not I'm one of these folks that hey I want people to uh to do well to have wealth and survive and have that kind of economic installation uh but there are too many now that are more economically vulnerable We're a nation since 1978 that the average CEO pay has gone up uh 1332 the average worker pay in that same period has only gone up 18 and so uh the average workers are really facing this time not just of income disparity I mean ceop has gone up wildly more than even the stock market has uh but the average worker is facing more and more tough economic headwinds and we as a society should figure out we share values as much as people want to emphasize right and left you could pull a hundred senators and ask them about working people and I think every one of us would say we may have disagreements on how to get there but we all want to see workers get a more fair Shake have more economic strength more Economic Security and I think this is a common sense low-hanging fruit way uh to allow people to be insulated from that uh from what is becoming increasingly just a tough world for the average worker please can I add just one point about sort of uh philosophy of government as it relates to this proposal as well we've learned a lot in in the last couple of decades uh about behavioral economics and and uh how we frame certain decisions it was a matter of of some controversy many will forget uh to Auto enroll employees into their retirement plan but uh it turns out employees really like it it's convenient it's consistent with their long-term wishes for saving but they make sub-optimal decisions as as they would judge the decision uh when uh left to make some some month-by-month decisions about saving for retirement uh because of the crisis of the moment because of impulses uh that creep in we still Empower of course employees to to uh to cease there are automatic contributions to a retirement plan that at any moment they wish but but that auto enrollment feature has been very powerful and very popular so we have taken that the change in Choice architecture as behavioral economists like to call it and uh adapted that concept to the emergency savings accounts and and so I think that's right I think that's appropriate uh as it relates to uh the sort of things we do in government because it still provides that individual flexibility just presented in a different and very helpful way and I'll just add you know we have decided my partisan ways to use our tax code to incentivize certain behaviors these tax expenditures have a cost this program is going to have a cost to it uh because when people pull out there will be no penalty we won't get those tax revenues but most people don't realize this we use about 600 billion dollars in our tax code every every year to provide certain tax breaks and incentives to certain Behavior we decided in this country that we wanted people to be homeowners and we have a mortgage interest deduction well I support that but we should understand that most of that 600 billion dollars including the mortgage interest deduction goes to is used by the top quintile within our society the top earners are benefiting from that one of the reasons why I like this is having an emergency savings account this is really targeted the people that are going to use this are not those uh c-suite Executives that have that kind of insulation as their salaries have gone up so much it's really Working Class People middle class folks uh that need this this so this is using our tax code now to better Target it towards working people and um I I think that we need to do more of this in using our task code not to incentivize people very well to get more wealth uh but uh uh like the carried interest deduction I think we should be using our tax code to help people who are doing everything right working hard uh to make the American deal even better for them and help them to engage in financial responsibility as Susan Orman would say that are going to further expand uh their ability to deal with uh severe Financial wins as well as secure uh retirement for their families instead of just a little just a little more right feet on the ground you're an employee so what happens right your paycheck is you know there's a certain percent about three percent I believe and you know you can pull it out at any time or just just a little more of the Mechanics for like say you know someone on my staff who's trying to figure out whether they want this to uh be part of their paycheck yes so these are after tax dollars so you're gonna it's like a Roth IRA you're gonna have to pay your taxes on the money you put in uh you put it into this account uh and uh as you said when you when as I said earlier if you have that emergency come up uh you could pull it out now that account is interest bearing just like my 401k might be so um you know it's going to grow over time if you look at the average uh sort of uh stock market earnings or however that's invested in a mutual fund or what have you it's my as my 401k is um and then you can pull it out and now just like that Roth IRA you're not going to pay uh a penalty by pulling it out you can use those resources to meet that emergency and but there's there's a cap twenty five hundred dollars Senator Young yes capped at twenty five hundred dollars and and uh agree with Corey's uh exposition of of how it works but would also add there's the further incentive uh which he may not have mentioned of the employer match which goes into the retirement account so the um the employee would will put money into the emergency savings account preparing for the near-term and very predictable emergency so they're not going to be part of that you know uh third of Americans who don't have four hundred dollars for an emergency and and and then the employee says I'm gonna match you but I'm going to put it in your retirement account so almost just preparing for the near-term Emergency you're enhancing your long-term security so it's really uh it has a graceful move no I smiled when I saw that in the bill um so I want to just get into a little bit of the politics in the moment so there's a there's a question about the sidecar versus opting out of the system and this is a place where we've been talking and I think you know I think my understanding is you interested in moving both those forwards but Senator we just give the audience a little sense of those two uh different parts of the program foreign I'm happy to please cover that so originally When Corey and Aunt I began working on this we decided to bundle this together in one proposal of some of your uh viewers will remember that it was the rise and shine act uh in uh was was part of the proposal and I if I recall the name correctly there's been a number of iterations but we split apart two components so those employers that also offer 401ks under this legislation uh now before us uh can also offer a sidecar uh uh emergency savings account and it would operate as I just described but there are a number of employers out there and I've worked for them that don't offer 401ks and so are we just going to leave those employees high and dry and so Corey and I and our teams are are working with VPC and other stakeholders to see if uh we might give those employees options to save for or emergencies as well and and uh and then if they leave that employer they will have tax advantaged a corpus of money that might be transferred into an IRA or a 401k or or what have you so uh we our our effort here if we can get this to work and we think we will uh get sufficient support to do so is to ensure that every American regardless of of uh their employee employers uh retirement uh uh benefit Provisions uh we'll have an opportunity to benefit from uh this emergency savings uh effort which will be tremendous especially just given the fact that we are in a more competitive Works uh economic environment in the now uh where people are competing over workers this is yet another incentive for employers to offer and again just the urgency of this you know we saw a recent study that showed about 60 percent of Americans have dipped into their retirement Savings in in the course of a year so this is something that people clearly have the demand for and are paying a cost on their long-term retirement uh and so since most Americans are familiar with having these kind of emergencies and have to dip into that retirement savings uh I I think this is something will become very popular very quickly both for the employer as well as for employees who are looking for um uh this uh this sort of kind of support and insulation well as you point out I'll just emphasize for employers having a staff that is resilient against minor life interruptions is obviously incredibly important right so I think that we see the incentives as you do on both sides of that uh equation so let's talk a little politics um we're in this thing called The Lame Duck which is kind of a remarkable moment in democracy where people who have retired or lost their elections continue to join together to try to make public policy and sometimes that allows a lot of things to move forward it's in a really bipartisan way you have tremendous bipartisan support for this idea but it's part of a larger package you know secure 2.0 and I wonder maybe uh Senator could you talk a little bit about what you see as the prospects for secure 2.0 in the lame duck you know there's a lot of conversations going on right now a lot of priorities being bounced around um but the benefit of things like this and I've done Common Sense economic bills uh across the aisles aisle before and I found that no matter which ways the political Wind Blows uh things like what Senator young and I are doing really um are appealing and make sense especially because I think a lot of my colleagues are fatigued at the Pars in gridlock down here and are looking often for common sense solutions that will help everyday Americans so I'm hopeful that this lame duck uh with uh I think the respect and influence Senator young has clearly in his Republican caucus uh and I believe that these are the kind of things that could appeal on the Democratic side that perhaps we can get a four corner deal uh done in this caucus but I'm not deterred uh even if it doesn't get done now regardless of what happens in the next uh cycle um you know again some of the best bills uh I've passed have passed on the Republican presidents and democratic presidents when they are bipartisan of this nature so again I'm a Prisoner of Hope usually uh but this time I'm even more more bullish on our ability to get something done here Senator young just go a little deeper so there's you know there's a couple big pieces of legislation you know where do you imagine I mean do you think this is going to pass on its own or do you think it becomes packaged with something larger well I think it uh is likely to pass his uh a larger bill as we approach years in we have a National Defense authorization Bill to consider uh we want to keep government funded uh there there may be uh an Omnibus sort of grab bag of of legislative items as we approach Year's End to include uh various various tax bills but this is a bill that's been vetted that's been socialized uh among people across the political spectrum that is very popular and frankly that so many of us not just its authors but uh uh you know those who've been very tangentially related to its development and passage uh have promised their constituents that we're going to act on so it really does uh make a lot of sense and I agree with Corey's uh optimism he's shown such great leadership and and uh especially uh attracting and earning Support over on on the Democratic side of that the aisle but also just articulating the value proposition here at a time of high inflation and a time of frankly a lot of concern about our nation's fiscal situation to pass a retirement Security emergency security piece of of legislation like this and and let me be clear uh the the piece of it that Corey and I are are speaking to today will cost nothing uh to taxpayers uh that's that's a pretty uh important value proposition right now there are the so-called uh eight Corners so there are eight legislative leaders in Congress for those who want a little more detail as to what's happening uh Republic chairman ranking member on the health education labor and pension committee chairman and ranking on the finance committee uh both in the U.S Senate and then over in the house it's it's the Ways and Means Committee and the Ed and labor committee which have oversight over these so so eight leaders all working together to see how they can um Advance this retirement security legislation as we have some retiring members that would like to see their Provisions in the larger secure 2.0 bill pass and see if we might get it done but if for whatever reason we fall short on account of the calendar uh I I think as we head into next year we are going to have divided government we're going to be searching for things that can actually be accomplished I would put this very high in the list of priorities and possibilities so you know to ask you one or two more questions but I'm looking at the uh the cue from our virtual audience and we've actually addressed a number of these but I think Senator young one question that kind of just building off of what you just described the question essentially is from Andrea and I'll paraphrased it seems like there's a lot of bipartisan cooperation in the Senate and then there's some Applause hands um but what's been the discussion of this in the house with all of the Notions about how majority that's going to be I mean what do you actually think that this is leader McCarthy could Advance this through a house Republican Congress well I I no longer said on the house Ways and Means Committee but I can say because that's uh one of the Committees that has jurisdiction over secure 2.0 again what Corey and I are speaking to and and uh other retirement security provisions um that's a committee where Republicans and Democrats uh tend to play very well with one another uh and and and so um I I am I'm optimistic about the possibilities there uh the late congresswoman Jackie wolorski uh republican from Indiana informed me there was a lot of support for uh secure 2.0 a number of months ago before uh her unfortunate very tragic passing so um you know just informed by that conversation and uh with conversations uh that have occurred with other members of the Indiana delegation uh I can tell you that uh I I have tempered optimism about our ability to get something done uh as we approach years and just on account of of the calendar uh I have uh high confidence that uh next Congress we can get uh secure 2.0 or some a very close variant to that past right I said we're going to pull one question uh off the string here for you and it basically says hey this is all great but what if people just don't have any money right you know with so many people in this country just getting going day to day is this really an option for you know tens of millions of Americans yeah well first of all it is an option for tens of millions of Americans it's not a cure-all to a lot of folks but um it is an incredible option for a lot of folks and we should focus on that these aren't mutually exclusive just because you're doing this doesn't mean you can't do other things to make work pay in America so again I'm like getting wins when you can uh finding ways to get good things off the table and I just want to reiterate what uh my colleague said uh which is so right look we have gotten significant things done in uh this Congress uh that people I I think weren't optimistic about but bipartisan bills and everything from the uh pact act to help our veterans didn't help all veterans but it helped veterans uh that were significantly suffering from Burn pits and other toxic areas we got uh bipartisan bill on on a science Bill investment science research the chips act uh and under President Trump we got big bills done that were bipartisan uh like our Bill the first step act helping to reform our criminal justice system to even opportunity zones which were investing in uh impact billions of dollars of new investment into low-income Rural and low-income urban areas and so this is a big step now do I not feel compelled to do more for more people yeah I'm looking at other uh solutions that we can find you know this is why I've been a champion for a long time on what was originally a bipartisan effort in the Senate far years before I came here but child savings accounts uh as as something uh to create in this country that again would Empower everybody with capital uh over time so that everybody at 18 years old could have uh depending on their income tens of thousands of dollars to Baby Bond Bill uh I think empowering people economically should be our mission and somehow in America uh since the 80s till now we've seen this terrible uh uh growth of income disparity leaving a lot of Americans as we've already discussed very vulnerable to what our unfortunately everyday emergencies Health Emergency an auto accident or more we need to begin as a society think more constructively about how to make the American bargain real for all families and I think the economic security we have in this country is leading to a lot of mental health and security it's allow making people make poor choices where they put off Medical Treatments uh because they fear they can't afford that which creates even a greater distress in the future it's not creating an environment where people are doing things like the common sense savings that Susie Orman was talking about so I I feel that there's a lot more work to do on retirement savings a lot more work to do on making work pay a lot more work to do on helping people uh afford an education but but in in Congress I've learned nine years that things are done often incrementally and this is a very very solid step to helping millions of American workers uh have a little bit more economic Financial stability in their lives I don't want to look uh you know BBC's unofficial tagline is the fierce urgency of pragmatism which is what we of course love you both um so maybe just kind of close this out give each a last word talk a little bit like you know so when this gets passed what do you think that you know the world looks like in five or ten years or anything else you'd like to share as we uh wrap up today's session Senator young you want to feed off well thank you I I think you find more people with four hundred dollars for an unexpected emergency uh significantly more uh I I think you see reduced stress uh among our weight uh Workforce on account of that I think uh to Susie orman's presentation I think you find a lot of Americans who have never really had retirement savings who who figure out that they have a retirement account that their employer is is uh putting money into and become very encouraged and excited about the possibility of retirement and and having some money for themselves perhaps even to pass on to uh their kids I think you see uh in short more short-term and long-term Financial stability for regular Americans who uh through no fault of their own uh and consistent with uh human nature uh and the demands of the moment have never really uh been uh offered all the tools that they might have been offered uh that would allow uh them to prepare for unforeseen contingencies and um a little more stability longer term Senator Booker final word yeah look I have a lot of concern you know the New York Times did a great article about the American deal and how it's changed from my father's generation to mine they looked at a janitor that worked for Xerox versus a janitor that works for Apple the janitor that worked for Xerox had really incredible benefits uh a pension uh the one that they followed had an employee assist educational assistance program where the janitor went to work every day and she worked really hard but went to school at night eventually graduated uh got recognized by someone the company moved up to middle management well the janitor that works for Apple doesn't work for Apple they work for an outsourced company where their wages are Bid down and they follow this person in a real poverty track they're working full-time uh but had to work extra jobs weren't home for their kids just the struggle every single day the constant Economic Security well this is stuff I don't have to imagine uh I when I came out of Yale law school I made a decision with my life I'm from rather relatively affluent suburbs but I decided to move into one of our nation's lowest income census tracts the 2010 census uh has where I live at fourteen thousand dollars uh in incomes I'm surrounded by janitors by cafeteria workers uh by people who are nurses assistants who do dignified important job work full-time but are stuck in an economy that puts them at severe vulnerability to economic shocks uh and often find it hard especially in the high on the New York New York City metropolitan area in a high cost area they really are an economic fragility this is something that could begin to address some of that economic fragility as we look at the larger Trends in our economy that in my generation are very different uh than when my dad came up and so this is a good step that will help a lot of folks in a community like mine where we don't mistake wealth with worth there are people that play by the rules work hard ever every single day and still find themselves struggling to make ends meet well this is a great way to go and make a difference in every big people's lives and again the wonderful thing about this nation despite the culture of contempt that often has Americans turning against each other along partisan lines as opposed to turning to each other like I think Senator young and and myself are in this case um is that we all share this common value is that people that work hard that really have grit and and and uh determination in this country should be able to thrive and have a high uh well sense of well-being um and again I think this is a way that we have found on common uh uh sort of ground uh to get our country uh more closer to that uh ideal that we have more work to do but this is something that is a no-brainer it's profoundly pragmatic and I think it portends a possibility if I don't go too far into alliteration but it poor tens of of good possibilities for more work ahead to make the American dream accessible to everybody from rural Indiana to Urban new Jersey I think this is going to help a lot of folks all right yeah thank you both for your time today but you know the words grit and determination also apply to what it takes to actually govern a divide a country and so I thank you both for your grip and determination and as you know we're of course eager to kind of help you see this thing across the line and uh I expect many of the people online today are now more engaged as well so appreciate you both and we will see you soon thank you thank you so much um and I appreciate Senator young dealing with the state like New Jersey uh which I hear has better high school basketball than Indiana all right all right easy always a burden all right thank you very much appreciate you all right thanks Corey buddy [Music] [Music] thank you

Mr. Speaker,
I rise today during Small Business Week in recognition of the entrepreneurs and small
business owners that form the foundation of our American economy. More than half of all working Americans either
own or are employed by a small business. In Congress, our job is to promote an environment
where small businesses grow and succeed, and communities and working families prosper. To do that, we need to educate our kids to
close the skills gap too many businesses face in finding the talent they need. We need to reimagine and renew our crumbling
infrastructure for the 21st Century economy. We can help small businesses invent things
here, make things here and sell them to the world. And we need to reform our immigration system
to reduce the complexity employers face when trying to legally hire talented, industrious
workers. I urge my colleagues to consider this week
what we can do to together to support American small businesses - the greatest job creation
engines of our economy..

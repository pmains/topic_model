right now we have actually thousands of constituents of mine from Clarksdale Mississippi and Greenville Mississippi and other rural hospitals throughout the state and they're living with the fear of uncertainty of their Hospital closing and it is a reality um in six months from now if their husband has a heart attack or their wife goes into labor or there's some type of a medical emergency you know they're trying to decide if they're going to be able to drive five minutes to their local hospital or a hundred miles to Memphis or Jackson Mississippi and one of the more common issues that I hear about from the rural hospitals is what they refer to as the USDA Rural development's five five review are the five five requirement they use a two different terms there but it's consistent but uh what we've figured out is the five five rule pertains to a rural development direct loan application which requires national office approval if the hospital has been in existence for less than five years or has not operated on a financially successful basis for five years immediately prior to the loan application and whether you're a National Bank Community Bank or credit union or a lender of last lender of Last Resort as USDA rural development in this case I think we can all agree that there's a need to be a level of confidence that loans will be repaid but that said the USDA is often referred to as the last lender the lender of Last Resort but hospitals with impeccable balance sheets they don't need our financing and if they do need something they get it somewhere else they don't get it from USDA so the bottom line is there are rural hospitals in Mississippi and across the country that need financing to remain operational but they just can't get it and the closure of just one rural Hospital means hundreds of jobs and puts in entire communities Lifeline at stake literally USDA or congress alone cannot eliminate all of the health care challenges facing Rural America but I really think that we can do better Madam under secretary will you commit to working with this Committee in Congress going forward to ensure the 2023 Farm Bill provides better opportunities for Rural hospitals are the best that they can be and do you have any thoughts ideas or suggestions on how we can make improvements in this area in the next Farm Bill Senator Hyde Smith thank you so much for uh for your advocacy for Rural hospitals yes I will commit to providing technical assistance to improving uh the our service to rural hospitals in your next farm bill it's a passion I think we both share recognizing that uh 135 rural hospitals have shut their doors and another 430 some are on uh are at risk of having to close I'd also like to follow up with you specifically about the USDA 55 review and we'll make sure my team does so to identify whether it's a statutory requirement or a regulatory requirement because I think you're absolutely right we've got to walk that cautious line of making sure we're making wise Investments but also being there for communities when they need it sometimes it's also about the speed of that review and I'm happy to talk through those specific examples of and what that speed looks like as well as as the national office is reviewing it

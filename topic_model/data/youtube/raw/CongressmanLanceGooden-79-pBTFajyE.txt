our next guest was there as part of the House Financial Services Committee let's welcome congressman Lance Gooden of Texas and Congressman it's good to see you thank you for joining us today thank you good morning what did you think of Mark Zuckerburg testimony yesterday well let me start positively I think markers Mark Zuckerberg is a nice guy I think he was calm cool and collected and sometimes hostile environment and he overall did a good job considering now to the actual subject matter this was supposed to be a crypto currency and it was but as some of it was a general airing of grievances by members from both sides of the aisle and at some times at times it got a little out of hand but I think members walked away from there not feeling a whole lot better with this crypto currency plan of Facebook has but one thing I was encouraged about was mr. Zuckerberg decision or his statement that if US regulators don't get on board that they will pull out of the Association that was encouraging but my message was if this is the future if America needs to be on the frontlines of innovation then let's bring this home let's have this base in the United States what was his response to that point because we've heard that from other congressmen as well you know it wasn't a total shutdown but it wasn't an eager stance to agree with me I I implored him to consider it and I think he will consider it but they seem to really be moving toward the direction of Switzerland and I don't think members of the committee will get on board as long as that's the case why why do you think they've chose Switzerland I mean that struck me as being very odd from the very beginning you know as I ask that question some ask that question one of the responses that he gave was that the companies are that her headquarter there are international it is he didn't say the word neutral but I think the thinking is it's just kind of a historic location for financial firms one a Democrat from California said don't we have quite a few headquartered companies here in the United States and I can't really get a great feel about why it's so important that they move this to Switzerland why they wouldn't want the u.s. on board and we're hearing things like we've got China competing against us it's important that we are leaders and innovation well let's be leaders from here in the USA that's absolutely something that we could do protect the dollar make this a patriotic project that everyone can get on board with

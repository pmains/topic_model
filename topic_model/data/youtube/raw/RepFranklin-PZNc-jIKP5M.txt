thank you mr chairman thank you mr sherman for your time here with us today the department's information technology and cyber security budget may not be the most riveting subject but it is certainly one of the most critical i.t undergirds every department or every part of the department whether it's protecting our defense networks from adversaries managing the dod's spectrum to ensure swift clear communication with our troops around the world or deploying it or software secure software i.t is foundational from weapons systems to financial management in an enterprise as large as the department of defense with its many missions different systems and multiple stakeholders we're fortunate there's not been a catastrophic i.t failure rendering our equipment no better than paperweights or allowing adversaries to sit in our networks and capture sensitive information i'm encouraged by the direction of the department but this is not an area where we can afford to slow down without strategic vision resourcing and investment in the workforce and buy-in from leadership in the department failure is possible the i.t and cyberspace budget represents roughly seven percent of the dod budget so every dollar must be used wisely i look forward to hearing your views and justifications for the budget and how you're using the dollars to pursue modernization efficiencies and security the department of defense has a technology deficit and unless we make both the necessary investments and prioritizations we risk weakening our national security and none of us here wants that with that mr chairman you're back

today subcommittee hearing will review the proposed replacements of the Clean Air interstate rule affectionately known as care and their clean air mercury rule camera and their economic environmental and health impacts centers again we'll have five minutes for for opening statements and I'll recognize our panel of witnesses each witness will have about five minutes for his or her opening statement and following each panel statements will have one round of questions since coming to the US Senate a decade or so ago I've made it my mission to to work with our colleagues to ensure that EPA has the right tools to clean our our air as some of you may know I've worked diligently across the aisle even with guys like like this guy through on clean air legislation to reduce deadly emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide mercury and other air toxics and in our country often times I've been asked well I'm so passionate about clean air we just start off by by giving you a couple of reasons first of all I believe I think most of us in a room believe we ought to try to treat other people the way we want to be treated and as many of you know air pollution knows no state boundaries as governor my state and in the 1990s I quickly realized that one state could do everything in its power to reduce its own air pollution but could still find itself with dirty air because of bad neighbors and many of you heard me say that the della is at the end of America's tailpipe is not just Delaware it's Maryland it's New Jersey it's Virginia it's Pennsylvania other states to the north of us but at the end of America's tailpipe in fact our Secretary of Natural Resources environmental control who's here today Collin O'Mara has said that up to ninety percent of Delaware's pollution least the air pollution comes from other states as governor I think I could have just about shut down every source of pollution in our state in Delaware would have still been in non-attainment think about that we pretty much have shut down our state and we still would have been in non-attainment and I quickly learned that and Christy Whitman my neighbor in New Jersey was mindful of the same thing and and any unhappy about being in that situation but she and I quickly learned that our neighbors dirty air meant higher health care costs for our own States my neighbors dirty air meant difficulty in attracting businesses to to our state of Delaware and my neighbors dirty air meant that we we were paying the full price for their dirty energy and that's when I realized that if we have that we had to have a national solution to address our air quality problems states can't do it alone couldn't do it then and can't do it now we're all in this together we've got to work together and we need to work with the EPA to continue cleaning up our air the second i believe it's critical for us to achieve better health care results in america for less money fact it's across the board we need to achieve better results in just about everything including health care for less money too but over the 1992 2020 time period the epa estimates that our country will see over 12 trillion dollars of health and economic benefits in the form of longer lives healthier kids and greater workforce productivity from the implementation of the Clean Air Act Clean Air Act benefits outweigh its cost by some 30 to 1 30 to 1 not a bad bang for our buck and although we've made great strides in reducing our nation's air pollution more must be done if we want to protect our children than compete an emerging global clean energy economy today we discussed two new clean air regulations the clean air transport rule and utility air toxics rule these regulations target our largest emitters of many known toxics the Cod's cancer brain defects and respiratory stress fossil fuel power plants and you've got a chart over here that this is a busy chart and but I I think it shows that in the US so that our power plant submit among other things I don't wanna almost tempted to take out my reading glasses so I could read this stuff but organics in fact I am going to take out my glasses to read this stuff in a true true sign of bipartisanship Center bra so these aren't any good but I pre I thought that I've done surgery with these glasses that's what I've heard no all right here we go sex there from power plants us power plants emission sixty percent the arsenic sixty percent of the so2 thirteen percent of the nitrous oxide thirty percent of the nickel twenty percent of the chromium fifty percent of the mercury and over fifty percent of many acid gases it's a good chart if you can read it but these toxic pollutants no thank you thank you John these toxic pollutants no no state boundary and they send thousands of our children to the hospital every day and contribute to shorter lifespans for thousands every year just one of these rules the air toxics regulation we could see from it some thirteen dollars in benefits for every dollar that we spend in compliance and again getting greater health care results for less money and that's that's being demonstrated by a chart held by is that by one of our no I say one of our interns but our interns are sitting over here making him do the Rob and do all the work but that's this a pretty good chart you I could actually read this but we're looking at the billions of of dollars in 2010 for the cost of implementation it looks like about 11 billion dollars the payoff looks like about 140 546 billion dollars that's pretty good return and as well here today thanks very much as we are today these regulations are long overdue addressing pollution that should have been cleaned up years ago maybe even decades ago we'll also hear today that we have the technology to meet these new standards in many states like Delaware has successfully implemented similar measures I look forward to hearing our testimony today on these important issues and regulations we look forward to working with the administration and with our colleagues Democrat and Republican tooken to ensure that we have even cleaner air going forward

good evening everyone we're living in bubbles and in our generalization stereotypes and labels we place people in buckets bucket after bucket so we stop seeing people as people and we start seeing them as groups we do it ourselves we do it to our enemies and we do it to people who we perceive as our enemies but no two people are the same as human beings we have a common experience in the world in terms of being human of being conscious but we have very particular experiences that give each of us annonced perspective on the world and it's on us it's on our generation to diagnose what experiences make a certain person's life choices more convenient and help them see themselves out of it see the best way to learn isn't by reading books or sitting in lectures the most important knowledge I believe is gained through human interactions through real experiences this is why I co-founded yellow talk with an Israeli at OGS to bridge the gap between or even beyond Palestine in Israel the language barrier that prevents us from understanding the other our on-demand user-friendly mobile application keeps you connected with native speakers across the world in just one click through interactive and personalized conversations you don't just learn few words here and there instead you grasp the origin of the phrase you're able to understand culture other people's point of views the way they think their habits of norms phonology tone syntax you name it all through our human interactive experience it isn't a simple task to build bridges it takes effort time and most importantly hope hope in each other you see young Palestinians hold the majority within the Palestinian people and their narrative is overwhelmed with frustration and absent of hope implications from decades of military occupation has imposed Geographic restriction social fragmentation and an overall marginalization that has effectively extinguished the prospect of a life that is deemed normal UNICEF reports that adolescent are becoming more prone to aggression rebellion risk-taking behavior frustration hopelessness and withdrawal hopelessness they are or more like we are overwhelmingly dissatisfied with our life and our future is dependent on a positive mentality a positive outlook is what is missing hope is what is missing and I'm sure everyone here has lost hope at some point I know I have I lost hope that one day I can fly out from Tel Aviv Airport or one day I can walk the streets or drive my car through cities without having to carry a permit but most importantly I lost hope in the system but the real question here is when everybody lets you down will you still make the decision to lift someone else up my message here today is be Ariella talk beta tester start learning Arabic of course and give us your feedback but more generally my message here today is not to ostracize the other but rather emphasize empathize realizing that empathy isn't about putting on someone else's shoe instead putting on someone else's wet socks and taking a really long walk this kind of empathy allows us to maintain our dignity even when the belligerent berate us this kind of empathy breeds hope enemies hell-bent on our severe UNS will become one of our bestest of friends because their animus will only make us more compassionate what empathy really does is allow us to see each other as human before we are terrorists or freedom fighters we're humans before we'll Celtics or Wizards before we're moderate liberal or conservative and it's that humanism that enables us to excavate what's left of hate and then eliminate its excessive waste it's that humanism that Edward cites so eloquently put as the only or final resistance against the inhuman practices and end justices that disfigure human history so let's make this practical with three simple items because people tend to think in threes the three pyramids the three musketeers past present future Father Son and Holy Spirit you name it so three action items and power Oh Diaz by raising awareness about the program be Ariela Tok beta tester and share your feedback visit the other side not once for tourism but twice for the experience don't just spend the day strolling down my streets and instead step so far out of your bubble or your comfort zone so that one day the world will look at you and me creating our own bubble and it doesn't matter what we call this bubble as long as we're in it together because we're human before we're Palestinians or Israelis because we're human before were Christians Muslims or Jews this will be our narrative this will be our solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict we're not here to restore faith in humanity we're here to restore humanity in faith thank you so much [Applause]

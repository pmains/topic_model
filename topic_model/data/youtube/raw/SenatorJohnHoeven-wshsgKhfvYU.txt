mr. president now's the time to get back to basics federal government does not exist for its own sake it exists for the people and if federal regulation serves no useful function for the people then it only serves to hold back our nation's prosperity and growth the so many Americans hungry for good-paying jobs now is the time to unleash our nation's economic potential by getting government out of the way it's just plain common sense to eliminate regulations that are duplicated costly and unworkable we need to get back to the basics by getting rid of those kinds of regulations and one of those regulations is the BLM methane rule now the BLM methane rule is one of those midnight regulations that the Obama administration put out as they were walking out the door this new regulation from the Bureau of Land Management or BLM imposes new rules and royalty rates on methane emissions from oil and gas production on federal and on Indian lands for those wondering why methane emissions aren't already regulated there's a simple explanation they are under the Clean Air Act the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and partnership with individual states is tasked with regulating air quality which includes methane emissions in fact states like my state of North Dakota states like the presiding officers state in Texas currently have regulatory systems in place to govern oil and gas emissions critically the North Dakota Industrial Commission has put in place flaring requirements that have successfully reduced the flaring in our state from 35 percent down to 10 percent as a result of their work this flaring reduction is a big deal because to reduce and they have a goal to take it even further this flowery reduction is a big deal because to reduce methane emissions you need to reduce flaring firing sounds complicated but it's very simple when excess gas is produced law with oil and it can't be captured that it gets burned off or flare now neither industry nor state officials like playing because it wastes natural gas waste and natural resource of which methane obviously is the main component as most Americans know obviously natural gas is a valuable commodity that's used to heat our homes and power our factories that's why both industry and the states I have worked hard to make big improvements they want to capture that natural gas not methane and that's not just in North Dakota that's other states energy producing states across the country now nationally methane emissions from oil and gas industry have been on the decline now for a number of years ok so we're already actively working at the state level under a regulatory regime where states have primacy to spend authorized by EPA to reduce natural gas plant with methane emissions already being regulated and reduced by the states and industry it's tough to figure out why this new vlm regulation has been passed and what it's accomplishing this rule has been calculated to cost up to two hundred and seventy nine billion dollars each year so each of the cost of this rule is two hundred and seventy nine million dollars a year a duplicate of rule now that's in addition to the red tape BLM estimates that the rule will impose an additional 82,000 hours of paperwork an additional 82,000 hours of paperwork these numbers might just sound like the cost of doing business if you will but Americas job creators know that it's really costing us business it's costing us economic growth and it's costing us jobs these aren't really numbers they're our livelihoods at state what makes the BLM methane rule particularly burdensome is the fact that it's simply unworkable the rule sets a maximum volume that each well can flare which will lead to a tailmon and shut-in wells meeting actually having to shut down the wells of course that decreases oil production and reduces royalty payments so we get less energy the owners get less revenue and we have less jobs meanwhile this rule treats all drilling spacing units the same regardless of whether they have minimal federal ownership or not remember a lot of these well you're trying to regulate our on minerals owned by the federal government they may also be on minerals owned by private individuals so once again you've got one of these federal one-size-fits-all regulations that just doesn't work in practice that's why regulating the natural gas the methane emissions has been delegated to the states by the EPA EPA and why it should be up to the states so the states are fighting back right Wyoming Montana and North Dakota filed a legal challenge to the rule the US District Court in Wyoming now the good news is that the states and our economy should not have to wait until this lawsuits make makes its way through the court system we can provide regulatory relief right now and we should do so through the congressional review act CRA which provides Congress with a tool to rid the nation of burdensome duplicate regulations like this one end that's what our schedule is for tomorrow to take up this CRA so I'm a co-sponsor of the CRA and we need to pass it I want to thank the chairman of our of the EPW committee senator Barrasso for his work on this issue and others the house has already passed this CRA so this has already been passed by the house president has expressed his support for it we need to pass it tomorrow we need to get this done every week I meet with North Dakotans and others who are working so hard to produce energy for this country to create jobs and a better future for their families they need and deserve a federal government that stand in their way this is a basic but fundamental objective and a good place to reduce that regulatory burden to get our economy going to create more economic growth more jobs higher income levels is by reducing the regulatory burden and this is a great example again it's just about common sense it's about empowering the states let's take a state's first approach a state's primacy approach in terms of this kind of regulation how we produce energy in Texas or North Dakota or Ohio or Pennsylvania or Washington State it's different across the country you can't have a federal one-size-fits-all rule that's why it needs to be left up to the states we have a chance tomorrow to pass this measure and it is exactly the kind of measure that will help reduce that regulatory burden help us grow our economy and help us create good jobs I urge my colleagues to join with us and pass this CRA with that mr. president I yield the floor in the absence of a qualm

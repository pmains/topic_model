well here now with more is the author of the new book Only the Strong which is a great cover right there Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton Senator cotton great to be with you again uh you know what's what's interesting is that you you get these whistleblower reports we see this uh in some of the messaging of generals and and others who are you know faces for television and commentary and we wonder if in fact you know we're preparing everyone to know what to do with pronouns but when it comes to dealing with the Chinese Communist party or Iran or Russia that they really won't know what to do uh can you fill us in here yeah Tammy it's a real problem it doesn't just distract from the training Focus that our young men and women in uniform need uh it shows divisions among them as well you know I wore that uniform years ago and I can tell you the colors that mattered to me and my soldiers my superiors my subordinates was not wide it wasn't black it wasn't Brown it was the red white and blue that we all wore on our shoulder and that we had all taken an oath to defend and we were battle buddies irrespective of our race it has also contributed uh to a severe recruiting and retention crisis in our military as well basically every service missed its targets for the fiscal year that just ended and I'm afraid that's going to get worse because the kinds of young men and women who are attracted to military service join because they want to serve that flag they want to learn how to defend America and kill the bad guys they don't want to waste their time learning how to use the right pronouns so it's a real problem in our military we're going to be able to address it more than we have over the last two years with the new Republican house but what we really will need in two years is a strong Republican president new secretary of defense will make sure that our military remains laser focused on training our young men and women in uniform to fight and win our nation's worse you know this is I think I think people realize now with everything we've experienced in the country that this isn't about all roads leading to Rome and that we just have different styles about how we get to Rome that this really is about whether we have a future or not I you know since Afghanistan Russia was emboldened to go into Ukraine because there was some sense that that was going to be fine Iran is making noise at Saudi Arabia they're calling Biden names North Korea is sending you know dozen of missiles of you know that could mistakenly hit Tokyo if one goes errant and of course China the Chinese Communist party this this becomes an existential threat if one of those actors moves the commander-in-chief doesn't know what to do and our military in general not being ready I can't recall with the exception of during Jimmy Carter's time an era when this was the case yeah Tammy it's very worrisome the military is a special a unique institution really in our country it's not a college campus it's not a Fortune 100 company if those institutions get infested with liberal political correctness and Social Engineering also maybe the president's office gets occupied by a bunch of student radicals or maybe a stock price takes a hit but for our military people die and our national security is imperiled and you're right as I explained in Only the Strong that our military has faced consistent budget cuts under every Democratic president since Jimmy Carter it's only gotten worse under President Obama and Joe Biden which is really Barack Obama's third term right and it's not just the budget it is this focus on left-wing social priorities as opposed to training our young men and women to fight and win our nation's worse and you have a sense that there's things we we can do you know obviously with the new house and perhaps even in the Senate to shift this because we don't want to be caught when there's the emergency and we're just not ready yeah I do Tammy you know we've tried to tackle some of these issues over the last two years it hasn't been easy with Democrats in control of Congress but with Republicans now in control of the house I can work with great Republican members over there like Jim Banks or Mike Gallagher veterans themselves to advance some of these priorities we can uh kind of get some forward momentum and then with a new Republican president and Secretary of Defense I'm very confident we can turn around quickly because again the military is unique it does have a chain of command that can move very quickly with strong leadership thank God it has strong leadership in You Only the Strong great time for Christmas and maybe even some presents during in between thank you sir for joining us I appreciate it Senator cotton

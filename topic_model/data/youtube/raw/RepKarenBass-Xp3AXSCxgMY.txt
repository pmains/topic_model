we start with congresswoman karen bass democrat of california she's the former chairwoman of the congressional black caucus who reintroduced the george floyd justice in policing act congresswoman let me go right to it you heard as did i president biden's remark on the chauvin verdict in which he called systematic racism a quote staying on the nation i want to play some of what your congressional colleague republican senator lindsey graham had to say about president biden's response this morning with fox news please take a listen we just elected a two-term african-american president the vice president is of african-american indian descent so our systems are not racist america is not a racist country so this attack on police and policing reform the police yes call them all racists no a mouthful your thoughts congresswoman well first of all we know that systemic racism absolutely exists i'm not exactly sure why senator graham said that but one of the most challenging things about our country is that it's extremely difficult to deal with the problem if you refuse to admit that the problem exists you can look at each of our systems education health care the environment housing go down the line and you can find historic legislation that was passed that absolutely discriminates sometimes that legislation was reversed but the impact of that legislation still holds and you know that housing was a a first example of that not a first but one of many when suburbs were built it explicitly said that federal dollars could not be accessed by african americans and other folks of color why do we have disproportionate rates of death with covet inequality in education down the line so i think it's very hurtful when you just flat out deny something that is so obvious that finally the nation is awakening to so i didn't think his comments were constructive in any way shape or form it also made me wonder does he even understand what systemic racism means because to have an election of a president and a vice president doesn't address the systemic institutional racism baked into the system that has to be brought out he may know but he certainly didn't answer what the president said he didn't address systemic racism at all that's like a corporation having a racism in the corporation and you say but we have a black on this on the c-suite floor that doesn't answer the question about how you run the company but i i want to pivot to another of your congressional colleagues and that's south carolina's other republican senator tim scott who's in the political spotlight right now ahead of his response to president biden's first congressional address he's also the gop's point person on police reform leading their push for a compromise on the floyd act in the senate now i know how much you respect the senator himself defending him just yesterday uh in the press over inconsistencies in his personal narrative but i wonder if you could legitimately see his party elevating him to become their first post-trump face or more cynically is he just their version of the right face for this moment well uh rev i have absolutely no idea what i do know is is that he's been absolutely straight and a good partner to work with on the policing issue and he might be a republican but he's a black man and he's has his own experience with policing and so my focus is making sure that we can get the job done and this bill on the president's desk you know i'm talking about a deadline of may 25th but there's no reason why it should even take that long we've already done a lot of work may 25th sadly is the anniversary of mr floyd's death and and uh in my conversations with uh scott over the uh last couple of years he has brought up his own experiences and maybe he's the only one that could talk to some of his colleagues uh time will tell congresswoman bass uh why did you recently join the lawsuit that several of your democratic colleagues and civil rights groups have brought against our former president over the january sixth insurrection explain why you joined in well i mean i think that we need to do all we can to take the mask off of what happened on january 6 because that is going to go down in history as the first time we really didn't have a full peaceful transfer of power and i think that there were a lot of elements behind it the organized right wing white supremacist groups and to me anything that we can do either legislatively through a lawsuit through a select committee we have to get to the bottom of what is going on in our country because this is not going away there is a right wing movement in this country that we need to pay serious attention to they are clear that they are armed they are trained you know that there was a lot of law enforcement officers there there were military members active and retired uh that were there there were even legislators that were there and so with all of that going on we have to get to the bottom of it and so i was happy that the naacp brought the suit i think it's quite ironic that it's the ku klux klan suit that says a lot um and i'm hoping that it will be a vehicle to get to the bottom of what happened on january 6. i'm out of time but i want to pivot back for a moment to the a question of the floyd act because one of the sticky points that we're hearing and now i'm talking with my head on as head of nash network with part of the civil rights group fighting to see uh this uh bill passed is that one of the sticky points is qualified immunity and a lot of us not wanting to see a compromise in that area explain why that's so important and explain why you've been fighting to make sure we end qualified immunity well first of all i think that the police officers in the republican party generated a lot of hysteria around qualified immunity as though if we remove immunity from officers so that they can be sued by people who they victimize that now no one is going to want to be a police officer police officers are going to retire and what i say back to them is that until we find a way to hold officers accountable so that officers like derek shovin don't think that he can kill someone and look at a camera and not think that anything is going to happen to them then officers and the profession is going to be demonized we need to have reforms so that people embrace policing not not shun it which is what's happening now and anyone that wants to look at a camera and not be held accountable shouldn't be a policeman i mean the argument is like we should have people like that on the force congresswoman karen best thank you for being with us this evening

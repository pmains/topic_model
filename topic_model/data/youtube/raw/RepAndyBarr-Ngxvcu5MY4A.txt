as congressman luke meyer pointed out in december i led a letter to you with 46 of my house republican colleagues outlining some of the methodological challenges with injecting climate change scenarios into supervisory stress tests we urged you to take a measured thoughtful data-driven approach as you study climate impacts while some on the other side have urged the fed to stray outside its mandate and take a more active role in fighting climate change in your response you stated and this is it your response you stated that quote congress has entrusted the job of directly addressing climate risks to a number of federal agencies not including the federal reserve end quote and that you'll consider climate impacts only when doing so falls within your congressionally directed mandates in january the fed announced the creation of the supervision climate committee led by kevin in a press release about the styro announcement new york fed president williams said quote climate change has become one of the major challenges we face which impacts all aspects of the fed's mission president william's statement seems contrary to the stated board position from your letter and your response to me can you please clarify his statement and how the new scc fits within the board's limited mandate so i i'm not familiar with the context or or that statement um i'll just say though that um we we do see uh the job of the of the supervision climate committee and our job frankly is to assure that the institutions that we regulate and supervise are resilient to all the risks they face and that includes climate risk that's a conversation we're having and by the way all of the large and medium-sized financial institutions are already having that conversation too let's let's drill down a little bit about how expansive the fed will get into this because as you as you know the fed recently joined as a member of the network for the greening of the financial system the ngfs has made some recommendations that if implemented in the united states could have harmful effects on u.s banks and the businesses they serve our letter asked that you not import any ngfs standards that would harm the financial system or u.s businesses and in your response you committed to this how do you plan to evaluate ngfs proposals through the length of upholding this commitment well as as i said in the letter as my colleague and i said in the letter we you know we're not going to import anything into the united states that we don't think is appropriate for the betterment and support and uh safety and soundness of the uh you know of the us financial system but we're actually at a much earlier stage than any of that that conversation would suggest we're really engaged in outreach and in thinking about frameworks we're talking to these institutions we're talking to uh supervisory institutions here in the united states and around the world so we're at in an earlier stage then well i i suggest and that's that's good to hear but i do worry that injecting climate risk scenarios into stress tests could perpetuate the trend of debanking legally operating businesses like fossil fuels in your letter you commit that the fed will not dictate what lawful industries regulated firms can serve even without a directive from the fed climate scenarios and stress tests may compel firms to de-bank certain industries to satisfy the spirit of the tests my comment here is that limiting capital allocation to specific industries may itself have implications on financial stability and economic growth through lost jobs higher energy prices and compromised energy security and final point here i would like the fed to keep in mind that choking off capital to fossil energy will not only produce the kind of reliability challenges we saw last week in texas it will undermine the fed's maximum employment mandate

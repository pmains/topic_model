our next guest was deployed iraq texas gop congress uh congressional candidate he's got the republican nomination uh certain to win wesley hunt so uh wesley your reaction to the unrest in afghanistan in iraq al sadr once our chief enemy is the least bad alternative and he just said i quit politics what do we make of this you know this is kind of the case of the enemy and my enemy now becomes my friend and and weakness that we've seen from this about from the bite administration invites war but strength deters war and this is the weakest president that we've seen in my lifetime this is the weakest president that we've seen in modern history look i flew 55 combinator missions in baghdad in 2006. i flew over sauder city multiple times so i understand what services sacrifice means for us and no one service should ever be taken for granted and put in vain but we have a current president that welcomed home 13 of our fallen soldiers after the debacle that was the afghanistan withdrawal and what was he doing he was checking his watch as if he was preparing for his afternoon nap and see this is a problem the world sees this and the world understands that if america doesn't want to leave from the front then that means that they can take advantage of us and for four years under the trump administration we had peace in the middle east we had the abraham accords everything was going just fine because we were literally leading from a position of strength and now every day we wake up in the morning we have to see what's going to happen in afghanistan what's going to happen in iraq what's going to happen with russia and the ukraine what's going to happen with china and taiwan and it's time for us to end this nightmare in this front we're watching now split the screen this happened yesterday that's the pool in the palace uh where they just stormed and took it over so keep in mind the iraqis are pushing back against the iranians and what are we about to do for iran alleviate all the sanctions cut an extremely bad deal let billions pour in some from our banks and i'll let them go about sell oil on the in the world community what do you think that's going to do to places like iraq we are empowering bad actors iran is a bad actor we are now allowing iran and giving them a path to have a nuclear weapon again after we know absolutely that they are going to target not only our allies they're going to target us and they're going to target israel they're going to target the world but also we look at the weakness that we have shown with russia and vladimir putin and the ukraine we've now empowered their energy policy as well and as somebody like me that's right here in the energy capital the world here in houston texas our energy policy for the last year has put the entire world at risk that's true and we could be flooding europe with much-needed energy and natural gas we're not even trying yes and they're going to freeze to death this summer this winter so west point decided uh to take down all semblances of confederate soldiers including robert e lee uh who had a rich history on it and to the point where the union was trying to recruit him to lead their army he chose the confederates so they're taking down his photo what's your reaction you went to west point this makes me very sad not only did i go to west point my brother my sister and i all matriculated through west point and at one point i actually lived in robert e lee barracks and i remember walking underneath the threshold of that building every single day and and filling myself with filling myself up with so much pride because i was like wow we have come a long way and i am not defined by the name on a building or by a statue or by a photo i am defined by being an american i am defined by showing the progress and being the very definition of the progress and the civil war and i'm living in the barracks of a general that fought against the rights of people that looked like me this is something that shouldn't be celebrated this is amazing and if the building and if that name were anything different then i wouldn't have this perspective we've got to stop this in this country we have to understand that we are all imperfect and if we want to name every building and statue and every road after a perfect person everything would be named jesus christ let's be honest let's talk about the progress that we have made over the years let's not whitewash this let's not change the name on buildings let's talk about our history and learn from it right all of a sudden in 2022 we don't want to do what they decided to do in 1865 and that is come together as a country and not forget about our past no one embraces slavery but it's part of our past robert e lee had fought brilliantly up until that point where he made that uh terrible decision to lead the wrong side of the war uh wesley hunt thanks so much let's talk about it yup let's talk about it and especially for a guy who served our country and went to that school appreciate it thanks my best luck in the general

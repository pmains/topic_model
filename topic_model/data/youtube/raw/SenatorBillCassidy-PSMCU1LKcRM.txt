let's bring in louisiana senator bill cassidy for more on this so the chicago mayor saying she welcomes the migrants but at the same time slamming greg abbott her office in a statement saying unfortunately texas governor greg abbott is without shame or humanity we know that racism discrimination and human cruelty have played a pivotal role in how immigrants are received within our borders was still working to recover from the previous presidential administration which encouraged this behavior your thoughts senator that that statement is so totally divorced from reality by the way in louisiana ice has taken people from the border distributing them across our state and church groups know they're coming but oftentimes they arrive unannounced so now it comes to chicago and there's a complaint from the mayor who officially welcomes this there's just an irony here an irony and an hypocrisy that's just on top of each other john yeah now greg abbott's point and doug ducey of arizona as well is that the federal government hasn't been doing anything to stop people from walking across the border despite what the press secretary said and that texas and arizona are going to share the burden here with other cities across the country mayor lightfoot eric adams of new york muriel bowser all proclaiming that they have sanctuary cities but at the same time slamming abbot but not slamming the federal government which has been flying illegal migrants to cities across the country for years abbott is doing the country of favor he is bringing this issue to the doorstep of elected officials and the people they represent it's no longer just mcallen texas if you think chicago and new york are going to have a problem imagine mcallen imagine alexandria louisiana and yet now that it goes to a city of i don't know eight eight million people and they get a thousand in new york and they don't know what to do with it it brings it home it forces other media outlets besides fox to acknowledge the problem let me let me switch gears and ask you about fentanyl because you have introduced the halt fentanyl act which would address the situation parents across america apoplectic that their child might get one pill over the internet take it and die yet the white house doesn't seem to have a plan to address this particularly the component where so much of this fentanyl is coming across the border you said shift gears you didn't shift gears at all because when i went to the border the border patrol said oh yeah here will come a whole bunch of folks trying to come across illegally the cartels know that attracts our border agents and then they sneak the drugs in over here the amount of drugs they're sneaking is astronomical again i was in central louisiana two days ago sheriff says we just confiscated 10 pounds of fentanyl now 10 pounds could kill everybody it doesn't sound like a lot but it is when a small amount can kill you that is a huge amount this is part and parcel of this almost open border policy that the administration effectively has adopted so our peter juicy yesterday had an exchange with the press secretary corrine jean-pierre about what the federal government was doing to address this problem she didn't seem to have a lot of answers listen here 300 overdoses a day now we know how the fentanyl is coming into the country it's coming right across the southern border when is the president going to do something you have seen a 200 percent increase of fentanyl seizures which means that we are we are doing the job of catching drug traffickers we are securing the border uh the fact that we are securing record levels of funding uh from dhs so they can stop illicit drugs from entering into the country look what's up 300 overdoses this is being designed to target children drug cartels in mexico want to kill american kids what is this president doing about it to say that we're not doing enough peter it's just falsely categorically wrong senator is the biden administration doing enough the number of fentanyl overdoses is increasing that of itself is evidence that they are not and there are other things that they could do again the more that you have tools that stop people from coming over the border you also have those tools to keep illegal drugs coming across the border when they use everything in their toolbox to do that i'll believe they're doing all they can and of course when you see now that these fentanyl pills are coming in multi-colors they look like smarties they look like sweet tarts clearly aimed toward children you know the deadly scourge that is gripping our country is just getting worse by the day senator great of you to come in good to see you thank you thank you appreciate it my best to

I'm done with Washington politician Tim Walz who voted for obama-care but doesn't live under the law like the rest of us walls uses a special 75% taxpayer subsidy established only four members of Congress to pay for his insurance meanwhile Obamacare is destroying my family's health care we lost our doctor lost our plan and now our premiums cost more than our mortgage it's time for a new congressman I'm voting for Jim Hagedorn on november eight I'm Jim Hagedorn and I approve this message paid for by friends of Hagedorn

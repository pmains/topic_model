madam speaker it's unfortunate that we're here again today to pass another continuing resolution i know that the appropriators on both sides of the aisle want to get a full fiscal year 2022 omnibus done as soon as possible i want to thank chair delora for her tireless effort to negotiate a bipartisan agreement with the senate we have to pass the cr today because america simply cannot afford a shutdown the shutdown would have a disastrous impact on our continuing economic recovery it would diminish our ability to fight the covet 19 pandemic and europe is facing one of the greatest threats since the end of world war ii our federal government should be sending a strong unified message to vladimir putin that we stand united with our european allies as chair of the defense appropriations subcommittee i want to highlight a critical life health and safety provision in this cr for our brothers and sisters in hawaii the fuel leak that occurred at the red hill bulk storage facility in hawaii last november is nothing short of an environmental catastrophe one that has impacted thousands of residents this bill should have never happened and congress will hold the department of defense accountable to make this right today we provide an additional 350 million dollars for the department and the services to continue their efforts to address this crisis i want to thank my colleagues from hawaii for leading on this issue especially representative case who also joins and serves with us on the appropriation committee you'll hear from him later you have my commitment that our subcommittee will do everything we can to stay on top of this the people in hawaii impacted by the spill deserve clean drinking water they deserve to know that their drinking water will be secure it's just one more reason to support the cra today and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote yes let's keep the government open and get the full omnibus across the finish line i yield back the balance of my time

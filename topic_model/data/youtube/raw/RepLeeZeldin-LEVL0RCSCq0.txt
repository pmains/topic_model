well thank you mr.speaker and it is a privilege to serve on the House Foreign Affairs Committee a great bipartisan Committee under the leadership of chairman Royce and the ranking member eliot engel and i'm very grateful that they brought this legislation to the House floor for consideration today as a co-chair of the House Republican Israel caucus the original co-sponsor on this piece of legislation I would strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support this important bill and I'm thinking of values what drove Taylor forced to sign up for the United States Military Academy at West Point to deploy into combat to protect and defend our freedoms and liberties willing to lay it all on the line willing to risk everything for our flag for our constitution not just for family back home he's joined here he's certainly with us in spirit with his parents Stuart and Robbie who are in the gallery and they know that the legacy of Taylor forces service and sacrifice is one that already is showing a change in policy in the interactions between our nation and those in that region because as we think of values the values of the Palestinian authorities one that incites violence that financially rewards terrorism that treats terrorists like they are heads of state in their interference and calls them martyrs I stand with Taylor force the House Foreign Affairs Committee stands with Taylor force this entire body hopefully when this comes to a vote stands with the parents of Taylor force and are effective in better leveraging our money because we should not provide $1 of United States taxpayer funds if that money is going to go towards not only inciting violence but also financially rewarding terrorism United States taxpayers not only want to make sure that their money isn't going to financially reward Palestinian terrorists when they murder innocent Israelis but this is also about Americans US tax dollars going to an entity that financially rewards terror I was moved greatly as I was listening to the chairwoman emeritus Ileana ros-lehtinen remarks and the need to use all resources that are available to stand shoulder to shoulder with our nation's greatest ally and change behavior of those bad actors those are the values we stand with taylor force

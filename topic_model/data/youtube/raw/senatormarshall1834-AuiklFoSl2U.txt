Mr Speaker I rise today to emphasize the need for broadband development in rural communities more and more we see a transition from brick-and-mortar to click and mortar establishments with the world quickly moving from paper to digital in rural America the digital divide is becoming increasingly present from limited connection speeds two locations entirely without service these communities are lacking the same basic abilities as their urban counterparts I'm encouraged to see so many conversations happening in and around the hill related to removing the barriers to connecting Americans but there's still a lot of work to be done I applaud the efforts of President Trump chairman PI and Agriculture Secretary Purdue and making rural broadband deployment a national priority as we head into 2018 and hope that my colleagues here in Congress will remember that all Americans deserve reasonable and comparable service now to where in the country they live Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back

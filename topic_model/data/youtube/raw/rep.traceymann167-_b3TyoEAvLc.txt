mr speaker i rise today to speak about my heroes america's farmers ranchers and agriculture producers these people are my family my friends my neighbors and my ancestors i came to this congress to defend agriculture because the time i spent on the farm with my father brother and grandfather growing up taught me the most important lessons i've ever learned agriculture's core values are the same as america's hard work self-determination responsibility creativity others before self and prayer therefore if america is going to thrive agriculture must thrive of all the hard-working resilient people in our country agriculture producers face more challenges and uncertainty than most of us can imagine as they strive to feed fuel and clothe our nation every day a late winter snow storm here in washington d.c means a frustrating commute to work in kansas where it's snowing right now it means essential moisture for the soil better hopes for the spring profits that might let you buy the tractor you've been needing for two years now and if there's some money left over an extra birthday present for your daughter in july kansas owned president eisenhower said quote farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand miles from a cornfield in congress we deal with the laws of our land and that's important but farmers are the caretakers of the land itself american farmers built our history sustain our present and secure future in the early 1930s america was suffering from food insecurity best in congress woke up realized that above all other concerns we need to eat to survive and drafted the first ever farm bill now nearly a hundred years later america is the most food secure country in the world because of the strength of our ag producers so when congress gets the opportunity to reauthorize the farm bill every five years we need to think carefully and critically about the extent and nature of our investment in agriculture because it's an investment in both the immediate and the long-term health of our nation agriculture is also about freedom is extremely difficult for a nation to be free if it relies on another for its food therefore it is essential to america's future that we get ag policy right so we never ever have to depend on another for our food or our freedom over the next several months as we gear for the 2023 reauthorization of the farm bill i'll be standing to share some of my thoughts ideas and amendments on that legislation on behalf of my constituents and every american farmer rancher and ag producers i want to say unequivocably that i will do everything within my power to ensure that the 2023 farm bill invests powerfully in agriculture america's future depends on it thank you mr speaker with that i yield back

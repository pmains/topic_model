that's for one minute i thank my friend for yelling and madam speaker you know the ppp program came out in astonishing speed the president and the secretary implemented the legislation we passed bipartisan and astonishing speed but there there were criteria to get the money because we're spending 350 billion dollars and i did have smaller banks and smaller businesses who did not have experience working with the sba with the federal government who needed to come up to speed and i think all of us hopefully were home and i certainly was talking to our small businesses our small banks getting them online and getting them ready had small businesses saying i don't have my 2019 taxes prepared yet and i have to have that to show my income for 2019. but it all came together right before we ran out of money at least in my district everybody was in the portal or the small businesses were ready and that's what we wanted was the 250 billion to go forward keep the program running they would be flush today and do the things that we're doing now today they're important too they're bipartisan we agree but we didn't have to have this interlude so help is on the way our small businesses are now ready it did take some time for some smaller banks and smaller businesses but i'm proud to say they're ready and i'm proud to vote for this bill today thank you and i yield back

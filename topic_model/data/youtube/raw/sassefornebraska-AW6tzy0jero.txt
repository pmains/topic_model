and sean hannity here with a highlight from my radio show today right here on i heart radio shawn's got more behind-the-scenes information more contacts than anybody more friends behind the curtain sean hannity is on the farmer getting up at four to start the day the single mom heading a third job so her daughter can do volleyball camp the pastor driving 40 miles plus some folks need a little help that's nebraska these stories aren't really all that uncommon it's just who we are nebraska's ben sass grew up working in the fields son of a football coach later he led the team that saved midland from bankruptcy ben thinks government can do better for people with dirt under their fingernails he'll tackle the big stuff put the shouting aside and just get to work ben and melissa are raising their kids about a mile from where he grew up teaching them that hard work's a blessing just like his dad taught him ben's nebraska i'm ben sasse and i approve this message all right 25 till the top of the hour as we are now three weeks to the day away from the midterm elections one of the more important senate races we're following is in the great state of nebraska that ad by senate candidate ben sass an open seat now uh is uh well he's a fifth generation nebraskan and um he uh joins us now how are you sean i'm doing well thanks for having me on yeah now you you were what the uh president of the 130 year old midland university in 2009 and tell me about that yeah so i'm a college president in my hometown 130 year old school that was doing everything we could to go bankrupt five years ago and i do crisis and turn around phase stuff and the school that i grew up going to sports camps at and my parents met at my grandpa who never went to college worked at for 33 years so another kid i kind of grew up on this campus it was going to declare bankruptcy and they asked me to lead a turnaround project and we've been real fortunate we're one of the fastest growing schools in the country now oh that's pretty pretty awesome so how do you view the race going on there by all indications you're winning by a pretty healthy margin how do you feel about you know we've had a great year uh we don't pay a ton of attention to the polls but we have three little kids and we've lived on a bus for 13 months and it now smells horrible and we've replaced the transmission and the this and the bad enough times it's like george washington's axe we've replaced every part of our bus over the year but we've gotten to spend the whole year traveling to 93 counties in nebraska and our people are serious people and they'd like a washington that fixes the bigger stuff instead of trying to micromanage every aspect of life and it's pretty encouraging to spend time in real america so what are people telling you is you go out and talk to people all around nebraska by the way i've been to nebraska a whole bunch of times i remember by the way flying over omaha after your big flood that shocked me i mean because we paid so much attention as a country to everything that had happened after katrina and i remember looking i mean it was devastating and we heard almost nothing about it it really was incredible the 2011 version i think you're probably talking about yeah uh we uh the iowa side of the missouri river just decimated um and and even in nebraska we had had a ton of damage but been been great recovery since then but it is it is a beautiful state and you need to come again and we'll take you to the college world series in june oh you know what i know all about it um i uh if you ask me how i describe myself politically i will answer i am a reagan conservative how would you answer the question yeah i think i'd say some version of the same thing obviously a lot of our voters were trying to appeal to young folks as well and conservatives and and mercanoin republicans haven't done enough of that persuading the next generation to join our party so i often talk about a constructive conservative or a common sense conservative but i believe in the private sector first not just for-profit institutions obviously that but civil society and mediating institutions life contrary to what president obama sadly said a couple years ago americans believe that you did build that world view and of the government that's required the vast majority of it should be delivered at the state and local level and washington has important responsibilities but it's a short list of enumerated powers and i think common sense people who work in the real world believe that stuff and we have to go out and tell the story more effectively to win them to our cause yeah i almost didn't put you on the program and i don't mean to be insulting here because there are so many races that are just that much closer your real clear political average lead over your democratic opponent is 22 points you are up 27 in the in the latest new york times poll that came out cbs new york times and you're up in rasmussen but that was kind of an older poll but what do you why is your race a runaway race do you think what is different about your race than say the races we're following in in colorado although cory gardner is now up by seven or louisiana or arkansas or bigots uh who's gonna go down i think in alaska and and joni ernst is just up by 1.2 points in iowa kay hagen it's a two-point race in north carolina why do you think your race is so lopsided in your favor well you know first of all 21 days to go and voters in nebraska get to make that decision and i've never run for anything before so i want to give you all the qualifications about us not and take not taking anything for granted but i i do feel blessed to live in a state where the work ethic is still pounding in lots and lots of chess um people understand that the meaning of america is about the things that you build and we have so many people who've grown up working in the fields walking beans into tesla and corn and uh you know helping with the cow calf operations uh nebraska's the largest cattle state union uh when you put all that together people know that if you don't get your crops in on time in the spring you're not going to get them harvested before the freeze in the fall and no government bureaucrat can write a different rule to change that outcome so there's a seriousness about our people that make us just dispositionally conservative so we're grateful for that but i think one of the things that you've also seen practically in our campaign again i'm a 42 year old non-politician so i've never done this before so there's a lot i don't know but we have pounded the ground in 93 counties we did an all-town hall strategy we had a very competitive uh primary had five good guys in our republican primary and uh one was the richest guy running in america this cycle and another started with 85 name id and i had three percent name id so nobody knew us and so we just decided we were going to live and go talk to nebraskans all day every day and nobody's ever really run this aggressive a grassroots campaign in nebraska and we've brought out a lot of people who you know are dispositionally inclined to vote for republican presidential candidates but really turned off by both political parties and we've got a whole bunch of folks supporting our cause because they really do believe the country's um imperiled but they're skeptical of the republican party but they're now supporting our project well i you couldn't have said i couldn't have said that any better you know that you're describing the reason that i love middle america i wish and this may sound strange as a kid that grew up in long island new york and and i've lived around the country quite a bit i lived in rhode island five years california five years alabama two years atlanta four years so and i've gotten to travel to every state in the in the union but alaska which i've never been to yet and i i really it was an education for me to travel around the country because uh i wish i grew up on a farm like you're describing i wish i i did some of the uh the the corn uh stuff that you're talking about i wish i raised cattle a little bit because there's something about really going back to i think the roots of where things come from um it's just it's it's just invigorating to me i mean i the fact that i started as a dishwasher and a cook and a busboy and a bartender and a and a painter and a contractor you know i think really is it's that's the better part of me does that make sense yeah i think real well stated that you were kind to play at the beginning of the segment uh the new commercial we have up yeah folks can watch it kind of like paul harvey i felt like i was then that's why paul harvey was so popular yes sap nebraska spelled out is a way to uh see the see the whole commercial but we think that the work ethic is exactly uh what you were talking about there that is where um you know when you go to a town hall and you let people talk not about politics first but you say what are you most worried about in the country moms and grandmas will stand up and they'll say you know i got a kid and all he does is play video games and i worry that we're not passing along the meeting of america to the next generation there's some things that shows that i feel the same way i i honestly i worry more about my kids let me let me tell you i put out what i call the conservative solution caucus i did this in the early part of the year and i'm asking every candidate that comes on the program it shouldn't be a surprise question for you i think and and this is separate from national security which i'll ask you about but in terms of getting 50 million americans out of poverty 50 million americans off of food stamps increasing the labor participation rate which is at a 40-year low i think there are things we should do one is stop robbing from our kids and that means balance our budget i like the mac penny plan i think we need an alternative a consensus conservative alternative to obamacare that to me is health care savings accounts we see north dakota unemployment as virtually zero um we've got to go towards energy independence the government is an obstacle in that in that process we need to secure our borders first and i believe schools are failing our kids i think we need choice in education to raise the next generation of of of innovators what are your top five items yeah it's darn close to yours uh so i'm familiar with your your proposals and i'm i'm on board um first of all we're on a pathway toward a greek style that decline crisis uh and there's 68 percent unemployment in the under 30 population in greece not kids but job seekers under 30. and you know this isn't the fault of the hard-working people of athens and corinth this is a political class it was vacuous and didn't tell the truth and eventually debt and credit market said well now we need to charge you an interest rate commence throat with your responsibility that's our future unless we lead our way out of it so we need entitlement reform uh number two uh we need a foreign policy that's coherent that does prioritize the us national security interests you've got to secure borders you've got to have coherence about the fact that when we're cautious about making alliances but once you do um israel versus hamas there's no moral equivalency one side is killing women shooting at women and children and the other side is doing it by hiding missile launch sites behind women and school children in you know schools and hospitals i don't understand why more people don't get that i'm with you the european media is the worst but the american media is almost as bad and just plain playing this you know solid philosophy class game about it all when prime minister netanyahu's great quote this summer uh if if israel would lay down its weapons there would be no israel and we all know that if hamas would lay down its weapons there'd be no war um we need to have a foreign policy that's coherent that's the pragmatic realism that goes slow about making commitments but plans to defend u.s national security interests unequivocally obviously your education point about choice uh we're going to need to become a nation of lifelong learners kids graduating from my college this last summer demographers and economists will tell you they're not just going to change jobs they're going to change industries three times in their first 10 years out of school and if they're not prepared to strive for towards self-sufficiency and recognizing that right now we have federal monies in the higher ed space and local monies in the k-12 space that are driven primarily by a desire for incumbent institutions to succeed and not have to make hard choices not kids and poor families to get choice and opportunity we're not going to fix this problem until we empower our students and empower our families with more choices and then we need regulatory reform what happens right now in the i have a pen and i have a phone world view of this executive branch i can't believe how short-sighted democrats are in not realizing that they should be standing for three separate but equal branches of government to check and balance one another because the next time we have a republican president we're probably going to have a problem of a republican president who's going to be just as drunk with executive branch imperialism and unilateralism as this president and we need to persuade some democrats to join with us in defense of american skepticism of consolidation of power so my agenda is really tightly like yours energy independence is right up there as well i gotta tell you um we've been interviewing a lot of senate candidates i think by far you're the most impressive person i've interviewed i am i am pleasantly shocked and i don't mean that to be insulting to the other people there's some good people running um i think you know the fact that you have no political background is stunning to me because and maybe that's your greatest asset but um i'm i'm i'm glad you sound like a ben carson to me um i think that message is going to resonate and i think you will instantly i predict not only win your race but i think you'll instantly become a leader of ideas and solutions in the senate and i have the same admonition as you do for the republicans i think they've been timid and weak and visionless and uh unless they get their act together they're going to lose people like me yeah i i hear well thanks for the kind words and we've we've got to be i got to move to nebraska i'm going to buy a ranch in texas now you make well you still have a state tax in nebraska i'm not going to nebraska unfortunately we do solve the state tax but we we also are the largest cattle state in the union now so i want your texas listeners to go to bend for nebraska.com and check us out too but you should still come to the ranch listen i to i said to governor perry one day i said i want to buy a little ranch in uh texas he goes yeah we got a ten thousand acre one i said no no i want a baby infant ranch i just want like 15 heads of cattle all right listen very impressive uh godspeed in what you're doing and uh for those of you in nebraska uh it's

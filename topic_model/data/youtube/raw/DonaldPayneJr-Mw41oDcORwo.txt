hi I'm congressman Donald Payne jr. this Black History Month as we honor the contributions of african-americans clear shaped the history of this nation we must remember what's at stake the Trump administration is spiraling this nation backward away from the progress we have made toward equality and freedom for all we can't go back to the days of Jim Crow when minorities were treated as second-class citizens we have made too many advances in the Equality of civil rights to go backward that is why we must all become champions of Justice and fight for a fairer country for all of our fellow Americans people like Carolyn Wallace the executive director of the international youth organization in northern New Jersey are empowering disenfranchised youth to create a positive change in their communities we must strive to follow Carolyn's example and the example set by others throughout the history of this great nation together we must strive to reinforce the fabric of our nation that President Trump is trying to tear apart we must work to eliminate the many disparities in our society and we must defend the progress that has been made and play our part in the progress that is still to come

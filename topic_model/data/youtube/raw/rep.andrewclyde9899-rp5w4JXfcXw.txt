when Washington D.C city council voted unanimously to update the city's criminal code far left mayor Muriel Bowser who was just sworn in for her third consecutive term she actually vetoed the bill declaring this bill doesn't make us safer the council responded by overturning her veto 12-1 now among the many troubling aspects of this bill the council would eliminate maximum jail times reduced almost all minimum sentencing for violent crimes and increased the access to jury trials for misdemeanors now this is extremely concerning for a city experiencing a rise in carjackings while ride sharing in the city becomes much more common and already in January the city has seen 411 vehicle thefts which is a 61 percent increase over the same time last year if left in place this code will be updated in October of 2025 but first it has to get the support of Congress and that is how a congressman from Georgia May factor in on the safety and well-being of all district residents Congressman Andrew Clyde plans to issue a bill that will stop the council from lessening Criminal sentencing guidelines before it goes into effect joining me now to discuss this legislation and more is Navy veteran and member of the House Freedom caucus Congressman Andrew Clyde Congressman so glad to have you on the program tonight before we get into your bill to overrule the D.C Council I want to ask you about something there's some breaking news today that DirecTV has dropped Newsmax what can or should Congress do about censorship at this level well Jen it's good to be with you tonight I think that was a big mistake by ATT and DirecTV what they're doing is silencing conservative voices and my district is a very conservative district and they love Newsmax and I think that uh that we this is something we could certainly look into but obviously they did it to oan last year they're doing it to Newsmax this year and that's a really big problem because the news media should not be silencing conservative voices and that's exactly what they're doing I think maybe folks should reach out and and talk to DirecTV directly and maybe even consider uh you know removing their subscription or or doing something like that because it's completely unacceptable that they would remove an exceptionally high rated conservative voice well Congressman we certainly do appreciate that and and now I want to talk about what's going on in our nation's capital right now uh you spend a lot of time here I live in the district crime is just rampant in the city right now our DC studios are not too far from Capitol Hill I'm sure we see a lot of the same things often uh tell us why a congressman from Georgia has so invested in what's going on in our nation's capital right now uh with the crime that we're seeing well Jen I think it's because our nation's capital belongs to our nation you know this city our capital city is for every state of the union for every person in the union you know when they come here to see their representatives I want them to come to a city that is safe and this bill what the Washington D.C Council just passed and overrode mayor Bowser's veto this bill does not make them safer in fact I loved your teas when you uh in your previous segment you're saying that we're trying to save the city from itself and I think you're exactly correct in that statement this is unacceptable because crime has been on the rise carjackings have been up robberies have been up home invasions have been up that is not a safe City so you know we in Congress have the responsibility for all legislative acts according to the Constitution and so we need to step in where the city has gone off the rails and I think they've gone off the rails so um we will be introducing legislation and Senator Hagerty from Tennessee will be introducing legislation on the Senate side and I believe that any member Republican or Democrat because this is not a a partisan issue this should be a bipartisan issue any member that does that doesn't vote for this I think can be considered soft on crime because that's exactly what what DC is doing they're passing a law to make it easier for criminals or to make it soft on crime and and no doubt a lot of residents are tired of that and Congressman I'm not sure how much you heard of the previous segment in our show but we were talking about uh the issues of gun violence in California and Democrats really taking advantage of that and going out after law-abiding gun owners uh especially in a state like California which has strict gun laws uh Washington D.C also has very strict gun laws I know that's something that you are also passionate about uh in in giving you know residents the ability to to carry could you tell us a little bit about that oh absolutely I mean it is a proven fact that where the citizens are armed that they are more safe and that criminals fear the common citizen who is armed and I think that's a great place to be my home state of Georgia just uh went to a constitutional carry last year I think constitutional carry would be a great thing for the city of Washington D.C but what are they they are a city that has Draconian gun control laws and they are denying their citizens the second amendment that the constitution guarantees to every citizen in the United States and so that's going to be up for uh as a prime target for Washington D.C um you know this city has proven time and time again that they are soft on crime we are not soft on crime We Believe criminals should be appropriately punished to deter crime so our citizens especially the citizens in our Capital City remain safe well Congressman Andrew Clyde of the great state of Georgia appreciate the work that you're doing in taking a stand for residents of the visit the district as well thank you so much for your time tonight hope to have you back here soon well thank you Jen I appreciate it

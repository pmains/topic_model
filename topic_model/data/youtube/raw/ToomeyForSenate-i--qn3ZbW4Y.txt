welcome back to this Thursday the healthcare bill signed into law by President Obama right there last week may help many Americans over time but will it help Democrats politically or hurt them come the next election trance right now two candidates for US Senate from Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak is a Democrat he's on the left part of the screen appropriately enough and former president of the Club for Growth Pat Toomey is on the right mornin to both of you morning good morning Steve congressman Sestak let's start with you was it a hard vote for you to vote for healthcare because a brand new USA Today poll shows that two-thirds of the country says this thing costs too much no not at all and this isn't about politics it's about what's good for the working family and I understand that there's no public policy that's more intimate or personal than health care reform I know my daughter had a Ford at four years old four years ago had a malignant brain tumor give him three to nine months to live she's here today because of the military's health care plan that's correct I got in not because I'm liberal it because I'm conservative I got into this for health care because I'm pragmatic all the military is health care and the dividends that accrue from healthy warriors and Families covetous is immense I'm sitting in Philadelphia 66% of the uninsured today here are working we lose 150 billion dollars a year because of the less look more sick they are so that's why I got in it it look good for the working family all right and now Pat Joe is gonna be out in Pennsylvania and he's gonna be listening to his constituents over the next week or two and he'll get a good idea of the reaction to his vote on health care why do you think it was wrong that he voted for it well I think he's gonna get quite an earful because I'm criss crossing Pennsylvania all the time and this is a bill that people don't want I'll tell you why first of all over 2,000 pages of new mandates that are going to drive up the cost of health care when we ought to be driving it down all half a trillion dollars of new tax increases including taxes on employers and employees taxes on jobs at a time when we don't have enough jobs we need to be creating more and trillion dollars of new spending much of which as money we don't have it's gonna increase our deficits create new debt at the time we can't afford it we do need health care reform what we don't need is a 2,000 page massive bill that disrupts the whole system hey Joe going into you know the primary and you're squaring off against Arlen Specter you've got all these attorneys generals across the country and they're suing their own the federal government saying this is unconstitutional we this can't stand so it's not as if you voted for it and suddenly it's going to go away this is gonna this is going to continue with you right up to the big vote for you absolutely look I know it's April Fool's Day how silly those comments are our fight by both Pat and well as Attorney General's look we are actually going to reduce premiums 15 to 20 percent over the next six years we hope since over the last eight years the premiums gone up 100% small businesses here in Pennsylvania pay 18% more than large corporations because if they have one person with cancer and they're trying to go she ate with Blue Cross Blue Shield as a small company they can't kind of spread the risk but we're gonna reduce that each issue what I hear is we need this okay Pat I'm gonna give you 20 seconds well I mean first of all you can't impose all kinds of new mandates and think that that's going to lower the cost you can pound your chance to be very proud about all the things you're gonna force coverage that's gonna drive up the course and the CBO has said so it said that the cost of obtaining health insurance will be higher under this bill and then if we never passed the bill and that's just the cost of the insurance itself I got a feeling you two are not going to be agreeing on this continue on with your campaign are to Joe Sestak and Pat Toomey thanks I have all right thanks guys

Things are hard right now, but it's all of you 
that are getting our country back on track,   so the economy should work for you too. 
Middle-class tax cuts instead of more tax breaks   for corporations who are making record profits. 
Invest in American manufacturing to increase   wages and bring down prices. And lower costs 
from tuition to child care to health care. I will   stand up to anyone who doesn't put you first. 
I'm Patty Murray and I approve this message.

democratic congressman tom malinowski welcome back to the show congressman thanks alex good to see you i want to start with hr one why do you think this law is necessary now so here's basically what hr one does it makes it easier for americans to vote and it makes it harder for billionaires to buy our elections i think most americans would support both of those goals we we saw what it meant last november to make it easier to vote we have measures in new jersey and all across this country to allow vote by mail and early voting and drop boxes i used a dropbox to vote in in flemington new jersey to make it easier for folks to register to vote and what what hr one would do is basically to create a national standard to allow people all across the country to continue uh to vote in ways that actually work with our modern lives and our modern schedules good high turnout is good and it's something that republicans and democrats should support it doesn't actually favor one side over the other as we have seen an election an election around the country it just makes our democracy stronger but see when you i pull back from this issue and look you talk about high turnout doesn't it seem though that the democrats want high turnout and the counterweight is the republican voter id bills aren't both parties simply trying to tilt the playing field to their own advantage well every of course every party wants to win um and i think there's a there's conventional wisdom out there that high turnout favors democrats if that's true i think like it would still be wrong to try to diminish turnout i think most americans would agree that our democracy's stronger when more people vote um but in reality i just don't don't think that's the case i think in my district uh for example in northwestern new jersey high turnout probably favors republicans more than democrats the important thing is why would anybody want to make it harder for americans to exercise this basic franchise in states like texas and georgia republicans are trying to make it harder and they say they're doing it because of voter fraud but there's no evidence of voter fraud in those states what it seems to me that they're trying to do is counter a situation they faced in 2020 when from their point of view the wrong people were voting too many young people too many people of color too many people who historically have not turned out uh to the polls and that's just not an appropriate motivation for voter suppression i wanted to turn to the ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline you were among members of congress who received a briefing from cabinet members from the biden cabinet this past week what do we know about the ransomware attack right now it was extremely serious in the sense that it reminds us just how vulnerable these critical systems that deliver uh our our energy uh to our homes are are whether it's nuclear power plants or the distribution system for gasoline which is what what uh what was hit in in this case our electrical grid we absolutely have to make sure that these critical systems are are secure this attack was not as terrible as it might have been some of the lines that we saw for gas in some states around the country were almost entirely due to hoarding not because of the the limitations created by uh by the hack that's one thing we learned from uh from this briefing and what we're hearing from the governors of all those states number two i think we've also recently learned that one reason for the shortages apparently is that this company this uh this pipeline company actually decided to cut cut off the supply because it was worried that it couldn't bill its customers if that's true i'm pretty pissed off uh that is not an appropriate response and then finally we got to deal with the fact that these hackers are in another country they're in russia president biden has said thus far we don't have evidence that the russian government was behind it i think that's a distinction without much of a difference i think we need new rules uh on the international stage that say you cannot provide safe haven for these kinds of hacking groups if they're operating on your territory you have a responsibility to shut them down and if you don't then we hold you the russian government accountable that would almost be a new doctrine though for for u.s foreign policy would it not actually yes consistent with with the the doctrine that led us to create nato you know when when we were worried about a physical attack by armed force from uh from our adversaries this is also an attack uh and if it's not the russian government if it's in effect like a terrorist group operating from russian soil then the russian government still has a responsibility to deal with it and i think that is a that's a principle that we need to establish in our foreign policy i have to ask you about the state and local tax deduction you and new jersey's congressional delegation have been very very vocal about getting that restored i have to ask you point blank for real if you don't get the tax deduction fully restored will you vote against president biden's infrastructure bill so there isn't an infrastructure bill yet we're writing it ourselves where president biden has proposed a framework a set of ideas to us the infrastructure and jobs package we believe has to be paid for right so we're talking about uh different ways through irs tax enforcement to making corporations like amazon actually pay taxes uh and uh potentially increases in the top individual rate for taxpayers to pay for some of the things that president biden wants us to do here's what i've said very very clear i will not support legislation that has a meaningful tax impact on my constituents that raises their taxes their individual taxes unless it addresses the salt issue that's the bottom line i'm not turning down the gateway tunnel right um if if we get a bill that that builds the infrastructure that we need in new jersey i'm not turning down the infrastructure but if we're dealing with tax increases tax adjustments to pay for infrastructure it's got to address the salt issue for my middle class constituents that were hit hard in 2017. congressman tom malinowski democrat of the 7th district thanks as always for joining us

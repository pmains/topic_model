and joining me now colorado senator michael bennett a democratic member of the agriculture finance and intelligence committee senator welcome to you sir it's good to see you i'm curious what you make sir of the probe into rudy giuliani should those who are close to donald trump be worried well i obviously know almost nothing about that investigation but i will say that it shows that nobody's above the law and rudy giuliani former mayor of new york is not above the law and donald trump even though he treated his entire presidency as though he was above the law uh is not either so this can't be good news for either rudy giuliani or donald trump well that is a a good answer and certainly a truthful one there uh let me ask you about the president's american family's plan it calls for a four-year extension of the new 3 000 child tax credit the child poverty program that is something you've been promoting for years now you've made it clear you want to see this made permanent so are you seeing support for that among your senate colleagues yeah we actually we sent a letter 41 of us sent a letter to president biden saying we want to make it permanent the chairman the house ways and means committee chairman has said he wants to make it permanent rosa doloro and chairs the appropriations committee in the house says she wants to make it permanent the speaker says she wants to make it permanent so i think we'll find a way to make it permanent this is the most progressive tax change we've made in our country in generations it's going to benefit 90 percent of america's kids and it's going to cut childhood poverty in half this year so i think uh i'm very pleased that joe biden has included it uh in his plan but i think we can do even better but yeah and i i have to say on wednesday night i mean really the the president got a big ovation when he talked about that and the way it is cut child poverty i think that was across the board support there in the chamber so let me speak about what's happening this week with the president vice president getting back on the road they're trying to sell their spending plans your republican colleagues have made it pretty clear their opposition to the price tag and in fact so has your democratic colleague senator joe manchin so how do you see these ambitious plans making it through the senate might they be broken up into separate plans is that is that concept at least getting support behind the scenes well well before we talk about breaking up i can see why this might be hard for some of my republican colleagues to grasp because unlike the plans they proposed this plan is paid for unlike the plans they pass this plan cuts taxes for working people and for the middle class and raises revenue on the wealthiest people in america they passed plans that that basically gave almost five trillion dollars to the wealthiest people in this country since 2001 they didn't pay for a single penny of it and now they're complaining when a president wants to actually invest here at home we've spent 20 years cutting taxes for wealthy people we spent 20 years fighting two wars in the middle east it's time for us to invest in our people it's time for us to invest in our infrastructure is global competitiveness requires it that the chinese government's march across the world requires it climate change requires it advancing technologies require it and the american people want us to do it these are proposals are broadly popular across the country even if the washington republicans can't quite figure that out and i hope joe biden and kamala harris not only go to blue parts of this country but go to red parts of this country and demonstrate how much better the biden tax cut is for rural america than the trump tax cut was for the wealthiest americans uh in the country that's what that's the argument we should be having i think it's the argument that we can win well to your point joe biden is going to louisiana and so uh he'll be going down there and he'll be making the case to those who by nature might be in opposition certainly from a political party stance let's talk about what your republican colleague john barrasso today gave his view of how he thinks a deal could be reached so let's take a listen to that i actually believe there's a deal to be had if we leave out things like the green new deal and recyclable cafeteria trays and climate justice because 500 and to 600 billion dollars of infrastructure is a massive amount of infrastructure we ought to start with the core that we passed when i chaired the environment and public works committee it focuses on the things that people think of as core infrastructure that president talks about is hard infrastructure okay so what people think of as core infrastructure i'm going to pick up on a couple words that you suggested when you just gave your last answer advancing technologies is there any sense of forward big thinking picture from republicans or is it only about tackling things as they seemingly exist right now there there there has to be there and there is i'll give you an example john cornyn has been who's a republican from texas has been great on semiconductors you know he's realized that if we don't do something we're not going to we're not going to be able to produce semiconductors in this country we're going to be relying on china i'd say the same thing is true for cars do we want to rely on the chinese government for electric field vehicles or who want to build them here in the united states advanced bioscience agriculture these are all open questions about whether we want to play a role in the 21st century i think it's critically important that we do and the other piece of this i think that's very important that shouldn't be lost is that for the last 50 years we've had an economy in this country that's worked really well for the top 10 but for nine out of 10 americans really has not worked it has created enormous income inequality we have one of the lowest economic mobility rates in the industrialized world we have one of the highest until recently the highest childhood poverty rates in the industrialized world and joe biden is saying these are not inevitable features of our society or of our democracy and i think that you know my hope is that we can pass bills in a bipartisan way i think that would be great uh i've yet to hear my republican colleagues say what pay for us they would support and they're having a hard time supporting uh the pay fors that joe biden has put forward which raises taxes basically on the top one percent of the american people and on america's largest corporations maybe they've got other ideas but we've got to move ahead in any case for the benefit of the american people to create an economy that once again when the economy grows grows for everybody not just the people at the very top and that's not just important for working people and for the middle class it's critical for our democracy because you cannot have a successful democracy with the lack of economic mobility that we've seen in this country for the last 50 years i really appreciate your sage insights colorado senator michael bennett thank you very much sir for talking with us

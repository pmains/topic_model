to be our guide star on this i'm going to go back the gentleman time has gone by the gentleman from minnesota mr elmer is now recognized thank you uh madam chair can you hear me you chairman gentzler uh thanks uh like everyone else i want to thank you for appearing before the committee today i appreciate your time uh you've already covered this topic with some other members but i want to go into it again there are millions of americans as you know who hold cryptocurrency specifically over 55 million americans are now engaged in this asset class and the value of these uh cryptocurrencies the value of the market is approximately two trillion dollars uh you've been outspoken uh in that you think most cryptocurrencies on the market are securities uh i couldn't disagree with you more thoroughly i believe most cryptocurrencies are commodities or currencies currency but for the purpose of better understanding your perspective i have several quick questions i'd like to run through during my time and i'd appreciate quick responses to each question uh chair gensler let's say someone who issued a token agrees with you and thinks that their token is a security and they want to register it with the sec if they register it can it can they trade it on the new york stock exchange or could they trade it on nasdaq it would somewhat depend on nasdaq and new york stock exchange listing rules and how they they register it but there's multiple ways to register if they registered and the new york stock exchange nasdaq said yes that might facilitate it nobody's asked to do that as as far as i understand actually yeah the answer is no a can a broker dealer like charles schwab another question deal in a digital asset that has gone through sec registration in other words would they be able to trade these digital assets securities and custody them well the custody is really the issue that you've mentioned we have not uh have been able to sort through there's a feature of crypto assets which is that a private key transforms ownership that's a feature but it also creates challenges or some would say it's both the feature in a bug of the custody of those uh crypto assets again i i believe the answer is no and i think earlier today you use the term stable value coins there's no such thing value is a term that you put in there they are stable coins uh chair gensler as you know there are about a hundred tokens with a billion dollar market cap let's say you deem one of these coins with a billion dollar market cap and tens of thousands of investors as secured what happens to those uh investors sir well if the if the coin were to come in and to actually register there's then they those investors get the benefit of our securities law right now they don't have the benefit of that that basic bargain that we protect people against fraud and manipulation in our capital markets as they get full and fair disclosure they're not getting that right now and it's falling short and people are going to get hurt chair gensler actually what will happen under that scenario is the value of the token will plummet and retail investors the very people you are supposed to protect will not be able to trade in it so i guess uh where i'm going to go with this if there's no path for them to be traded anywhere wouldn't investors be hurt by your enforcement actions and what are you doing to solve this problem what are you going to do what i've said publicly and i mean mean this is come in work with us if the rules that were written in other decades uh don't quite fit this these digital investment contracts and and that's what many of these are they're they're entrepreneurs computer scientists that are raising money from the public and the public is anticipating profits and that's why congress painted with a broad brush and the investing public is relying on some group of entrepreneurs and computer scientists for their profits and i'm glad to work with projects work with congress if you want to repeal the laws as they are uh so that fewer people are protected against fraud in these markets and actually uh chair i appreciate the answer i don't know that the end that we still disagree on the securities aspect i think the vast majority are currency or commodities but this is why it's really important for the sec to develop a framework that the crypto industry can operate in crypto is one of the highest performing asset classes in decades retail investors got into this space before institutional ones your job the sec's mandate is to protect investors maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation when you make conclusory public statements and regulate to enforcement action you jeopardize that mandate i encourage everyone to take a look at my bipartisan bill the securities clarity act which amends securities law with a new definition the investment contract asset so the sec can work with issuers to swiftly determine what a token is offered as part of the securities contract and when it's not thank you again chair gensler madam chair i yield back the balance of my god thank you very much and mr gibson i want you to know i appreciate your

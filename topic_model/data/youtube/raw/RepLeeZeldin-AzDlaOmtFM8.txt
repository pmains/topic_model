well thank you mr speaker and i thank the distinguished gentleman from kansas for offering this amendment to a very important underlying bill from the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee ed royce it's really important to point out as a matter of policy and what unfortunately is very necessary for this congress to take action on to make it very clear that we don't pay ransom now with regards to the 1.7 billion dollars that has been paid to iran to secure the release of the four iranian hostages other terms have been used the one most often used lately is called leverage the fact is if the money did not arrive immediately the hostages wouldn't have been released no money no hostage release why are we debating as if this wasn't a ransom if the money didn't show up 400 million dollars in cash the hostages wouldn't have been released why do we not put a price on securing the release a financial price is because now more americans are being unjustly imprisoned by iran mr shaheen from california in iran visiting his mother is being held accused of quote cooperating with hostile governments actions against national security and communication with anti-revolutionary agents and media end quote this is an american visiting his mom in iran and why do we not pay ransom why do we not give money to secure the release of an american hostage is that now more americans have been taken hostage thank you mr pompeo

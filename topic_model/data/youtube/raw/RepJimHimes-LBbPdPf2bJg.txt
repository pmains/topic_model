you know it was a rare kumbaya moment in Washington yesterday it's actually the first budget we've had him for years what do you know in the first budget from a divided Congress in 27 the bill is now on its way to President Obama's desk where he says he's gonna sign it into law but critics say this budget more to help repair Congress's reputation then actually repair the nation's balance sheet joining us right now is Democratic congressman jim heintz from connecticut nine senators voted for the bill yesterday congressman was this budget a Republican senators I should say was this some missed opportunity in terms of a grand bargain uh well it was certainly a missed opportunity in terms of a grand bargain partisanship but look to bipartisanship the fact that we got a budget done after many years of not getting a budget done and the fact that it was strong and bipartisan bicameral you know you gotta you gotta crawl before you can walk the grand bargain which is you know I've been a supporter up for a long time that's a that's a marathon so we're a long way from getting there but look take what we can get right do you sense a change or shift in Washington now well yes I do but I wouldn't overstate it look think about what happened in the last couple of months politically obviously the Republican Party took a drubbing as a result of the shutdown and and the debt ceiling shenanigans and frankly the president the Democrats you know took a real hit with the initial failure of the Obamacare website to come out so I think everybody was walking around the last couple of weeks with a newfound sense they came in saying in other words everyone has been hurt over the past call it six months yeah yeah and you know I think people you know look what the speaker did you know standing up to the more aggressive right-wing organizations I think people are starting to understand that folks expect us to get something done and to find that compromise in that center yeah and i think you know we're getting closer and closer to 2016 perhaps everyone's realizing that they need to be able to campaign i'll actually having gotten something done that's it we still got a lot of pork in this thing let's take a look at some of the highlights uh 125 thousand dollar 3d pizza printers your astronauts um brothels in nevada this is something are going to take 17 and a half million dollars in exemptions for such necessities as breast implants and the FBI spends one and a half million dollars each year to educate Hollywood producer riders and the such on how to portray the agency so you know back to your point about getting something real done is there any hope here can we get rid of some of this pork that's infiltrated the budget well look at you know it was ever thus right you know powerful people in capitol hill and as a third term IRR I'm not sure I necessarily qualify at this point can get things done for their constituencies in the grand scheme of things those items that you talked about first of all you know they probably can be framed in other ways in ways they're economically helpful for those particular areas but there are very few need pizza clearly and it needs to be printed on a 3d printers in space there is need I need I not say if you're working at a brothel in Nevada there's other things you might be ethical expenditures you know you can you can focus on that or you can you can look at the headline which is we're not shutting down the government by the way that's not a done deal yet right we've got to have the commitment through their work but compared to where we were and I'm not standing in support i was i was supportive of doing away with earmarks oh don't get me wrong here but you know we're taking some steps towards a bipartisan you know way of operating the business of not shutting down the government of not scaring people who run businesses and i think that's an important step forward look there's all kinds of things this deal didn't do it wasn't a grand bargain it didn't deal with unemployment insurance didn't didn't touch entitlements that's that's really though the grand bargain right exactly yeah no it was not what has to happen to know okay now that we've got this small deal and people were able to come together and actually make it happen what needs to happen to just keep the conversation going so that we legitimate lee talk about entitlements and you know tax loopholes etc well you know unfortunately i think that the general environment needs to improve so that more people and I would I hope I don't sound partisan as saying this but so that the Republican Party remember that moment in the debate where every presidential candidate was offered the chance to balance the budget with ten dollars in cuts and one dollars newer in new revenue and they all said no you know we need to move a little bit from that to a point where there's common ground we're not there yet so you know I wouldn't again I you know I was 38 people in the house who voted for the simpson-bowles like grand bargain so it makes me sad to say this but we are a ways away from you know that final push to get the country on a sustainable path all right well the budget agreement is the good news for a lot of people um certainly small business owners for it like the sound of this the White House held a meeting today actually with small groups of business leaders local ones including small furniture CEO t-day gentle who's that joining us right now here on the show TJ tell us about what happened in the meeting today well president or a few of the senior administration officials we're talking about what you were just discussing the sort of the environment of my partisanship and the administration is is very much trying to project sort of an environment of economic stability and you know coming out of the meeting I was sort of left with the impression that all right we've taken one small step towards bipartisanship now there is this framework for for the parties to work together again and you know maybe we can look at putting the economy on the right track reducing the deficit and moving forward yeah i mean this is this is giving hope to business leaders not just you know it's small and large business leaders that you know overall that say okay maybe i don't have to worry as much about Washington right now is this the juice the economy needs I think so and again i I'm sorry it falls short of what it could be you know if we had embraced the grand bargain at some point in the last five years we wouldn't be talking about this now and it would be a great stabilizing force for for business but again as much as you might point to you know little bits of pork here and there and this bill consider where we were three months ago where we really thought there was a chance of a default on the United States debt so it's a small step in the right direction look it's a two-year budget right that gives people some certainty about the end at least the fiscal side of where they'll be operating and I think that's a small good thing that's true we don't have to go through this a year from now all right so if the grand bargain is going to be very difficult to try to move forward on and hopefully people like you will try Fannie and Freddie that seems like there's more common ground what's the possibility of actually transitioning from the current fannie freddie into some new hybrid that say senator bob Corker tennessee has been trying to push forward yeah sure there's a lot of proposals in the Congress right now of course jeb Hensarling the chairman of financial services put something forward called the path act which was a very very slim down version of Fannie Mae Freddie Mac a you know restructuring if you will so the discussion is underway but you know I wouldn't count on this being a you know kind of next three to six months thing now remember you said the election is 2016 we've got the 2014 elections coming up and unfortunately I think that creates a certain amount of pressure where people get concerned about you know angering their base and so I do fear that in the coming months you're gonna start to see people acting a little bit more politically and making it harder to get things like GSU reform done um let's switch topics for a moment here NSA obviously in the news this week we had of course the the court ruling a federal judge saying in fact what the NSA is doing is in violation of our Fourth Amendment and then of course the president's a report that he had commissioned coming out yesterday with the recommendations being made basically to curb some of the NSA practices the NSA that we're gonna see you know two years from now is it gonna be very different and do you think that people's privacy will be more protected yes and yes I do think look the Snowden revelations obviously though very dangerous for this country started a discussion and I think a lot of Americans woke up and said wow I had no idea the government was doing this and both the judge's decision the panel that just reported to the president yesterday and frankly people like me have been concerned about the fact that after nine eleven not only do we throw a ton of money at national security appropriately a ton of money through the Patriot Act and through other mechanisms I think we also probably stepped over the line where most Americans are comfortable in terms of surveillance is a good thing the Edward Snowden came forward and brought all this to light should he be given a mystique no this nut is not a good thing look a country should not run itself and have a discussion that is how we want to know about it we wouldn't know about no I acknowledge that that's a challenge and you know this is a larger discussion about how we can do better oversight as a congress but no no country can run itself where discussions are catalyzed by disaffected 26 year-olds deciding that they're gonna do so so if in sort of a backhanded curious li+ way Edward Snowden brought the discussion to light what do we do now so that there doesn't have to be another Snowden that in fact there's a check-and-balance inherent in the system how do we do that well remember i'm not sure that Snowden did what he did because he had given you know intense legal thought to constitutional violations nobody's awesome he acted from his conscience he thought there was something that was inappropriate and he wanted to bring it to life maybe I mean I might argue that if he was really arguing from his conscience in the you know in the tradition of lawbreakers and civil disobedience he might have done what he did and then turned himself over to the authorities to bear the legal consequences of what he did which is what civil disobedience is all about so we could debate that for a long time but look the larger point is that clearly Congress the courts are gonna begin a process of scaling back some of these surveillance authorities to a point where Americans are a little more comfortable and it's always gonna be tough right because by definition we can't know everything that the intelligence community is doing in the name of keeping us safe if we know it the bad guys know it so it's always gonna be attention and it's up to guys like me frankly who sit on the Intelligence Committee to be particularly aggressive about the oversight because we're acting on behalf of the American people when we listen to in closed rooms what the NSA what the CIA are doing congressman jim Himes thank you very much for being here today thank you great to be here

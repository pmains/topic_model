Thank You mr. chair and thanks to the witnesses you know one of the things these four hearings has shown is that reinsurance is a really popular idea I have a bill with Senator Carper who's here to do a federal reinsurance program there's a cost to it but it's not a bailout of insurance companies what reinsurance does is it brings down premiums for most people by bringing down premiums that allow some people to buy insurance who weren't going to do it otherwise by bringing down premiums it reduces the federal government's payment of subsidies based on those premiums it provides a backstop that enables high risk or high claim individuals to get insurance and it provides certainty to enable insurers to stay in the market there are five definite benefits are insurance and that's why every witness in the for hearings has asked for it mysteries must I want to talk to you about anthem in Virginia just using it as an example you were anthem was the largest provider of care through our individual marketplace 330 thousand Virginians and anthem Reese recently announced that would no longer provide coverage on the individual market I am right am I not that anthem still does a lot of business in Virginia with group plans and and finds Virginia and Virginians in that market very good customers correct yes that's absolutely so in the group market anthem finds Virginia to be profitable and stable but the individual market you found not to be profitable and definitely not stable correct correct and I don't think it's unfair for anthem to deliver a message to Congress or for insurers generally that we would like some stability so in the individual market if you don't know whether the mandate is going to be enforced if you don't know whether CSR payments are going to be made if you don't know whether marketing is going to be done or whether open enrollment is going to be vigorous or narrow that creates an awful lot of instability for a company like anthem and I don't think it's unfair for you or other insurers to say to us give us some stability and if we don't give you stable answers then you take actions and and I get that and I hope we can provide stability but I want to turn it around and and give you a message about an action that we're likely to take anthem coming out of Virginia combined with others could lead about 60 to 65 counties in Virginia to be without an insurer riding on the exchange we have a hundred and thirty four cities in County so that would be half of our counties not half of our population because this is overwhelmingly rural it's depriving people in rural Virginia of opportunities I think people ought to be able to buy into Medicare so this is the Tim Kaine view if I had a magic wand people under Medicare eligible age I think they should just be able to pay a premium that's accurately signed and buy-in and I don't have the votes for that right now but I will get the votes for it if there are bear counties in Virginia or elsewhere so just as you've communicated to us a desire for stability which is fair I just want to communicate to all insurance companies there is no way none that Congress is going to tolerate a situation where persistently there are counties in this country where people cannot buy insurance on the individual market we just won't tolerate it and the pressure will build and then we will create a solution for it and the solution will be if there's no individual if there's no private companies will provide insurance the solution will be something like Medicare that people can buy into and and when that day comes we won't just allow them to buy in if insurance companies don't cover their county we won't just allow somebody to buy into Medicare if insurance companies have said they're too old or too poor they're too sick we will provide a vigorous public option to allow anybody to buy a new Medicare because we will want to have a broad risk pool with some young and healthy people just like you would want to have one so in some ways the bear County phenomenon I view it bluntly a the insurance companies have to worry about holding a knife up to their own throat the bear insurance the bear County phenomenon is going to create incredible pressure for us to provide a solution so that people can have health insurance and at the end of the day that solution I think is going to be one that is gonna work they're directly contrary you know you're worried about you know profitability incivility as you should be you're a company you don't worry about that but if you if you're thinking about that in the short term and you're missing the long term we can't have bear counties I'm not going to tolerate one I'm gonna find a solution for the one and if we can't find a solution through private insurance we're gonna find a solution so just as you're communicating to us that we owe you stability and we do I want to communicate to private insurance companies that we're not going to tolerate bear counties and we will provide an option and it will be an option that will be very very challenging to the insurance industry as we know it so with that mr. chair that's all I have thanks

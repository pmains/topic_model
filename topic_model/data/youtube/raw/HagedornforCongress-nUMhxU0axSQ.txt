good afternoon delegates thank you everyone for coming out today I know it's probably been our our first nice weather day we've had so far this spring this is a really important day I'm Jeremy Monson state representative Jeremy Monson or as they call me in st. Paul hey that's that Republican that votes against Republican spending bills okay well as most of you know we had a special election this winter my state rep stepped down and I had to make a decision that if I wanted to run or not and I called a bunch of friends to ask them get some advice on how to run a campaign and and was this possible and what should i how should I be campaigning in this district and most of these people that were political Insider said you know you got it you got to raise 40 grand and just run on to issues cuz your district only cares about just two issues just bang bang bang bang and you'll get it and when I call Jim Hagedorn I'll never forget what he told me he said Jeremy you've been travelling this district for ten years volunteering for the party you've been talking to voters you know what the issues are and you you've dealt with mnsure you farmed with your in-laws you know taxes and business you've deep knowledge of both talk to people about the real issues but don't forget when you get to st. Paul never forget the people in your district and the issues that are important to them and every vote that you cast you need to represent your district and that's what's important that's how you can be a great representative now after the endorsement I had a primary challenger and it was a well-funded well organized campaign he was backed by the entrenched establishment in st. Paul and it was a very uphill battle for me there was you know $80,000 spent on this campaign in a matter of 10 days I was taken by surprise I reached out to Jim Hagedorn because I was really worried I really wanted to represent this district and Jim Hagedorn if you're running for Congress you don't step out and help underdogs and go against the establishment but Jim Hagedorn is a principled he's a principled conservative and he helped he engaged his team to come out and sub-zero weather and help us door knock and get the missus get the message out to the voters in this district and I'm thankful that Jim did that in the fact that he would stand up against establishment is really means something to me because that's the kind of representative that I want to send to DC to represent me to represent you to represent this district because he's going to be a great conservative for this district now it is my absolute honor and privilege to nominate Jim Hagedorn to be our next congressman from the first District here in Minnesota [Applause]

ben bernanke as I said threw cold water on 2013 tax hikes today of any kind he told the senate budget committee that they would threaten our economic recovery please take a listen with no action is taken on january first 2013 between expiration of tax cuts sequestration a number of other measures there'll be a very sharp change in the fiscal stance of the federal government which by itself would would with no compensating action would would indeed slow the recovery all right joining us now senate budget committee members Ron Wyden Democrat from Oregon Ron Johnson Republican from Wisconsin gentlemen welcome back to the program both of you mr. Johnson if I can begin with you Bernanke made it very clear that tax hikes now scheduled for 2013 could derail the economy why is it their conversation in Washington to stop these tax hikes well there's not much of a conversation Washington bought you really are whole debt and deficit issue here at on and we absolutely absolutely have to start having that conversation because Larry we have to grow our economy and the CBL came out pretty much the same results when they issued a new baseline to the we let these Bush tax cuts expire it's going to do great harm to economic growth and that's the number one component of the solution is growing our economy senator Wyden i really ask you the same question because the budget leaks so far suggests not only of the bush tax hikes going to stay in place but the president is going to layer on a millionaires tax and also take some punitive measures against corporations how can this grow the economy Larry first of all I think Chairman Bernanke was actually even stronger as you know he is not a person given to hyperbole but he was talking today about shocks to our economic system and he compared it for example to what happened when there was efforts not to raise other debt debt ceiling and to me if you don't deal with this payroll tax and again you have more uncertainty failure to provide our businesses the ability to predict what's ahead I think they're going to be huge kinds of consequences and as you know what I really want want to see along with senator dan coats I've introduced the first bipartisan tax reform bill in a quarter century where we go in there clean out the special interest tax breaks to hold down rates and grow the economy for everybody Santa Johnson tax reform kind of music to my ears simplification sure beats raising taxes to put us back into recession absolutely i'm all for pro-growth tax reform that that eliminates there are 70,000 page tax code and simplifies it dramatically to actually help grow our economy and one thing i would cost 11 points I made up there's an interesting article in The Wall Street Journal talking about what Marilyn tried to do in 2007 a millionaires tax was expected to raise 330 million dollars it raised 120 million about thirty six percent and that's certainly the caution I wanted to throw in there's you know you start raising taxes on small to medium sized businesses you're going to harm economic growth and you're not going to raise the revenue that you're going to be hope to raise senator Wyden are you in favor or are you opposed to the millionaire's tax so-called I think what's really needed Larry is to stay away from any approach that doesn't give everybody in America the opportunity to get ahead what senator coats and I are trying to do on a bipartisan basis is create incentives for everybody when Democrats and Ronald Reagan got together we created 6.3 million new jobs in two years I think we could do that again I think it would have such a powerful boost psychologically and that's why I mentioned dr. Bernanke's testimony today he is not given to exaggeration he was talking about shocks to the system a failure to move ahead in these areas that are so important in terms of providing certainty well we should listen see skin I want to see us give everybody the opportunity to get ahead this is going to be the year when we make can make a real difference for pro-growth tax reform senator dan coats a Republican who's been on your show and myself I think have a good way to start the conversation sander wine I just want to follow up I don't want to be moving away from Senator Johnson but you are pushing for a corporate tax reform that would actually punish corporations operating overseas I'm surprised to hear that given your other tax reform proclivities particularly coming from an export state like Oregon why do you want to punish overseas companies well first of all Larry what we do is we lower the corporate rate from 35 to 24 and frankly we could lower it even a bit more but what we ought to do is do everything we can to create incentives for red white and blue jobs we need to grow a jobs in this country I am pro pro exports I managed a big chunk of the trade agenda on the floor of the Senate died here recently what I want to do is make things here grow things here add value to them here and ship them somewhere dan coats and I / of the corporate tax rate dramatically we could take it down a bit lower but we do try to create the incentives for growing on the economy here in our country but senator Johnson it lets you weigh in on this point why should we double tax corporate profits why shouldn't we do it territorially where they operate the way every other industrialized country does we would be the only one in fact right now we're the only one that punishes companies that operate overseas for sales reasons for distribution reasons you name it what's your take on that Senator Johnson well Larry it's it's like any business you have to benchmark your costs you have to benchmark your business environment and we have to do that here in America we need to make sure that America is an attractive place to headquarter business to build a manufacturing plant and you do that by daniel geery regulatory environment ours is onerous and do they take a look at your tax regimen and again ours doesn't stack up very well you know one I want to make to that Chairman Bernanke made very clear we have got to address the long-term entitlement issue and that something this president has totally failed to lead on we need presidential leadership we need we need to start addressing that because Chairman Bernanke said it's clearly unsustainable path that we're on here right now all right one word one word on this guy gavriel issue I gotta leave at their centers I'm sorry I'd love to have a much longer discussion just I'm going to come down there and sit with you guys and we can talk every but right now Thank You Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin thank you gentlemen

here with me now is republican congressman air force veteran and pilot in the air national guard adam kinzinger of illinois congressman thank you so much for joining me this morning you now support universal background checks red flag laws raising the minimum age to buy a gun banning high-capacity magazines how did your thinking evolve so a lot of that happened around vegas so i woke up the morning after the vegas shooting and you know we heard the audio from that and and i had shot a bump stock before i knew that was a bump stock and so i called for banning bump stocks and you know at that point it's like okay this is getting out of hand what are the things we can do you know to make it to make a difference i mean obviously there's going to be some fundamental disagreement and it's like what well why why should somebody be able to buy a gun at 18. particularly long gun at 18 when as of recently they can't even smoke cigarettes till they're 21. that's just the right thing to do the problem is everybody is scared to inaction uh they're frightened of the loudest voices and 90 of americans are begging that we do something is is that the reason why you think so many of your fellow republicans aren't where you are on those issues yeah i mean i've talked to a bunch that are where i am but they won't say it or they won't come out and say it because again it's you know i've experienced this whether it's talking about donald trump january 6 or or the guns issue is you know yeah once you make something that's outside of the cultist position or outside of you know that like tribal position you're going to get a bunch of taxes say you're crazy you know it's my right the second amendment even though we all believe in the second amendment we just you know believe that there are reasonable things to do about it and you know look if you look at this shooting you look at uh you look at buffalo you look at parkland and all these others there are people taking these guns these ars under the age of 21. uh can we stop all of it no can we mitigate it certainly and we should be doing that now governor greg abbott says this shooting shows the need for more laws addressing mental health texas senator ted cruz wants to reduce the number of doors in schools install bulletproof glass put arm copt on school campuses is that enough to stop mass shootings if the u.s doesn't also do something about access to guns yeah i mean look ultimately i do think it's a hard issue because people have to make a decision to go and do a mass shooting but if we think that just hardening schools or reducing you know basically turning schools into military camps is going to be the answer even if it does work which it won't but even if it does that's not the kind of country i want to live in right i got a kid that's four months old now we'll be going to school someday i don't want to have to have a military id to check him into the front gate of his elementary school and you know so look any what you're seeing right now dana is all these people that are these politicians that are scared to death to talk about the gun issue they know that this is an issue but they're scared to talk about it so they launch into this thing about mental health we all agree that mental health is a problem first off i'd ask have they actually put any more money into mental health people like ted cruz highly doubt it um but secondarily at the same time why is an 18 year old buying an ar so it's not an if or that you know but there's always the old saying too about the way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun typically i agree as well but there were 150 good guys with guns at this shooting that didn't do anything um you know until basically border patrol swat showed up uh we've got to take we got to take we got to take handle of this man this is insane congressman you do still oppose a ban on the kind of assault weapons that were used in the shooting can you explain why private citizens need weapons of war look i have opposed a ban uh you know fairly recently i i think i'm open to a ban now it's gonna depend what it looks like because there's a lot of nuances on what constitutes you know certain things but i'm getting to the point where i have to wonder maybe it's maybe somebody to own one maybe you need an extra license maybe you need extra training and so the question is is it a band versus an additional certification but yeah i gotta tell you i mean the 99.9 of people that own ars we all know are not going to walk into a school and do this but the problem is for those that support the second amendment like me we have to be coming to the table with ways to mitigate 18 year olds buying these guns and walking into schools my side's not doing that my side's not coming forward with reasonable ways to defend an amendment that we think is very important and so i'm looking at this going fine if people are going to put forward solutions about certifying maybe who can buy an assault weapon i'm certainly open to that well so that that is another change it sounds like you're willing to make uh congressman i want to turn to the topic of january 6th you are of course a member of that committee the house republican leader kevin mccarthy says he will not comply with the committee's subpoena to interview him as it currently stands are you considering holding the sitting house minority leader in contempt of congress you know that's it that's a that's a big deal obviously there are things we can do including you know whether it's with ethics or other things uh trust me every day we're talking about what to do when these members if these members don't comply with the subpoena uh and so we'll see but i'm gonna tell you ultimately it says way more about him than us if he doesn't come in because look he has information we want to talk to him this is the house that he wants to be the speaker of by the way and he's saying you don't have a right thought well look i'm not going to be here next year in congress but i guarantee uh if he is speaker there's going to be people that are like wait you didn't even bother to comply with a subpoena kevin mccarthy has no respect for the institution anymore for the process all he wants to do is be powerful and it's not even be powerful through normal means it's through really kissing up to donald trump i mean that's more on him than us adam kinzinger we're gonna have to leave it there thank you so much for joining me this morning you better

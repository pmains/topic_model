hi I'm Dylan Williams director of government affairs at J Street there's been a lot of media coverage around the status of Jerusalem recently so we wanted to provide you an explanation of what's been going on first let's understand the facts about Jerusalem the State of Israel and many of its supporters including Jay Street regard Jerusalem Judaism's most sacred city as the capital of Israel if the status of the city remains undetermined for much of the international community including every American administration for the past 40 years with the Palestinian people claiming the eastern neighborhoods of the city as the future capital of the state they seek for themselves Israel annexed these eastern neighborhoods including 28 villages which to this day remain almost entirely Arab following their capture from Jordan in the six-day war in June 1967 at the same time previous Israeli prime ministers have proposed resolutions to the israeli-palestinian conflict that would give a Palestinian state sovereignty over the neighborhoods for use as their capital unfortunately these are complicated facts that are often ignored amidst the broken politics surrounding Israel in the United States instead of leaving the permanent status of Jerusalem to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians as every president has since 1967 - many American politicians try to burnish their pro-israel credentials by making dangerously simplistic categorical statements about Jerusalem pushing the United States government to conclusively decide the status of all Jerusalem or to move our embassy there in advance of a peace agreement hurts America's ability to help the parties achieve peace and thus for its Israel itself this was the root of the controversy over whether and how Jerusalem was mentioned in the Republican and Democratic Party platforms this year and as is so often the case it is ultimately Israel and its prospects for peace that are most damaged by such grandstanding we hope you will join J Street in urging both Republicans and Democrats to focus their energy on helping Israel and the Palestinians achieve real peace rather than political point-scoring

hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update busy week in DC a lot going on I'm so a couple things number one how we had our second bill pass on the House floor that I introduced as long as the battlefield cross memorial act and what this would do is ensure that our battlefield crosses are never removed from our national cemeteries one was removed from our National Cemetery in Seville while back VA employee misinterpreted our particular rule so we're going to codify the rule and make sure that that never happens again really excited about that it passed unanimously and now we need to get the Senate in gear and then to the President's desk so very excited about that very big for our veterans in Northeast Ohio secondly I had two bills passed out of Science Space and Technology Committee one has to do with election security which would encourage NSF and NIST to federal science agencies essentially to articulate best practices and standards for securing our elections this way every state could look to these these entities as they work to secure their elections in their poll book so very important there on the election security side excited to get that done that was also bipartisan and unanimous on a committee and then finally a bill to study the root causes of suicides obviously we've had a growing number of suicides in our country and in our district and it's something that's particularly concerning in in the youth community so and our teenagers from kind of 15 into the mid-20s those numbers are skyrocketing and so we want to get a better sense of that so that passed unanimous on a out of committee as well and then finally also introduced a bill to hold China more accountable so this is at the World Bank and I realized this is a little bit wonky but let me explain it so the World Bank we are the largest funders of the World Bank we meaning you the American taxpayer is the largest funder of the World Bank China currently borrows money from the World Bank at discounted rates and so what that means is that we the American taxpayers are subsidizing China's growth and the repression that they have on their own people have World Bank on its balance sheet has a hundred million dollar loan to China discounted underwritten by the American people for the weaker Muslim camp concentration camp in Xinjiang so I don't think we should be funding that at all I don't think that the United States taxpayer should be funding China's growth story in their oppressive regime and so what my bill would do is prevent China from being able to borrow from the bank again I'm hoping that this will get bipartisan support but it's for me it's a key initiative on the Financial Services Committee what can we do in that committee to crack down on what China is doing we can make sure that the American taxpayer isn't funding their growth and so those were kind of my big initiatives for the week and then obviously the impeachment hearings take the public version of the impeachment hearings kicked off I'll be continuing to watch those if you want to know my stance on it I've said in previous videos I'd refer you to there but but otherwise my challenge to my staff and our office is while this is going on which is very distracting for Congress generally speaking I want us to be more productive than we've ever been and so to have multiple bills pass out of committee to introduce new bills on China and to see our battlefield cross bill on the House floor that was something that was really exciting to me and we're gonna keep that level of activity up you sent me here to work you didn't send me here to be distracted and so so that's what I'm gonna do so with that thank you as always for allowing me to be a representative and I hope everybody has a great weekend

this is news director Gerald's Melser and talking with Jim Hagedorn who is a Republican candidate for the first District congressional seat here in Minnesota and Jim can you tell me how is your campaign going right now oh it's going great we've been having a wonderful time these last seven months criss-crossing the district taking our message of conservative reform and limited government free enterprise the rule of law and contrasting that with congressman Tim Walz the most liberal congressman in the history of southern Minnesota who's voted for all these big government bills like Obamacare cap and trade and so forth and so we're just getting our message out to the people well speaking of the Obamacare there's a deadline coming up on Monday March 31st this coming Monday and right now Minnesotans are being told that they have to meet that deadline they're gonna face a penalty now that doesn't sound like the right thing to do well the whole Obamacare bill has really been it's a monstrosity that needs to be repealed and replaced with free-market reforms like expanded use of health savings accounts competition across state lines we should be tying the tax benefits to individuals so they can have portable benefits and go from job to job but unfortunately these mandates inside of Obamacare it's been mishandled by the administration they I it's a very difficult complex piece of legislation that is imposing undue burdens on the private sector limiting people's employment opportunities and driving up costs and sending people into government programs and for that and many reasons I think congressman Walz was wrong to vote for it and I'm ready to take office to try to repeal it and replace it with those free market ideas yeah how do you do that you have to get Republicans to try to back that they've been trying to overturn some things but they have been successful well you keep fighting I learned a long time ago when I worked for a Minnesota congressman that you don't count the votes that you get out there and you fight on the issues and you take it to where it goes and over time you can change minds and the political situation can change and before you know it you've got more support than what you thought so you just keep fighting for principle and doing the right thing and you'll let the chips fall where they may the first District republican convention is coming up I guess in about a week and they'll be under seeing a candidate how do you think you stand among the there's what two or three others yes we're in a strong position I'm running against two public and competitors they're nice guys but we've been working very hard we've been taking this race directly to Tim Walz for the last seven months we've been taking our case directly to two people and I appreciate again this opportunity to speak directly to the people our convention will be a week from tomorrow Saturday the 5th and Elbert Lee and we feel very good about our chances will you abide by the endorsement process oh absolutely I I trust and rely on the judgment of the activists of the Republican Party the delegates and alternates and I look forward to their a to their decision how do you feel about the way the country is handling the Ukraine situation that's gonna mean on the front burner here now yeah I think anytime you have a president and an administration that projects weakness we end up with problems we saw this during the Carter days we projected weakness and before you know it the Soviets and others were running around the world overtaking countries and and having Wars of not liberation but Wars of communism on fought on their terms in this case I think the mr. Putin has seen that President Obama is weak he's not going to defend our interests and this is what happens the sphere of influence of the Russians is expanding and the United States prestige has been diminished and we see this in the Middle East as well and these Obama Tim Walz foreign policy foreign policies are undermining the United States and helping our enemies one of the issues that has come up is with the internet apparently and farming out some of the things that United States is responsible for can you tell us about that well I think it was just last week that the Commerce Department put out a proposed regulation that it would send some of the domain servers over to an organization called ICANN which is more of an international group I think anytime we move away from us control the internet it's a national security and economic security issue some people have referred to this as sort of the Obama administration giving away the Panama Canal or that equivalent it may be much worse than that I mean we rely on the internet for everything in this country from from you know the sewer systems all the way up to our financial systems and we should not be turning it over to international organizations associated with the you in the Internet is a driver for democracy - a driver for Western values and we shouldn't we should maintain that here in the United States Wow what is the latest on the agriculture issues where do you stand on those well the farmers say I think what we're seeing lately is unfortunately the crop prices are down and farmers are starting to starting to struggle and winnette when people in agriculture struggle in southern Minnesota then other businesses are going to struggle and our rural communities are in trouble so what I'd like to see done for farmers is to get back to free enterprise policies in some of these other areas like we need an energy policy that's going to be make us energy independent and put a downward pressure on prices that'll help farmers getting rid of Obamacare and having free market reforms that would help our farmers getting rid of this thing called dodd-frank that congressman walz voted for it would help our farmers get capital it would help new farmers get in the business so those are the types of changes that I'd like to make to help farmers alright well our guest is Jim Hagedorn again he's the candidate for Congress and first District the seat currently held by Tim Walz the congressman or I should say Jim good luck to you election well thank you very much I appreciate it

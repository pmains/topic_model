all right we want to uh introduce you and ourselves to somebody who is running for uh the senate in nebraska his name is ben sass he is um one of the guys we've talked to uh freedomworks there's two guys that are running in nebraska uh for this uh seat both republicans are just stunning uh ben sasse is one of them and as i was talking to freedomworks i said so you you endorse the other guy and mike lee has endorsed ben sasse and um and freedomwork said i'll take either of them and i am the same way uh assuming that ben sasse is everything that he he seems to be and i have a lot of friends who are like glenn you've got to have ben sass on welcome to the program uh ben glenn good to be with you thanks for having me so tell me why you're running uh for senate what are the biggest issues and and uh and and why we should trust you yeah i'm not a politician i'm i'm running for office because we owe our kids freedom uh we we owe it to our kids to pass on to them a great and free and opportunity-filled world and we're not on a path to doing that president reagan would regularly talk about the fact that in a republic we're always only one generation away from the extinction of freedom our kids don't get it by the bloodstream they don't get it in their genes they get it because we teach them the american dream and the american work ethic and we've got a crisis in the country okay so what is the biggest what do you see coming down the road well i mean let's let's start with the fact that we have these screaming matches in washington when uh 14.3 trillion dollar debt ceiling limit goes to 16 goes to 17 and we don't even have a public that we're helping engage on the fact that our true unfunded obligations numbers more than four times bigger than that um you know we're on a path toward a greek style debt crisis politicians think they're santa claus they make promises that don't add up and then instead of dealing honestly with them they add another entitlement in the form of obamacare what is what is your background i'm a 42 year old non-politician most of my background is in business turnaround projects so i've worked for boston consulting group and mckinsey and company and spent the last five years as college president my hometown 130 year old lutheran liberal arts college was going out of business and i was blessed to be a part of a team that came in to turn it around and we're now the fastest growing school in the midwest okay there is a a story out today that i i just find remarkable uh that david stockman came out and said the fed's moves put us in to uh economic calamity the fed said it could end its stimulus program in the fall the stock market tanked uh stockton now says we should have never painted ourselves so deep in this qe corner in the first place um because the whole uh the whole policy is false how do we get out of this what do you agree with that and how do we get out of that yeah so i haven't seen the news of this morning particularly but when you're on the trail with nebraskans our folks now talk about obamacare not just as a failed world view as just not just failed legislation but an entire failed world view and one component of that is you don't even have to pretend there's budget seriousness if you pass budgets that that make no sense you can just print more money with quantitative easing round four five and six eventually uh reality comes to bear in the situation and i think greece is really the best picture of what ultimately happens you can't kick the can down the road but you don't have a you don't have a society that cares about this for the most part um you've got a president who is missing all of his national security meetings while the world is literally on fire um you have uh budgets going not even being passed and debts going through the roof you have now the polls back on obamacare with the president actually starting to climb back up again there is absolutely we are as disconnected as a society from reality as as wall street is from actual real economic numbers you know you're right uh to your opening point there about the disengagement of the public i think george will had a column last month that only about 40 percent of the american electorate even know that we have three branches of government uh so we've obviously got a crisis in a republic we believe in the self-discipline and the virtue of the people as the guardian of liberty and if we're disengaged we've got a real real problem and obviously we've got that in particular with the next generation we've bred cynicism and disengagement and false promises and the crisis of the work ethic i think is as big a deal as anything particularly political we could talk about but inside those that are politically engaged i do also find some hope uh because on the ground in nebraska we've got serious people when you go to town halls in nebraska and we're getting some of the biggest crowds in the history of nebraska politics right now these people stand up and 33 of our jobs are ag dependent jobs and if you don't get your crops in on time in the spring you're not going to get them out before the frost in the fall and there's no way the federal government can just write a new rule to make up a different reality let me talk to you about that because i think i live in a farming community um part time when i'm not living here in the city and i um uh i see two sides of things i see the side of farmers that everything makes sense when you live in a farm everything makes sense you understand how the world works you understand how nature works because you're part of it you also understand how god works because you are dependent on him you could do everything right and your crops may not come in because you're dependent on him you're also dependent on one another that being said the other side that i see is a uh is a farming society that is dependent on subsidies yes let's break those apart uh maybe a brief comment on the latter half and then let's go back to the the former as well the the federal government has so perverted the marketplace for different types of insurance all over the place i mean in healthcare we pretend we're talking about health insurance when we're usually talking about the collectivized prepayment of mostly predictable medical expenses where washington gets to be the center in an agriculture cultural farm bill the most recent one 975 pages lots and lots of slop in there there's a 150 million dollar subsidy for maple syrup marketing budget i don't see where you find from good and necessary inference in the constitution some way that the federal government should be helping us subsidize sweeteners for our breakfast products it's it's a it's a whole bunch of mess but partly the mess is created by the fact that normal farming does require there to be some sort of crop insurance market and the feds have perverted that but i think your opening points are the the right places to drill deepest our world view in america has always been based on the idea that most of what defines meeting is outside of and prior to government you know we travel the state right now in our campaign bus we have the 22 000 pages of implementing regs of obamacare and we said they're nine and a half feet of paper and we have a big metal rod through it and we anchor it in a dolly and we put it at the front of the room at all of our town halls and we contrast it with the homestead act of 1862 which is the piece of legislation that led to the settling of 270 million acres of the former louisiana purchase that homestead act of 1862 is two pages long it created a framework for ordered liberty but it didn't think that government defined meaning local families and communities and worshiping communities and civil society and mediating institutions and entrepreneurs defined meaning and we need to recover that sense of america but nobody again i go back to the nobody wants that sense of america i shouldn't say nobody there's a large growing number when the president is on ellen today and not dealing with serious journalists serious um uh issues yesterday he went to a movie screening in the middle of the work day while russia was invading ukraine he went to a private movie screening of a cesar chavez movie in the white house so nobody cares so how do you get people to have that conversation on a on a um on a national scale well unfortunately we're probably headed toward a path where crisis is what's going to focus the mind right i mean william f buckley's old line there's nothing that's wrong in america that a great depression couldn't fix unfortunately we're headed down a path toward either a debt crisis domestically with obviously international consequences or we're going to have more foreign policy crises i don't mean to go down the ukrainian path here but one of the obvious lessons we're going to learn from this five and ten years from now is countries that have a chance to go nuclear are not going to believe the promises of the us and the international community hey give your nukes back to the soviet union and we'll guarantee your terrorism that was obviously a problem that we should have i mean we should never have told them to get rid of their nukes let me let me ask you this where are you on uh foreign policy because i am a i'm a guy who 10 years ago maybe 15 years ago i probably would have said hey we gave them our word um this is the putin is a very bad man you can't let him have the rest of europe and i probably would have been a guy who said hey we've got to be involved now i have totally flipped i am i am very libertarian on let's stay out of everybody's business here where do you stand on what should we be doing in ukraine yeah so let's start with your principled question before we get to the ukraine because we're in a mess there because we've uh blustered and bluffed and drawn lines in the sand that we didn't intend to keep the first point is the first duty of the federal government is to defend us from enemies foreign and domestic the ninth and tenth amendment envision a world where almost all governance functions that might be necessary can and should be delivered at the state and local level but border security and national security policy has to be done at the federal level and so this is the first duty of government to protect us the 310 million u.s citizens that means that we need allies in the world and that means we need to keep our promises but the way adults act is you make very few commitments and you give your word very rarely but when you do you really intend to keep it i think inside the conservative movement there there's room for a continuum of views that are more isolationist to more engaged internationally but both sides should agree with the fundamental principle that it's u.s national security interests that drive those decisions and you don't give your word lightly and when you do you intend to keep it so then to your ukrainian question the problem isn't today the problem is in the years that led up to today where we just gave our word weekly and now we've reduced our level of total national security investment to the place that we've abandoned the u.s historic doctrine of being able to uh fight two large-scale wars at a time and if you make that sort of investment you rarely have to do it because people actually believe your word we're at a place right now where our enemies uh don't fear us and our friends don't trust us so so where do we do what do what we've you were in the senate right now and john mccain said my friends we've got a fight we've got to stand up to putin what would you be saying yeah i don't think we have the level of uh preparedness and investment to be able to do that i think that the mistakes that were made were well before today when we drew lines in the stand we promised we were going to deploy anti-ballistic missile systems in poland and the czech republic and we didn't fulfill our commitments there and that's why putin got what he got here but fundamentally this president has a naive liberal world view that somehow thinks international aggression is out of date we're being schooled by putin we're being schooled in iran we're being schooled in many places across the globe and the diminution of the u.s brand and credibility around the world is bad for us and bad for the world talking to ben sass he is running for senate in nebraska ben speaking of being schooled uh where do you stand on common core uh common core is such a disaster the fundamental duties of government uh at the national level don't ever have anything to do with trying to raise my kids um you know there are a lot of i think only nine states are like nebraska and being fortunate to have had a governor uh that has resisted common core but it is a tool for driving political correctness in the future we need to resist it um i heard in your intro you're talking about freedom works obviously there are issues in life where freedomworks and i uh differ but i really love the work they've done against common core the war on our children and the federalization of childhood government can't fix most problems but government can make them worse and when you see problems of dependency rising up in local communities and the feds come in and try to fill that vacuum what they actually do is they subsidize the absence of mom and dad common core is a disaster rand paul recently said uh love that by the way but rand paul uh recently said something like um we're gonna have to just republicans in order to win are just going to have to agree to disagree on social issues this time and just leave it alone sort of where how do you feel about that yeah i i don't i don't agree with that but i want to give rand something back here so i am a social conservative on all these issues i think that the traditional family uh predates government government doesn't create this meaning uh the you know the great verb at the beginning of the constitution is secure we the people come together to secure these god-given and natural and inalienable rights government doesn't give them to us and the family is the core building block of society but isn't that but isn't that what rand paul is saying that the government has absolutely no business in anybody's business they don't have a right to why why does why do we have to get our marriage um recognized by the federal government other than for tax reasons yeah i was going to go exactly to where you landed there which is when government gets as big as it is it crowds out freedom and it crowds out local community you know we're 41 years into the national tragedy that is roe v wade and abortion on demand 55 million babies have been aborted in this country in the last four decades but uncle sam took a new and more perilous step just two months ago as because of obamacare we now actively subsidize abortion obamacare is the single greatest attack on religious liberty in u.s history and so win governments that big it does crowd out freedom but one of the things i love about rand is as a committed federalist he tries to drive these issues back to the state and local level and that's what he did yesterday going going to berkeley conservatives need to actually win some arguments we can't just reach to the choir we need to go and persuade some people and i really love the way he does outreach i agree with you 100 percent i'd love to have you back then because i'd like to hear where you because you said you know i disagree with freedomworks and things i'd like to know some more you are i see what um uh mike lee uh likes in you and why he endorsed you because you you sound to me very much like mike lee um and uh and that i mean that as a compliment um i uh i can hear the constitution running through your uh your veins which is very very good but i'd like to have you back if you wouldn't mind i'd love to the constitution of the american creed we need to celebrate it and and on the freedom works point um what i simply mean is i love so much of their policy i just mean they got their endorsement wrong in this race okay all right all right ben thank you very much i appreciate it um if you want to support i wish there was a website or something that people ben nebraska b e n f o r nebraska nebraska.com pen for nebraska all right thank you very much i appreciate it ben thanks glenn bye-bye uh i'll take either of these guys he's great he's really good and and i tell you mike lee doesn't just give the endorsements out neither does freedom works but they don't give it out like candy um and uh and and and certainly mike lee doesn't and mike lee is a deep deep constitutional thinker um that is uh a very good friend of the constitution and a very good friend of both rand paul and of uh ted cruz and i think those are the two kind of branches that you kind of go off of uh here if you're at least here if you're minded like me you're kind of like when do i go with ted cruz or do i go with rand paul i'll take either of them but mike lee and guys like this are friends to both of them

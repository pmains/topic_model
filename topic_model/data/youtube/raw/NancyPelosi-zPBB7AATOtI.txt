thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank him for his leadership and that of mr. Levin and mr. Waxman as the chairs of the three committees when this legislation so transformative in the lives of the American people was passed by the House of Representatives and now for coming to the floor today to what the word is to even counter some of the ridiculousness that is being said on the other side of the aisle in relationship to the Affordable Care Act the fact is that what's happening today is the patients rights repeal act that's what they want to do is repeal patients rights why are they doing this do you think this would be a good idea to do this on women's health month to repeal legislation gives a wide range of free preventive services to women the protection being dropped for women when they are pregnant or when they are sick that no longer will they never end under the bill no longer will they be charged higher premiums then of course Republicans want to repeal that today women's health month a health week that knowing soon be a woman will no longer be a pre-existing medical condition it's just one piece of it the fact is this is not a serious effort to repeal the act that's not going to happen what this is is another example of job evasion jobs evasion in several ways first of all it is our job to come here and act for the good of the American people and right now the American people see that good as the creation of jobs what is it 134 days into this Congress and the Republican majority has yet to put forth one bill one bill out to create jobs job evasion here we are today with yet another one there subterfuges let's not talk about jobs let's use up I'm and that adds to what has it been up until now 54 million dollars 43 some days spent on this the 37th effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act but we should be doing is what the Republicans have asked for regular order to go to the budget table to reconcile the differences between the House and the Senate so that we can put forth a product of budget that creates jobs that reduces the deficit that strengthens the middle class instead we are wasting the taxpayers dollars and time on legislation that is going to undermine protections for the American people when it comes to their health and well-being this legislation this bill today just gives us another opportunity for our side to talk about the transformative nature of the Affordable Care Act if there were no reason to pass such a bill if everyone loves his or her own health care and health insurance premiums if that were the case we would still have had to pass the legislation because the status quo and health care in our country was unsustainable from a financial standpoint it was unsustainable for families for individuals for families was unsustainable for small businesses was unsustainable for corporate America the cost of health care was a competitiveness issue as we try to be retained per position as number one in the world competitive issue a cost of health care the rising heavily and it certainly was unsolvable for cities states and the federal government are by our budget could not sustain the rapid increase of health care to our budget and so that's why when the speaker asked the CBO responded by reiterating in a letter he sent yesterday yesterday the non part in congressional budget office and formed House Republicans in a letter that repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase the deficit by 109 billion dollars over the next 10 years they said this is a figure that had given the speaker last July there may be some little changes in it between now and then but that was approximately where the figure sir so if you want to reduce the deficit you don't repeal the Affordable Care Act because in doing so you increase its deficit by a hundred and nine billion dollars over the next ten years and the purpose of the bill was not only to make health care improve the quality of health care increase the accessibility to many more people and to lower the cost but that in lowering the cost it would reduce the deficit so at the bill it's that's pretty soon many more Americans will be taking advantage of it but so far over a hundred million Americans have taken advantage of the present preventive services over 100 million Americans over 100 million Americans are no longer subjected to lifetime limits on their insurance coverage that's a remarkable thing six million seniors have seen their their a prescription drug costs be reduced those who are in the doughnut hole by around six billion dollars young people can stay on there right now today on their parent's insurance policy until they are 26 years old the list goes on and on about the preventive exams that are free to seniors the list goes on and on about what benefits the action that the republicans are taking today would repeal that are good for the health and well-being of the American people now this bill is not just about health care it's about the good health of the American people it's about prevention it's about wellness it's about electronic medical records that will make a change everything in terms of access to care and the quality of your care because your records or wherever you are its entrepreneurial our founders in their dedication and their sacrifice in their courage called for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness has goals of our new republic of our democracy and this bill honors the vows of our founders and just that way a healthier life the Liberty to pursue your happiness if you're an artist or if your photographer if your writer if you want to be self-employed if you want to start a business if you want to change jobs whatever it is you are no longer job locked because you can only go as fast and reaching your passion and your aspirations as your health insurance program will take you if you have a child with a pre-existing medical condition or if you're concerned about being sick yourself you no longer are confined and your pursuit of happiness by the cost of health care premium or they even get one it is entrepreneurial we even see articles now in mr. chairman you have pointed them out in the public media about young people or not even young people but people who want to leave companies and start their own businesses they're waiting for this bill to be fully implemented so they have that freedom to go forth so while I think it is a waste of the public's time to take this bill up on the floor of the house to hear my colleagues talk on the floor you think either don't know what they're talking about or they do and in either case it is not that they are not presenting the facts about what this legislation does it is going to be right up there with Social Security and Medicare as pillars of economic and health security for the American people it is going to make us more competitive internationally because our businesses will not be have an anvil or the cost of rising cost of health care it reduces the deficit improves the health and well-being of the American people it's about the entrepreneurial spirit of America it honors the vows of our family founders of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that this legislation should be rejected and pretty soon more people as they take advantage of the legislation will see just how an important it is to them individually and how important it is to the health and well-being of our country that mr. Chatham chair I yield back the balance of my time the gentlelady yields back the gentleman

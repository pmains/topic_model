chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland mr. Hoyer about objection Thank You mr. speaker Mr Speaker I am saddened and angered that a school in my district great Mills High School in st. Mary's County was the site and most recent school shooting of which there have been 17 just since the beginning of this year two students were injured and the gunman also a student was killed and an entire community of parents students teachers and faculty has been shaken by this violence if it had not been for the courage and quick action of the school resource officer Blaine Gaskell and local law enforcement the casualties might have been far far greater Blaine Gaskill was a hero as were the teachers students and other school personnel Tim Cameron the sheriff of st. Mary's County and the Sheriff's Office of which plane Gaskell was a member responded exactly as they had practiced efficient and effective and caring Cathy O'Brien who heads up a place called Walden in our County and R in Southern Maryland was the on site just within an hour dealing with the crisis in the mental health challenges caused president Jake hybl made sure the school responded effectively Superintendent of Schools gent dr. James Smith had made sure that the school would act in a way that was appropriate we thank all of them but Mr Speaker our nation is suffering from a crisis of gun violence it has affected schools places of worship entertainment venues city streets and other places where a lot of people congregate no other industrialized society or nation faces such crisis and that's because in America or laws allow almost anybody to access dangerous firearms almost no questions asked furthermore we allow the sale of assault rifles of the kind used by soldiers in the battlefield designed to kill a lot of people quickly in this instance it was a handgun a Glock I do not know the capacity of the magazine that was used but it was not an assault rifle this republican-led Congress mr. speaker has chosen to follow the lead of the NRA and do nothing of substance we did pass a bill the other day that gave schools the some help some grant money to ensure the safety of their schools that was appropriate to do but they could do that now on their own we will help that's good but it does not address the real problem perhaps that was the point and America students however mr. speaker won't have it I had the opportunity last Wednesday to stand with thousands of students who walked out of their schools and walked into democracy and marched to the Capitol will call for action against gun violence these young people displayed the best of America using their voices and their actions to promote a just cause and a worthy effort to make our union more perfect the other members and I who join these young Americans could see that they do not take this and other national challenges lightly indeed they have much to say about the future they want for our country and for the role they will want to play in to shape it one of the students mr. speaker from Maryland Matt post spoke extraordinarily eloquently and I would like to enter his remarks in the record and I ask unanimous consent to include those remarks in the record that objection Thank You mr. speaker now I'm not gonna read the remarks in their entirety but I do want to highlight one thing Matt had to say which I thought was so profound he concluded his remarks by saying that and I quote the right to own an assault rifle does not outweigh my right to life his right to live is guaranteed by the Constitution as well there were many others like Matt Mr Speaker other student leaders from our area who stood up and spoke out and roused their peers to be engaged along with man I want to recognize Brenna Leavitt an era Shea Emily doler rotas Michael Solomon Nate invite Christiane Crawford and a student from the American University who up and organised Erin Thorpe student leaders and the many peers who marched with them yesterday deserved to be heard in the halls of Congress actually it was last week Mr Speaker we must not fail them like the young leaders of generations ago of centuries ago of millenia ago these young leaders are calling to our conscience to take action and we must not fail them we must not fail the students and teachers and parents of great Mills High School in st. Mary's County or Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in parkland Florida or Marshall County High School in Kentucky or Umpqua Community College in Roseburg Oregon or Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut or Virginia Tech or Columbine or any other school than as witnessed the carnage of a school shooting Mr Speaker we must take real action action to make our schools and our communities safer from gun violence I am proud to stand with the young Americans who walked out and thanked them for their passion and their advocacy and who say they do not want to go to school and be afraid one young woman said the first thing she does when she goes to school now is to look for a place to hide Mr Speaker we must do better than that I will continue to work closely with the community and great mills and the days and weeks ahead as we try to heal and move forward but mr. speaker in order to do that this body the people's body who raised our hand and swear an oath to the Constitution and laws of our country designed to create a more perfect union a union in which the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is protected by the people's house Mr Speaker let us act shoot Clause 12a of rule 1 the chair declares the house in recess until 11:00 a.m. today well the house back at 11 o'clock they're scheduled after that someone up in the air

[Music] hi i'm jessica charlton and i'm gina picarella and we are co-founders of job share connect um as co-founders gina and i came together and we both recognized the same problem but we did not find a good solution and that was that the work model really needed to change it needed to change for multiple reasons but one was how to keep and maximize the workforce at the same time allowing people the time they needed back in their lives so when we found job sharing as an underutilized model we wanted to standardize that for both businesses and talent so it was easy to find their match for their job share partnership and it was also easy for companies to onboard this as a flexibility solution businesses what we've found is that in nebraska in particular that there's a huge military population that is either transitioning out and wants to continue to stay in nebraska but are unable to find employment that meets their needs and utilizes their skills and also for military spouses who because they're constantly traveling are not able to maintain jobs you

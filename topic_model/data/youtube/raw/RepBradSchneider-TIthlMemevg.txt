madam Speaker like so many of my colleagues I rise today during national gun violence survivors week we mark this occasion at the beginning of February because with a gun death rate ten times greater than other developed nations more Americans have already been killed with guns in 2020 then are killed in the entire year in our peer countries we are a nation suffering an epidemic of gun violence each year more than 36,000 Americans are killed in acts of gun violence and an additional 100,000 are injured by firearms and the trauma caused by this violence is not limited to the victims losing a loved one to gun violence is a wound that never heals if this were any other epidemic destroying lives at such a great scale we would have long ago taking action to be fair in this house we did act nearly a year ago we passed bipartisan background check legislation HR 8 to close loopholes that allow gun sales to go unchecked but in the Senate leader McConnell is blocking a vote and choosing obstruction over saving lives enough is enough for all the survivors of gun violence this week we demand action I yield back

OF ONLY TEN GOP MEMBERS WHO  VOTED TO IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP,  AND ONE OF ONLY TWO SERVING ON  THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE. HE ANNOUNCED ON FRIDAY HE WILL  NOT RUN AGAIN NEXT YEAR.  >> I CANNOT FOCUS ON BOTH A  RE-ELECTION TO CONGRESS AND A  BROADER FIGHT NATIONWIDE. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR. THIS ISN'T THE END OF MY  POLITICAL FUTURE, BUT THE  BEGINNING. >> AND CONGRESSMAN KINZINGER  JOINS US NOW. GOOD MORNING, CONGRESSMAN. WHAT IS THAT BROADER FIGHT? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE IT ON? >> THE BROADER FIGHT, YOU CAN -- IN THE HOUSE, AS HARD AS YOU  CAN, FIGHT TO TELL THE TRUTH. YOU CAN FIGHT AGAINST THE CANCER IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF LIES, OF CONSPIRACY, OF DISHONESTY,  AND YOU ALSO MIGHT COME TO THE  REALIZATION THAT BASICALLY IT'S  ME, LIZ CHENEY, AND A FEW OTHERS THAT ARE TELLING THE TRUTH, AND  THERE ARE ABOUT 190 PEOPLE IN  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT AREN'T GOING TO SAY A WORD, AND THERE'S A LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN  CAUCUS THAT IS EMBRACING DONALD  TRUMP WITH ALL HE CAN. SO THE BROADER FIGHT IS LOOK --  I STARTED COUNTRY FIRST. BY THE WAY, COUNTRY1ST.COM. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT  FEEL POLITICALLY HOMELESS, AND  THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT  FEEL LIKE SOMETHING HAS TO  CHANGE IN OUR POLITICS, AND I  THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUMP IN  WITH BOTH FEET AND SEE WHERE  THAT GOES, AND SEE WHERE THAT'S  GOING. WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, WE'RE FAILING THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS FAILING  AND THE REPUBLICANS IN  PARTICULAR. >> JUST A MONTH AGO, YOU WERE  CONFIDENT YOU WERE GOING TO RUN  AGAIN. WHAT CHANGED? WAS IT THE REDISTRICTING PLAN  THAT WAS PUT FORWARD BY  DEMOCRATS IN ILLINOIS THAT  BASICALLY SQUEEZED YOU OUT OF  YOUR DISTRICT? >> YEAH. IT'S A COUPLE OF THINGS. IT'S SITTING BACK AND SAYING,  OKAY. WHAT HAPPENS IF I WIN AGAIN? I GO BACK, AND REPUBLICANS WILL  PROBABLY BE IN THE MAJORITY. I'M GOING TO BE FIGHTING EVEN  HARDER SOME OF THESE THINGS, AND IT'S BEEN OBVIOUS OVER THE LAST  TEN MONTHS THAT NOBODY -- I  HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MOMENTUM IN THE PARTY MOVE AWAY FROM LIES AND  TOWARDS TRUTH, AND THE OTHER  THING IS KEEP IN MIND, GEORGE,  TEN YEARS AGO DEMOCRATS IN  ILLINOIS CAME AFTER ME, AND THEY DID IT AGAIN. I'M NOT COMPLAINING. IT'S REDISTRICTING. I GET IT. IT'S BEING DONE AND ABUSED  EVERYWHERE, BUT WHEN DEMOCRATS  DO SAY THEY WANT, YOU KNOW,  REPUBLICAN PARTNERS TO TELL THE  TRUTH, AND THEN THEY  SPECIFICALLY TARGET ME, IT MAKES YOU WONDER, BUT I'M GOING TO  STAY IN. I'M STILL IN FOR THE NEXT 14  MONTHS, AND I'M EXCITED TO  CONTINUE ON THE JANUARY 6th  COMMISSION TO GIVE PEOPLE THE  TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE  THEY DESERVE THAT. >> PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK A  VICTORY LAP AFTER YOUR  ANNOUNCEMENT. HE SAID, TWO DOWN, EIGHT TO GO,  REFERRING TO THE TEN HOUSE  REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED TO IMPEACH HIM. YOU KNOW, A MONTH AGO WHEN  ANTHONY GONZALEZ, ONE OF THE  OTHER TEN SAID HE WASN'T RUNNING AGAIN, YOU SAID THAT WAS A WIN  FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. DID YOU HAND HIM ANOTHER WIN? >> YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY, BUT I  DON'T THINK IT WAS MY DECISION  THAT WOULD HAND DONALD TRUMP A  WIN. I THINK IT IS -- IT'S THE  SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN. HERE'S AN INTERESTING THING,  LIKE, DONALD TRUMP -- HE PUTS  OUT -- I THINK HE SAID, TWO  DOWN, EIGHT TO GO. THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY INK HE  GETS FROM THAT. HE'S KIND OF JUST TWEETING OR  PRESS RELEASING FROM MAR-A-LAGO, BUT I ACTUALLY THINK WHAT'S  GOING ON HERE IS IF HE RUNS IN  2024, HE'LL BE THE FRONT-RUNNER  NO DOUBT, BUT I THINK THE  REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT NOW,  WHETHER IT'S THE NRCC, WHETHER  IT'S KEVIN McCARTHY, HAVE HELD  ONTO DONALD TRUMP. THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO BREATHE  LIFE INTO HIM, AND SO ACTUALLY  IT'S NOT HANDING A WIN AS MUCH  TO DONALD TRUMP AS IT IS TO THE  CANCEROUS KIND OF LIE AND  CONSPIRACY NOT JUST WING  ANYMORE, BUT MAINSTREAM ARGUMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS NOT ON, YOU KNOW, THE  TEN OF US THAT VOTED TO IMPEACH. IT'S NOT ON LIZ CHENEY AND I TO  SAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT'S ON THE 190 REPUBLICANS WHO  HAVEN'T SAID A DANG WORD ABOUT  IT, AND THEY PUT THEIR HEAD IN  THE SAND AND HOPE SOMEBODY ELSE  COMES ALONG AND DOES SOMETHING. >> AND THAT SEEMS TO BE  SOLIDIFYING, YOU KNOW, CHUCK  GRASSLEY, 88 YEARS OLD, SENATOR  FROM IOWA IS RUNNING AGAIN. HE WAS QUITE CRITICAL OF THE  PRESIDENT AFTER THE JANUARY 6th  INSURRECTION, BUT HERE'S WHAT HE SAID JUST LAST MONTH IN IOWA  AFTER HE ENDORSED PRESIDENT  TRUMP, AND RECEIVED HIS  ENDORSEMENT. >> I ACCEPT THE ENDORSEMENT OF  THE PERSON THAT HAS 91% OF THE  VOTERS IN IOWA. I WOULDN'T BE TOO SMART. I'M SMART ENOUGH TO ACCEPT THAT  ENDORSEMENT.  >> THAT'S MAINSTREAM VIEW. >> YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S VERY TELLING AND IF YOU ARE IN POLITICS, YOU KNOW,  SOLELY TO BE IN POLITICS, AND  NOT TO FIGHT FOR SOMETHING  BROADER, IT'S A VERY LOGICAL  POSITION TO TAKE. WHERE I'M OPTIMISTIC, YOU KNOW,  I THINK WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH  PRETTY LOW POINTS IN A COUNTRY,  AND EVERY POINT IN HISTORY TO  EMERGE IN A BETTER WAY. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, GEORGE,  THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE, TENS OF THOUSANDS, CLOSE TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THAT  HAVE REACHED OUT THAT FEEL  POLITICALLY HOMELESS AS WELL,  AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTRY FIRST IS ACT. IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT LEAVING THE  PARTY.PIT'S ABOUT SAYING, HOW D  POLITICS DIFFERENTLY? BECAUSE THIS MATRIX OF WHAT  WE'RE CONVINCED WORKS. YOU HAVE TO BE THERE, AND BE FOR JOE BIDEN, AND BE THIS, AND BE  FOR DONALD TRUMP. THERE'S A VAST ARRAY OF  SOLUTIONS WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF. I'M OPTIMISTIC FOR THE FUTURE,  AND WHETHER THAT MEANS I'M IN  THE HOUSE OR SOMETHING ELSE OR  JUST FIGHTING FOR THIS POLITICAL CAUSE.  >> RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ON THE  JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE AS YOU  SAID. WE JUST LEARNED YESTERDAY THAT  FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO SEAL HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF  DOCUMENTS WITH EXECUTIVE  PRIVILEGE. IT DOES APPEAR THAT HIS  STRATEGY, THE STRATEGY OF SOME  OF YOUR HOUSE REPUBLICAN  COLLEAGUES IS JUST TRYING TO  DRAG THIS OUT AS LONG AS  POSSIBLE, IN THE HOPES THAT  REPUBLICANS WILL TAKE CONTROL OF CONGRESS NEXT YEAR. >> I 100% THINK THAT'S WHAT IT  IS. THEY KNOW IF THEY CAN DRAG THIS  OUT, AND IF THE REPUBLICANS TAKE THE MAJORITY, THEY WILL KILL  THIS COMMITTEE. LOOK. THEY KILLED AN INDEPENDENT  COMMISSION. THEY'VE KILLED ANY ATTEMPT TO  GET TO THE TRUTH. WE HAVE SOURCES BEYOND JUST  THOSE THAT ARE KIND OF MAKING  THE NEWS, THE STEVE BANNONS, YOU KNOW, THE ARCHIVES. WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN AND  TALKING TO THE COMMITTEE EVERY  DAY, BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT  THAT ARCHIVE REQUEST AND WHAT  THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS TRYING  TO BLOCK, IT IS VERY TELLING  WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE  CALL LOGS, ET CETERA. TAKE THAT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,  AND THE PRESIDENT HAS NO GROUNDS TO CLAIM EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AS  HE IS TODAY. >> BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN, DO YOU THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE  GROUNDS TO PROSECUTE PRESIDENT  TRUMP FOR HIS ROLE IN THE  INSURRECTION? >> I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE  MAKING THAT STATEMENT YET. I'LL SAY THIS. WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF  INFORMATION. WE ARE CONTINUING TO LEARN  THINGS EVERY DAY. SOME OF WHICH GETS OUT TO THE  PRESS. SOME THAT DOESN'T. IF THE PRESIDENT WAS AWARE OF  WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, DIDN'T LIFT A FINGER TO DO ANYTHING  ABOUT IT. THAT'S UP TO THE DOJ TO MAKE  THAT DECISION. WE CAN PUT OUT THE FACTS, BUT  I'LL SAY THIS TOO. JUST FROM A RAW POLITICAL  PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU WANT A  PRESIDENT THAT CAN SIT AROUND  AND BE MORE INTERESTED IN DOING  THINGS LIKE WATCHING TELEVISION  THAN ACTUALLY PROTECTING THE  SEED OF THE CAPITOL OF THE  UNITED STATES AND YOU WANT TO  PUT HIM BACK AS PRESIDENT OR YOU WANT TO NO, MMINATE HIM AS  PRESIDENT, DON'T COME ASKING ME  WHY THE PARTY HAS

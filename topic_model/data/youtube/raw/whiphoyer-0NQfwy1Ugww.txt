thank you very much miss LOI here we are again mr. speaker two weeks ago the Republican majority asked for another two weeks to write an appropriations package to fund the government yet now they're asking to kick the can down the road one more time we all knew that those two weeks were a pretence for getting the votes to pass their tax bill we didn't make any progress on a bipartisan appropriation bill before that Republicans asked for an additional 12 weeks in September we all voted to give that 12 weeks all of us know exactly why the Kin keeps being kicked farther and farther down the road it's because the majority cannot muster a majority of their own members to support bipartisan funding bills because the governing party which controls the House Senate and White House has not been able to govern Senate Republican John Cornyn said on Sunday the can always seems to be kicked down the road yet here we are again with Republicans doing exactly that mr. speaker let's call the CR for what it is a chaotic retreat from rational regular order and fiscal responsibility we have a long cited a supplemental funding bill that provides some additional emergency relief to those affected by our natural disasters but it ought to do more in my opinion to help those in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands it's been three months since Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and Harvey visited so much water on Houston many still do not have electricity in Puerto Rico or running water these are our fellow Americans we owe it to them and to ourselves to help them in their time of need Congress mr. speaker can do better it should do better we should act in a bipartisan way I was on the Appropriations Committee as an active member for 23 years I was a member Health Committee and I told people that you could take the 13 of us we were eight Democrats and five Republicans you could have taken the 13 of us thrown us up in the air we would have come down in random seats and how to markup and you would have been hard-pressed to identify the Democrat or the Republican because we believed our responsibility was to fund the priorities of this country now I know that we passed 12 bills it's almost as if general is gentleman is recognized for one additional minute I thank the speaker and I thank the gentlelady from New York the Appropriations Committee used to be an extraordinarily bright partisan committee where we worked together not on a partisan basis but on a basis of trying to determine which priorities were important for our country what funds were needed so that agencies could operate in an effective way that unfortunately is not happening the way it did so Mr Speaker I urge my Republican friends who control this house and all the levers of government to work with Democrats on making sure that all those who need emergency disaster relief as well as those who need funds to operate their government agencies in a way that serves America best I urge us to work together toward that end and I urge us because nobody believes these see ours our good policy but they unfortunately are becoming regular if not regular order I yield back the balance of my time gentleman's time has expired the gentlewoman from

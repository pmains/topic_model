there has been considerable progress mobilizing international support for Haiti since the introduction of this bill multilateral development institutions have already begun to take steps to reduce our council Haiti's debts and on March 31st the United Nations hosted the International donors conference for Haiti where leaders of the world's nations pledged nine point nine billion in aid including 5.3 billion for the first two years I'm encouraged by this progress and I'm inspired by the outpouring of support for Haiti from the international community the people of Haiti were poor but they are physically and spiritually resilient I know that with the support of the international community they will recover from this tragedy and create a better future for their children mr. speaker and members in fact Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere and Haiti has experienced extreme devastation for many years it was just 2008 when they were hit with four hurricanes and they had not had the opportunity to even try to recover from those hurricanes at that time there were many deaths many houses are the roads then the bridges were destroyed and coming on the heels of that they were confronted with this most devastating earthquake there are those who look at Haiti and say we don't know whether or not this nation can survive there are those who say you know that had problems with governance they have lived under dictators they have lived under a Catholic priests who practiced Liberation Theology where there was a coup d'etat that Elstad him and it goes on and on and on but there are many of us who look at this earthquake as opportunity despite the severe loss and the devastation we believe that there's now a real commitment by the world community to come to the aid of Haiti we believe that there's a real commitment to governance in a new way we believe that is a real commitment not only by USAID the State Department and the government of our own country but by other governments around the world to include Haiti in the redevelopment and so despite the devastation I think that many of us are looking forward to the opportunity to help Haiti become the country that it can become this is going to be a lot of hard work but this debt relief will go a long way toward happenin that redevelopment with this debt relief that means that Haiti will not have to repay debt they can invest that money in health and education and infrastructure and despite the fact that I've spent many hours working not only on this debt relief bill but working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle I've learned a lot working with the Jubilee committee and would mr. Bachus about what we can do if we cooperate and that we have been doing and so we move forward to have develop Haiti and I would appreciate the support and the vote of my colleagues for this debt relief legislation

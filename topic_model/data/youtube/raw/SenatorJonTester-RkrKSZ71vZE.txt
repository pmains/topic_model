the Wildfire funding fix that's in the omnibus that we just are going to vote on tomorrow is critically important it allows us to treat wildfires as a natural disaster which is what they are treat them just like tornadoes or hurricanes floods whatever it may be in not robbed from the Forest Service budget because when we take money on the Forest Service budget to fight fires we cannot do proper forest management it takes away all the resources of the Forest Service in fact this year it took over half of the Forest Service budget just to fight fires and it's been that way over the last twenty years where we see every year more and more dollars are coming out of the Forest Service to fight fires because their summers are getting hotter and drier there's just no doubt about that so this is a step forward for the Forest Service and for forest management and it's a good thing to do and I'm glad we finally got it done in the Omnibus budget

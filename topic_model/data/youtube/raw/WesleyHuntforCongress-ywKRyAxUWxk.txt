some people want to be paid back and and members of the public are wondering why are we suffering when you are you know you have all of this vast wealth those are legitimate concerns well i think you're right about reparations in terms of if people want it though what they need to do is you always need to go back to the beginning of a supply chain where was the beginning of the supply chain that was in africa and when that crossed the entire world when the slavery was taking place which was the first nation in the world that abolished uh slavery the first nation in the world to abolish it it was started by william wilberforce was the british in in great britain they abolished slavery 2000 naval men died on the high seas trying to stop slavery why because the african kings were rounding up their own people they had them on cages waiting in the beaches no one was running into africa to get them and i think you're totally right if reparations need to be paid we need to go right back to the beginning of that supply chain and say who was rounding up their own people and having them handcuffing pages absolutely that's where they should start and maybe i don't know the descendants of those families where they died at the in the high seas trying to stop the slavery that those families should receive something to i think at the same time

recognized for five minutes thank you man i'm sure and uh i want to thank you for holding this hearing a congressional oversight of these unprecedented programs is critical especially as we think strategically about the past our posture going into the fall i want to thank you as always and to the committee staff for the work you've been doing throughout this process secretary mnuchin and mr carranza thank you for joining us today and for your work assisting small businesses throughout this pandemic administer administrator kronzer you assured me that many of our complaints about the idle program the lack of communication to borrowers the backlog of applications have been addressed i heard you say today that you've compressed the time of processing to only five days but i'm concerned that you know at this moment as we're in this kind of lull it's kind of like a diner in between the lunch and the dinner rush things are quiet but it's going to get busy again soon when money starts to run out when you talk about the 150 000 uh as a cap and earlier you had mentioned that we through our work had provided a bridge when you created that arbitrary cap that's a bridge that goes part way across the river but without a full bridge many of these businesses are going to find themselves in the river getting wet and many of them will drown we need your help and i hope you will lift that cap and and give the help that many of these businesses need economic uncertainty continues and will continue in the months ahead uh small businesses are still going to need more help in the fall and and so today what i'd like to discuss is treasury and sba's preparations to anticipate the expected surge and and challenges in the fall earlier this week i sent both of you a letter with questions i'd like to discuss on on on the ppp and ibl e-idea loans how well they were implemented how they helped the businesses what gaps remain and what your agencies are doing to anticipate that in that vein secretary mnuchin what economic forecasting or modeling if any has treasury done to anticipate future needs so uh is i think economic modeling is particularly hard at the moment because of the fact that we close down the economy this is not a typical economic situation but we are relying upon our economic models where we do anticipate as we open the economy that we will have a significant improvement as i've said in the third quarter but there will be industries and we've done economic modeling uh within the treasury on the industries that are going to be hit the hardest and the sizing that we need of additional ppp funds to address that and we'll be working with this committee and with the senate on that do your models take into account the fact as we're seeing in california texas arizona louisiana florida a a serious spike in in cases in california you're seeing businesses close down again do the models take that into consideration well again let me just first say that traditional economic models given the medical situation are very hard but yes we're looking at this across the entire us and certain scenarios as you said where there will be a slow down an opening in certain areas where things are doing better but again that's the reason why i think we need additional funds to help these hardest hit businesses and i appreciate it's hard but it's it's necessary and it's also necessary for these businesses and other organizations like our schools to have clear and consistent guidance i've had countless conversations with businesses yesterday i had a group call zoom call with school superintendents and all of them are talking about the challenges they're facing with the lack of clarity and the guidance coming from both your your department uh as well as as others uh and i asked the superintendents about the teachers the teachers said they're absolutely terrified about going back to work i don't think the government's doing nearly enough to provide that guidance i hope we can see more guidance um but as you're looking at at forward thinking and what we might need how do you incorporate the data you have the the uncertainty that lies ahead to make sure we can give better guidance to our businesses going forward well i i can assure you that the the task force will be working and continues to work with the states on guidance and and obviously the states refine it based upon the different areas and and on your comment uh i expect that we will have a significant amount of money dedicated to k-12 education to help them deal with as they the the areas that reopen have the proper money to fit uh so that it's safe for students and for teachers uh thank you let me just say it's critical not just the money which desperately is needed but the guidance on how to use that money and how best to open safely in my last few seconds uh uh administrator karanza when we spoke last i gave you last month a letter asking for an update on 59 businesses in my district that still had not received a decision on their idle application as of today 12 more than 24 20 of those companies are still waiting can you give us an estimate when we will get these uh companies like easy cut in my districts uh are waiting and and trying to get that information to survive this pandemic gentleman's time has expired you might proceed congressman i look forward to working with your office to identify the remaining balance of those businesses to come to a conclusion thank you

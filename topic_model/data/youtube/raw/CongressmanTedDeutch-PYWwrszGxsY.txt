I'm joining about congressman Ted Deutsche Democrat from Florida and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Judiciary and ethics committees with plenty to talk about this morning congressman thanks for coming back on the show that's great to be with you thanks let me start with a little bit on the Democratic race come 2020 Dave waggle over at the Washington Post reports that Bernie Sanders in the last three hours since it launched his campaign raised more than a million dollars right there is clearly a lane for Bernie Sanders for progressive Democrats which way do you think the party should go come 2020 that more progressive land or the more moderate one yeah well I don't at this point we're just at the start of this campaign here's what I can tell you about every single candidate who's running they want to restore American leadership when Donald Trump retreated they want to restore American values like integrity and honesty and truth that Donald Trump has trampled they want to deal with real emergencies like climate change and 40,000 people dying a year from gun violence and economic insecurity of millions of Americans rather than fake national emergencies so we're gonna have a long important debate about how to do all of these things but the difference between every single Democrat who's running and a president who has thrown these values out the window is stark and that's why we're all so optimistic about the 2020 election one thing Bernie Sanders senator Sanders did not talk about when he was asked was this explosive claim by Andrew McCabe somebody else he's making headlines today regarding the 25th amendment in conversations that were apparently had according to McCabe on the level of Rod Rosenstein to remove Donald Trump from office Sanders said he didn't want to talk about it I'm wondering if you do what you make of that claim and what you make of the reaction so far to McCain well I absolutely want to I appreciate the question of course when the the acting director faced a moment where there was such concern by him and among his team that they chose to launch a counterintelligence investigation into the President of the United States there are a million questions that follow from that we have to we have to look at the president's actions from from disclosing highly classified information to the Russians Minister in the Oval Office to the secret meeting with that the off-the-record without anyone in attendance meeting with now with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki we have to we have to ask the questions about what is it exactly that the president has been has been doing and to the extent that the the Acting Director can shed some light into what they were thinking at the time it helps prove why the Muller investigation is so important but remember Hallie I just make this point the Muller investigation is important not because it's going to produce a report we're we're interested in seeing him finish his work but what we're altima ly interested in is getting to the truth for the American people that is going to come in part from what Muller produces and it's going to come in part from what Congress is now underway and investigating so given what you just laid out congressman about the idea that Andrew McCabe is talking about some of this and answering some of these questions do you want him to come back in front of as a member of the Judiciary Committee do you want to see him come in front of your committee what questions would you had for him should he be subpoenaed if he doesn't do it voluntarily well I would like to ask I would like to ask the kinds of questions that that I just laid out and that the decision to launch a counterintelligence investigation into the president is is a it's remarkable it's distressing and certainly we'd like to understand better what the thinking was even beyond what was already public at that time we were at this moment now where the president every day tweets about the about the Muller report the Director of National Intelligence was just on Capitol Hill the president continues to try to undermine the intelligence community makes claims about Russia and this investigation being a hoax when the Director of National Intelligence tells us that the intelligence community is so worried about Russia's attempts to interfere with the 2020 election all of this there's a whole pattern that's developed over the course of this presidency that that needs to be the focus not just of the Muller investigation but I want to hear what what the Acting Director has to say just as we listen to the FBI director before him you mentioned the DNI dan coates I have a question for you on that but very quickly here I just helped yes or no would you support a subpoena for Annie McCabe if he didn't come on his own accord well I'd like to I don't know that the subpoena is going to be necessary I'd like to ask him to come in and and in by all indication that sounds like he's going to on Dan Coates the Director of National Intelligence somebody who interacts with the president especially when he's out in Florida Chris ruddy told I think to Christian I'm a poor the president is not happy with coats for publicly disagreeing on North Korea's nuclear capabilities there was that moment I want to show it here very quickly between Andrea Mitchell and Dan Coates of course last year which seemed to show the disconnect remember this right watch we have some breaking news the White House has announced on Twitter that Vladimir Putin is coming to the White House in the fall say that again [Laughter] Vladimir Putin yeah okay that's going to be special what happens congressman if the President does in fact get rid of dan coates right but remember now he the the president sending out one of his one of his friends to talk about his displeasure doesn't have anything to do with that it has to do with the job that the Director of National Intelligence is doing the fact that dan coates came to Capitol Hill and pointed out that when the president says that he's defeated Isis the national insurance the National Intelligence director points out that in fact Isis has thousands of soldiers who were looking to carry out attacks the president says the president says that North Korea has no nuclear weapons and he says that they're not giving up their WMD capabilities and on Russia we've already talked about that the president is upset because the intelligence community has just shown time and again that most of what the president says on these issues is just flat-out wrong congressman Ted Deutsche will have to leave it there thank you for coming on the show much appreciated

gentlemen um very nice to see you all again thank you for your extraordinary service and thank you for your leadership during one of the most challenging chapters in the history of this country at least in the years that I've spent on this earth hi my colleagues would tell you you don't know me well but my colleagues would tell you I'm a glass-half-full guy I take to my heart the the words and the the Bible and all things give thanks sometimes it's hard to do other words of Albert Einstein and adversity lies opportunity and sometimes that's hard to to realize but this is adversity God knows this is adversity and there's got to be some opportunity here as well I am served in uniform never made it through Admiral made it as far as captain but and what I am was along with John woods though death of john mckean last vietnam veteran serving in the US Senate and I like to run down to Lincoln Memorial I usually go home at night but I love the run from here down to Lincoln Memorial and I buy cars run by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial as well and there's 58,000 names carved into that stone and I think about them every time I run by them that's 58,000 names we learned this week I'd say this to the administrator gain we learned this week Pete that the number of deaths is in 110,000 this country it's a hundred and seventeen thousand I just learned that this morning that's twice as many people who died from this virus is died in the entire of Vietnam War from beginning to end and that war was predicated on a an untruth and we paid severe severe price for that we are in a different kind of war today and we're in an award that you're trying to help us turn the corner on and turn the tide and I just want to say that the the work that you've described the efforts that you've described from men and women in uniform folks who are medical professionals folks who are in the private sector who fly airplanes and move goods from all across the world heroic efforts her walk efforts we have somebody's really close to our family who's an anesthesiologist and she's very special to us she graduated from Anna's her anesthesiology for years as a about to be anesthesiologist and finished last week four months she has worked in a hospital intubating people so that they could be placed on go into a coma and be placed in a ventilator and hopefully survive most did and she's a hero as well or heroine as well there's all kinds of people hundreds thousands tens of thousands across the country and and that I'm inspired by them and I'm inspired by the the efforts that you describe here today but what I'm not inspired by are these numbers in a in a country in a world where we in the United States have less than five percent less than five percent of the world's population we've recorded more than 25% of the world's deaths from co19 I like I have a friend you asked me how he's do any I says compared to what and I'm just saying hey I just want to compare the u.s. to what and we're at 117 thousand and Counting New Zealand 22 Singapore 25 Taiwan 7 Australia 102 Canada 7800 South Korea 274 Germany 8800 Japan 916 China I don't know that I believe these numbers but with on 1.4 billion people there reporting less than 10,000 death even if you double that it's still only 20 and the thing that I have a hard time getting my head around in understanding is how by comparison do our deaths have they reached these kind of staggering numbers by comparison to these other nations I've just mentioned and I'm not a real partisan guy but I'm just going to share with you what maysun partisan but it's the truth and I want to use these words from our president February 28th 2020 is what he said he says it's going to disappear one day it's like a miracle it will disappear that was February 28th 2020 March 6 the president's words anybody that wants a test can get a test that's what the bottom line is really March 6th here's March 10th the same president he said this was unexpected and were prepared and we're doing a great job with it he added and it will go away just stay calm it'll go away March 24th we've never closed down the country for the flu you can say to yourself what is this all about in May 20th when you say that we lead in cases that's because we have more testing than anybody else I don't look at that as a bad thing I look it as a badge of honor that just flies in the face of the truth you've been asked and handed an incredibly difficult challenge incredibly difficult challenge and if truth be known it's because we were really late out of the starting gate realizing what we faced and addressing it right up front right up front fellow used to be the head of the General Motors used to say leadership is staying out a step when everyone else is watching to the wrong turn well the people that you have to lead have had too much a lot faster because of the lack of leadership that we had in February in March into April so I just want to thank you Herculean effort to try to get us out of this out of this crisis finally and we're not there yet but because of your efforts well be we'll be there someday a question when I was remember the house representatives I co-authored the reauthorization of the defense production Act one of the things I was proud of and I've followed with interest the role that this administration is played with respect to using the defense production act but what is the role of this White House this would be in a few Admiral and the administrator gainer what is role of a White House if any in steering defense production act policy and response to covert and specifically what is the role of the president's trade adviser Peter Navarro and improving defense production Act requests or shaping DPA policy and I would ask that of Admiral Paulo Chuck and Admiral I'd admit a straighter gainer please you that order Minister algo I'll go first so any use of the defense production Act and no matter where may came from so let me describe a little bit to you otherwise I do my work who figured out that you know n95 masks for incredibly short supply lying on Asia the first action that I put over to the joint acquisition task force was increased US production and n95 masks that came that wreath at work came back from the professionals acquisition professionals at DoD came back in through the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA whose staff brought it to the unified command group the ucg were administrator gainer dr. Catholic and Admiral JA lead that approved that item and then sent it to the White House the NSC to work through the staffing at the White House and then it was again briefed to the White House Task Force for approval I would imagine that mr. Navarro is in that management process but I have no first-hand knowledge of mr. Navarro approval of something it was all proved that the White House Task Force and mr. Gaynor just a brief response if you would be yesterday I wholly agree with the Admirals recital of how that process works that's exactly how it works there's a there's a function for that we've used DPA FEMA and my other partners 15 times a title one title three title seven all those all those uses follow that process and it's pretty straightforward from my point of view all right thanks very much Thank You mr. John senator

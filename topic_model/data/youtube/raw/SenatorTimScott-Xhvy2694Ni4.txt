[Music] all right the remains of the Chinese spy fight heading to the Quantico labs in Virginia for analysis as Fox News learns the president will make a brief reference to the incident in tonight's State of the Union Address the administration scheduled to classify briefing for all centers including our next guest on Thursday GOP Senator Tim Scott joins us now two days leading up to that big briefing Senator how new was the balloon to you and understanding what China was up to when you first found out about it it was over Montana perhaps how new is that for you it's very new unfortunately for the administration it was not new January 31st they had an opportunity to act and they let it pass by one of the things when you have weakness on the global stage and Biden has presented weakness not strength you see our adversaries and our competitors whether it's China Iran or frankly Russia they're all emboldened by a weak leadership from the American president and this is another indication that China assumes that he is weak I sense he's going to say they sent the balloon and I shot it down and people stand up and cheer will you cheer that absolutely not it was literally a dereliction of Duty to wait six seven days before he acted that is not in the American people's best interest what's in our best interest is to take enemy and or adversarial uh adversaries to take action against them as soon as possible that did not happen there's nothing to cheer about in this situation whatsoever they sent it over South Carolina too it started in Montana did they brief you on that well I got a briefing about an hour from the dod before it happened but here's the truth Brian they closed down three airports for hours because they tried to put together a plan thank God for our military thank God for the F-22 fighter that shot it down but the truth is slow action from this Administration imperils people throughout the world even here at home that is something that we should take seriously is this dereliction of Duty from President Biden all right so let's talk about the State of the Union tonight uh it's going to go for about an hour he's got special guests there the theme is he'll be reassuring assessment of the state of our Union and he's going to point to the jobs numbers the unemployment rate and the fact that we're not in a recession what would you would you expect to hear well I think we'll he'll say is that 573 000 jobs last month was a was a record what he won't tell us is what we see with our own eyes is that 13.5 inflation has eroded our spending power what he won't talk about is how gas is over 40 electricity up 20 plus he's going to give us a song and dance show to tell the American people things are better than what we think they are actually they are exactly as we see that they are gases eye electricity is high eggs in California it's almost ten dollars we have to do better we deserve better that means we need a change in leadership in order for us to put America back on the right path Senator one of the reasons people are talking about you for president is because you gave the rebuttal to the first state of the union they said this guy was so composed so upbeat and so accurate and direct he's got president he's got presidential Timber and that's why you're invited to the Club for Growth donors conference I imagine I know you're thinking about it doing a listening tour but what advice would you give Sarah Huckabee Sanders tonight because she's got the pressure on her shoulders to give the rebuttal speech well she is a strong powerful woman I am so excited to hear what she has to say just be yourself Sarah you have already knocked the ball out of the park several times you know what to communicate education is the closest thing the magic make sure that the American people understand that we are the party of parents talk about the strength of the economy in Arkansas and what you're going to do to make it even better and talk about the fact that American greatness starts with her people not the government that's why we are unleashing Economic Opportunity throughout this country by making sure American entrepreneurs have all the tools they need so Tim it's very special day for you and your family and for the country uh it's your mom's birthday what should everyone know about your mom well thank you very much Saturday University was Saturday yeah that's close enough my mother actually thinks she gets a birthday week and not a birthday so the most important thing that I bought my mother is that she used the biggest encourager I've ever had and she's also my toughest critic she makes it real whenever I'm in town she'd make sure that I take her trash out before I go to my own house and so I love my mom uh happy birthday week Mom I love you so much God bless you now does she all over the news where if there's something happening does she want to know your opinion is she asking you what you're doing next how close is she to filing your career you know she actually tells me what I should do and when she disagrees with me she'll have a debate I I love the fact that she's actually engaged in some of the issues that she finds to be really important she enjoys debating issues around taxes because as a single mother she understands the power of the purse keeping money in her person not in the government's purse she loves education because while she finished high school she wanted her kids to do better I mean she just represents what every single mother across this country wants is that the Next Generation within their family to be empowered with more resources more opportunity and then pay it forward for the next generation and between you as a sitting Senator and your brother as a military officer she's got to be pleased and proud happy birthday to Mrs Scott uh Senator best of luck with your big decision I look forward to talking to you after you get your briefing on Thursday God bless you got it

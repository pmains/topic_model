hello this is u.s senator cindy hyde-smith of mississippi amid an alarming surge in violent crime across the country it's critical to remember the men and women who toil every day to keep our community safe i believe demands by radical liberals to defund the police is contributing to the alarming spike in violent crimes whether or not you live in a state or community that actually agrees to cut police budgets let's be frank the defund the police mantra nurtures the idea that law enforcement is the enemy and it diminishes just how vital they are to keeping us safe it is important that we remember law enforcement officers are human fathers mothers daughters friends and neighbors when they leave their families to report to work they knowingly step into harm's way to protect and serve so let's recognize the sacrifices they make day in and day out so that we may sleep more soundly and feel at ease in our communities to law enforcement in mississippi and across the nation thank you from the bottom of my heart i will continue to pray for your protection as you carry out your vital duties god bless you all

uh Senator Tom Cotton from the great state of Arkansas is here Senator Tim Scott from the great state of South Carolina is with us I don't want to get ahead of myself but I could see two potential presidential candidates down the road I'm just guessing you never know just throwing that out there thank you all for being with us you know you're running your own re-election round absolutely you I predict you win by 12. so I'm glad you're here but you you made it a priority to help Herschel to help Dr Oz and Lindsey Graham said something the other night that people in South Carolina are tired of having their votes canceled out by these radical liberal Senators absolutely there's no doubt about it when you think about the most important issues to Americans inflation Biden has provided the American people with a pay cut 18 consecutive months with inflation outpacing wage increases and in York Pennsylvania we're going to send a message to All America elect oh it's got to start here without any questions John I can't even believe it think about what you said during your amazing monologue a person puts a shotgun in a man's chest an innocent man imagine it being a white Republican putting the shotgun you scare me now in the chest I'll go back there okay we go to church together can you imagine the media frenzy around that issue can you imagine the having a president who says nothing on that the national media silent the vice president silent why because they care more about the issue and the people living in impoverished areas where I come from think about the single mothers trapped in their houses at night praying for daylight so they can go outside because they're afraid of the crime driving throughout this nation we need a common sense conservative from Pennsylvania to bring home the majority by the way for the record Senator Scott was not kidding we actually have the same Pastor uh he introduced me to him and he's been has had such a great impact on my life and I appreciate you as the friend that you are great friends Senator cotton you're up from Arkansas you know what I'm glad you're here this is important to the country when you look at when you compare and contrast fetterman and Dr Oz that you can't have a bigger Choice election than this it really couldn't be a bigger Choice election Sean and I got to tell you that control of the senate in Washington runs through Pennsylvania we have to elect Dr Oz to hit the brakes on bidened radical ideological agenda let's just take the energy issue Sean Dr Oz and I were out on a natural gas pad in Western Pennsylvania a couple days ago with hard-working pennsylvanians who are getting God's resources out of the ground for the benefit of America and the rest of the world the thing about the issues that you care about do you care about high paying good quality jobs for thousands of Pennsylvania families you've got that do you care about lowering inflation lowering the cost of your utility bills then Pennsylvania can do that for us as well do you care about supporting our friends and partners around the world wouldn't it be better if our friends in Europe had Pennsylvania gas as opposed to rushing gas and if you or if you're concerned about our environment isn't it better for us to be using good clean burning Pennsylvania natural gas and having third world coal dug up with the worst cut with the worst kinds of practices all around the world yet John fetterman as you saw he would ban hydraulic fracturing the most advanced Innovative environmentally friendly way to get that natural gas out of the ground Dr Oz will be a champion for Pennsylvania's energy industry he will prevent the Democrats from forbidding it and he will promote it um for those of you that may not know in the crowd uh I first met Newt Gingrich in a holiday in room in 1990 I was a local host in Alabama and then I got a job offer in Atlanta where you were and I was the emcee the night that he became Speaker of the House in 1994 it was the honor of my life and he's one of my dearest closest friends so you're one of the smartest political strategist I've ever met and you have been defining the closing arguments of this election explain okay it's not complicated uh if you like inflation eating up your paycheck you ought to vote Democrat if you like having your 401k collapse so you can't afford to retire you ought to vote Democrat if you think having a guy Run for the Senate who voted 25 times to release a murderer when the other four members of the parole board voted no the only person to vote for these 25 murderers was Federal now if you think that's a good idea and Philadelphia doesn't have enough crime and Pittsburgh doesn't have enough crime you ought to vote Democrat because you're going to make sure you get more they want to give you more of the wrong thing and less of the right thing so it's not this is not a complicated election this is a straightforward election of having every American look at the world around them and make a simple decision you want to keep going down this road or not I've I've known memorize for many years I knew him back when he was already an Eagles fan which I have to say anyway hold on one can only go so far but he may have lost in votes in Pittsburgh oh I I think any Pennsylvania team is acceptable at this point but I know that he went to medical school in Pennsylvania he went to business school in Pennsylvania he grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs and like everything else about fetterman's campaign the attack on Oz was just plain a lie fetterman cannot tell the truth because if he's going to tell the truth he might as well get off the ballot let me highlight one thing I touched on it earlier but it's rare that I'm in a group and we do a lot of gatherings like this just if you don't mind put your hands up if your life has been touched by Fentanyl so you see how many hands go up wow now here's the part that hurts me I'm a doctor I've dealt in addiction for many many years and I understand how challenging it is to come back from that abyss of darkness when John Federman says he wants to legalize all drugs decriminalize all drugs when he wants to create heroin injection sites and no one wants it in their neighborhood because they know it brings crime it's devastating to communities and then when he says he wants an open border because he wants more workers and he wants Sanctuary cities so our governments can't work you know Municipal and federal governments can't work together you build what we have now in Pennsylvania a a rabid illness that is taking over all of our youth and we haven't done anything about it because we're following John federman's and people like his lead I think addiction is probably big in South Carolina right yeah I mean think about the issue 107 000 Americans have lost their lives Plus because our borders are open we need to build a wall to stop that fitting off from walking across we have an opportunity we have an opportunity to restore sanity to this country by controlling our borders every single County in America every single County in Pennsylvania is a border County because we're all experiencing illegal immigration Fentanyl and National Security risk because of that southern border being open so let me ask you if I can a question for everybody the reason this race I think is where it is is because the Democratic party has been pouring money into Pennsylvania I just learned before I walked on the stage here we're expecting another 10 million dollars coming against us and it's a panic move because they know they're in trouble and they're pulling in money from Every Which Way that's why it is vital vital that we have the support if I can tell the truth about John fetterman more than he lies about me we've got this race and I think you've all been there [Music] [Applause] it's very simple if you want to keep murderers in prison and you want to keep John fetterman on his parents allowance go to doctoroz.com and with that we'll take a quick break we'll have more with Dr Oz Newt Gingrich Senators Tim Scott and Tom Cotton we are in York Pennsylvania

America is listening foreign [Music] welcome back to Hannity we continue from beautiful York Pennsylvania with Newt Gingrich Senator Tom potty Senator Tim Scott and Dr Oz you know I said it's interesting and this has played out in pretty much every race gubernatorial race Senatorial race the Democrats their strategy is to hide they have tens and tens of millions of dollars in negative smear ads um they don't answer any questions if they debate like in the case of Dr Oz they will do it a week before the election after early voting has gone on for weeks if not months um I worry about money and campaigns in the sense that negative ads people begin to believe the lie what's the best way to counter that look I think it's pretty straightforward you tell the truth routinely all day every day and then people get to decide so the you know President Biden says we have a great economy well you go to the gas station you go well maybe not you go to the grocery store he said the economy is strong as hell right which I think given his cognitive situation may be true no idea what the economy is but the fact is reality I mean if if look take the example of crime people in Philadelphia watch the evening news you can't buy enough ads to convince them that Philadelphia's safe people in Pittsburgh watch The Evening News you can't buy enough ads and then they go out to the grocery store you can't buy enough ads to convince them the Democrats know what they're doing you go through item by item and people go you know the truth is if you want a better future you vote Republican if you want to put up with the current disaster you vote Democrat gee that's really a hard decision well you know and I think that's the answer that's a good point gone I think Newton made a very important Point how many of us want energy Independence energy Independence today you have to go to doctoroz.com literally in order for us to create a firewall for the American people we have to elect Republicans that starts right here right now with Dr Oz doctoroz.com if you want if you want inflation coming down Dr Oz has to go up doctoroz.com we have to figure out we better make we have to match fire with fire but by the way you're in the wrong business you need to be a talk show husband are really good at what you're doing yes sir you taught me but the bottom line is a single thing Newt said everything you stand for and that we stand for but more importantly the kids and the grandkids of the people here today we're fighting for their future not ours I will stand up for America's kids every single day we will fight night and day in a full moon to win in America bring you at home you're right right here right now you know I all the years I've started and been in radio and TV I've never felt a sense of urgency Senator cotton like I do now for and for the sake of our kids and grandkids as Senator Scott's pointing out I never worried this much I never thought things could get this bad this fast and that's the urgency I feel that I don't even feel as a communicator that I can convey to my audience how how critical this moment is now it's incredibly urgent Sean I mean just look at what the Democrats have been able to do in two years when they have a thin majority in the house and it's a 50-50 Senate imagine what they would do they had total control if they had complete majorities with no breaks on them whatsoever I mean think about those workers that Dr Oz and I visited uh out in Western Pennsylvania earlier this week um John fetterman would literally ban their jobs he would put them out of work or think about the families who've been devastated by crime and by fentanyl here in the Keystone State I mean when John fetterman was asked if you had a magic wand you could have one wish what would it be he didn't say like I would end our inflation problem or I'd bring down the price of gas or I'd I'd solved the opioid epidemic that's killing so many pennsylvanians he said I would end long sentences for murderers that's in addition to all the murderers he's voted to let out of prison so yeah there's an absolute sense of urgency here in Pennsylvania and really across the country because most Americans understand the stakes of this election if you want a future that is bright and prosperous and safe for our for our country for our children then you have to vote Republican and you have to help these elect Republicans get elected you can do that by going to doctoroz.com and pitching in to make sure that he can answer the lies that Democrats are telling about every election year I spend a lot of time on the phone with Newt Gingrich because I don't think I've I've ever met anybody that's able to predict an election result as well as you can and I remember in 1994 election day I said what do you think oh we're going to win by and I think you pretty much nailed it to the to the number off by one so what's happening I said 53 we didn't count on beating Russian Kowski in downtown okay you remember so my question is I know people want hope but I don't want people to get arrogant either there's an urgency that I don't want to go away I want people to fear that this will continue if they don't go out and vote what do you see happening nationally in the House and Senate I think the most important thing I've been at this since August of 1958 so I've had a lot of experience uh the most important thing to remember is it's not the polls it's the people when people go out and vote they change everything uh in a bad year for Republicans they vote Democrat and it changes everything in a good year for Republicans they vote Republican and it changes everything I saw one race in Michigan where the candidate for governor was 19 points behind according to the newspaper on Saturday and one on Tuesday when you and I talked Time Magazine the week before we took control had the Democrats ahead by Five Points 40 to 35 in the generic and one week later we won 54 Saints so I would say to all of you I'd say to every Pennsylvanian if you love this country you have an absolute obligation to vote and you have an obligation to tell your friends your relatives I want this is a this is a very patriotic state I might spent my childhood in the Harrisburg Area my dad served in the Army for 27 years I know how deeply patriotic this state is people risk their lives tonight all around the world to give you the privilege of voting and any American who is too arrogant or too cynical to show up and vote is I think betraying the cause of freedom in the United States if everybody turns out to vote we will win in a staggering Landslide they will be part of a big Senate majority the house will be amazing we'll have a new Republican Governor here in Pennsylvania and 720 . all right wow with that said um we're in York Pennsylvania I want to thank Senator Tom Cotton I want to thank Senator Tim Scott Dr Oz I want to thank you y'all going to vote pause [Applause]

I want to expand on that because the the the emphasis is that this offering paid leaves the smart decision a business decision it reduces employee turnover and increases employee retention I think can change the culture of a company as him laid out now I introduced legislation that would provide this much-needed protective leave to workers following every parent's worst nightmare the death of the child my colleague mrs. Wilde had introduced after Sarah grace Farley Kluger act is named after the brave families who lost children and have been tireless advocates for this cause and their experience illustrates how critically important it is for parents that protected leave after losing a child very very Kluger who lost his daughter Eric in 2001 says in his testimony submitted for the record new parents are given 12 weeks of unpaid leave under FMLA but most employers only give their workers three or five days up to five days to grieve imagine receiving the most earth-shattering news having to bury your child and then returning to work only a few days later and that's for those lucky enough to work for employers who provide even that minimal leave according the National Academy of Sciences the death of a child is one of the greatest and often most enduring stress as a parent can experience no parent should to see their child be lowered into the ground kelly Farley's experience speaks to how vitally important this protected time is for grieving families he and his wife lost both his daughter and their son in the course of two years when his daughter Katie died he drove right back into his work he said that and I quote I thought that was expected of me as a dad but on the inside I was screaming in pain to this day Kelly describes the decision to go right back to work is one of the biggest mistakes of his life eighteen months later Kelly lost a son Noah this time he and his wife took off three months to start the grieving process having time allowed them to begin to heal and to get the support they needed Kelly says it literally saved a couple from a complete emotional breakdown Kelly and his wife were fortunate enough to have employers who were understanding but it's not the case for every one of the estimated 20 million parents who have lost a child by age 16 nearly 10% of parents have experienced the death of a child Illinois my state is one of two states that has passed protected work leave for grieving parents my bill would allow workers nationally to take up to 12 weeks of protected leave I appreciate our witnesses for highlighting the incredibly important reasons why we need national paid leave research shows and stories like berry and Kelly's demonstrate how important it is to include bereavement within FMLA dr. Jake is in your testimony you also touched on the big impact leave has on the health and well-being of new mothers and fathers with a few seconds we have left could you expand on how federal leave laws provide leave circumstances like bereavement in the case we talked about how the federal law is a void don't have that for critical health and well-being of working families so I can't speak specifically to the impact of bereavement leave on health outcomes for families I can say as the mother of two children the idea of having to go back to work immediately after losing a child is breathtaking and so I can I can only imagine a few things that I can say based on the data first of all we know their demographic differences in terms of child mortality so minority families are much more likely to experience the loss of a child so I'll say that that there's a demographic dimension to this as well and the second thing I'll say is that we know that the opioid crisis has expanded the range of the kinds of families who are who are losing children this isn't just about young children it's also about parents losing older adult children and so I think when we think about bereavement and who this impacts and the ripple effects it's having on the labor market but it's important to actually take a step back and think bigger and I'm very happy to mention that he's still 2 more seconds I spoke to a constituent yesterday about other issues but she shared that she's raising her nine-year-old grandson because her 28 year old son died of opioid overdose and his the child's mother died a year to that so this is something we're seeing across the country and it does not discriminate thank you I yield back

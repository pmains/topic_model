republican senator tim scott from the state of south carolina says he uh we have to end reliance on russian oil i just saw nikki haley just texted something very similar saying it is unthinkable senator that we are still importing over 672 000 barrels of oil a day from russia i put up on the screen as i toss a question to you senator a really important chart because what you also hear from this administration is we're addressing the problem we're releasing barrels of oil from the from this strategic petroleum reserve well look the last time they did it november 23rd 50 million barrels prices have only gone up from there and then we have the announcement yesterday of another strategic release and you have prices yet going up again it's not working senator no doubt about it sandra i'll say this without any question that when you think about uh importing over 600 000 barrels of oil at over a hundred dollars per barrel you're talking about 60 million dollars american dollars being pumped into the russian economy how we went forward with the keystone pipeline and had 800 000 barrels coming into our country over the next several months or years we would be able to eliminate any dependence on russian energy this is a catastrophic decision that biden made on his first day in office that means that the prices that we're seeing today are reflective of his decisions a year ago not reflective of the conflict that started days ago we need better leadership in this country we need to make sure that national security is indeed synonymous with energy independence they are as close as wet is to water they are inseparable why the president of the united states does not understand that i have no clue senator when we look at how we got here we point to the state of the union speech last night in which uh the president said this about the situation in ukraine with russia he thought the west and nato wouldn't respond he thought he could divide us at home in this chamber in this nation he thought he could divide us in europe as well but putin was wrong we are ready this idea that we are ready i i think critics might say that's open for debate well there's no question when you think about where we were in 2014 the last time putin decided to invade ukraine we have the same failed leadership from president of biden as we had in 2014 what the russians understand is power we didn't see this under president trump and now we're seeing it again what do those two have in common the 2014 and 2022 weak leadership from our white house strong leadership is in fact the best repellent to an eastern mindset we cannot try western diplomacy consistently day in and day out in an area of the world that doesn't respect just negotiation you have to have every tool in the tool kit on the table to negotiate with someone with the likes of putin senator based on the war that is happening over there and the reality for americans here at home and the impact that we are seeing from that here's a headline in axios this morning hundred dollars plus oil is the new reality after russia's ukraine invasion saying that energy costs continue to spiral higher with u.s and european crew benchmarks both leaving the century mark and the dust we're looking at our benchmark 111 highest since 2011 the european benchmark 113 dollars a barrel so will the american people have to face what may be a new reality as far as energy prices in our lives here so some have even suggested that the price could go as high as 140 a barrel so what does that mean let's translate that that means that means for americans living paycheck to paycheck rationing between energy prices uh and their drugs as well as their food becomes a reality too many americans can ill-afford any more increases at the pump or when it's time to heat your home or cool your home they have to make a decision about whether or not they can afford to do that plus take their medicine this is a catastrophe that can be avoided we have to focus our attention and our efforts on being energy independent because this we have seen before and if we don't learn the lesson now we will see it again and by the way 30 million barrels being released that's less than two days of oil yeah yeah that that that oil goes uh goes through cars pretty quickly senator i want to ask you this because republicans and democrats at capitol hill are working on a bipartisan aid package for ukraine but but what is taking so long by the time it gets done there may be nothing left in ukraine john that's a great question one of the things i hope we would do immediately is spend the time on that package right now let's quit bickering about other issues let's start focusing on those people who are freedom loving liberty defending who need our assistance we can say yes right now to a package listen last night the president said we spent we sent a billion dollars to the ukrainians when we're spending 60 million dollars a day 60 million dollars a day and buying energy from russia so just how many days does it take for us to eclipse what we've sent to the ukrainians not very many so this is a challenge that we can face today come up with a solution today and implement it tomorrow well what what do you what do you as a member of congress the sitting senator gonna do about this we continue to buy oil at this hour from an enemy that is causing amazing destruction in that country right now of ukraine what is congress going to do to hold the president accountable if he's not going to act on this well today at 2 o'clock republicans are having a press conference to push that very point that we can act and we should act together the president talked about national unity americans are unified in support of ukrainians let's start by acting on a a package today let's provide more resources and let's start the engines of energy independence by permits being said yes to on public land and going back to the table restart the keystone pipeline there are things that we can do today and we'll send a signal to the american people that we're paying attention to their needs while addressing our strategic strategic national interest all right senator tim scott of south carolina good to catch up with you today thanks so much for your thoughts thank you senator thank you both god bless

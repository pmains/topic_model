>>> A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF  SENATORS HAVE FAILED TOAGREE ON A SANCTIONS PACKAGE TO DETER AN  INVASION OF UKRAINE. STICKING PNTS ARE SANCTIONS  PACKAGE NOW OR AFTER. AND THE NORD STREAM TWO PROJECT. JOING ME IS THE CHAIRMAN OF  THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, SENARR BOB MENENDEZ OF THE  FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE. WEAKENING THE ADMINISTRATION'S  HAND BECAUSE THE  ADMINISTRATION'S HAND HAS BEEN  CALLING FOR DETERRENT AND NOT  PUTTING THE SANCTIONS ON BEFORE  PUTIN MAKES A MOVE BECAUSE THEN  HEOULD SAY I'M ALREADY BEING  SANCTIONED, WHY SHOULDN'T I GO  AHEAD? >> FIRST OF ALL, THANKS FOR  HAVING ME ON. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE  LAST TWO WEEKS TOOME TO A COMMON POSITION, WHICH I THINK  IS IMPORNT. FOR RUSSIA AND THE WORLD TO  UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONGRESS STANDS WITH THE PRESIDENT UNITED IN OUR SUPPORT OF UKRAINE, ITS  TERRITORIAL SEREIGNTY AND YOU  UNITED TO HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PUTIN AND RUSSIA, SHOULDE  MAKE THE ENORMS MISTAKE OF  INVADING AND WE'VE COME A LONG  WAY. WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO  FINALIZE ON SOME KEY ISSUES,  EVEN THOUGH WEEVT GONE A LONG  WAY IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE IT. I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD R RECOGNE HERE IS THAT THERE IS COMMON  GROUND INXTRACTING A BIG PRICE R RUSSIA IF IT MAKES THE  MISTAKE OF INVADING UKRAINE. THERE IS COMMON GROUND WITH  STRONG SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE. THE QUESTION IS EXACTLY HOW DOES ONE CREATE THEONSEQUENCE FOR  RUSSIA? AND THERE ARE DIFFERENCESF  OPINION. BU THERE ARE SOME SANCTIONS,  WHICH WE HAVE OFFED THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE FOR ACTIONS THAT  RUSSIA HAS ALREADY  TAKEN, LIKE  CYBER ATATTACKS, FALSE FLAG  OPERATIONS, DESTABILIZING THE  UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT. THE MOTHER OF ALL SANCTIONS  LEGISLATION I STARTED OFF THE  NEGOTIATION THAT I WROTE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES IF RUSSIA INVADES. THERE'S ASSISTANCE TO UKRAI IN TERMS OF LEGAL ASSISTANCE   DEFEND ITSELF. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE  BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE. BUT I HOPEE CAN GET THERE AND  IF WE CANNOT GET THERE IN THE  NEXT DAY OR SO, AT LEAST I HOP  WE'LL PASS A RESOLUTION I HOPE  WILL EXPRESS THE SOLIDARITY  BEFORE THE RECESS. >> AND ONCE Y RECESS, OF  COURSE, THE HOUSE IS OUT ALREADY FOR TWO WEEKS. YOU'RE SENDING SIGNALS AS WELL. WHAT DO YOUHINK VLADIMIR PUTIN IS DOINGY SAYING WE WANT TO  TALK. LET'S TALK ABOUT ARMS CONTROL. 'S HAD THAT PROPOSAL FOR TWO  WEEKS ORORE AND SAYING IT WAS  HIS NONSTARTER. HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE YIELDING  ON HIS DEMAND THAT NATO PULL  BACK AND UKRAINE BE LIMITED FROM JOINING NATO DONE THE ROAD. >> I THINK THE SESSION HE HAD  WITH HIS FOREIGN MINISTER LAVROV WAS KABUKI THEATER. HE NEVER DOES ANYTHING IN  PUBLIC. HE WANTED TO GET THE INTERNATION COMMUNITY AND THE PRESS TO BITE  ON THE PROPOSITION THAT IN FACT  HE IS OPEN TO DIPLOMACY AND  NEGOTIATIONS. AND I HOPE THE INTENSE DIPLOMACY S A THAT HAS BEEN TAKING PCE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND  OUR ALLIES AND THE THREAT OF  OVOVERWHELMING SANCTIONS THAT  WOULD HAVE CRIPPLING EFFECTS ON  THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY AND PUTIN  HIMSELF WOULD ULTIMATELY LEAD  AND MAY ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A  DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVE. BUT IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT DIPLOMACY  WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY. TROOPS AMASSED ALONG UKININE'S  BORDERAND AS WE SPEAK, CYBER  ATTACKS TAKING PLACE AGAINSTHE UKRAINIAN BKS WHERE RUSSIA'S  LOWER HOUSE ANDTS PARLIAMENT  HAS PASD A RESOLUTION  RECOGNIZING ELEMENTS OF THE  EASTERN UKRAINE THEY WOULD LIKE  TO SEE BREAK AWAY AND ULTIMATELY WOULD GIVE RUSH THEY ABILITY TO  PROVIDE SECITY GUARANTEES TO  THAT REGION. SO, THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT  BETLIE AIONS -- THE ACTIONS  BELIE THE WORDS THAT YOU'RE  TRULY WILLING TO BE ENGAGED IN A DIPLOMATIC EFFORT. >> THEY'RE WNING THEY COULD  POSSIBLY LAUNCH AALSE FLAG   THE EAST. HE'S USED THOSE IN THE PAST? . >> WELL, I'VE GOT TO GIVE  ENORMO CREDIT TO THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION USING ITS  INTELLIGENCE AND BEING ABLE TO  BE CSSSSIFIED IN A WAY THAT HAS  OUTED THE RUSSIANS IN EACH OF  THESE FALSE FLAG ATTEMPTS. AND SO, ACTUALLY, WE HAVE,  THINK UP TO THIS PO OUT  FLANKED THEM IN TERMS OF HAVING  AN KINOF PRETEXT OF AN AKUS. THERE IS NO AGGRESSION BY  UKRAINE. THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO  SOLICIT THEONSEQUENCES THAT  PUTIN HAS AMASSED ON THEIR FRONT AND THE THREAT THEY OFFER. YOU SEE RUSSIAN TELEVISION  TALKING ABOUT SOME TYPE OF MASS  NOCIDE IN UKRAIN FALSELY, OF COURSE. SO, IT IS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO  CREATE AET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH IT CAN HAVE THE ALLEGED  PROVOCATION BUTHERE IS NO SUCH THING. THE WORLD WILL SEE IT. IF PUTIN CROSS INTO UKRAINE'S   TERRITORY, IT WILL BE HIS  AGGRESSION. AND THE ONE THINK THAT, NO  MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, THAT PUTIN  WILL HAVE LEARNED IS THAT THE  WEST IS MORE UNIFIED THAN EVER  BEFORE. THE TRAATLANTIC ALLIANCE IS  MORE UNIFIED, THERE ARE  THOUSANDS OF TROOPS PUT INTO  PART OF EASTERN EUROPE THAT  PUTIN WOULD HAVE NEVER WTED TO SEE. SOAR THAT'S WORKED OUT BADLY. >> SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

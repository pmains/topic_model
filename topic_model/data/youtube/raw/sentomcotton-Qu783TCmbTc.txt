and focus now Senator Tom Cotton Republican member of Senate Judiciary and armed services committees is here with me down the stretch so first of all what do you make of these latest Power Rankings shifting over to the GOP uh just slightly but it's happening doesn't count Democrats out completely but what's going on in your estimation well Harris it's not surprising that more Americans are repudiating Joe Biden and the Washington Democrats agenda you just look at the headlines inflation continues to run very high the stock market has fallen precipitously over the last year and a half more crime on the streets Across America we have a drug epidemic unlike anything this country has ever seen I was on the campaign trail yesterday in Pennsylvania with Dr Oz we visited a natural gas pad in Western Pennsylvania that natural gas provides thousands of good high-paying jobs to hard-working pennsylvanians and Ohioans it also provides low-cost energy to America it helps America support our allies around the world who'd rather get American Gas rather than Russian gas and it's good for our environment because it's so clean burning as opposed to say foreign coal yet John fetterman and Joe Biden and the Democrats would ban the techniques that we have to get that gas out of the ground that's why Democrats are losing in the poll that's why they're going to lose badly in three weeks I don't know how much time John fetterman has to focus on that with the crime that's just out of control particularly in Philadelphia I wholeheartedly mean that he might have been part of the problem with words like show the the criminal's mercy so that's that's a big big way to go and now you got energy mixed in too uh inflation and and it gets mentioned to every conversation you mentioned it a few moments ago a few days ago President Biden said there may be a chance of a slight recession but maybe just light will Bloomberg out with a new projection there is a 100 percent chance of a recession in the next year given the decades High inflation fed interest hikes and tense political climate the economy of course we know the senator is top of mind for voters a New York Times poll shows concern over economic issues have jumped to 44 from 36 percent a few weeks ago in summer Americans also are weary when it comes to the president's performance on those top Issues new Fox polling puts Biden's inflation approval at just 29 percent where are the 29 percent who actually like where inflation is the White House doing pretty much anything they can they say to defend him let's watch together if President Biden's top domestic priority his inflation why doesn't he have more to show for it so he's been very clear about making that his number one economic priority and he's done the work with Congressional Democrats but exactly thinks the president is doing a good job on inflation we understand that there are challenges that are in front of us here in this country that is why the president has taken action to lower costs republicans in Congress refuse they refuse to be partners with us on this all right we'll hear from Democrats in a moment I want to get your direct reaction to what she's talking about from the White House lectern well guilty is charged that Republicans in Washington have refused to spend trillions of dollars we don't have Joe Biden and the Democrats don't have an answer on inflation because they're the cause of inflation there's two main reasons we have this inflation uh at uh generational highs the first is Democrats have spent trillions of dollars that we don't have it was completely obvious and predictable in fact it was predicted not just by Republicans but by democrats like former treasury secretary Larry Summers but spending all that money would lead to inflation yet the Democrats kept spending it even after we had record high inflation just a couple months ago they spent another 700 billion dollars the second reason we have so much inflation is the price of energy is so high because it doesn't just hit families in their budget when the price they pay for gasoline is high it drives up the cost of manufacturing it drives up the cost of doing business it drives up the cost of transportation and that very much is an intentional policy the Democrats want Energy prices to be high because they want to end and American production of fossil fuels oil and gas and coal they may not say it in the 45 days before an election they may rely on gimmicks like releasing oil from the Strategic petroleum Reserve which is also dangerous to our national security but mark my words on November 9th the Democrats are going to go back to openly Waging War on American oil gas and coal when you say words like intentional crisis can think of is our power grids are still about 80 percent dependent on fossil fuels and or coal I mean I don't know what they're thinking they're doing but they're actually making that situation weaker using electricity I mean I remember a few weeks ago you do too when the governor of California said we're in a heat wave stop plugging in your electric cars I mean it's a world hurt that they've brought with the policies and now for the Democrats senator who also were not getting what they need from the president watch the president over the weekend said the economy is quote strong as hell do you agree with that I think there is much more the administration needs to do especially around energy costs wow it's like losing a relative Hassan and you say what to that yeah well every one of these Democrats Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire Raphael Warnock in Georgia Mark Kelly in Arizona Catherine Cortez masto in Nevada any one of them could have put their foot down in a 50-50 Senate and demanded that Joe Biden stop his war on American Oil and Gas and coal and they didn't they were a rubber stamp for Joe Biden and a vote for any Democrat this year is a vote for Joe Biden's agenda if you want affordable and reliable energy in this country you need to vote Republican on November 8th yeah you have really tied that with inflation unlike the president was able to tie his inflation reduction act to actual inflation and reducing it just one quick one Fox News polling shows extremely or very concerned they ask voters their number one thing by 89 inflation slash higher prices Democrats are in trouble they have only 21 days to figure that one out will they do it meanwhile President Biden oh go ahead go ahead your quick thought no no they they won't do it again because it's their policies that have caused this inflation sometimes intentionally caused it in the form of high gasoline prices so of course they're not going to figure it out they just hope that they can distract the American people for another 21 days so they can get back to those harmful policies uh President Biden is scrambling to tame just what Senator cotton is talking about

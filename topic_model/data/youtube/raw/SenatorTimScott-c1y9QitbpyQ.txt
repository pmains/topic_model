why specifically are you not voting for the judge for the supreme court it it's a very simple answer i did not vote for her for a lower court because i believe that her judicial philosophy is inconsistent what is in the best interest of our judiciary can you imagine me then coming back and changing my mind on a more important see the most important seat in the judiciary the supreme court of the united states it's not biden supreme court it's america's supreme court the number of her cases that have been overturned only reinforces the fact that this requires a deeper look and the deeper i look the more i realize that her judicial philosophy is antithetical to mine it's a really simple answer senator i know you and lindsey graham both of our senators have said they're not going to vote for her they're voting no this is a democrat for a democrat on the supreme court but how progressive is she compared to where the court is now should we be concerned i think if you are concerned about activist judges you should be concerned if you're concerned about someone who uses their position that to reinforce a progressive agenda we should be concerned i i those are the issues that most concern me about this appointment she is a nice person she is well educated but her judicial philosophy not her who she is but her ideology is what we should focus on she she represents herself incredibly well i think she was reasonable in our conversation together but at the end of the day i'm not looking for someone to have a coca-cola with i'm looking for someone who will rule in favor of america's future and i don't see that in this judge so uh senator you saw cory booker get all emotional when some of the questions got tough and he said it's gonna be a great moment because uh african-american women have to overcome so much to get to this level do you have the similar emotion i know you're not gonna vote for but do you think in any way this is groundbreaking for you in the african-american community well there's no doubt brian that the fact of the matter is that she would be the first african-american female on the court it does speak volumes to america's progress and the evolution that we're seeing in the country and we should all celebrate that but we should stop and pause for just a minute and ask ourselves when then senator biden had a chance to make sure that the court continued to have minority representation what did he do he said to clarence thomas no way no how not on my watch he did everything in his power to make sure that the court that he now is concerned about diversity would have been completely white that kind of hypocrisy has to be brought to the surface so that we understand when they're talking about the future or when they're just talking about politics they're talking politics they're talking elite progressives they're not talking about the literal future of america and the diversifying of our court they're talking about embedding in concrete a progressive view of what america should be versus the view of conserving the core principles that undergirded american prosperity and human flourishing the world over because of the united states of america senator is such a good point and we appreciate you coming i just wonder with your colleague mitt romney you started it off by saying you could not vote for her for the supreme court if you didn't vote for her at a lower court he didn't vote for her at the lower court but now he's voting for her now why do you think he decided to do that have you talked to him well lawrence i have not spoken to to uh mitt romney about his decision i can't imagine why he has made the reversal that he has the way i look at it is this is a simple question if i thought she was not qualified at a lower level it's really hard for me to come to a decision and listen i do think history plays a role in so many people's decisions and i understand that i just cannot allow that to be my decision for the highest court right and the most important democracy in all of the world it is just too important it's a consistent view all right senator thanks so much for joining us how about those gamecocks the women the basketball team you know what let's let's give a shout out to the lady gamecocks yes i will say don staley has done a fabulous job i'm looking forward to seeing her go for another 10 in a row so that's my hope for the lady gamecocks go cox yeah to catch up to you

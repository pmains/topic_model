well i want to thank the ranking member for his friendship his encouragement um and uh maybe not encouragement on this specific bill but i'm proud to support this bill uh because it it does help with a maintenance backlog in the national parks and as well as assist with a long-term reauthorization land and water conservation trust which is something i strongly support since its inception over 50 years ago the land of water conservation trust has done very important things for my state and our nation in preserving access to public lands and the great outdoors also for the maintenance backlog i'm proud to represent a piece of the blue ridge parkway which runs through my district and is the second most visited national park last year and i think this year it will be the same and in north carolina alone we have over 260 000 jobs that are directly attributable to the great outdoors and those millions of visitors that come to the state through the blue ridge parkway they are vital for our economy in western north carolina passage of this bill will help both within the backlog and with ensuring that we have long-term reauthorization i encourage a yes vote you're back

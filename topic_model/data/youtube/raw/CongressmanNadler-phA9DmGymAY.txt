good afternoon everybody I'm kind of Gerald and with new york i want to thank completion waiting xk and I particular the bank people standing here the press conference bill some months ago I heard an account of a woman Victoria sorrenti worked as an activity director at a nursing home in Valparaiso Indiana which he became pregnant 2007 when you started experiencing some complications Victoria's doctor advised to avoid strenuous activity Victoria told her boss Matt a doctor's advice noting that she quote would just need a little bit of help on close with tasks such as rearranging tables and pushing heavy wheelchairs NASA took up about 20 minutes your entire workday despite the fact the victorious co-workers already pitched in to help of these tasks for boss fired her shockingly when Victoria turns to the courts for protection court denied or even a trial by granting the employers summary judgment motion means it's not even worth of trials addressing the patent unfairness in its own ruling the court noted that due to the courts near universal understanding the laws dealing with pregnant workers Victoria had the misfortune of quote of course crawling in the blind spot in the statutory scheme created by Congress unquote that she was quote lost in the gaps in the law for pregnant women lost in the gaps Victoria is not alone we're hearing about thousands of such cases to cross the country and this is outrageous we believe we believe that the current law does protect women but clearly the courts are uncertain even confused and they have invited us to straighten this out so today we are here to clarify the law we don't believe to make you of it to clarify the law and to erase us injustice through this bill to pregnant workers of fairness at 34 years after congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act with 1978 no woman should fear that you will be fired forced out on leave unnecessarily or denied a minor adjustment that would allow it to continue working during your pregnancy a record 70 million women are in the american workforce today the three-quarters of them will become pregnant during their lifetime many working women are the primary or dual breadwinners in their house and failing to protect the workplace discrimination birds of them and their entire family it also runs counter to every economic need and value in our society particularly during tough economic times of course many advocates have been working to address this gravel for years including many of the leaders standing next to me today my state of New York state senator this really recently introduced legislation prohibiting employers in New York from refusing to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers the law this has been the law in California for years legislators in Connecticut Minnesota Louisiana Hawaii of already in it and California have already enacted this type of legislation which is helped countless women stay healthy and worked in during their pregnancies I applaud the leadership of those things but of course this is a national problem that warrants a national solution the pregnant workers Fairness Act will provide that national solution this bill would require an employer to make a reasonable accommodation for pregnancy trout group and related medical conditions unless this creates an undue hardship on the employer the employer would be prevented from denying a pregnant woman employment opportunities or forcing her to take in the commendation that she does not want or need finally an employer would be prohibited from forcing a pregnant woman to take a leave when another reasonable accommodation could help keep her on the drug this is a simple and straightforward solution to a problem our women and families should not be faced I want to thank all the women's in employment ad mystic advocacy groups where it's the most into my office Travis bill the special thank you to my colleagues of let the nation support

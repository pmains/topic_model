thank you chairman davis and i can't tell you how much i appreciate you hosting this roundtable and to our panelists for your you sharing uh your perspectives and experiences i know how hard it is i can't imagine how hard it is actually and i can't tell you how grateful i am for you bringing your voices forward to humanize the stories of unemployment in the current pandemic the heroes that clearly articulated a plan to extend emergency unemployment benefits through january the house passed the bill nearly three or nearly three months ago 80 days ago for mitch mcconnell's senate to engage and work with us to help struggling americans sadly the senate has gone on to recess has gone home for the weekend and they their proposals fail to adequately grapple with our problems their proposals cut unemployment insurance as more people continue to lose their jobs with no work to return to the national association of state workforce agencies says that the senate proposed unemployment scheme would take months to implement the bottom line is that americans who have been sidelined due to this virus do not have months to wait the last payment for federal pandemic unemployment compensation in illinois went out last saturday and if the senate continues to fail to act we will see more children go hungry more families fail to pay rent and the nation's economy contract further it's needless suffering at the hands of failed leadership in the senate i appreciate all the panelists sharing their stories let me highlight two stories from my my district um that will expand on the experience the first is from michael ways of libertyville reminds us that no matter how badly mitch mcconnell wants him to return to work there's simply no gatherings for him to go to my name is michael ways and i'm from libertyville illinois i've been in the live concert industry for 30 years without the ability for people to gather this industry is completely gone myself and hundreds of other sound and lighting technicians have zero work our hands are tied until it is safe to gather again most folks in this industry do not have insurance or 401ks without the 600 benefit many will have to choose between food and insurance before paying their bills for the record whoever is telling folks the extra money is keeping us from working couldn't be further from the truth all of my fellow technicians just want to get back to work none of them want to stay home i implore you to extend this benefit at least until the end of the year thank you thank you michael and now let me play from joy perlman in wheeling my name is roy perlman from wheeling illinois i had a very successful career prior to covet the extra 600 is less than half of what i was making it's a lifeline right now my health insurance premium alone is 875 a month just one of my inhalers is 375 additional i want nothing more than to be able to go back to my career and continually am looking for extra ways to earn money from home where it's safe until covet is over keep fighting for us please we need you thanks joy i have so many more recordings letters calls to my office from people in my district sharing stories like these to joy to michael to everyone who shared their story today thank you for doing so i know you are counting on this benefit your stories are making a difference and please thank you brandt and now

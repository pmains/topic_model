I don't know what goes on in your zip code but I do know what goes on in my state and when you have 72 banks that are chartered there and now we have 49 and you've got different credit unions and and I should get the head of the Bearpaw Credit Union to come in and talk to us or the head of Glacier bank to come in and talk to us about him making millions of dollars because neither one of them do the fact is is there's a lot of a lot of reasons why we're seeing Bank consolidation technology movement of population but regulation is also a part of that equation and I will tell you that I don't know what it does in your zip code but I can tell you this is gonna allow working families to be able to get loans to be able to buy homes where now they can buy a pickup with no documentation but they can't buy a home this is gonna allow small businesses to be able to expand and this is going to allow entrepreneurs to be able to get the money to start up businesses that is the reason we did this and and I can tell you for no other reason and if we continue down the line and if we would not have come to a bipartisan agreement I can guarantee you the only people we bit would have been empowering by not doing this bill are the biggest of the big banks because there is a natural progression between the little ones being bought up by the Bechstein next bigger ones and the next bigger ones and the next bigger ones until finally we get to a point where we don't have any banks in rural America to services to give us capital and you've got the biggest banks that are truly the biggest banks I mean bigger than bigger than bigger bigger than they are now by far [Music]

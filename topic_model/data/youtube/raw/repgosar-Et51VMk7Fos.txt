thank you very much mr. chairman members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to provide this testimony my name is Hilda Angus and I am the chairman of Mojave County Board of Supervisors from Mojave County Arizona and I provide this testimony on behalf of the more than 200,000 citizens of Mojave County which is the fifth largest county by square miles in the United States Mojave County unequivocally supports the Fish Hatchery Protection Act and we thank representative Gosar for introducing such a critically important piece of legislation now this is the second time this year I've traveled across the country to testify before a House subcommittee about the National Fish Hatchery system specifically about the willow Beach National Fish Hatchery the willow Beach national hatchery has been a critical component of Mohave counties economy since it was established in 1962 it was established to raise rainbow trout for release into the Lower Colorado River system to offset the massive impacts to local fisheries caused by the construction and operation of the Hoover Dam and related water resource management projects the hatchery is located along the Colorado River near the border of Nevada and Arizona within Mojave County and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area and it helps support recreational sport fishing and tourism throughout the region those industries make up over 30% of Mohave counties economy in fact according to a study prepared for the Arizona Department of Fish and Game recreational fishing within Mojave County in 2001 alone contributed 74 point 5 million dollars to the local economy and supported approximately 1682 jobs numbers that we believe have remained the same or increased since that time the Willow Beach facility is or at least was until this year a significant piece of that economic activity because it releases thousands of rainbow trout each year into our region's waters the trout is an iconic species that attracts recreational anglers to our County from all over the country in fact it would be hard to imagine a more effective federal stimulus program for our region has pointed out but yet on November 24th 2013 Mohave County learned that the US Fish and Wildlife Service was terminating the rainbow trout propagation program at the willow Beach hatchery the service claimed that it lacked sufficient funds to repair a broken water line that delivers water from Lake Mohave to the trout ponds at the hatchery the service has known since 2000 ten that it's water delivery system was in need of maintenance but it failed to take corrective measures my County is now suffering because of that failure in fact the services incompetence in managing the water delivery system resulted in the deaths the deaths of over 60,000 fish last year that tragedy was completely avoidable now the service is claiming that it has no choice but to eliminate the entire trout program because it can't afford to fix a pipe we seriously doubt those claims particularly because the services estimates for repairing the pipe are more than ten times higher than the detailed estimates prepared by Mojave County engineer's the service will tell you that they aren't shutting down the Willow beach hatchery well that's true but going forward they will spend all available funding on raising bony tail chubs and Razorback suckers for release into the Colorado River using an alternative water supply long dangered species recovery efforts are obviously worth wild Mojave County has been struggling to understand where the service gets its authority to unilaterally alter the fundamental purpose of a national mitigation Fish Hatchery that is operated for more than half a century nor has the agency explained how it prioritizes maintenance projects throughout the the fish hatchery system or why it lacks sufficient funds to support the willow Beach program the reason we fear is because the service is getting out of the sport and recreation fish hatchery business altogether at the same time that Mohave County learned about the services decision to terminate trout operations at Willow beach and we learned that through the news media I want to add we also learned about a new strategy that the service had developed early in 2013 without any public or stakeholder participation for the entire National Fish Hatchery system the new strategy clearly prioritizes the use of the nation's fish hatcheries for threatened and endangered species recovery efforts and calls for the service to dramatically curtail hatchery operations that support recreation and sport fishing that is why Mohave County fully supports the Fish Hatchery Protection Act we believe that Congress should establish the goals and priorities for the National Fish Hatchery system the unelected executive agency charged with its administration should not be able to unilaterally walk away from commitments the federal government made decades ago that type of dramatic shift in operational strategy should not be made without congressional oversight and public and stakeholder participation HR 50:26 will ensure that Congress maintains that authority we implore this subcommittee to move this important piece of legislation forward and protect the economy of Mojave County and counties like it all over the country that benefit from the economic power of our nation's national mitigation fish hatcheries thank you very much mr. chairman congressman Gosar members of the subcommittee for giving me the opportunity to testify today on behalf of the citizens of Mojave County we appreciate your time and consideration and I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have

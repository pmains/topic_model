the chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from california i ask unanimous consent that all members have five legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h.r 6552 as amended i also asked to include in the congressional record an exchange of letters between me and the chairs of the ways and means committee and the judiciary committee on the bill without objection i yield myself such time as i may consume the gentleman is recognized i rise today in strong support of h.r 6552 the frederick douglass trafficking victims prevention and protection reauthorization act of 2022. i want to thank the ranking member of our subcommittee on africa global health and human rights representative chris smith who i have worked closely with for many years to develop this bill this joint effort has served as a daily reminder that collaboration in congress is both imperative and far from finished when it comes to combating and eliminating human trafficking this legislation is the overdue reauthorization of the trafficking victims act of 2000 which expired last september to continue this essential fight to end global human trafficking this measure must be passed by the house today so that more than 20 years of work is not undone this bill is especially important in the wake of covet 19 pandemic when virtual 12 through k-12 education made it harder for teachers to identify and report human trafficking prosecution of traffickers were delayed as courts closed and the demand for social services for survivors increased as many of them lost their jobs and homes critically this reauthorization strengthens provisions in the original bill that protect and support trafficking victims while reauthorizing one billion dollars to fund programs across justice homeland security health and human services that are dedicated to addressing human trafficking and aiding victims this funding includes 35 million in housing assistant grants for the victims of human trafficking which offer temporary housing that provides trafficking survivors with meaningful alternatives to living with their abusers it also funds education programs on trafficking warning signs for educators and law enforcement personnel who may otherwise unknowingly encounter trafficking victims and it further requires greater accountability measures to protect people who are trafficked while appropriately punishing traffickers in the u.s the populations most vulnerable to human trafficking include migrant laborers minorities people with disabilities those in the lgbtq community and especially runaway and homeless youth and those in the child welfare and juvenile justice system and in regard to sex trafficking which is where the child welfare system comes in the average age of the victim is 12 years old as a former health care professional and chair of the subcommittee i have been a champion of child welfare issues throughout my time in congress i've seen too many instances of human rights violations against children and other vulnerable populations falling victim to the abuses of human trafficking both in the u.s and around the world we must take this issue seriously and continue taking a whole of government approach to addressing it sometimes however we focus on the international and forget that this is a problem right here in many cities around our nation the frederick douglass trafficking victims prevention and protection act adds several new provisions to the original legislation that will substantially improve our efforts against trafficking here at home while only slightly modifying existing provisions that have been successful throughout its passage one important example is the modifications made to existing hhs grants that would train elementary and secondary school teachers children guardians and trainers in the recognition and response to child trafficking child trafficking in the us is not labor trafficking but it's sex trafficking this section now authorizes author focuses authorities to ensure that grantees will use proven best practices trains personnel with equitable approaches and identify service gaps amongst other things it also calls on state child welfare agencies to prioritize the implementation of protocols to report on missing and abducted children to the national center for missing and exploited children and law enforcement additionally the bill requires states to submit annual reports on child sex trafficking victims to health and human services which is just one of the many steps that we can take to trace track and find those missing and hopefully create a system that prevents further disappearance of our youth it is our job to protect those in this country who cannot protect themselves especially children in the child welfare system when we remove them from their parents from their homes then we the government become the parents and we cannot be guilty of neglect when these children disappear hr 6552 also strengthens anti-trafficking efforts abroad human trafficking is the second largest criminal industry worldwide with more than 25 people 25 million people women and girls being the largest identified demographic these numbers are alarming and i'm humbled to be a part of a measure that will focus on expanding prevention efforts at usaid by taking steps to further integrate counter trafficking in persons activities into already existing international development programs this bill moves not only to support those who have already fallen victim but also to prevent further trafficking and bring perpetrators to justice we must swiftly pass this bipartisan measure to protect those who are the most vulnerable among us it is our duty to stop this heinous crime whenever and wherever it is discovered whether it be here in the united states or abroad i reserve the balance of my time

thank you madam Speaker I rise today with America's friend and ally Israel asked against asking rising against a tide of anti-semitism and the dangerous boycott divestment and sanctions or BDS movement BDS is a form of economic warfare aimed at marginalizing the world's only Jewish state this radical agenda rejects Israel's right to defense self-defense and seeks to destroy its economy the house must stand with Israel and pass HR 336 the strengthening America's security in the Middle East Act this common-sense bill would combat the BDS movement by supporting state and local governments that choose not to contract with companies that discriminate against Israel it already passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support sadly speaker Pelosi refuses to allow a vote I'm a proud co-sponsor of HR 336 and this week I signed a discharge petition to ensure it gets a vote on the House floor madam Speaker Republicans and Democrats must send a strong signal against anti-semitism and the anti-israel BDS movement we need a vote on HR 336

on his first day in office president biden revived the democrats war on fossil fuels which began under president obama harry reid and nancy pelosi in doing so in this war on fuel countless jobs billions of dollars in economic revenue have been lost money that supports our local schools and hospitals these actions are destroying those communities relying on fossil fuels for their livelihood today's hearing will focus on the president's decision to cancel the keystone xl pipeline a critical transnational pipeline project first proposed in 2008. through the use of an executive order president biden has revoked the permit needed for the project to cross the u.s canadian border and as he stated that completing the project doesn't serve the quote national interest and it would not be consistent with the administration's economic and climate priorities curiously though in 2013 president obama's state department found that the development of the keystone xl pipeline would have quote minimal impact on the environment and when president obama or president trump took office in 2017 his administration took action quickly to move the project forward and work resumed now four years later president biden revokes that permit retroactively and that was set forth by his predecessor and in so doing has cost the area 11 approximately eleven thousand jobs and two billion dollars in lost wages in reflecting on this denial how do lost jobs and lost wages serve the national interest remember keystone is but one pipeline project under the microscope others like the dakota access pipeline mountain valley pipeline and the line five in michigan also face an uncertain future from a business perspective this certainty uncertainty causes alarm for any of us that have been in business financial institutions and investors look for certainty when funding a project why would wall street or any other entity invest in a project that requires a permit simply to see it withdrawal and by a different administration which could be years later when a project is cancelled it creates a loss for banks bondholders and other sources of funding and unfortunately many of those bondholders or pension funds are senior citizens and what they're counting on for their retirement could be losing out so is my question i guess would be is this biden's effort to stop pipelines or is it a more sinister approach to discourage wall street and investors from ever getting involved in funding fossil fuel projects and pipelines all together i want you all to think about that for a little bit and i look forward to a thoughtful discussion and now recognize representative armstrong for his opening statement

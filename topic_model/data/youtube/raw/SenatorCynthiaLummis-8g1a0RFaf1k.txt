republican senator cynthia lumus of wyoming senator i watched the video that zielinski brought to the united nations today it was extraordinarily powerful it's a reminder that there really are no limits on crimes against humanity when you have a strong man like vladimir putin what else can and should america be doing to help we need to give them more weapons we need to go further with the sanctions on the oligarchs on the political leaders on as many citizens as we can get we need to clamp russia down why are we dripping all of this out you know every time i think this would be the third or fourth round of sanctions why i mean we didn't do enough in my opinion to prevent this from happening and then once it did happen we keep drip drip dripping why don't we just hit them with everything we've got including the kitchen sink now absolutely right kitchen sink right now in addition we should have sent them more weapons earlier even just hand guns and and ammunition now they need bigger equipment they need anti-tank missiles they need us to send all the weaponry that we can possibly get to them we should have done it months ago president zielinski uh took the opportunity to ask the u.n security council she said she suggested this is a great time for reforms now we've heard this suggestion over and over again for decades but i think many americans tend to agree how likely is it that that could ever happen well this is the perfect time and he's the perfect person to ask for reforms they are absolutely critical so the united nations can address these issues on a more long-term basis i hope they'll be very serious about it uh certainly we need that kind of a reformed u.n to be more proactive for atrocities such as this i want to ask you about runaway inflation the biden administration has decided that the best course of action is the blame game vladimir putin and to demonize american oil companies in the end though won't that result in even higher prices less opportunity and more more damage to the middle class it is so obvious what we need to be doing we need to produce more united states oil and gas we need to once again become energy independent we need to provide natural gas liquids to europe to india we need to restart pipelines from canada we need to have more energy available to europe so we need to have approve those lng terminals there's so much we can do charles to be responsive and responsible and the biden administration is doing neither i love the word responsible because that's exactly what it would be right now no matter if you if you believe climate is going to change overnight or not responsible to ourselves and our allies can you give us an update on the progress your digital currency legislation the regulatory reform efforts you're working on uh how's it going so far the digital asset bill that is very complic comprehensive will roll out this month senator kirsten gillibrand is my democrat a co-lead sponsor it addresses definitions it addresses consumer protection privacy stable coins the cfdc's jurisdiction and the sec's jurisdiction among other things it's very comprehensive it uses traditional regulators and provides them with the tools they need to regulate as well as retain an innovative environment in the united states for digital assets senator real quick i got to get this in because i saw your op-ed in american bankers speaking of words with the federal reserve its mission creep the misadventures into the political arena what's the biggest concern right now americans should have about the politicalization of the federal reserve well their mission is very clear they're supposed to worry about interest rates jobs and stable prices right now all of those issues are on the table they need to focus on that not focus on climate change and whether oil and gas companies should be funded and whether social justice is being performed those are all projects for other people stick to your knitting fed all right senator lomas thank you so much you are doing so much good work and i appreciate you taking the time thank you thank you charles i'd like to bring in

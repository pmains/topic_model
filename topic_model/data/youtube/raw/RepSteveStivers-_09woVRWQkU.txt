q chairman Goodlatte and ranking member Conyers thanks for holding this hearing and thank you mr. chairman for your leadership on the balanced budget amendment off you know you appropriately mentioned that in 1995 you eight folks today that have worked so hard to try to put forward a movement toward a balanced budget is their belief and my belief that if we spend more than we bring in overtime this system will collapse and so it's we have to act and I the ranking member talked about what might happen with a balanced budget amendment some draconian cuts actually I believe the true Taccone draconian option is to do nothing a recent CBO report talked about what would happen under the current law with the old age survivors insurance of Social Security by 2030 it'll be exhausted in 2031 the cuts will be about 31% we've never seen cuts like that other mandatory programs Medicare Hospital insurance will be exhausted by 2028 and you'll see draconian cuts there as well this my dad used to tell me we can do this the easy way or the hard way and that's the truth here too we can do this the easy way which is us deciding to come together my proposal for a balanced budget amendment is a bipartisan amendment mr. Conyers edit it it does not require a supermajority to raise taxes it does not require a supermajority or cap spending it simply requires us to do things because I haven't been here a long time I've been here six years but I've been here long enough to learn that the only things that happen in Congress are the things that have to happen we need to make balancing our budget something that has to happen and if we don't millions of Americans will see draconian cuts as a result I think the gentleman from Florida very accurately talked about what could happen with interest rates interest rates are at an artificial low our servicing costs on our debt is tiny now yet it's already more than we spend in veterans it's and if interest rates were to normalize back to normal four to five percent rates you know we would be be spending about thirty percent of everything we bring in just to service the deck and that doesn't account for anything else it we have to do something and we have to do something now and I would plead to all of you that we I believe we have to do it in a bipartisan way you know what I like a limit on how much we could spend as part of our GDP yeah I would like that I didn't put it in my balanced budget amendment because I know we need to compromise I know it has to be bipartisan to get to the numbers we need we need Republicans and Democrats to come together to do this and control our own fate because we don't our fate will be controlled for us by other people by our creditors around the world and we all saw what happened to Greece we all saw what happened to Portugal we all know how bad that situation could be I don't want to let that happen to the citizens of the United States of America and to the people who depend on our government to do the things that it needs to do to help and to defend our country and you know one of the greatest threats I've been a military guy for 32 years one of the greatest threats to our national security as Admiral Mullen said almost five years ago is that our national debt risks our national security and we all know that in our own lives when you Oh people money you're at their mercy and that's why we need to live within our means and start to pay down our national debt I want to thank my co-sponsor Henry Cuellar for our balanced budget amendment h.res 110 mr. Conyers I hope you'll look at it it doesn't require many of the things that you talked about I know we as Republicans and Democrats have to come together to solve this problem and I'm willing to give up on some of the things that I might like in a balanced budget amendment and simply require it I think my the gentleman from Florida explained that 49 states everybody but Vermont has a balanced budget requirement in their state constitution and since 2008 countries like Germany Austria Poland have added a balanced budget amendment to their Constitution as countries because the financial crisis demanded that they do and I'm not talking about our financial crisis you know eight I'm talking about what happened in Europe in 2007 and 2008 so there is a way forward it's a bipartisan way forward I hope we can all work to make that happen because the alternative is grim for millions of Americans and I hope we don't do this the hard way but the problem will be solved one way or the other I hope we take the reins provide leadership and lead the country on a better path of a balanced budget thank you for the opportunity to be here I appreciate all the very passionate advocates that are here today to talk about the future of our country thank you and I appreciate yield back the balance of my time

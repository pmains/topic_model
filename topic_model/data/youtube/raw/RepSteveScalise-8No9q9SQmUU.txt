now we just wrapped up a boot camp on the tax cuts and jobs act this something we wanted to do for all of our new members who weren't here when this house republican majority worked with a majority senate and president trump to pass an historic piece of legislation that got our economy going in a way that we've never seen in generations we have about 80 members who weren't here during that time and so we wanted to walk through just how that bill came together and how well it's done to bring jobs back to america we brought millions of jobs back to america we made america competitive again at a time when we were losing companies thousands of american companies had left the united states because we weren't competitive we had a 35 tax rate when the world average was 23 and all that changed when we passed the tax cuts and jobs act and the biggest beneficiaries and the data clearly backs this up were the lowest income earners in america they saw tremendous wage growth great job growth some more job opportunities we had virtually no unemployment anybody who wanted to work had multiple companies competing for them and paying higher higher salaries for those families president biden right now is trying to unravel that success by raising taxes on hard-working families by passing tax increases that would run more jobs out of america and cost those low-income families the good jobs that they enjoy today we don't want that to happen and in fact we will fight to stop that from happening to prevent these tax increases that would hit the lowest income families the hardest

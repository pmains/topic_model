Thank You mr. Speaker I rise in support of HR 4031 the Great Lakes restoration initiative Act of 2019 first I want to thank my good friends from Ohio mr. Joyce and MS Kaptur for their leadership on this legislation the Great Lakes are an essential natural resource not only for my district and state but for the entire country one of the world's largest bodies of freshwater the Great Lakes provide fresh drinking water for over 30 million people in addition the Great Lakes serve as an economic engine generating eight point four billion dollars in wages and supporting over 300,000 jobs for the Great Lakes are more than a source of revenue ask any of my constituents what the great lakes mean to them and they will tell you they're an essential part of what makes Northeast Ohio such a great place to live work and raise a family over the past decade both Democrats and Republicans have understood the importance of protecting the Great Lakes since 2010 the GL RI has catalyzed critical restoration action that both restores and protects the Great Lakes in fact for every dollar spent under the GL RI an estimated three dollars and thirty five cents in economic activity is produced I strongly urge my colleagues to support HR 4031 and ensure that preservation of our waterways and ecosystems for future generations with that I yield back the balance of my time gentleman from Ohio yields gentleman from Michigan

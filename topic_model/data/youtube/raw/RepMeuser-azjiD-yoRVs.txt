for more on the president's state of the union address we go out to our congressional correspondent comedy ducard who's joining us live on the hill she's at a republican house media event speaking to lots of lawmakers today kilmany great to be back with you bianca obviously russia and the escalating crisis in ukraine is going to be center stage in that address at 9 00 pm eastern here with me now is congressman dan muser we really appreciate you being with us we've heard republicans we know that they wanted preemptive sanctions to stop this but what can we do now to prevent russian aggression in the way of helping ukraine zelensky has said to the u.s in terms of evacuating i don't need a ride i need weapons he sure did he said i don't want to ride i need bullets and his courage is certainly contagious germany caught it right germany has stepped up in an unprecedented manner other allies have as well from sweden to switzerland we're finally hitting putin where it hurts and that that's in his in his money belt frankly and you know not to be a monday morning quarterback but a good month ago many of us were stating no no the level of full sanctions needs to go into effect now not after they're on the they're knocking on the door or not banging down the door of of kiev so so what we at least need to do is hit them with everything we've got at this point we need to sanction gasprov their largest oil company we're now hitting their largest banks we we are in line with our other allies but this thing comes down to energy it comes down to oil and natural gas it's truly the carrot and stick of the of this war so we've not along with sanctioning those companies we need to embargo russian oil imports to the united states europe is going to do what it needs to do there but that also needs to be on the table for them and that will completely rattle which has already been unbelievably rattled the russian economy and i think the russian people are getting real tired of this as well agonizing over it's sick about it and this is going to be putin's war not russia's war and the russian people may respond congresswoman sparks laid it out so well she said that america's adversaries are watching north korea china this has massive implications is the response now going to be enough to deter our adversaries from pursuing their own ambitions well it could be right as long as we act in unison and we make their lives a living hell moving forward the russian people don't want that they're not going to accept that rather than do away with somebody like putin so congressman unfortunately we have to rap and keep it there we really appreciate you being with us back to you bianca

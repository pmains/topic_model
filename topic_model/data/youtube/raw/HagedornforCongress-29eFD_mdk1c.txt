the threat from radical Islamist groups like Isis and al-qaeda is growing and it's real and our government needs to do a better job of protecting the American people just last week in Paris one or two of the attackers the Islamic terrorist attackers were foreign fighters trained in Syria trained by Isis and sent into Europe posing a Syrian refugees in spite of that President Obama and my opponent congressman Walz they have a plan to bring 200,000 additional refugees into the United States refugees from Syria and refugees from other Muslim countries that's just wrong now they'll tell you that they can vet those people to make sure that will be protected but that's completely false we know that because in the state of Minnesota we already have a terrorist recruiting problem and that stems from Muslim refugees that we brought in from East Africa right now the FBI across the country and each and every state has a thousand ongoing Isis investigations this is a big problem I completely reject Obama's refugee policy and in fact am calling for a timeout on those programs the best way we can defend the United States and protect the American people from Islamic terrorism is to keep the Islamic terrorists as far away from our country in our communities as possible I'm Jim Hagedorn thanks for watching

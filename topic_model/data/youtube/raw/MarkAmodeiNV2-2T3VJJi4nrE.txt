all right now to chaos on Capitol Hill where the House Speaker faces a mutiny of sorts from his fellow Republicans if it succeeds it would make me a make-or-break day for a number of congressional Republicans who are eager to finally address immigration the main point of contention is a so-called discharge petition don't worry too much about the term basically it's a move that would move immigration legislation out of committee and onto the House floor for a real debate and a vote such a move could force Speaker Paul Ryan to call a vote on a bill he doesn't like or isn't sure he has got the support for House Democrats joined about in kind of all House Democrats joined about 23 Republican Republicans in Congress using this maneuver to force a vote on four separate immigration proposals they've almost got enough signatures to pull the trigger but speaker Ryan trying to hold off an assault on his authority and prevent mayhem in the Republican Conference is trying to hold the line instead he's negotiating with the various factions to come up with a unified GOP plan for immigration legislation to introduce sometime later this summer now all of this comes at a time when arrests at the US border with Mexico are on the upswing topping 50,000 in May for the first for the third straight month joining me now is congressman mark Halliday a Republican from Nevada who supports the discharge petition congressman good to see you good to see you so this is not just a matter of supporting something on the merits it's the idea that you like many other members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are frustrated with the fact that we haven't moved forward on some meaningful immigration legislation you know what Ally your description of the procedural tool that the discharge petition is and leading into this is pretty darn accurate and thank you for that the discharge petition doesn't mean I'm going to vote specifically on any one of those but it means I want the legislative process I want a chance to go to Rules Committee and offer amendments and I want a chance to vote on the floor and you say why is that it's like does anybody think the status quo is really working regardless of what your politics are right that's right and then you and I have had this conversation on other topics in the past and it's meaningful for you and your constituents to get this done now look I'm not bothered by the fact that all Republicans are not on the same side on this issue that is the beauty of our pluralistic Republican democracy but is there common ground is there enough common ground to get something happening you know what I don't know I mean the Senate tried vote in king of the hill they had they had what what did they call that a boat a thon and they didn't pass anything that could be the result in the house - but to be prohibited from being recorded as for or against something when you're a legislator is a curious thing and remember Ally the president gave us a March 6 deadline which is 90 days in the rearview mirror now so when we talk about what's what's the magic of continuing to do nothing yeah got me right and and so part of the issue is that on some of the issues on immigration look there's some on which there's not there's not common agreement amongst Republicans it's certainly not agreement with Democrats on the border wall this is an issue that is very difficult for people to come to terms with but on the issue of some solution for murrs for these daca kids the country is almost of one mind on this and I think most Republicans want some resolution to this what does it come down to that some Republicans are okay with a path to citizenship for these people and some are not well you know when you look at that particular issue you say well the president was talking ten or twelve years citizenship was at the end Bob Goodlatte was talking three years and you had to keep signing up but it's like so that's fine put something on the floor and let's see what the amendment process produces and then let's see what people actually vote for this bit where we're saying I don't want to pass I don't want to bring something unless I know it's going to be signed into law well with all due respect I don't know anybody who's got a hundred percent crystal ball here remember when we brought healthcare to the floor young guess what we took those hard votes and it didn't get into law so I'm supposed to shut everything down No right so that's the process that that constituents in your constituents in particular want to see they'd like to see some legislative process I guess this is the part that frustrates people that things get stuck in committee and there's these negotiations that go on between Congress and the White House but but folks want some kind of movement from members of Congress well it's just my opinion but let me tell you what it's pretty tough to defend nothing okay judge me by how I vote yeah that's this business give me a chance to vote setting up this this this hurdle that says I don't know if it's if we should do it unless I know it's going to pass is like well if we did everything that way we probably wouldn't even have a country right now what do you say to those people who describe this I mean I did it I was a bit tongue-in-cheek when I said that Speaker Paul Ryan is holding off a mutiny this isn't really a mutiny but it is a challenge too to what he leadership thinks is the order of which in which things should be done through committee through leadership sanction and scheduling of votes how do you what do you say to people who say that you're you're you're pushing back on on your leadership well first of all when you look at the 23 Republicans that are on that thing there's about 13 of them that have a higher voting percentage with the president and the speaker so this isn't a bunch of wild people running around trying to tear things down second of all there's probably general agreement on 80 plus percent of the issues there so it's like are we gonna let the perfect be the competitor to the good after this long you know the last time we did immigration of any kind we were listening to cassette deck yeah some of your viewers don't even know the cassettes are it was an AJAX but it was cassettes you're absolutely right about that all right congressman good to talk to you as always congressman

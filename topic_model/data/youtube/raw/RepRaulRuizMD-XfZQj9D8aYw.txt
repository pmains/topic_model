i now would like to recognize someone who you know there's no one with greater passion uh for our americas for america's veterans who've been exposed to burn pits uh stands alongside uh representative slotkin my good friend and neighbor dr ruiz you're recognized for three minutes to comment on your bill thank you chairman takano for your work and leadership on toxic exposures look veterans are dying as delayed casualties of war or suffering from permanent disabilities from their exposures to carcinogens and other toxic chemicals emitted from burn pits used by the military this is a department of of defense self-inflicted as womb emergency physician and public health expert i understand the science and urgency to act and save our veterans lives that is why i recently reintroduced with republican representative fitzpatrick and senators gillibrand and rubio the bipartisan bicameral h.r 2372 the presumptive benefits for war fighters exposed to burn pits and other toxins act of 2021 to get our veterans the care they need and deserve under current law a veteran who has an illness or disability must establish a direct service connection in order to be eligible for va benefits that means that after serving and sacrificing for our nation veterans exposed to burn pits face a cumbersome and in many cases impossible burden of proof to provide enough evidence to establish a direct service connection between their health and exposure we can and must do better and my bill offers the most comprehensive coverage for our veterans by removing the burden of proof from the veteran to receive presumption of service connection a veteran would only need to submit documentation that they received the medal associated with the global war on terror or the gulf war and that they suffer from a qualifying health condition additionally my bill would grant to veteran health care for burn pit exposure ailments and for other toxic exposures disability compensation and death benefits to a spouse or dependents this is the most aggressive and comprehensive legislative initiative aimed at tackling the immediate healthcare crisis that too many of our veterans are facing i first learned of the effects of burn pits when one of my constituents jennifer kepner 39 year old air force veterans with a healthy lifestyle no other risk factors came to my office for help she was battling pancreatic cancer with her oncologist determined was likely linked to exposure to burn pits i sat with her in her home as she told her story and i can tell you that was one of the most impactful kitchen table conversations i've ever had she spent her last month as a leading voice for her fellow veterans exposed to burn pits which she called the agent orange of our generation i was at her bedside with her husband and two children when she died on october 18 2017. her story continues to be an inspiration in this fight to protect veterans and their families from the pain and suffering she experienced both from burn pits and from her difficult experiencing navigating the va as an emergency physician i can tell you that in science and medicine we know that if you have a high enough suspicion of an agent that causes a severe enough consequence then you need to act on that suspicion we have according to the literature and science enough suspicion and veterans are dying therefore we need to act this congress to provide the relief the care that our veterans need with that i thank you and i yield back my time i want to take this down to the basics my first question is to mr burke mr burke would you consistently burn trash including plastics human waste possibly even jet fuel in your backyard or near your family i would not sir thank you dr kelsey dr the doctor uh what potential illnesses could a healthy person develop if they consistently burn trash as i mentioned in their backyard uh dr ruiz uh that's a uh complicated question but there's a panel it's not very complicated you know the answer people will get what are the illnesses that can potentially be uh they can develop from breathing into smoke from burning trash in their backyard well it depends on the exposure certainly respiratory illness is uh commonly encountered by uh uh inhalation of of you know things that burn uh what else what other so respiratory illnesses what else depending upon what you're burning you could you can get systemic illness of all sorts you there's immunotoxic agents that you can inhale there's uh you can have digestive elements there's a how about carcinogens of course absolutely okay so then asthma constrictive bronchiolitis copd potential leukemias pancreatic cancer brain cancers all these are potential health consequences of burning trash in your backyard and with the the exposures uh and dosage of course dr kelsey that you had mentioned so bernie household waste produces many toxic chemicals and is one of the largest known sources of dioxins in the nation dioxin is a carcinogen a carcinogen causes cancer cancer causes deaths right it's pretty it's pretty uh it's a pretty straightforward association in fact according to the epa burning waste is a serious public health threat the epa banned it in the u.s in 1979. it is bad for people here it is bad for our military personnel serving our countries overseas we need to end the exposure to burn pits in our military we need to act now to care for our veterans who are coming back with delayed injuries in the form of asthma constrictive bronchiolitis copd and cancers too many have been told by the va that their injuries are not service related even though there is enough suspicion enough evidence to show a high enough association correlation of the illness due to exposure to toxic chemicals from burn pits we will not we cannot sit by and watch our veterans wait decades like they were forced to with agent orange which is why i will not stop fighting we should not stop fighting until our veterans get presumption of service connection for their exposure to toxic substances during their service look you have mentioned dr kelsey that producing causality of an agent to an illness is very tough standards of course they're tough standards the best ideal way of benchmark research is to put a a person and expose them to the agent right and then you can control the amount of dose that they get well that's illegal because it's unethical and you said it yourself that it is almost impossible to determine so let's not use that as the strict criteria we need to expand our models of association and correlation to show a high enough suspicion of an agent that causes a severe enough consequence which is death we have already correlation studies from firefighters exposed to the toxic smoke of jet fuels crashing into the buildings that caused cancers and respiratory illnesses we already have dioxin that have been found in the sample and the sand uh in places where burn pits were used and we have bronchoscopic biopsy samples that show metals in the lungs of veterans exposed to burn pits so there is evidence to show a high enough suspicion association correlation to know that our burn pits exposed veterans are dying of cancers being permanently disabled of respiratory illnesses this question last question is for mr burke does the va support establishing presumption of service connections to veterans exposed to burn pits or other toxic substances so as contained in the written testimony my oral statement the secretary is committing to doing an end-to-end review of the current process all right we're going to have to do it for you uh it sounds like this committee is going to have to write the legislation and do it for you because we can't wait for a repeat va's performance the way they did and for the veterans exposed to agent orange we will not allow that to happen to our veterans in this generation i yield back my time i represent the eastern part of riverside county in southern california which has a large veteran population i think is is in the top 11 county with most veterans in the nation and as an emergency medicine physician helping ensure veterans have access to high quality care is one of my highest priorities since the get-go that includes making sure that our veterans who are exposed to harmful toxicants during their service to our country get the critical health care needed for their war illnesses this is why senator gillibrand and i reintroduced the presumptive benefits for war fighters exposed to burn pits and other toxic exposures act of 2021 along with our republican colleagues senator rubio and congressman fitzpatrick we cannot simply pay lip service to our war heroes and thank them for their service we owe them the health care and benefits that they earned when we sent them to war for our country anything less than presumption of service connection for toxic exposures is not acceptable let me repeat that anything less than presumption of service connection for toxic exposures is not acceptable mr you're from the iraq afghanistan veterans of america can you articulate the importance of the establishment of presumption of service connection for veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic exposures yes thank you very much congressman for one working so closely at reintroducing the presumptive the warfighters act is one of iva's top priorities to ensure we i want to echo your statement that anything less than a presumptive illness is is not acceptable for iava the presumptive illness would open up so much for veterans that are currently sick or is sick in the future proving the illness as i mentioned before can be extremely difficult because of the time that has lapsed or lacking dod records that would take that burden of proof off of the veteran and they don't no longer have to wait for all of these research studies to be done which may never link 100 because of all of the issues with the research that our previous panel had mentioned that we've had in the past that we've run into before additionally it will encourage veterans to come forward with their claim as va wants because they know they don't have to go through this bureaucratic red tape to prove all of these different things that they were exposed that they are sick et cetera et cetera so we believe all of these reasons are why presumptive illness is so important thank you miss keenan can you think do you think that it is premature as mentioned previously for the va to support toxic exposure legislation thank you congressman for that question we absolutely do not think it's premature we we are actually disappointed that va hasn't taken the opportunity in in this and last week's hearing to express um their feelings about these bills we'd like to work together with them to come up with a solution but to be honest you know the train has left the station um we really believe that comprehensive toxic exposure legislation can and will pass this congress and we're going to continue to advocate you know how can the va be more transparent with implementing its framework for responding to veterans exposed to toxic exposures mrs keenan again we we don't want to wait um you know for va to try to come up with yet another plan and then you know find the statistics and find out see if it's effective or not we really think that legislation has which in the past and will work in the future thank you uh ms keenan as you know i've uh found co-founded the bipartisan burdeks caucus and for many years i've laid out a framework a public health scientific approach to the issue of burn pits there's four pillars to that framework that i've been speaking for so many years one is to end the exposures to the burn kits to the agent that's causing harm two is aggressively educate through outreach to service members and veterans exposed to toxins and trained providers and personnel in dod and va and the general public three is take care of our patients provide the health care and the benefits to our veterans and four do the research to understand the full gamut of illnesses caused by hundreds of chemicals that have that our veterans have been exposed to so those are four pillars and approaches of a framework that i've been speaking about for many many years and we take those as pillars as a as a committee then we will ensure that we address this issue once and for all with that i yield back my time you

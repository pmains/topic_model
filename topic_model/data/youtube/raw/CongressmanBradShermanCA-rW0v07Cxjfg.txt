  WATCH. I REALIZED, THIS IS AN HOUR  DEVOTED TO REMEMBRANCES FROM HIS COLLEAGUES FROM MICHIGAN AND I   THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING A HUMBLE  CALIFORNIAN TO PARTICIPATE.  AMERICA IS HEALTHIER BECAUSE OF  JOHN DINGELL.  LESS TOBACCO IS SMOKED NOW THAN  DECADES AGO BECAUSE OF JOHN  DINGELL. OUR AIR IS CLEANER, OUR WATER IS CLEANER, WE ARE HEALTHIER. AND WE ARE CLOSER TO COMPLETELY  UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE THAN WE  HAVE EVER BEEN IN OUR HISTORY. BECAUSE OF JOHN DINGELL. NOT ONLY IS OUR ENVIRONMENT  HEALTHIER, OUR BODIES HEALTHIER, OUR COUNTRY IS HEALTHIER BECAUSE OF WHAT JOHN DINGELL DID TO  BRING CIVIL RIGHTS, TO MOVE  FORWARD THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL  RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY.  JOHN IS THE DEAN OF THE MICHIGAN DELEGATION, BUT HE BELONGS TO US TOO. HE'S THE DEAN OF THE HOUSE, HE'S THE DEAN OF THE HOUSE FOR ALL  TIME.  I DOUBT THAT ANY MEMBER WILL   EVER MATCH HIS RECORD OF TENURE, BUT I KNOW THAT NO MEMBER WILL   EVER MATCH HIS RECORD OF   ACCOMPLISHMENT.  SOONED WE HAVE SO MANY NEW   MEMBERS COME TO THE HOUSE THIS   YEAR -- AND SO WE HAVE SO MANY   NEW MEMBERS COME TO THE HOUSE  THIS YEAR WONDERING HOW TO   LEARN, HOW TO BE AN EFFECTIVE  MEMBER, HOW TO SERVE THEIR   COUNTRY. THEY COULD NOT DO ANY BETTER   THAN TO -- THAN TO STUDY THE   LIFE OF JOHN DINGELL IN HIS  NEARLY SIX DECADES OF SERVICE TO THIS COUNTRY AND TO THIS HOUSE.  I'M SO PLEASED THAT DEBBIE   DINGELL CONTINUES TO SERVE THE   DISTRICT, A DISTRICT SERVED BY   JOHN AND JOHN'S FATHER.  I THANK YOU FOR INVITING A   CALIFORNIAN MEMBER TO TAKE JUST  A BIT OF YOUR TIME AND I YIELD   BACK.  MR. KILDEE: THANK YOU,   CONGRESSMAN SHERMAN

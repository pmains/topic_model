we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back everybody and happy fourth of july happy independence day this is one of my favorite holidays for for many many reasons mostly because i just love the declaration of independence this podcast is called hold these truths that comes from you guessed it the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be self-evident and what are these truths these truths are derived from our creator as the declaration states and these truths means our rights our inalienable rights life liberty and the pursuit of happiness um there's a lot to the declaration it's it's it's part philosophical political uh it's a political philosophy and it's part and it's mostly a long list of grievances against the british the americans claiming that they are actually equal and sovereign next to the british and they have every right to self-govern and that the list of grievances has not been addressed and they list a whole bunch of grievances i probably couldn't list a lot of those for you off the top of my head um because i think the most important thing about the declaration of independence is the philosophical statement that it makes it tells us why government exists governments exist to protect your inalienable rights to protect you from others who seek to infringe on those rights a government can only exist by the consent of the governed it packs so much meaning into into this one long sentence um there and we're gonna pick it apart today uh i think it's i think it's prudent let me read it to you first before we before we get into it we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed and that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness there is a ton of history and a ton of meaning philosophical meaning philosophical underpinnings history behind all of these words and we're going to dive into it um we're probably not going to be able to talk about the actual revolution itself today uh because there's there's so much to talk about about why government exists and that's that's the purpose of the declaration of independence to tell us why government exists the constitution tells us how to govern it provides that infrastructure hey you're supposed to have three branches of government they should have checks and balances this is how they should vote that's what the constitution does it gets more philosophical when we have the bill of rights of course and that's incredibly important but it's the declaration that even tells us we have rights in the first place and that you can't argue with those rights because they come from our creator it's really interesting stuff and um and to have that conversation i brought an expert on it dr danielle allen welcome back to the show really glad to have you thank you so much congressman glad to be here so i'm going to reintroduce you to everybody remember for the audience you were here in april um but we were talking about something totally unrelated um covet 19. unfortunately that hasn't gone away uh but we're not going to talk about that today we're going to talk about what you what you'd normally um work on which is political theory remember you're a professor at harvard you are the director of harvard's center for ethics uh political theorist you you've published a lot of things on democratic theory political sociology and history of political thought and given that it's the fourth of july i would love to talk about your book our declaration a reading of the declaration of independence and defense of equality um it's a fantastic read and i highly recommend it um so we'll start from the beginning because you actually have a interesting reasoning as to why you you wanted to write the book in the first place sure absolutely now i'm glad to talk about the book and the declaration of independence is literally my favorite topic so i always welcome a chance to talk about it um i taught at the university of chicago for a decade and while i was there i was very fortunate to get involved in a night program for low-income adults a year-long humanities course where they did history philosophy literature art history and critical thinking and writing and over the course of my time i taught several of the units in this night course and the goal of the night course was to give our students the same caliber of education that the day students at the university of chicago got yet these were folks sometimes who hadn't even completed a high school degree or were working two jobs so there was this real sort of um conundrum of how you delivered the same quality of education in such different contexts with people with such different backgrounds the solution was to teach the same caliber of text high quality pieces of writing with incredibly important content so but to shrink the size to do shorter texts so i'm going to be honest and say from a purely pragmatic point of view for a purely pragmatic reason i chose to teach the declaration of independence not just teach it as history just such as philosophy as literature to support uh learning about writing but it was an electrifying experience my night students were people who were all in that course because they wanted to change their lives and they connected to the declaration faster than i'd ever seen any of my day students do they went right to the heart of its argument it's about people who look around at their circumstances diagnose them identify what's wrong and chart a path to a better future so we just took control of that document took ownership to mastery and it was an amazingly empowering learning opportunity that is what i tend to love about the declaration is empowering is a pretty good word to describe it and so can can you actually go let's go back before 1776 just just a few years or however many years you think we should go back when did the when did the i guess cognitive gears start spinning in the founders minds what what are some of the what are the actions as well that led up to the writing of the declaration of independence let's frame it for the audience the historical framing for the audience sure so i think it's fair to say that roughly a decade of work uh preceded the declaration of independence so there was an important moment in massachusetts in the 1760s with the ritz of assistance this was when british customs officers were given the power to search people without cause they could just sort of search people willy-nilly you could sort of think of it as stop and frisk of the day and that really ticked off a lot of resistance and resentment on the part of the colonial americans so um they began for that and for other reasons there were lots of new taxes coming out of the british need to pay for the french indian war which had been extremely expensive and there were lots of additional controls on american efforts to develop mercantile power and industries of various kinds so there was a requirement for example that they used things that had been made in britain um cloth for instance or iron and things like that even though they were developing manufacturing capacity themselves so there were a lot of problems in relation in british colonial policy in the 1760s and the americans were routinely writing to parliament routinely writing to the king submitting petition after petition seeking an alternative landscape an alternative legal landscape an alternative policy landscape so by the time they write the declaration they say you know we've petitioned for redress of our grievances and we've been met only by repeated injury and what they're doing is describing a 10-year process of trying for change through existing channels and finding those channels non-responsive and you also write about and this started with the issue in new hampshire where they sort of found themselves without proper governance and and and i think you write about how adams and lee sort of figured out how to sell independence in in this way by are making making kind of a clever argument that that because the british were i guess retreating from their duties of governance declaring the colonies and outright rebellion that well you have no choice but to set up your own government so don't we need independence am i explaining that correctly yeah yes no no you've got it well so i think very often um we repeat this myth that first you have revolution and then you have the work of constituting something but that's actually how it went the relationship was actually the other way around that is they understood how they wanted to constitute what they wanted to constitute before they decided to declare independence and so yes i mean what happened was um there was resistance there were uprisings and in various ways the british were withdrawing from their responsibilities so in new hampshire the royal governor fled new hampshire was literally without a functioning government the judicial system couldn't operate that happened in june of 1775 and so the folks in new hampshire wrote to continental congress and said hey what should we do and congress wrote back and said set up a government and so by january 1776 new hampshire had written a constitution that was the first state constitution and so then so i think adams and lee john adams and richard henry adams from massachusetts leave from virginia together they were pulling north and south in one direction um they had this sort of powerful insight that that was the way forward so then with the king in the fall of 1775 declared the colonies um outside of his product protection with regard to um naval matters um maritime matters um that was their moment they said look he's just declaring us out of his protection on the high seas we're not gonna be protected from spain and from france it has as good as abandoned us so it's on us to govern ourselves and so new hampshire was already at work writing that constitution and they started arguing that everybody else should start doing the same in may virginia went ahead and voted on a constitution for itself by the time we actually get to july 4th we already have four or five colonies that have written constitutions for themselves so they've made that commitment to governing themselves and once they've done that and lay the foundation to do that and then they're ready to declare independence yeah it it starts to become inevitable i suppose um exactly what it's the thing that sort of seals the deal but the point really is that they didn't you know wake up one mo one morning and declare independence and then figure out what to do that's the important right right but yeah yeah the positive project of self-government before they declared independence right it was a process it's a part of that process is the continental congress can we actually real quick we back up here can we define for the audience the continental congress why why was this set up what is this continental congress that that's operating in rebellion against the british like what is this sure so as i said um in the wake of the french indian war there were a lot of political difficulties between the colonies and britain and so um different leaders in the colonies began organizing initially sort of conversation groups so sam adams here in massachusetts ran a group called the loyal nine which was like his you know nine buddies who get together and think about what's wrong with their relations with britain what to do about it and coming out of that initial kind of group they started setting up these things called committees of correspondence all over the colonies where they would communicate with each other and say well here's what's going on with us what's going on with you what do you see it sort of it was grassroots organizing of the day and so then at a certain point there's a kind of center of gravity of agreement that there was a problem and that they wanted to be able to speak with one voice about the problem so they decided to from their colonies send delegates to philadelphia to form a continental congress called that simply because it was going to cover the continent all the colonies were going to come together and speak with a single continental voice when they first did that they weren't trying to set up a government separately from britain they just wanted to write one letter to the king instead of writing 13 letters if you see what i mean um so you have the first title congress which basically submitted a bunch more petitions to the king and then the second continental congress which is the one that declared independence and fought the war got it and and they also set up a committee and the this committee was meant to when would finally decided to to write the actual actual deck of well there's a resolution that needs to be written first it's kind of a complicated process that actually occurs there's a resolution and there's a declaration the record the resolution doesn't get a whole lot of attention um but but who's on the committee and and why sure well so i may just want to say out loud you know they didn't just set up one committee you know they're just like you guys in real congress now because they were congress they were the first congress and they set up loads and loads of committees so that's sort of like what was was just this incredible producer of one committee after another and um in this instance what they did was um richard henry lee stood up in congress in early june to propose a resolution for independence and that was how congress proceeded at the time was that first you'd have somebody propose something for people to vote on and then if there was movement in the positive direction you'd go ahead and have a committee assigned to draft the preamble to go with the resolution so what lee's resolution was is basically what is still the final paragraph of the declaration when they say we therefore declare these colonies be free and independent states um that paragraph was basically the text of his resolution and um so the committee assigned to draft the preamble well the way they did committees was they voted and whoever got the most votes would be the chair of the committee um it's also important to say that at the same time they're sitting on the committee to draft the articles of confederation a committee to draft the treaties with france and spain so the point is there were 56 people in congress they had a whole lot of committees most of them were really really really busy there was one person who wasn't very busy who wasn't on a bunch of committees and that was thomas jefferson so john adams um was super busy he was on a bazillion committees um he was really the leading intellectual force long future henry lee behind the declaration he was also a real political actor so he worked behind the scenes to sort of get folks voted on to this community to write the preamble he got jefferson voted on winning by one to him adams coming in second then franklin roger sherman of connecticut and robert livingston of new york so those five a note one southerner for four northerners so it's a kind of interesting fact to register that the authors of the declaration were committee that spanned the colonies jefferson got to be chair and as chair you get to actually be in charge of the literal writing out of the text and that was mainly because he was young and not on a lot of committees yeah he was 32 which is incredible yeah that's not that young i'm 36 come on no comment okay um this is the committee work was incredible and john adams basically said to jefferson you're gonna write it um because you're a great writer actually you actually um adams wrote and you have it here in your book the conversation that he had with jefferson adams i will not do it you shall do it jefferson oh no why will you not you ought to do it adams i will not jefferson why adam's reason's enough this is just a hilarious conversation exactly jefferson what can be your reasons adams reason first you are a virginian and a virginian ought to appear at the head of the business reason second i'm obnoxious suspected and unpopular and you are very much otherwise reason third you can write ten times better than i can jefferson well if you are decided i will do as well as i can i wonder how that i wonder how the guy just i don't know i i had to read that out loud because i'd love it too yeah funny right 18th century uh conversation and such an accurate honestly you know it's like it's a really powerful accurate statement of facts on the ground yeah if i may i mean um virginia was the most populous state and um in various ways it was closer to britain massachusetts had been pestering britain for quite some time so for virginia to come round and also be in favor of independence was a very significant political thing hence the importance of having jefferson um at the head of the committee um and yes you know adams was this rabble rouser so he's just describing himself accurately there so so i want to read the uh the first draft that that jefferson wrote and it's not going to sound it's going to sound kind of familiar to people but but obviously wrong we hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable that all men are created equal and independent that from that equal creation they derive in rights with inherent and inalienable that among which are the preservation of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these ends governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed so that's not exactly how it ended up um and so i i love what you wrote here have this messy work um where we obviously know that the final draft was we hold these truths to be self-evident and so they changed sacred and undeniable to self-evident and you've got to wonder like how do you how do you think that conversation went between adams and jefferson and benjamin franklin was was also on this committee as well but how how do you think that conversation went and why would they why did they want to change it do you think it was word flow do you think it just sounded better do you think there was deeper meaning i mean you go into a lot of detail in the deeper meaning behind the words self-evident so but do you think they had that conversation i think they do i mean they were working so hard on these questions and they weren't just working on them in the context of this moment of writing i mean they've been working on them for months i mean adams really first starts sketching out ideas that show up in the declaration in letters in november and then he writes a version of declaration from massachusetts in january 1776 he has another pamphlet in april which also has a lot of the content of the declaration in it so basically they've been giving this so much thought and the question of what's sacred does matter to them they also recognize that they have a hugely diverse population jefferson is really writing as a deist or that you know of uncertain religious persuasion or conviction adams is a practicing christian um so they are collectively working their way towards compromise language um franklin is a quaker very different in kind from sherman who is a very austere puritan um and so um we end up with a language of the creator um as the source for rights where the creator is not given any specific doctrinal link or association and where the creator's also linked up with nature so that people have kind of two different ways they can understand the foundation of our rights and source of our rights um and so they what they ultimately do is they distinguish the source of our rights um from the things we should understand about our rights and the things we should understand about our rights are a matter of logic and that's where the concept of self-evidence comes in and it's a really important word because what it's actually doing is naming the structure of that all-important second sentence of declaration that's the we hold these truths um sentence and so the point they're making about truth is that um you can see sets of logical relations among things such that conclusions necessarily follow so basically you've got this premise people have rights here are some examples life could be the pursuit of happiness second premise governments are instituted among humankind to secure those rights and then those premises deliver a conclusion so if governments are supposed to secure rights um all people have rights well then if those governments are securing rights it's the right of the people also to alter or to abolish them so in other words what they're doing is using logical inference to draw a right of revolution out of some premises that they take to be true um so they're separating there's a sort of source of truth that comes from logic that's what's captured in that sentence and then there's a question of what's the source of our rights and that's what comes from the creator or nature depending on how you want to look at it so they were really very careful about their justifications for things that's what we see happening as they make those edits and revisions yeah it's it's true they don't if you're reading it it's obviously it's obvious that they're talking about god but it's not it's not necessarily a specific religion it's not tied to a specific religion and they were careful about that and um jefferson has a very interesting uh i guess set of religious beliefs he he wrote his own version of the bi they call it the jefferson bible but you know that he called it something different i don't have it in front of me um but but the point is is that they they come from something higher than just your opinion and and you can't you can't derive these rights just by opinion alone because well if that were true then they could just be changed uh quickly and radically and and i think human history would back that notion up uh quite easily so it's also a good time i think to talk about the philosophical underpinnings of why they wrote these words it's not like the founders just figured this stuff out all of a sudden um they were they were very well educated they they were um very well read on history and philosophy and um i don't i missed it in the book but i remember you talking about this um at a talk you gave a about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness why those three things and and the origination from john locke's life liberty and property yes that's a good point you know it's funny because that was some work i ended up doing after the book came out so if i were to do a revised edition of the book this would be a section that would go in um so the phrase life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is hugely important obviously and it is a moment of a really fundamental choice the tradition coming out of um enlightenment philosophy for talking about rights and for example from the work of the english philosopher john locke have been to argue that the fundamental rights were life liberty and property and over the course of 1775 and 1776 the americans were having a debate about this they were having a debate about how they wanted to describe their fundamental purposes and aspirations the debate had already gotten seized up with and massively confounded by the problem of enslavement in the fall of 1775 the british governor of virginia lord dunmore had decreed that any enslaved person who escaped and fought for the british would be free and from that point on the virginians were arguing that the king was violating their rights of property so the right of property the defense of the writer property had became closely associated with defense of enslavement and benjamin franklin notes this in the debates about the articles of confederation so while this is happening john adams is working really hard to try to figure out what the right way is of talking about what they're all about and he starts really pursuing the happiness concept and writing about it and when he does that what he's drawing on is another part of the philosophical tradition partly drawing from philosophy so aristotle for example from the greeks cicero from the romans and then also in important ways for him specifically from religious traditions and texts so um that concept comes from aristotle and cicero about happiness is a big concept about human flourishing and well-being it's about yeah if you have a life well-lived it's not a hedonistic pleasure concept um it's really a concept that's about if i get to the end of my life and look back how will i know that i had a life well lived that's what happiness is fundamentally about um and so for them that means concepts like virtues of various kinds living well treating others well having positive unhealthy relationships with other people and that kind of thing um and so then adams makes this argument in april 1776 in this pamphlet called some thoughts concerning government that the object of all government is the same as the object of life for all human beings and that's happiness and you can see the debate coming together at this point because then in virginia when they draft their um constitution and their declaration of rights um when george mason drafts that he argues exactly for life liberty property and securing happiness he puts all the whole package together in two so that means between may with when masonry sat in virginia and july when congress passes the declaration the debate is over do we put property and happiness both in or do we just use happiness and so in the end they just use happiness that is a really important anti-enslavement moment in the declaration because it means they were really pushing out what had become the anchor term for a defense of enslavement there is also in a moment where they compromise on behalf of the slave faction so you have both voices in the declaration but it's really important to see that life liberty and the pursuit of happiness um was anchoring um space for the anti-enslavement position and that was a conscious decision a conscious decision i mean yes when you look at all the minutes and notes so for example in the debates about the articles of confederation property comes up and the question's like are they going to put property in the text as a kind of specific term and franklin says we can't we can't use it because when it comes up it just is about slavery so we can't it's too there's too much controversy that is connected to this term um so that's how we know that they were very explicit and self-conscious about how the right property had become very closely entangled with the defense of enslavement adams never owns um slaves who's not in slavery benjamin franklin had enslaved people earlier in his life and he became an abolitionist he became an active advocate of abolition so in that committee working on the declaration you have people who already had different positions on enslavement both adams and franklin in various ways would help advance the end of enslavement in their states and both massachusetts and pennsylvania had achieved that by the early 1780s and and on that subject jefferson had a whole paragraph in the in the original declaration on a a vehemently anti-slavery uh paragraph that was that was taken out um not by the committee but by the by the continental congress as a whole that's right yes so there's a paragraph that refers to the sacred rights of life and liberty it's the same vocabulary as you quoted before um of africans um and the way in which the sacred rights of life and liberty were violated by the slave trade so the committee endorsed that language even jefferson he is the mystery figure in all of this how he could have written and or endorsed language like that given his own status as an enslaver but at any rate um then yes congress took that paragraph out um but congress also endorsed the life-threatening pursuit of happiness phrase so it's the declaration has its compromises around enslavement in it in the same way that the constitution did and and so what are your explanations because jefferson is that mystery man um and and you write about this in the book and try to try to figure out and contextualize what's actually happening there he was he clearly intended to write a legal document that would be used as an abolitionist document and yet he himself owned slaves and so does the this hypocrisy i think drives people crazy um when they when they study the founders it's it's it's clearly it's clearly front and center uh in our country right now the hypocrisy of historical figures um who could do great things but be but be sinners themselves and so how do we how do we tease that out sure well there's a lot to say about this um so let me say maybe three things um two general one about jefferson so the first general thing is to say that sometimes we tried to deal with the past by saying oh well they couldn't have known any better it was just the times so that's actually not true um just because there were people already in the 1760s 1770s who were arguing against enslavement james otis another bostonian um who gave us the fight against taxation without representation you know that was his cause um also wrote one of the first abolitionist pamphlets and was very explicit that when he talked about the rights of british subjects that included black and white he says that explicitly um and um so the point is just that there was already a choice to be made um about who counted um under the big banner of universal human rights and people made choices so we have to accept that people chose wrongly in some cases that's point one uh point two however is that it's not actually our job to judge our ancestors we need to understand do they choose rightly or wrongly but it's not really our job to be um their their final judges um they have met their judgment day um that is not for us for us is to think about our own moral positions and responsibilities um that's where our moral work comes in our behavior our relations to others so then the third point about jefferson if we just try to understand jefferson um you know my judgment is he made the wrong decision but nonetheless let's understand what his decision is um or was rather and i think basically what it came down to was this i think he did in fact think that all human beings had as he wrote sacred and undeniable rights um and that included people in africa but at the same time that he believed that all people had rights and that all people should have governments that secured their rights he didn't think that all people should do that together okay so in other words i think what he was trying to articulate was a separate but equal doctrine before its time in other words he was fine with the idea that africans should go back to africa and have a government in africa right they had rights they should have their governments and so forth but that they should do separately from what white people would do in his society so he had a strong racialist picture at the same time that he had the universalist picture and i think he squared those things in his own mind with this notion that there could be separate communities for different people each of which separate communities delivered rights to those people does that make sense yeah it does and you know the way i i kind of described this too is you know civilization is an ongoing project and civilization in its in its best form [Music] i think tempers the worst of human nature you know there's there's some people believe human nature can be changed by by good and just institutions i'm not one of those people human nature is pretty consistent throughout time and i think the founders inherently understood that fact about human nature and they wanted to to institute the best framework that they could um to limit the excesses of of the worst of human nature and civil but like i said civilization is constantly evolving and and with it better tools with which to to subjugate the worst instincts of human nature and in in this case in the case of you know slavery or racial tensions it's that in-group loyalty sense that we have um and we are born with it and civilization and the free market this sort of exchange of goods and labor without without having to beat somebody up for it um it individualizes people and i think that's that's the key inside of the enlightenment and the founding is this philosophical point is that everybody is an individual everybody is equal or created equal not same but created equal with equal rights and able to engage freely with one another and protect their own life liberty and property and pursuit of happiness so property in our modern sense you know because because we we can say that now i say it all the time life liberty and property because it doesn't have that meaning anymore um but back then it did and it's it's so interesting that they took that out so because they wanted the declaration to be an abolitionist document i find that um fascinating and it was used as you've noted it was used as an abolitionist document um right after that and i guess but but going back to my main point that the civilization is constantly evolving and so yes we can judge and say that people were wrong to do things at a certain time but it should always be contextualized with civilization was still evolving um to the point where it hadn't it hadn't rooted out all all of these bad things yet and a bit of grace with with how we look at people um might be in order so you've said lots of important things there and i want to respond to some of them if that's okay um so just a small clarification i wouldn't actually go so far as to say that they um that all of congress working together wanted to produce a document that would be an abolitionist document of course not no there were people in the group for whom that was an important thing to leave open the space for abolitionism um and they achieved that in a kind of compromise context i guess that's how i would put it and indeed abolitionists saw the value of the document and we're using it immediately from january of 1777 forward um but but to your philosophical point um so i think you've said something really helpful and valuable the point about individualization as a way of breaking through um the inflexibility and the sometimes inflexibility of in-group loyalties i think that's true but i think there's more to be said um so psych psychologists and sociologists have been able to really study in group loyalties and have been able to observe that there's really different categories there are in-group loyalties that are connected to things like um opportunity hoarding and um aversion to out groups you know actual positive aversion to out groups and then there are other kinds of in-group loyalties that are about a certain kind of affinity sense of sharing but are actually disconnected from that negative view of out groups and so that's what i find really interesting the question of how do we cultivate those kinds of social connections um you know those were birds of a feather social connections of people to one another that are the version that are not connected to negative views on out groups because at the end of the day none of us is an atomistic individual we do all live in social connections in that regard i am a deeply aristotelian thinker and recognize that human beings are social creatures social animals and so our job is really to figure out um yes how to activate um individual self-governance and an individual's commitment to crafting their own life course but it's also how to sustain a network of associations and a life of communities that is in that positive way supportive of the communities of others also so that is the sort of circle that i think we're trying to square yeah that's a great way to put it um i want to get to the your book is called in defense of equality or the subtitle so uh we haven't talked about uh your your analysis of the word equality as it pertains to the declaration and so there's four facets of equality that you mentioned what what are those and what's your general take and analysis on equality and the declaration sure no thank you um so the declaration starts and ends with the concept of equality um people often forget that so in the very first sentence um what the members of congress say is that they want to claim their separate and equal um place on the nation on the world stage among nations they want their separate and equal place among nations and so when they're saying that they're making a point about what independence means for a society they want to have sovereignty and that concept of sovereignty is about not being dominated by the other powers of the earth so at the very beginning there they lay a claim to equality which is about a concept of non-domination and then that concept of equality about self-sovereignty is one that they've been applied to themselves as individuals too um as individuals they want to be equal to one another in not being dominated by each other and so that's why they want a structure of rights so that they can all pursue their life courses pursue their happiness um as a free equals to one another so that's the first way equality comes up the second way equality comes up is in that we call these choose to be self-evident um sentence where all um people are all men are created equal and that is a claim about moral equality so whereas the first thing i just described was about political equality the second way it comes up is about moral equality we human beings all have the same capacity inside us and this is that capacity to to to diagnose our circumstances and to set a course to ensure that tomorrow is better than yesterday we may exercise at capacity at different levels of success but we all have that capacity we all have the capacity to be judges of our circumstances that's the second way equality comes up the third way is in the list of grievances that they introduced in their complaints about the king so this list of grievances is made out of the contributions of people all over the colonies and the members of congress even put advertisements in newspapers saying to ordinary members of their society write us letters tell us what you're seeing about what's going on with britain in other words this was a kind of equality about knowledge sharing they recognize everybody in their society might have something useful to share some useful bit of perspective um it's kind of like a potluck approach um to knowledge creation facebook well there's yes exactly but without curation right facebook no curation congress is also a mediating um vehicle here so everybody contributes something and then we in congress will synthesize and interpret and try to make sure it's curated um at the end of the day um so but that's a very democratic approach to knowledge generation development very egalitarian that's the third way um the fourth way is in they when they define um the king the tyrant as somebody who has not been responsive um to their knees that they've reached out with petitions seeking redress and he's only responded by repeated injury and that's a really powerful point because it makes a point that equality and freedom or rather freedom is about sort of reciprocity and responsiveness if i've got a grievance i need responsiveness and that balancing of exchanges is a fourth facet of equality and then the last one i'm sorry i'm taking so long about this but it's also important the last facet of equality is when at the very end of the declaration um they mutually pledge their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to one another in other words they are in this together they're gonna invest their lives their fortunes in the sacred honor like they're everything they have they're gonna co-invest in a set of political institutions of which they're gonna be co-owners so this is a thing i just you know think it's so important for people to recognize when you look at your state capitol building when you look at your courthouses when you look at any of your public offices when you look at the white house when we look at the u.s capitol building this is an incredible body of assets okay they actually increase the quality of our life on every dimension economic social educational you name it these are assets that are delivering well-being who owns those assets we the people we are all equal co-owners of those assets um and that's what they were really saying that there's that kind of quality of co-ownership of our political institutions when they mutually pledge their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to one another yeah and they certainly did that i mean i don't have any of this the the stats right in front of me but many many were many of the signers of the declaration were some were killed some were um uh house had their homes burned to the ground they were truly hunted i mean they were there was it was interesting that they did not sign this anonymously um it was in fact a death warrant it was very courageous and without they had made their decision there was no turning back at that point and so i mean there were members of congress who chose not to sign and they left at that point that was the point in which they you know got on a ship and went back to britain basically so um so that was the turning point while you were picking aside at that point yeah and you're careful to define equality and i think you need to be careful to define equality and i i certainly don't have any disagreements with the way you do it it's an interesting number of facets here so again one political um everybody should have the political equal political representation um everybody should have equal moral rights equal right to pursue their happiness and decide what happiness means to them i think that's really interesting and i didn't actually quite understand what you meant by the development of collective intelligence until you just said it now and it's it's what we do on a daily basis we collect uh constituent input and uh some sometimes some of the best ideas for legislation actually do come from uh local constituents and so exactly it's this sort of um this bottom-up uh democratic process um that is quite interesting um reciprocity is a really interesting one the way and this this may be the one where i think people if people i'm sure everybody's got complaints about everything but if there's one that i can see people having a complaint about now and feeling like we're not living up to this sort of practice of reciprocity um to to to confront each other on equal footing especially between government and citizen um i i think this one would be it uh you know the the tensions with police right now are are clearly that that's the complaint if you're a liberal if you're a libertarian the complaint is that the government and the regulatory system can just beat you over the head and there's nothing you can do about it you can't possibly muster the resources uh to fight the government when they won't when they won't sign your permit oh we just won't do it why you know and and like if there if there's work to be done um it's here perhaps and this is the story of america right we wrote down these incredible ideas and um they they came at a time that wasn't ready for them uh but when is society ready for for landmark ideas and and we spent quite a bit of time actually trying to live up to this notion of of true equality um and in the ways i i just mentioned i suppose we still are um although while we have come come a long way there's always there's always work to be done it's so important to define it though and the standards right and this is this is the lack of conversation i see happening now is lack of definition you know i feel like we're ghost hunting oftentimes and so it's so important to understand what we mean by equality in a philosophical sense so that we actually know what we're striving for yep no i appreciate your saying that i mean i think that was really what motivated me to write the book was this real frustration about the way in which it often felt that people were sparring over boogeymen you know um that there was some words being banned about but nobody actually knew what they meant and labels slapped on people um again mainly for the point of demonizing and this went both directions both sides sort of um to each other so yes i wanted to lay out space for careful thought and i also you know our our foundation rests on the linkages between freedom and equality the fact that these are mutually reinforcing ideas and it was astonishing to me that we had gotten ourselves to a place in our country where we thought we had to pick between freedom and equality as if you were for freedom you couldn't be for equality and as if you were for equality you could be for freedom and you know this sort of sense of opposition had begun to track our party politics and i just found this um incomprehensible basically and so i wanted to carefully show people how freedom and equality belong together well yeah the case and i wanted to address that because you called it an anti-libertarian case and i actually disagree um because the case you make would not be objectionable to a libertarian i think i think the the libertarian argument and even the conservative argument yes would say that depending on how you define equality it can be at odds with freedom but if you're defining equality correctly and i think you do uh then there is no then it is not at odds with freedom and in fact we would agree with you that it is necessary for it is a necessary foundation uh for freedom because if you don't have these tenants of equality well then the the obvious i think the obvious outcome of that would be that somebody infringes on your freedom yeah yeah no i agree i appreciate that thank you for saying that and i take the point and i think then um you know maybe it is my uh not having seen the places where that view was articulated um from a libertarian perspective um and if it's out there that'd be great to have that lifted up where libertarians are explaining the place of equality in their uh framework um because i think it'll be beneficial for all of us to be able to see that yeah i okay i can send you a bunch of stuff i don't know it's um i i when they they mean equity i think you know they they mean everybody gets the same thing i mean they they mean they mean we're going to to try and and take from one group and give to another they they view that as an infringement on freedom um for the sake of making people more equal but that's i just don't think that's what you're saying here well it's true that in my book i don't address economic questions and so i think once we can see how liberty and equality are are mutually necessary for each other um when you're focused on definitions of equality that are political equality moral equality that concept of reciprocity and responsiveness that democratic approach to knowledge generation and social equality if we have agreement there then the next step is the next conversation is okay well so where does the economic picture fit in how do we talk about that um i would be in agreement um with libertarians that any effort to achieve a kind of perfect material equality in distribution is an infringement of freedom that's problematic it's problematic in other ways as well i think it is not the best way of delivering a prosperous economy for example um so i would be in agreement there but then there's another conversation to be had about well what are our goals um for the economy and i think it is reasonable to say that we do need an economy that is egalitarian in its rough results to support the other kinds of equality so that doesn't mean that you have to be using redistributive tools to achieve that i think there are other mechanisms that can make an economy more egalitarian or less egalitarian and i think for example if you look at the way george marshall thought about rebuilding european economies after world war ii he was really focused on the question of what kind of underlying economic infrastructure do you need to support um societies of free self-government and i feel like that's the question we should be collectively asking and that we haven't been asking enough yeah um it's a longer it's a longer conversation but um but but the point is and i think the point of this conversation is that the foundations the philosophical foundations have to be solid first and then you can move into that with in a reasonable way i think i think you and i probably could i i think ours i think our nation has failed to do that unfortunately and we need to get back to it we need to start to agree again on on basic definitions and and foundations but we you and i should at some point try to have a conversation about economic questions and just see where yeah let's find out where are the divergences and agreements and so forth that would be super interesting it would be you mentioned it a couple times in your book you talk about zoning laws um increased social connectedness across economic and ethnic differences um do you what do you i i i'm all about repealing zoning laws because so easy um houston doesn't have zoning laws right yeah it comes with some problems but mostly it means lower housing prices and more mixed neighborhoods you know it's it's pros and cons but it works it's you know um and one interesting thing too maybe that is what creates this increased social connectedness that you talk about um and i didn't i didn't see any like policies associated with that idea but but maybe the lack of zoning laws automatically creates that and houston also stands out as a major city um and a deep it is the most diverse city in america and it also stands out as a major city that has not seen the the kind of let's call it mayhem that has occurred throughout the country um and maybe there's reasons for that the the way people live together and and respect each other i don't know i'm sure the causality is extremely complex super interesting yep i wanted to go back to just back to the the 1770s and 1780s here um and and and to this and so just to really kind of hit this question that irks everybody again that the question of historical hypocrisy that you know the why didn't we if we were a good country why didn't we abolish slavery right away um and this is this is what's on everybody's mind right now um there's there's a couple things in your chapter if actions speak louder than words if you could lay out some of the things that they did try to do um and uh to write this wrong sure well um i mean we have to simply accept the fact that our country um has committed great wrongs right there's just actually no way around accepting that um so i think i always end up feeling slightly puzzled about the structure of um this kind of conversation so i think the harder thing is how do you love a place that has done wrong in this kind of way and um but i also think that shouldn't be hard either in the sense that we all you know you know anybody look at their extended family we all have people in our extended family who have done wrong we love them anyway right we we can love and forgive and try to redeem and i think that is basically the story here so um you know there were people already working on abolition in the 1770s as i mentioned and prince hall a free african-american in boston used the language of the declaration of independence to submit a petition to the massachusetts assembly in january of 1777 and moved abolition forward there it was achieved by the early 1780s in massachusetts also i mentioned pennsylvania vermont two vermont wasn't a state yet um in all those cases the lego to the declaration was influential and helpful to achieving that um so you know the engines of change were in gear but it was also the case that there were vast swaths of the country um where um a sort of deep kind of culture of racial superiority had taken hold and then fear about um insurrection and uprising from enslaved populations really entrenched that um i think um sometimes what we don't see is the way in which um domination so when one group dominates another is actually corrosive for the people who are doing the dominating um it makes them feel unsafe and exacerbates fear and fear is morally corrosive so we have a kind of deep um set of cultural habits that we have to uproot and move beyond and so in that regard we are collectively at work on a process of achieving transformation for all of ourselves together um that is a work work of forgiveness but it's also for confidence it has to be connected to transformation so it's not kind of forgiveness in the sense of kind of blank free past everything's okay now let's move forward we really have to i think focus on the question of social equality so for generations we focused on formal civil rights legal rights and that sort of thing and that has been fundamental but you can think of the country as having a political constitution and a social constitution we've made huge strides on the political constitution at this point i think what what we're seeing and hearing around us the voices rising up are saying our political constitution has actually gotten ahead of our social constitution our political constitution is more robust more inclusive more successful than our social constitution and it's time for us to really look into our hearts at our social constitution our basic habits of interacting with each other to see if we can build something there that lives up to what we have already built with our political constitution it and and that's the goal is to live up to the the symbol of the american flag the the union i i would call the union and uh and live up to the declaration of independence because these things are good that's exactly the right way to put the political constitution has always in america been well ahead of of social constitutions um as as you call it and i well it's hard to imagine a world where that's never the case but i mean we're always striving to get there we're striving to match those things i would actually put it slightly differently to be honest um congressman in assessment i think in the beginning i think our political constitution and our social constitution were aligned our political constitution had the compromises in it about the three-fifths clause for instance it uh treated indigenous americans as uh you know adversaries to be dealt with entirely through treaty and war structures um so the concept the political constitution actually at that moment matched up with the social constitution and we've transformed our political constitution um with the 13th 14th 15th amendments with the inclusion act giving citizenship to native americans in the early 20th century with the various acts around voting um for native americans for african-americans the civil rights act voting rights act etc um and with you know important legal decisions so we literally have um rebuilt our political constitution in ways that have moved it far away um from that original moment and so in that regard i think the question of alignment with our social constitution is more complicated i think we desire um to have a social constitution that lives up to our new the literal structure of our institutions and i think that's what we're struggling with i think it's that gap no there's not a gap between our original ideals and the present um but a gap between our renovated institutions and our social constitution yeah that's fair um do you think that i don't know how much time you have left i think we're uh running out actually maybe we'll uh want to end there but i guess do you do you think our current conversation and debate about the social constitution let's call it is healthy because it's again the thing that i that frightens me the most is there's uh in the conversation about the social constitution there's a direct backlash against the political constitution and and the meaning of america herself and i think that strikes me as inherently unhealthy um and are we are we having a healthy conversation about this at the moment because i would argue it doesn't appear that way well one of the reasons i want to make the distinction between the political constitution and the social constitution is so that people can see more clearly um what each is so for example you know there's been this big debate this year coming out of the new york times 1619 project i just wanted to say the real founding of the us was in 1619 when enslavement started um and i would say that's actually that's when the social constitution was founded but the political constitution was founded in 1776 and then 1787-88 um and so the important thing to recognize is that both of those founding moments matter and they have been aligned or not aligned in different ways over time so we can look at the political constitution now and as you pointed out with our conversation about reciprocity there are things we need to do to improve it right so there's i mean the issues of policing are real the issues of regulatory sort of arbitrariness or rigidity are real right we need to address those things in our political constitution but we can also see the way in which we have indeed transformed our political constitution and achieve something quite different from what existed in 1788 um there's our social constitution and so let's focus on that but let's let's be able to have separate judgments about the political constitution and the social constitution that's why for me those that distinction between the two is so important it's a great way to put it i'm gonna use that uh from now on um to try and explain this because i think it is the right way to put it um it's it's it's why leaders like frederick douglass and martin luther king they they looked to and frederick douglass said this he called the us constitution and the declaration of independence these glorious liberty documents that you are not living up to and the social constitution was not was not catching up to the political side and and your hypocrites were for not living up to it and that was his that was his declaration and but but he in in doing that and martin luther king in the same way as he said i have a dream that all men are created equal that we're actually living up to these rights that that are that our social side actually actually catches up well in that case the political side as well i mean they were both catching up to the promises of of the founding documents and we have to wrap ourselves in that correct american story you know the american story was was was written as an ideal that we have to live up to but to tear down that ideal i think is is is the complete wrong approach um and i think i think talking about the way you do i think is it does click so there's a sense of clarification there that i think is is rather useful and as as you've noted there's different strands of history and it's maybe we simplify it all a little way too much i think that's right i mean i think we do desperately need a shared history and that history needs to be simultaneously honest and empowering and uh one of the things it needs to be empowering of is our broad collective mutual commitment to one another and to american constitutional democracy that's a great place to end dr danielle allen thank you so much for being on and i hope everybody enjoys that extremely important discussion on this extremely important day on an extremely important document so thank you so much thank you congressman very good to speak with you

America I'd like to give you an update on the Social Security Fairness Act this is our bill to repeal the windfall elimination provision the WEP and the government pension offset of the GPO these programs unfairly penalize more than 2 million Americans stopping them from collecting their full Social Security benefits I've been a co-sponsor of this bill for six years since 2017. in July of this year we crossed a 290 co-sponsored threshold that moves the bill onto What's called the consensus calendar meaning it would have to be brought to the house floor within a set period of legislative days those are the rules however in recent weeks speaker Pelosi and house Democrats used a procedural tool to stop the clock and delay the bill from coming to a vote we have over 300 co-sponsors on the Social Security Fairness Act it takes 218 votes for a bill to pass the House of Representatives it's not right that speaker Pelosi continues to block this bill from moving forward if you've paid into Social Security you should be able to collect your fair share when the time comes too many of our seniors are beautiful elders or being financially injured by the GPO and the WEP this Injustice must be corrected and our bill does exactly that with only a few weeks of legislative business left in this Congress there's no time to delay speaker Pelosi we demand that you schedule the bill now it's time to vote

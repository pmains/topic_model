you thank you mr chairman and again building off what some of the others have said about this uh i think if the single most important priority for congress should be this widespread vaccination but and what we had to do before it was a three-step process one was to develop a vaccine two was to get the shots in people's arms and thirdly as a result we could open our economy and bring kids back to school but i want to just focus about schools for a moment because according to the mckinsey report students unfortunately are falling behind academically and but that's not all that's not the end of the story i'm talking to educators they've told us about the fact that their kids across this country are not getting their meals abuse neglect according to the american academy of pediatricians and the mental well-being missing out on their peer involvement with them is there in fact over the last week we talked with steve woodring he's the preston county superintendent of west virginia and president of the association of schools uh school administrators and he said during this pandemic he said we're missing some kids we have no idea where they are and we have a principal in one of the counties that actually is going door to door to check base touch base with the kids find out how the families are doing with it just yesterday we spoke with the college's universities in west virginia and they said they're planning this fall to have a remedial classes because they know that the kids are falling behind academically as a result of this so again mr chairman vaccination is the key west virginia is doing its part where western is ranked second in the country uh uh public broadcasting pbs just put out a report yesterday that said we're now up to 15 percent of our population has been vaccinated and we're 90 of our utilization of the drugs that we've been getting unfortunately that's not the way it is across the country a lot of the other states are not they're struggling to attain this widespread vaccination and maybe we're confusing them because the message we're sending from congress is that uh we want to address a political wish list i don't understand that we should be addressing primarily just getting our kids vaccinated so again i'm going to reinforce it our goal should be mr chairman get our kids back in the classrooms and opening up our economy it's not that complicated but we've put unfortunately we've allowed politics to come into this and we're putting this political wish list and causing us not to be able to we work on a bipartisan manner

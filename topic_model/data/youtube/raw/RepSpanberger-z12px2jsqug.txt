HELLO EVERYONE, I'M ABIGAIL
  SPANBERGER AND I AM THE U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR VIRGINIA'S
7TH DISTRICT, AND I WORK HERE AT CAPITOL HILL. I AM SO EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO
GIVE YOU ALL A VIRTUAL TOUR   LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY, AND
OF THE BUILDING, SHARE A
TALK ABOUT MY PRIORITIES. ONE OF
MY FAVORITE THINGS WORKING HERE IS TO BE ABLE TO
WELCOME 7TH DISTRICT CONSTITUENTS TO CAPITOL HILL. BUT I KNOW THAT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INDIVIDUALS,
STUDENTS, FAMILIES ARE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO
MAKE IT TO CAPITOL HILL. SO TODAY, I'M GONNA SHOW
YOU AROUND, TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY
OF THIS RICH HISTORICAL SITE — THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL —
TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT MY JOB REPRESENTING
YOU, AND SHARE SOME PRIORITIES.
SO THANKS FOR JOINING! FOR MORE THAN 200 YEARS, THE
BUILDING BEHIND ME HAS BEEN THE CENTER OF OUR
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF
GOVERNMENT — THE UNITED  STATES HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE
UNITED STATES SENATE. THIS
IS WHERE WE MEET TO DEBATE LAWS, TO WRITE LAWS,
TO PASS LAWS, AND TO DO THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNING. ORIGINALLY THIS LAND WAS A
WOODED SITE. AND IN 1791, PRESIDENT GEORGE WASHINGTON
AUTHORIZED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL. AND THE CAPITOL WAS BUILT
PREDOMINANTLY BY THE FORCED
WORK OF ENSLAVED LABORERS. TODAY THIS BUILDING AND THE
BUILDINGS AROUND IT OCCUPY BUILDINGS, THE CAPITOL
58 ACRES OF OFFICE COMPLEX AND GARDENS. THESE ARE THE STEPS WHERE
ABRAHAM LINCOLN GAVE HIS
SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS, AND AT THE TIME, HE SOUGHT TO
BRING TOGETHER A DIVIDED
NATION AND FROM THESE STEPS HE
FAMOUSLY SAID: "WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE, WITH CHARITY FOR ALL." AT THE TOP OF THE CAPITOL SITS
THE STATUE OF FREEDOM. SHE WEIGHS 15,000 POUNDS
AND FACES EAST. SO NOW LET'S HEAD INSIDE FOR A
TOUR OF THE CAPITOL COMPLEX. BEHIND ME IS THE CAPITOL
VISITOR CENTER. THIS IS THE
MOST RECENT COMPLEX, AND THIS WAS BUILT TO
ADDITION TO THE CAPITOL ACCOMMODATE GROWING NUMBERS OF
TOURISTS COMING HERE TO CAPITOL HILL. INSIDE THERE'S A MUSEUM WITH
AN INTERPRETIVE EXHIBIT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS CAPITOL
SPACE, AND HISTORY OF THE
BILLS AND LEGISLATION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED HERE IN
OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. ADDITIONALLY, THERE'S TUNNELS
THAT CAN LEAD YOU TO THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS,
WHICH IS JUST ACROSS THE WAY. THERE'S ALSO CAFETERIAS AND
GIFT SHOPS, SO YOU CAN BRING SOME GIFTS
BACK HOME TO REMEMBER YOUR TIME HERE ON
CAPITOL HILL. EVERY STATE SENDS TWO STATUES
TO THE CAPITOL. THIS ONE OF KING KAMEHAMEHA
OF HAWAII IS THE TALLEST OF ALL THE
STATUES HERE AT THE CAPITOL COMPLEX. THIS PLASTER CAST WAS USED TO
CREATE THE BRONZE STATUE OF FREEDOM THAT SITS ATOP THE
UNITED STATES CAPITOL DOME. THIS CAST SAT IN STORAGE FOR
MANY YEARS BEFORE BEING RESTORED IN 1992. IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUT ON DISPLAY IN THE RUSSELL SENATE
OFFICE BUILDING BEFORE BEING BROUGHT OVER HERE TO THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER. THIS IS THE CAPITOL CRYPT. AND DESPITE ITS INTIMIDATING
NAME, NOBODY IS BURIED HERE. THE ORIGINAL PLANS INTENDED FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE
WASHINGTON AND MARTHA
WASHINGTON TO BE ENTOMBED UNDER THIS VERY
PLACE, THOUGH ULTIMATELY THEY WERE
LAID TO REST AT MOUNT VERNON, PER GEORGE WASHINGTON'S
PERSONAL PREFERENCES. IN THE CAPITOL CRYPT, HOWEVER,
THERE ARE STATUES FROM ALL 13 OF THE ORIGINAL COLONIES. AND I'M EXCITED THAT SOON, VIRGINIA WILL
BE REPRESENTED HERE WITH A STATUE
OF BARBARA JOHNS. BARBARA JOHNS WAS A CIVIL
RIGHTS LEADER. AND IN FACT, IN 1951, AT JUST 16 YEARS OLD, BARBARA JOHNS LED A PROTEST OF
450 STUDENTS AT HER SCHOOL, PROTESTING THE POOR CONDITIONS
THAT STUDENTS FACED IN THEIR ALL-BLACK SCHOOL. HER CASE WAS FOLDED
INTO THE BROWN V. BOARD
OF EDUCATION SUPREME COURT CASE, WHICH
ULTIMATELY RULED THAT WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
SEGREGATED SCHOOLS I'M EXCITED FOR THE DAY WHEN
HER STATUE COMES HERE TO REPRESENT
VIRGINIA. AND IF YOU LOOK
RIGHT HERE, THIS STAR IS THE POINT FROM WHICH ALL STREETS IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. ORIGINALLY WERE
SPACED OUT, PER AN ORIGINAL PLAN BY THE
ARCHITECT, MONSIEUR L'ENFANT. EACH STREET WAS NUMBERED AND
ORDERED COMING FROM THIS EXACT
LOCATION. THIS RIGHT HERE IS A REPLICA
OF THE MAGNA CARTA — THE
DOCUMENT THAT WAS CREATED IN 1215, THAT REALLY LAID THE
FOUNDATION FOR WHAT WOULD
ULTIMATELY BE THE IDEALS OF OUR UNITED
STATES CONSTITUTION. AS SOMEONE WHO
HAS SWORN AN OATH TO UPHOLD AND DEFEND THE
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT MY
CAREER, I AM ALWAYS
PARTICULARLY PROUD TO THINK ABOUT ITS
ORIGINAL BEGINNINGS. THIS REPLICA OF THE MAGNA
CARTA WAS GIVEN TO THE UNITED
STATES AS A GIFT BY ENGLAND, TO MARK
OUR BICENTENNIAL — OUR 200TH ANNIVERSARY AS A
NATION. AND NOTABLY, WE CERTAINLY HAVE
COME A LONG WAY IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR FRIEND
AND ALLY, THE UNITED KINGDOM, SINCE WE ORIGINALLY DECLARED
OUR INDEPENDENCE — AND
CERTAINLY SINCE THE BRITISH TRIED TO
BURN THIS BUILDING TO THE
GROUND. SO WE JUST LEFT THE CRYPT, AND
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU THESE STAIRS — BECAUSE THESE ARE THE
STAIRS, EVERY FOUR YEARS ON INAUGURATION DAY,
THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT WALK
DOWN THESE STAIRS AND GO OUT TO FACE THE MALL,
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BEFORE SWEARING A OATH OF THE PRESIDENCY AND VICE
PRESIDENCY. HERE WE ARE IN THE ROTUNDA. THIS CIRCULAR ROOM IS AT THE
CENTER OF THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL, AND IT CONNECTS THE
UNITED STATES SENATE WITH THE UNITED STATES HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES. YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THIS ROOM FROM WHEN A PRESIDENT
PASSES AWAY. ELEVEN FORMER PRESIDENTS OF
THE UNITED STATES HAVE LAIN IN STATE HERE IN THE
CAPITOL ROTUNDA, AS WELL AS FORMER
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN, AND ROSA PARKS. HERE IN THE ROTUNDA THERE ARE
EIGHT PAINTINGS AROUND THIS ROOM. FOUR OF THEM WERE
CREATED BY ARTIST JOHN
TRUMBULL, AND HE WAS AN AIDE-DE-CAMP OF
GEORGE WASHINGTON DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. THEY'RE ALL ABOUT
12 FEET HIGH. BUT HERE IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ONES — THIS IS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THIS PAINTING MAY LOOK
FAMILIAR TO YOU BECAUSE IT IS FOUND ON THE
BACK OF THE $2 BILL. ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE PAINTINGS
BY JOHN TRUMBULL IS THIS ONE. IT DEPICTS GEORGE WASHINGTON
RESIGNING HIS COMMISSION AS COMMANDER OF THE
CONTINENTAL ARMY IN 1783. THIS IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE IT
SET THE PRECEDENT THAT IN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, WE WOULD BE LED BY THE PEOPLE — OR TYRANT WITH COMPLETE POWER.
THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE A KING AND THIS SET US APART FROM JULIUS CAESAR, FROM NAPOLEON, AND FROM THE
PRECEDENT THAT WAS SEEN THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE WORLD. THERE ARE MANY STATUES
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL, AND HERE IN
THE ROTUNDA, BUT THIS ONE IS AMONG MY
VERY FAVORITES. IT'S CALLED THE PORTRAIT
MONUMENT TO LUCRETIA MOTT, ELIZABETH CADY STANTON AND SUSAN B. ANTHONY. THIS WAS DEDICATED FOR
SUSAN B. ANTHONY'S 101ST BIRTHDAY, BACK IN 1921. AND YOU'LL NOTE IN THE BACK
THERE APPEARS TO BE AN UNFINISHED BUST. THERE'S A
LOT OF STORIES ABOUT WHAT THAT PIECE IS SUPPOSED TO BE — IS
IT SUPPOSED TO BE MODELED INTO A WOMAN IN THE FUTURE WHO MAY TAKE HIGHEST OFFICE? OR IS IT SUPPOSED TO
MERELY REPRESENT THE FUTURE, AND ALL THAT
WOMEN ARE AND HAVE BEEN IN OUR SOCIETY? IF YOU ASK ANYBODY HERE
AROUND CAPITOL HILL — EVERYBODY'S GOT A
DIFFERENT STORY — BUT
CERTAINLY THIS STATUE IS ONE THAT ALWAYS
KEEPS PEOPLE TALKING. HERE IN THE ROTUNDA, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IS IF YOU LOOK UP. AT THE TOP OF THE ROTUNDA YOU WILL SEE A PAINTING CALLED "THE APOTHEOSIS
OF WASHINGTON." AND THIS IS A PAINTING THAT
WAS CREATED BY CONSTANTINO
BRUMIDI. HE WAS AN IMMIGRANT FROM ITALY
WHO CAME TO THE UNITED STATES IN 1852. BACK IN ITALY, HE
HAD PAINTED AT THE VATICAN AND HERE HE PAINTED AT THE
UNITED STATES CAPITOL. IN THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL,
JUST OFF THE ROTUNDA, THERE IS A MEMORIAL TO THOSE
WHO DIED ON FLIGHT 93 ON SEPTEMBER 11TH, 2001. IT'S BROADLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE HIJACKERS OF FLIGHT
93 INTENDED TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL. AND THE BRAVE PASSENGERS
JOINED TOGETHER TO AVERT THAT DISASTER,
SACRIFICING THEIR OWN LIVES. HERE IN THE ROTUNDA,
THERE IS A STATUE OF PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN. AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
ABOUT THIS STATUTE IS THERE'S PART OF THE BERLIN WALL EMBEDDED IN THE BASE OF THE STATUE. NOW IN 1987, RONALD REAGAN
FAMOUSLY POINTED TO THE BERLIN WALL AND SAID: "MISTER GORBACHEV, TEAR
DOWN THIS WALL." HERE IN THE ROTUNDA, VIRGINIA
HAS TWO STATUES — GEORGE WASHINGTON, AND THOMAS JEFFERSON. AND IF YOU HEAD RIGHT
DOWN THIS HALL, STRAIGHT AT THE END IS THE
ENTRANCE TO THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. HERE, WE'RE IN NATIONAL
STATUARY HALL, ALSO CALLED THE OLD
HALL OF THE HOUSE. IT WAS HERE, FROM
1807 TO 1857, THAT MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES MET. THEIR DESKS WERE LINED
UP IN THIS SPACE, AND THIS IS WHERE THEY MET, DEBATED LAWS, AND VOTED. PRESIDENTS LIKE ABRAHAM
LINCOLN SERVED IN THIS VERY
VERY SPACE. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST
EXAMPLES OF GREEK REVIVAL ARCHITECTURE — IT WAS
BUILT TO RESEMBLE AN AMPHITHEATER. IN
FACT, WHEN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MET
IN THIS SPACE THE PUBLIC SAT UP THERE, AND
WERE ABLE TO SEE THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE HAPPENING HERE. HERE IN STATUARY HALL IS A
STATUE OF ROSA PARKS. THIS STATUE IS 9 FEET TALL, AND IT DEPICTS ROSA PARKS WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES
THAT SHE WAS WEARING ON THE DAY WHEN SHE DECIDED, IN PROTEST, TO NOT
GIVE UP HER SEAT TO A WHITE PASSENGER ON A BUS. ROSA PARKS IS AN ICON IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND TO SEE HER DEPICTED SEATED, DIGNIFIED, STRONG, IS A BEAUTIFUL WAY TO REMEMBER
HER IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. THIS IS THE CHAMBER OF THE
UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND IT IS ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ROOMS IN OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS WHERE I CAST MY VOTES
ON BEHALF OF VIRGINIA'S 7TH DISTRICT ALONGSIDE MY
COLLEAGUES FROM DISTRICTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS IS WHERE WE DEBATE AND PASS LAWS, AND THIS IS
WHERE MUCH OF THE WORK OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
GETS DONE. YOU MIGHT ALSO RECOGNIZE THIS
CHAMBER AS THE LARGE ROOM
WHERE THE STATE OF THE UNION
TAKES PLACE. THE HOUSE CHAMBER
IS LARGE ENOUGH TO FIT OFFICIALS FROM ALL THREE
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. ABOVE THE CHAMBER THERE IS A
PUBLIC GALLERY WHERE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND
THE PRESS CORPS CAN WATCH DEMOCRACY AT WORK, IN PERSON. THE UNITED STATES SENATE HAS A
SPACE VERY SIMILAR TO OUR HOUSE CHAMBER. AND THE SENATE CHAMBER IS A SLIGHTLY SMALLER ROOM, WHERE IT ACCOMODATES 100
MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, WHERE THEY DEBATE
LAWS, RATIFY TREATIES AND
APPROVE PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENTS. THIS CHAMBER ALSO HOSTS JOINT
SESSIONS OF CONGRESS. THAT'S WHEN MEMBERS OF THE
HOUSE AND THE SENATE COME TOGETHER. AND ONE OF THE MOST
FAMOUS JOINT SESSIONS HELD IN THIS CHAMBER WAS ON DECEMBER
8TH, 1941, WHEN PRESIDENT FRANKLIN
D. ROOSEVELT DELIVERED HIS "DAY THAT WILL
LIVE IN INFAMY" SPEECH JUST ONE DAY AFTER JAPAN'S ATTACK
ON PEARL HARBOR. CONGRESS PASSED A DECLARATION
OF WAR ONLY A FEW HOURS LATER, AND THE UNITED STATES HAD THUS
ENTERED THE SECOND WORLD WAR. ROOSEVELT: "DECEMBER 7TH, 1941, A DATE WHICH WILL LIVE IN INFAMY." THIS ROOM HOLDS A LOT
OF HISTORY. ANOTHER THING ABOUT THE SPACE
IS THAT WE HAVE THE PRESS
CORPS THAT SITS IN THE GALLERY WHILE
WE'RE DOING OUR BUSINESS AND
OUR WORK — BUT ALSO IS
IN HALLS OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE FLOOR, OUTSIDE
THE HOUSE CHAMBER. I AM PROUD THAT THE CAPITOL
CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN STRONG ACCESS FOR NEWSPAPER, RADIO
AND TELEVISION REPORTERS. WHEN I'M WALKING TO VOTES, AND BACK-AND-FORTH BETWEEN MY
OFFICE BUILDING AND THE
CAPITOL, I FREQUENTLY WALK IN
THIS HALLWAY. AND ALONG THE WALLS YOU'LL SEE
THERE'S ART FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EACH
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IS
REPRESENTED BY PIECES OF ART SUBMITTED THROUGH THE CONGRESSIONAL
ART COMPETITION. RIGHT HERE, IN THE GOLD FRAME,
YOU SEE "THE GOLDEN GODDESS" — WHICH WAS SUBMITTED BY A HIGH
SCHOOL STUDENT FROM MANCHESTER HIGH SCHOOL IN
CHESTERFIELD COUNTY. WE ARE STANDING OUTSIDE OF THE
OFFICE OF THE 7TH DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA. HERE IN THE
LONGWORTH OFFICE BUILDING, OUR OFFICE IS IN 1431 — THAT'S
ON THE 4TH FLOOR OF THE LONGWORTH
OFFICE BUILDING. THE LONGWORTH OFFICE BUILDING
IS ONE OF THREE HOUSE OFFICE BUILDINGS — WE'VE GOT RAYBURN
AND CANON AS WELL. THE LONGWORTH BUILDING IS
NAMED AFTER SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE NICHOLAS LONGWORTH, WHO
INTERESTINGLY WAS ALSO THE SON-IN-LAW OF
THEODORE ROOSEVELT. WE ARE IN MY OFFICE IN THE
LONGWORTH HOUSE OFFICE
BUILDING. THIS IS WHERE I DO MY WORK
WHEN I'M HERE ON CAPITOL HILL, AND ON EITHER SIDE WE'VE GOT
THE OFFICE SPACE FOR THE REST OF OUR STAFF. HERE ON CAPITOL
HILL WE HAVE OUR TEAM THAT'S FOCUSED ON LEGISLATION — SO SPEAKING WITH CONSTITUENTS
RIGHT ALONGSIDE ME, DRAFTING UP BILL IDEAS, WORKING WITH LEGISLATIVE
COUNSEL, SO THOSE ARE THE ATTORNEYS WHO WRITE
THE FINAL LEGAL TEXT... AND WORKING WITH OTHER OFFICES
TO TRY AND FIND OTHER OFFICES THAT WANT TO CO-LEAD AND
SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION THAT I'M WORKING ON. WE ALSO HAVE A TEAM THAT'S IN
CHARGE WITH COMMUNICATING WITH YOU CONSTITUENTS ACROSS
THE DISTRICT, PUSHING OUT A NEWSLETTER EVERY WEEK AND
ENSURING THAT YOU ALL KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE ON
CAPITOL HILL. IN RICHMOND, AND IN HENRICO
COUNTY IN SPOTSYLVANIA, WE
HAVE TWO OFFICES WHERE OUR
CONSTITUENT SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES WORK. AND THOSE ARE THE FOLKS WHO
ENGAGE WITH CONSTITUENTS IN SUPPORT OF ANY CHALLENGES
THEY MAY BE FACING WITH A FEDERAL AGENCY. SO YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW WHO
LIVES IN THE DISTRICT CAN ALWAYS BE IN TOUCH WITH OUR
OFFICE IF YOU'RE HAVING ANY CHALLENGES WITH FEDERAL
AGENCIES. IN THE OFFICE, WE HAVE A
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WALL
HANGINGS THAT REMIND US OF THE
PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS A
PICTURE THAT MY DAUGHTER DREW THAT SAYS
"PATRIOTISM," AND IT HAS A
HEART WITH THE UNITED STATES. AND HEART-PLUS-UNITED STATES
EQUALS PATRIOTISM. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD REMINDER
ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ON OUR HALL, WE HAVE MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU CAN SEE EACH
OFFICE IS MARKED BY THE FLAGS
OF THE INDIVIDUAL STATES. AND WALKING DOWN THIS HALL
WE HAVE WISCONSIN, IOWA, VIRGINIA, NEW MEXICO,
MINNESOTA AND SOUTH CAROLINA. WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED AND
ARRIVED AT MY OFFICE ON
CAPITOL HILL, WE WANTED A WAY TO
ENSURE THAT OUR DISTRICT WAS REPRESENTED, AND OUR WALLS ARE
DECORATED. SO WE LAUNCHED A PHOTO CONTEST,
AND THESE PHOTOS THAT ARE FOUND THROUGHOUT OUR
OFFICE ARE A RESULT OF THAT CONTEST. WE HAD PEOPLE FROM
ACROSS OUR TEN COUNTIES SENDING BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHY, MAKING CLEAR THAT AT
ANY TIME OF YEAR VIRGINIA'S 7TH DISTRICT IS AN
AMAZING PLACE TO LIVE. CONGRESS FIRST MET IN THE
UNITED STATES CAPITOL IN 1800, AND I HOPE THAT WE
CONTINUE TO MEET HERE LONG INTO THE FUTURE. I HOPE THIS TOUR HAS BEEN
INFORMATIVE AND INTERESTING
FOR YOU, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A
TIME WHEN WE CAN WELCOME YOU TO THE CAPITOL COMPLEX. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

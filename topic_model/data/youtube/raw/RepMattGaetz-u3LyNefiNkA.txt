well the mother investigation sure knows how to make a splash she heard nothing from them for months and then BAM one morning there and seen them with guns a week ago before dawn an army of rifle and flashbang toting federal agents descended on the home of poor Roger stone they dragged him away barefoot the crime that justified this military-style capture of a 66 year old man lying to Congress but wait a second people lie to Congress all the time we live here we can tell you that and almost none of them ever get charged with anything should that change congressman Matt gates represents the state of Florida and he joins us thank congressman am i imagining this or is lying to Congress as common as the Sun rising is anyone ever happens daily yeah I thought Robert Muller was supposed to be investigating Russia collusion now he's become a glorified hall monitor enforcing the provisions of lying to Congress the problem Tucker is that he's enforcing them unequally and so I'm introducing the justice for all act which would create criminal referrals for the other people that we know have lied to Congress Hillary Clinton said that she didn't send a receive any classified email we know that's a lie Jim Comey said he was never the source or never the director of leaked information he later admitted that that was not true even though it was the subject of his sworn testimony before Congress and you'll remember clapper told all the American people before Congress that there was no bulk collection of data the Deputy Director of the FBI mr. mchabe he lied four times he lied so frequently he was demoted and referred for criminal prosecution but a whole lot of these other people haven't been and it's the it's the greatest evidence that Robert Muller is not a person in search of the truth he's out to get Trump and the people close to Trump because if he wasn't if he was unbiased you would have seen similar charges brought against other these other people instead he sends it army bigger than the force that killed bin Laden to go chase down Roger stone in Fort Lauderdale amazing so you're gonna for all that to the Department of Justice I hope you will come back and tell us what happens by the way I think that I'd be deeply revealing congressman Matt Gaetz afforda good to see you

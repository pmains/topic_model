Congressman Jim Clyburn the third ranking Democrat in the House and of course a an activist in the civil rights movement one of the heroes of that movement congressman thank you very much for being with us your reaction to the president's comments yesterday looks like you very much for having me you know Andrea on yesterday I think the president brought this country to the brink of a seminal moment I really believe that if we are a government made up of three co-equal branches of government I think it's time for the Congress to step up and into the gap so to speak the president has created a social gap in this country we are having some economic gaps widened in this country it's time for the yardsticks Congress to step into that I think that speaker Ryan and leader Pelosi I think the Senators McConnell and Schumer need to assemble their leadership teams right away and let's begin to develop some by Protestant approaches to solving some of these problems there are four things we need to do right away number one we ought to raise the debt limit we've got to do that The Full Faith and Credit of the United States of America is at stake we ought to do that and I don't think it has to be a clean bill it should be bipartisan and it should not be controversial so let's do that and then let's work together in a bipartisan way three big pieces of legislation number one let's do what is necessary to fix the Affordable Care Act there is a problem with the Affordable Care Act and we all know that so let's work together in a bipartisan way and fix it solve it number two we ought to work together to reform our tax code not necessarily pro-business or anti label for the tax code there will be pro-growth Perle American and third let's do something about our infrastructure and do it in a bipartisan way to help create jobs in America infrastructure is more than roads and bridges it ought to be about water and sewer it's only about broadband development and let's do this in a way that Congress would improve itself to be representative of the people when there is a failure and we do have a failure in the executive branch of the government it's time for the other two branches to step up and Congress needs to step up and our judiciary need to step up and let's do what it's necessary to restore people's faith and confidence in this great country of ours it is at the brink of disaster and we all step back from the brink and you're basically saying congressman let's ignore the White House because it's not rising to the level of leadership here to the contrary in fact we're told that the president had no real planning on infrastructure that there's nothing legislatively coming through the White House to the hill that's exactly what I'm saying we have three co-equal branches of government and everybody can see on yesterday that there's a total disaster in the executive branch but the Congress is representative the people the House of Representatives we call ourselves all the time house for the sign for us to step up and demonstrate that we are in fact the people's house I'm no speaker Ryan I like him a whole lot we have worked together he has put our 10-20-30 formula into 14 pieces of the Republicans Appropriations bill that's a way of getting funding into low-income communities and that's the kind of thing that we've got to do we can have an infrastructure bill that put this formula in place so low-income communities can be a part of this significant recovery that that's going good for Wall Street let's do something about infrastructure let's do something about what I like to call a fair tax bill not a tax bill that's going to give unusual the high breaks to upper income people but a tax code that will be fair to everybody that we'd be pro-growth for business and pro-growth for America's families we can do that it's been done before and so let's just work together in the bipartisan way and get that done because this president has modulized himself in such a way that I don't think there isn't and they come back for him there is no way that he is going to be able to revive himself and be of any real good going forward congressman james Clyburn with a call to action by Congress thank you so much thank you very much for being with us thank you so much for her

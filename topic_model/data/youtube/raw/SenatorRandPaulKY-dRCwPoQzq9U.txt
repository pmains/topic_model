joining me now to further discuss the penning impeachment trial is senator rand paul of kentucky hi senator thanks for joining us no problem thanks for having me so first off you introduce this resolution it calls the impeachment of former president unconstitutional some of your democratic colleagues have argued otherwise why do you think it's best to table this whole impeachment trial well the thing is is we argued that it's unconstitutional to impeach a private citizen so the constitution says that you can impeach and you can disqualify someone from holding office but you have to start by impeaching them first if they're not in office how do you impeach them so i don't think our founder father has ever intended that this be used against a private citizen also if they can impeach the president could they impeach other private citizens could we impeach fdr i have a friend who wants to impeach fdr now so i mean it becomes ludicrous if we do this but the reason i wanted to test the vote early on is i felt that there was a strong sentiment in the republican caucus that this was unconstitutional so we got 45 votes we only need 34 votes to acquit the president we got 45 today so there's more than enough votes the impeachment's dead on arrival so we can get back to business now they're going to have a charade of a trial but there's no reason for the nation to pay much attention to this now because by our vote today we show that the impeachment is over and it was a bad idea idea to begin with it's not a way to bring the country together and so i've told the democrats all along they're just dividing the country they're also messing up things for their president they elected biden if they want to do something positive why are they spending time trying to kick the last president so this was a bit of dumb idea from the beginning but we showed him today they don't have the vote so everything they do from now on is theater the impeachment is over right like you said two-thirds a majority would be needed for a conviction to happen if that were to be the case although it's unlikely because it's unlikely a lot of these votes are going to get switched in the other direction what's there to gain from this process moving forward well they're going to move forward just because for them it's a political thing they can't get over their last election but they need 67 votes to convict and they got 55 today so they're not going to get anywhere near what they can and here's the other thing is i also made the argument on the floor that if this is about inciting violence look the guy that shot steve scalise at the ball field i was there nearly skilled steve kalis he was a big supporter of bernie sanders what were the democrats saying at that time they were saying that the republican health plan is that you get sick and then you die that to me like it sounds like inciting violence they're saying oh if your child has leukemia and dies it's a republican's fault why don't you go shoot them at the ball field that's what it sounds like to me but not one republican argued that bernie sanders should have been impeached or censored in fact we downplayed it because we are better people than they are but they're going to say oh the president who said go peacefully and patriotically down there and tell those people what you think about how they voted that that somehow is inciting violence or go fight for your country is somehow inciting violence this is crazy and if this is a standard they want they're gonna have to explain maxine waters inciting crowds to go attack congressmen they're gonna have to explain cory booker who said get up in their face get up in those congress people's face so there's a lot of bad language on both sides that goes around but nobody has ever said oh we take this literally and we're gonna make you responsible for people who act out and commit violence so this is a double standard and the democrats are gonna have to listen to their own words and have to decide you know they're gonna only say when republicans say go fight that it's a problem no i think this is really gonna show this this whole trial to be a partisan charade and i think democrats will come to rue the day that they decided to do this and finally senator paul i want to pivot slightly senate minority leader chuck schumer he's made it very clear that he doesn't think president trump should ever be eligible to run for office again he's vowed to make that happen on the contingency that the senate convict trump so can democrats still try to do something like this if the senate were to equip president trump and move on from that no they have to win an impeachment vote to get to this disqualification of office vote but really should a small group of democrat liberals particularly democrat liberals from new york tell the rest of the country they're not allowed to vote for somebody it seems quite presumptuous that congress thinks they should dictate to all the american people who they can choose look there'll be a big battle moving forward for the direction the republican party takes and i haven't always agreed with president trump on every issue i didn't think it was a good idea to shake the money tree and give out free money to people so i've had my disagreements but i will not let the democrats take this and sort of make the president into a scapegoat and say oh you can never run for office republican party can decide who they want in four years but we're not gonna let the democrats dictate who can run for our for our side all right kentucky senator rand paul speaking with us about the impeachment trial and what's next thanks so much for your time we appreciate it thank you

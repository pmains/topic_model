um one thing i wanted to bring up uh and i mentioned this up in my opening statement uh uh the jira program the agency noted that 10.3 million legacy diesel fleet engines are still in use also in the report the epa estimated over 1 million of the oldest and dirtiest diesel engines will still remain in use until 2030. the inland empire in california where where i live was part of the south coast air quality district which i talked about before which has been in the non-attainment for ozone for about as long as the federal standard for ozone has existed but it's not for a lack of trying uh you know as i mentioned we have been regulating air quality longer than any other area on the planet and implementing some of the most stringent air pollution control measures we've done all we can do pretty much to reduce emissions from stationary sources our issue is the amount of cars and trucks and you mentioned mobile sources that's that's the problem and we also have two of the largest port facilities in the united states a port of la and the port of long beach which is responsible for 40 of all u.s container cargo uh in the united states these containers are loaded onto trucks which didn't travel through my district to the rest of the country so mobile sources contribute to about 80 percent of the air quality in the south coast region of course you know that part of california i think there's about 20 some 26 27 million people who live in the los angeles basin we've made significant progress in improving air quality however largely due to the topography large volume of transportation occurs in and around the empire we need some additional resources can you make to make those improvements that's why we fund the targeted air shed grant program provide additional resources to areas across the nation that need help to meet air quality standards the same true for dira grants and as i mentioned in my opening statement i appreciated the announcement with flexibility for implementation of the 2015 ozo standard because communities are just starting to work to meet the 2008 standards the fiscal year 2017 omnibus directed epa to send a report to congress regarding administrative options for regulatory relief as states and communities attempt to comply with both the 2008 and 2015 standards in response epa has convened a task force as you mentioned to examine what options may be available so my question real quickly is in your opinion how can we accelerate the process for some of these communities to reach their attainment goals well i do want to address dira for a second i think it's a very important program the gao has found a duplication with a across federal agencies and the mission behind duro is right and we believe it should be funded and i think this uh this committee should give direction on how it should be funded that we are committed to that dura program and believe it's important however you choose to to achieve that with respect to how do we improve attainment i mean i think a lot of it uh mr chairman uh is restoring that that joint cooperation uh through compliance and assistance uh equipping those at the local level to achieve better outcomes but i do think some of it may be legislative i do really believe that uh addressing some of the issues we talked about earlier with ozone is something that this body ought to consider but air attainment on our next program is some of the best work we can do as a nation to to impact health outcomes and it should be absolute priority of our agency working with congress to achieve those outcomes thank you

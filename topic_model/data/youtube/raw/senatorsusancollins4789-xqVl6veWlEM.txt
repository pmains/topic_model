mr. secretary I'm very concerned that sequestration those indiscriminate automatic cuts are going to kick back in in 2016 if we don't act we have a two-year reprieve but in fact the Budget Control Act calls for those draconian cuts to resume in 2016 there are two issues that I want to raise with you about the impact of those automatic cuts known as sequestration and the first follows up with the point about the efficiencies that you achieve if you have multi-year contracts right now we're looking at a tension by for the ddg 51 class of destroyers over 10 it's a 10 ship by and that ten ships by actually saves the Navy some 1.5 billion dollars is that correct that's absolutely correct and so that's essentially allowing us to get an extra destroyer for free if you look at it compared to buying them individually and not having the certainty of the 10th ship drop by is that correct you've identified one of the pernicious effects of sequestration that we will get it it has the potential if he kicks back in in 16 to give us fewer ships but at higher costs and that mr. chairman truly is the worst of all worlds if we don't have the certainty of the ten ship by we end up paying more per ship and getting fewer ships so I hope we'll keep that in mind and make sure that we do not allow sequestration to kick back in and undermine the savings said otherwise would occur for ship sub we really need the second and related issue has to do with the number of destroyers that could be procured right now we're scheduled to build two ddg 51 spur year through FY 15 through FY 17 yet according to the chart that gentle Greenert gave us today it sure looks to me that we would be in jeopardy of losing three of those destroyers if we have to budget at the BCA levels Admiral is am I reading your chart correctly yes under your reading it correctly and could you describe the benefits that destroyers provide that the ddg 51 in terms of their missile defense they're the real workhorse of the fleet are they not yes sir they're the premier warship surface warship of our fleet premier and if you look at the number of ships that the combatant commanders have requested how many is that well if we if we add them all off 450 is what they say they need to do the global engagement of the force now I realize that is without considering cos but I just want my colleagues to realize that the combatant commanders say that if you really fulfilled their needs and met their requirements we'd actually need 450 ships and I think that's really important for us to keep in mind as we go through these budget deliberations Thank You mr. chairman

concealed weapon unconstitutional restrictive joining us now to discuss this and with the implications on not only new york but six other states former greenberg florida congressman michael waltz who we used to pay you to carry a gun in new york they're saying you have a second amendment right how big a deal is this well it's a huge deal brian i think people need to understand the laws went in place back in like 1911 and they were intended to keep people of color from having easy access to guns uh back then so we actually actually have left-leaning uh minority representation group saying look this is actually a win for people to be able to get their concealed carry license and protect themselves particularly with crime spiking all over the nation and spiking in underserved neighborhoods senate's come up with a bipartisan bill they've gotten 15 senators to vote on it on gun some type of gun legislation first time since 1993 a lot of it i think you agree with more money for social services more money for mental health more money for school security yeah uh but i imagine you have seemed to have a problem with the red flag law and how it's implicated how do we do that and stop the next attack before it happens yeah so i could get behind all those other issues hardening of schools and and addressing mental health but i could not get behind a blank check out to states like massachusetts new york california to go after people's second amendment rights and basically back door it through these red flag laws you have to have due process brian has to come from law enforcement has to go to a judge and people have to be able to make their case not someone's ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend that just lobbies out some type of accusation with it congressman what are you doing in florida didn't you guys have more restrictive laws yeah in florida actually all of those due process pieces are in place but the problem with the federal legislation is it just literally sends checks out to the states and and i'm not confident states like massachusetts or california will protect people's right to defend themselves the other major uh the other major story is abortion president united states has spoken about it roe v wade is overturned yeah i saw that you tweeted you obviously in support of this the president went out of his way to blame the three supreme court justices that donald trump put in place your thoughts on that yeah of course he's going to do anything he can to link everything he can to to donald trump but at the end of the day i think it's worth repeating there is no federal law uh on abortion so roe versus wade the courts are supposed to comment on the law right and there is no law uh and and the the court totally overstepped the case i think this is the right decision uh and at the end of the day the states will get to decide right and and this is this is protecting the rights of the unborn they have rights too and brian it puts these things back in the hands of the voters if you have issue with it one way or another make your voice heard at the ballot box with your state legislators congressman uh you and i um more you you're you're the guy who fights the wars i have not taken my eye off the ball when it comes to ukrainian russia i see russia on the offensive of playing a massive toll uh in the big picture the the you want me to bring it to sanctions the sanctions on russia have not strangled that country like they should what happened yeah not at all i mean the russians are grinding away and as long as oil and gas prices are as high as they are uh as long as biden war on american energy uh is in place putin's going to have all the cash that he needs to be able to continue to pump resources into this war listen the the chinese have imported uh 50 more russian oil just the last year for every european bank that's backed away a chinese bank uh has stepped in and and the rupal the russian currency is actually in a better place now than it was pre-invasion so for all the tough talk from biden about the toughest sanctions ever they failed the russian economy has completely recovered one thing the ukraine wins one-on-one battles the artillery they lose but they're about to get a new missile system could you tell the country to tell our country what their country just got from us yeah this is a long-range rocket system that can fire it can fire upwards of 200 miles of course biden tapped the brakes on that and gave him the shorter range version of only 40 miles uh so once again he he's a dollar late and a day short in what he's providing the ukrainians but this will help it'll help them take out some russian artillery it's just can we get it to them fast enough can we get them trained up on it yeah to make a difference yeah and we were all we do want to talk about the woke-ism going on our military academies we'll have to put that for another time because of the breaking news congressman michael waltz always great thank you brian all right coming up

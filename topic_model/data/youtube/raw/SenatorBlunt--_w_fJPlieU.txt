so last week House Democrats decided again that they wouldn't have a vote to officially begin an impeachment effort so what do we have as a result of that we have a process that's going on in secret we have selective leaking without much material coming out but just a little of it coming out there are no neutral observers allowed to be part of this it's elde usually now in the Intel committee secure setting even though there's no indication that any of the information being discussed is classified no public debate on a vote no rules are set out president's lawyers aren't allowed to see the evidence or challenge evidence ranking members don't have the ability to have subpoena power now what's similar what's what's common about all of those those things in the past to impeachment efforts all of those things have been exactly the opposite in the early Federalist Papers looking at impeachment they understood that impeachment was a very vaguely defined thing in the Constitution and because of that they said that impeachment has to be public it can't be entrusted to just a few people you can't have people in this setting behind closed doors pursuing what is clearly an unfair way to pursue something as a constitutional privilege but the other privileges of responding and knowing are also there and those are not being allowed

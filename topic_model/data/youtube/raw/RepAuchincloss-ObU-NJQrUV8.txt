MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESSMAN JAKE AUCHINCLOSS SAYS HE'S CONCERNED AND AMERICANS SHOULD BE TOO. (Rep. Jake Auchincloss/(D) Massachusetts) "We're not sworn in members of Congress right now, we can't get intelligence or national security briefings. We aren't able to do any business in the house, other than the speakership votes. That means should a crisis occur, we'd be impaired in our ability to respond to it.

uh thank you mr chairman uh we are here to examine the clean future act uh but it reminds me during the vietnam war an american general was paraphrased as saying we had to destroy the town to save it we had to destroy the town to save it it reminds me of the motivation behind this proposal the goal of the act is to decarbonize the u.s economy by 2050. have net zero emissions from power plants by 2035 80 percent by 2030. in so doing well we're going to destroy livelihoods disrupt families decimate communities increase utility bills threaten the stability of the of our grid and we will still experience negative effects of climate change since the rest of the world isn't following suit look chairman we agree we need to work to reduce carbon emissions but we also need to understand the consequences before we rush into such a punitive action let's keep in mind last year 60 percent of our power came from fossil fuels coal gas and oil it's reasonable to understand that this total transformation it maybe isn't reasonable to undertake this total transformation of our electric grid in less than 14 years or even nine look at solar energy they're predicting that in their publication this week they're predicting that they're going to quadruple their capacity in solar in the next 10 years that now make sure we understand that means they're going from 2.3 of the of the mix to nine percent but remember coal and gas are still sixty percent according to the utilities we've consulted decarbonizing our power sector by 2035 and 80 by 2030 will take a miracle so paul at what cost it will increase costs for families with higher utility bills according the institute for energy research two thousand dollars per household annually it'll destroy jobs not just coal miners and pipeliners but all the secondary jobs that rely on them the railroad workers the barge operators and machinists the fabricators that go on and on where will these workers go many of them are making seventy eighty a hundred thousand dollars we get yes we get these big promises about making solar panels or windmills about these promises terry sullivan the president of the labor international labor union said it's pie in the sky bs and he didn't say bs about this green jobs being good middle class jobs he said because they're not as a result single industry towns like welch west virginia gillette wyoming hazard kentucky katus ohio you're going to be crushed not to mention we'll be left with a grid that is far less reliable and resilient with more frequent blackouts haven't we learned anything from california texas about how fragile our grid is and from what gain even if america totally decarbonizes the rest of the world is still increasing its consumption of fossil fuels we still have wildfires on the west coast droughts and flooding in the midwest and hurricanes on the east mr chairman we want to work in a bipartisan fashion to address climate change and utilize all of the above energy resources this committee has demonstrated a history of bipartisanship and if you'll let us we can do it again let's not destroy the village in order to save it so we have on our panel we have kevin sundy from the pennsylvania chamber of commerce he's going to be tested by today he will explain pennsylvania's dependence on foster fuel resources for economic growth and job creation and discuss the devastation that the impact this legislation would have on a state i look forward to this conversation today and i hope that we can work with frank pallone and his and and all of you on this committee how we can make this a bipartisan bill or start with something that is bipartisan from the very beginning so i thank you and i yield back my time the gentleman yields back

the the Alliance reported not well understood here in the I think the folks in Honduras and Guatemala and Salvador beginning to to understand it it goes back to the the notion to find out what works do more of that go back about 20 years ago the country of Colombia which is just south of the Central American nation was a failed pretty much a failed nation their drug drug gangs narco dog lords pushing them they're pushing around the elected appointed officials the police they had the leftist guerrillas were creating a great havoc there and question was can this country survive one at one point the bunch of a gunman in Colombia rounded up the Supreme Court of Columbia took image room and shot them all to death and that's where they were and today twenty years later apart from our help in part with a lot of courage and hard work on their part they were thriving nation to driving democracy not without challenges but it's just as a saved nation they could do it and we could help the key here is for for us with Honduras quantum el salvador for them to do it to do the hard work with respect to improving their governing institutions or ability to actually run things make things happen about provide services to the people of the country the the idea that the fight corruption to to shut down the gangs to provide people with better options make sure that that the prosecutors prosecute the police police the judges the judge the Correctional Institute actually correct behavior and the last piece is the nurturing environment for job creation job preservation part of that is public safety rule of law but part is also the workforce to advocate the skills that they need to do the work that needs to be done in transportation infrastructure roads highways bridges airports in and in and so forth the cost of energy and those countries is very high they have used a lot of oil from Venezuela it's just it's not cheap they have as it turns out the ability to bring in natural gas at about half the price of Mexico that needs to be done we have the ability to to a to use some would find you some own resources to provide energy they need to do more of that you can do those things they'll create a nurturing environment create jobs in doing those things and be more attractive place for foreign capital investments so if they do those things we will help we're not going to give them money we will spend money that supports in the areas of gower improving governance improving public safety rule of law improving the economic climate but it's not money that we're going to give directly to these governments that you spend it no no no we'll spend it ourselves and we'll use in some cases and non-governmental organizations ngos to do the work nonprofits

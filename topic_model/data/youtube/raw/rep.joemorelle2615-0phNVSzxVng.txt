want to call attention to the incredibly important cause of fighting to protect women's health care which is under attack on the supreme court at this very moment i believe every woman has the fundamental inalienable right to choose what happens to her body which is why it's so important we fight to uphold roe versus wade the repeated efforts of states like mississippi to ban abortion are not only unconstitutional they also endanger the lives of countless women who will be forced to turn to unsafe procedures in 1930 illegal abortion was listed as the official cause of nearly 20 percent of maternal deaths recorded that year we have come too far in the fight for women's equality to retreat to an era when women lack the basic right to autonomy over their own bodies that's why i am a proud sponsor of and voted to pass the women's health protection act and while continue fighting to ensure that every woman has the absolute right to make her own health care decisions no matter what

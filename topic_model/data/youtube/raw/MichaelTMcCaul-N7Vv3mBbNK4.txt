well Mike McCaul of Texas Thank You mr. chairman mr. secretary thank you for being here today as President Kennedy once said let us never fear to negotiate but let us not negotiate out of fear as an American I want to wish you my heartfelt sincere wish that your negotiations are successful I think every American wants that I think that the stakes are dealing with or the national security stakes have never been higher than they are with the RAM and from a national security homeland security standpoint as well I have some concerns about this deal we've worked on these sanctions for a decade we've gotten to the point where we can possibly negotiate i sent a letter to Senator Reid signed by 70 members of Congress to continue and vote on the sanctions bill that we passed by 400 votes in the house so that we could strengthen your hand strengthen your leverage in these negotiations my concern is if this deal violates 6 un security council resolutions to give around the right to enrich that it sends a message to our partners in the Middle East that's okay for a state sponsor of terrorism to enrich but not for them I'm concerned that it could spark and nuclear arms race in the Middle East if not done correctly I'm concerned it deals nothing with the technology aspects as we know they have the capability to hit Israel and Europe with its missiles currently and the Pentagon projects that they have ICBM capability of hitting the United States by 2015 and I think most disturbingly mr. secretary to president Ronnie just said this week that Iran's centrifuges and his words quote unquote will never stop spinning now I've talked to officials in the bush administration who claim that where the biggest mistakes made was North Korea I think Iran is playing the North Korean playbook if you will and also trying to play the United States its homeland security chairman I'm concerned about seven billion dollars of relief without any assurance that that money will not be used for further terrorism and will not be used to further a nuclear weapons program I think that we should negotiate but i believe that lifting sanctions should not be done until they have dismantled their nuclear program in other words mr. secretary are you willing at the end of the six months in the final deal to say look we're willing to lift the sanctions when you stop enriching uranium well let me speak for a minute to the question of the never stopped spinning the centrifuges if they're you know less than a thousand or 500 or whatever they are they may never stop spinning them but they're very limited and what they're going to be able to do the outlines of this have to take shape now and we're very clear this agreement as I read earlier to you and visions and they've accepted this envisions severe restraints mutually defined program with mutually agreed parameters consistent with practical needs what are the practical needs to have some medical research maybe to feed enough fuel into a legitimate power program which may be done in consortium with other people with intrusive knowledge of what's going on as a result I mean there are a lot of things here yet to be filled out in this so the answer is at the end of this I can't tell you they might not have some enrichment but I can tell you to a certainty it will not be possible for them to be able to turn it into a weapons program without our knowing it so far in advance that all the options that are available to us today to stop it let's say we weren't here talking about this and they're proceeding down the road and we came to you and said hey we got to stop it the only way we know how that's still going to be available to us only it's going to be available to us with much greater foresight much greater knowledge of what's happening and much more restraint on whatever their program is between now and then that does make Israel and Saudi Arabia and Emirates and Egypt and all the other countries concerned much more security I think you'd have more confidence from Israel ethnic end members of Congress if you came back in six months and said you know we can they can of a peaceful program but not enriching uranium inside Iran and that can be done by providing that enriched uranium to them outside of Iran I would urge you to pursue that that deal was on the table the number of years ago but that deal I'm afraid has probably been lost I believe 02 wrong gentleman's time is expired we go to Gerry Connolly of virtue

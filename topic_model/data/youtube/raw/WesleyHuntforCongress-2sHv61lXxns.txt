one of my best friends has one of the best quotes of all time he said the problem with the american dream is that it came true so when it came true then people realized so what do we have to complain about because now we actually do have some equality yeah we've actually had a black president yeah i mean white people will elect a black guy as their congressman for their community so now what do we do um this is this is not good for us because now people have autonomy they realize that they can achieve the american dream they realize that within a couple of generations they could be successful broadcasters and successful podcasters like yourself and then now all of a sudden that then scares those that want the government to run at all and now they're trying to take it back and the good thing is is that we always know this doesn't work this is the highest gas prices i've seen in my lifetime this is the highest inflation i've seen in my lifetime this is the worst border crisis we've seen in our lifetime putin is running amuck iran is on a path to have another nuclear weapon and the world is literally falling apart and it happened in a year and a half and we're paying attention i hope everyone's paying attention

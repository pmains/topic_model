joining us now is Mississippi senator Roger wicker good to have you here sir hello good to be with you you guys going to get this done well I sure hope so and the plan is yes to get a tweaked version out by mid-week and then to pass the motion to proceed actually get on the bill and that will open up what we call the voter AMA and will be one of the most open processes of amendments you've ever seen so we need to move to that phase get on the bill and then move to the amendment process next week are you really optimistic that it can happen because it sounds like there's just huge division among Republicans people plug-ins within the party about what exactly health care reform should or should not be about when it comes to for example the expansion of Medicaid well I think there's unanimity though that the current system is imploding there was a Gallup survey out yesterday that indicated that two million fewer adults will be covered this year under the current system the the market is crashing the co-ops are getting out of the business premiums are going through the roof this is a system that's not working we can make it better we know all that but you're losing a PR war on the Medicaid front without the fear or having to pretend this morning well the every story that you read about what the bill will do to Medicaid is all about how the severely disabled are going to lose their care that the elderly are going to lose their care rather than the whole focus on the expansion to able-bodied adults well you know that that's just I would just challenge that as as being false listen Medicare expenditures are going to go up under the house plan I think under the Senate plan Medicare expenditures are going to go up even more but we've got to slow the growth rate of this program so it will be around for people that need it and also for future generations nobody's talking about cutting Medicaid we're talking about slowing the growth rate and preserving and making it better and having 50 state have experiments about making it more efficient and able to live to deliver better services for the people in those states but do you realize that the American public is hearing that it's about cutting Medicaid I've been doing a lot of research over the last three weeks talking to Medicaid researchers on when you get them on the phone they are very much against this bill this is about draconian cuts the entire system is geared against you guys right now well and that's why I'm on your show at 8:00 a.m. this morning and beautiful Washington DC - to try to win the PR war so of what I am Telling You is that we are going to we are going to make Medicaid better we're going to give states the power to experiment and come up with their best plans and also we're going to lower premiums for people in the private market now that is a better solution and and we're doing our best to get the message across but you're right it's awfully hard to compete with the media and all of these choices senator your problem the problem is there is a there's a contingent that like Bernie Sanders he wants single-payer that's exactly that's exactly what the Democrats read that so they watch it with you if everybody had Medicaid that would it would essentially result in single-payer so they're not the interests that I don't think in any way of reforming the entitlement they want to expand the entitlement to to basically be akin to something like well it business I'm not I'm not depending on Bernie Sanders to make this work Bernie Sanders and his team lost to the last election right and the team that won was one saying that we are going to replace Obama care which is a failing system with something that lowers premiums and makes the Medicaid system work better okay California looked at I thought they were going to add the state you know they're they're very you know we're thinking people out there put the politicians they're going to make up single-payer in that state but then they realize wow we won't have any education we won't have any police we won't have any clean and cleaning up the park there won't be in my ways and when being firefighters or you know but we can have single-payer we just can't have anything else and we probably will out of money on single-payer so they make and I need for you to repeat that five times an hour and and maybe you'll help us get our message through we can grow the Medicaid program and make it work for the people who depend on Medicaid and we can do it in a sensible way that lets 50 states experiment and we'll see who comes up with the best plan nobody's talking about cutting the Medicaid program and also we've got to do something to moderate these these premiums in the private sector but Senate no question about it you say it's about winning a PR war but realistically it is more than that if you really want to get this bill passed what actual changes to the bill do you expect will need to be made well okay but don't please excuse me from negotiating in public I think it's going to look much like the bill that was there was out the two weeks ago but I will see I'm not in the room where where the writing is taking place but I think bottom line is we're going to grow Medicaid at a reasonable rate that our economy can sustain and we're going to let 50 states experiment with doing it right and does all it's happened before the August recess oh it very much needs to be done we need to free up the Congress to work on on tax reform making us more competitive internationally and getting jobs going we need to talk about an infrastructure bill since yeah we need to build up our defense and get the defense so should you just give us less completely since it so let's say you get health care reform done tax reforms a big big item as well should you just keep up the August recess right now to say you know what we go to much more 2.41 if the majority leader asked my vote absolutely I would certainly welcome the idea to to stay here and Washington DC and get the job done for the American people is that important nope about it and said but let's go ahead now and try to get it done in this month and then move on to to the conference committee into other topics and so just quick side point Randy Quarles is the nomination when did that get to the floor and will it be an easy confirmation I know it seems to me that confirmations that should be easy have been slow-walked by Senator Schumer the majority leader I mean we even had to vote cloture yesterday on a district judge nomination that had initially come from the Obama administration so I'm not going to be optimistic about any nominations moving quickly

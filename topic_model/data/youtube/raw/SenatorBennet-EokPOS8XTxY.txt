THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM COLORADO. MR. BENNET: THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I RISE TO SPEAK ABOUT VERONICA ROSSMAN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S NOMINEE FOR THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT. MS. ROSSMAN COMES TO THIS FLOOR WITH BROAD LEGAL EXPERIENCE AND A STERLING REPUTATION IN COLORADO. VERONICA CARES DEEPLY ABOUT JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE WITHOUT IT. VERONICA WAS BORN IN RUSSIA WHERE HER FAMILY FACED ANTI-SEMITISM AT EVERY TURN. HER GRANDPARENTS COULDN'T OPENLY PRACTICE THEIR FAITH BECAUSE THEY FEARED RETALIATION AT WORK. HER FATHER WAS A BRILLIANT CAREER SCIENTIST WHO WAS ROUTINELY DENIED PROMOTIONS. HER MOTHER, A TALENTED PIANIST AND MUSIC TEACHER, NEVER OPENLY SHARED HER FAITH UNTIL THE FAMILY FLED RUSSIA. IN THE END, VERONICA'S PARENTS KNEW THAT ANTI-SEMITISM WOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF HER ENORMOUS POTENTIAL, AND THEY WANTED HER TO GROW UP WITH A FREEDOM THAT THEY NEVER ENJOYED. AND LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY, FAMILY CAME TO AMERICA ASND HER POLITICAL REFUGEES, AND FROM VIRTUALLY NOTHING, VERONICA BUILT A DISTINGUISHED LEGAL CAREER. SHE WORKED HARD AND EARNED A B.A. FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, AND THEN A J.D. FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT HASTINGS. SHE CLERKED FOR JUSTICE WILLIAM MAUPIN OF THE NEVADA SUPREME COURT WHO COULD SAY NOT ENOUGH ABOUT HER BRILLIANT LEGAL MIND. VERONICA THEN PRACTICED APPELLATE LITIGATION AT MORRISON AND FORESTER WHERE SHE WORKED ON ONE OF THE LARGEST INTERNATIONAL PATENT CASES IN HISTORY. LATER, SHE SERVED AS A STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AND TAUGHT FOR THREE YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF DENVER AS A VISITING PROFESSOR OF LAW. IN PRIVATE PRACTICE, VERONICA SPECIALIZED IN COMPLEX CIVIL LITIGATION AND HANDLED CASES ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM ANTITRUST LAW TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW. AT THIS POINT, VERONICA COULD HAVE PURSUED ANY NUMBER OF HIGH-PAYING LEGAL JOBS, BUT INSTEAD SHE BECAME A FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR THE DISTRICTS OF COLORADO AND WYOMING, AND OVER THE PAST 12 YEARS, MS. ROSSMAN DEVELOPED RARE EXPERTISE AS AN APPELLATE SPECIALIST, HANDLING DIRECT CRIMINAL APPEALS FROM EVERY JUDICIAL DISTRICT IN THE TENTH CIRCUIT. IN HER TIME AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER, SHE HAS HANDLED OR SUPERVISED OVER 100 APPELLATE MATTERS BEFORE THE TENTH CIRCUIT. SHE HAS REPRESENTED MORE THAN 250 INDIGENT CLIENTS FROM CONTROVERSIAL DEFENDANTS TO PEOPLE STETENCED TO LONG TERMS FOR A NONVIOLENT OFFENSE, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NO CRIMINAL HISTORY. SHE FOUGHT FOR EVERY ONE OF THOSE AMERICANS, OFTEN AGAINST LONG ODDS. BUT MORE THAN THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, SHE FOUGHT FOR THE AMERICAN IDEAL THAT EVERYONE DESERVES EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. IF CONFIRMED, VERONICA WOULD BE THE ONLY JUDGE ON THE TENTH CIRCUIT WITH EXPERIE PUBLIC DEFENDER. WE NEED MORE JUDGES LIKE VERONICA WHO ARE NOT ONLY HIGHLY QUALIFIED BUT WHO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ON THE WRONG END OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AND TOO OFTEN FAILS THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY. I KNOW SOME OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WORRY ABOUT CONFIRMING PUBLIC DEFENDANTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT CIVIL PROCEDURE. I DON'T SHARE THAT VIEW, BUT IN VERONICA'S CASE, IT DOESN'T APPLY ANYWAY. WHEN SHE WAS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE,  I I MENTIONED, SHE WORKED EXCLUSIVELY ON CIVIL MATTERS. SHE TAUGHT CIVIL PROCEDURE AT SOME OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT PUBLIC DEFENDERS BRING AN IDEOGIGICAL AGENDA TO THE BENCH. IN VERONICA'S CASE, THAT COULDN'T BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. HER FAMILY'S STORY HAS PROVEN HER PROFOUND APPRECIATION FOR HOW AT ITS BEST THE RULE OF LAW IS AN ANTIDOTE TO THE ARBITRARY ADMISTSTRATION OF LAW BASED ON PREJUDICE. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. HERE IS WHAT SHE TOLD THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE UNDER OATH. SHE SDD IF CONFIRMED, IN EVERY CASE, ILL-TREAT ALL LITIGANTS RESPECTFULLY AND IMPARTIALLY. I WILL CAREFULLY REVIEW THE RECORD ON APPEAL. I WILL PUT ASIDE ANY PERSONAL EWEWS. I WILL FAITHFULLY ADHERE TO THE RULE OF LAW. MS. ROSSMAN'S QUALIFICATIONS ARE OBVIOUS. SHE HAS BEEN A FIRST-RATE LAWYER, AND SHE WOULD MAKE A FIRST-RATE JUDGE. THAT'S WHY THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SENT HER TO THE FLOOR WITH A BIPARTISAN VOTE, AND NOW I HOPE ALL OF US CAN COME TOGETHER

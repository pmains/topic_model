one of the first members of congress at the border this year we won a couple months ago and uh back then it was already culminating into a crisis now it's a full-blown crisis we already have more illegal crossings and apprehensions this this year in 2021 than we did the entire year of 2020. we had this under control and what the biden administration has done is very deliberate so we're all ringing our hands because kamala won't go down to the border well let's say she does let's say my yorkist does so what they don't want to change this this is very deliberate they took very willful steps to reverse trump administration policies the remaining mexico policy the asylum cooperation agreement stopped building the wall and maybe more importantly than all of that send a signal to people that they're welcome here and that when we catch you we're going to release you well over 60 percent of family units that are that are caught illegally crossing the border are just releasing the into the interior very low chance that we're ever going to see them again they're creating this crisis on purpose and then on top of all that what do they do in congress well they propose legislation that puts the vast majority of illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship so let's just abuse ourselves of the notion that they're incompetent they're not incompetent they're willfully doing this and we need to create the public pressure in the backlash so that they stop them at the reverse course

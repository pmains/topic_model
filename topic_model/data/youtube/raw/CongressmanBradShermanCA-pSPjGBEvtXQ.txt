gentleman from California mr. Sherman was also the chair for the Subcommittee on investing entrepreneur ship and capital markets is now recognized for five minutes couple of responses to what the ranking member had to say yeah the stock market's way up wages are up a bit more than one percent in real terms after inflation wages at the bottom have risen chiefly in those states where we raised the minimum wage and when we have a Democratic majority in both houses we will raise the minimum wage nationwide and deal with and and deal effectively with those states that have not seen such an expansion of wages at the bottom I've grown not quite old but I've spent many decades in this room I've seen your predecessors predecessors predecessor and every time they come in and the Republicans attack them or expansionary monetary policy both traditional and newfangled and now we have a new president and all of a sudden they're pushing on the other side all I'll say is that I've consistently from the days of mr. greenspan been pushing for somewhat lower interest rates and an expansionary policy particularly quantitative easing because you returned 55 trillion billion dollars to the Treasury last year and that's I know not your purpose but think of the kids that will get an education because we could fund aid to local education think of the medical research and the lives that will be saved because we were able to fund medical research I don't think the 55 billion should be regarded as an irrelevance E or an embarrassment and finally as to the jobs growth we've seen recently I do need to point out the jobs grew much faster in the last three years of the Obama than the first three years of the Trump administration it is as if Trump inherited a plane as he inherited so much else the plane was on automatic pilot and it was going in the right direction and he hasn't managed to completely screw it up

jection to mr. DeFazio from or going to be recognized for his questions thank you for not objecting this chairman appreciate it yeah we-well Keating yeah like we got the problem first I would observe mr. chairman that I did introduce a bill today we called cleverly called the tusker act HR 1945 that would require that countries that are identified under site ease as significant source transit or destination points for legal ivory a rhino horn immediately enter into consultations with the us to discuss measures to end their importation and facilitation and absent that then the US has the option of imposing sanctions and I think the Chinese with their you know whatever their current trade deficit is with the US with you know with us at risk would take some measures and I actually got these some of the ideas from Jack fields former Republican representative from Texas you might know jack and jack worked on this on a bipartisan basis the last time we had a huge crisis and we did pass a bill it was particularly targeted at Hong Kong in some other areas at that point they got the message pretty quickly and and it stopped but of course now ivory isn't infinitely more valuable than it was then and now you are talking about dealing with Lord's Resistance Army or who you know Isis or who knows who are financing their nefarious activities with this and so I would just put to the panel I mean first i'm not aware that even though the president has site ease as authority under pele that he has thought about or has initiated any use of it against these target countries even though we are initiating rules here secondly uh you know if if you're not aware of that don't you believe that given the fact that absent us sending in the seals and the special forces to you know to level the playing field in terms of weaponry that this is one of the best things the US could do which is to threaten meaningful sanctions against Vietnam China and the other major importers who are facilitating this trade so two questions one has has there been any consideration or discussion of invoking pelle yes or no and and if not would this not be a an effective potentially and effective tool well I am not aware of discussions of within the administration of invoking pelle I know that that it is an issue that that from time to time is raised with us and that we do consider as to the issue of trade sanctions I mean part of me wants to say that that what are the great facts of coming to this hearing is that that we're seeing people including this committee and we're very grateful for taking lowlife trafficking crisis very seriously and one of our messages has been throughout the national strategy and our testimony here today that it should be considered to be on a par with other forms of extremely dangerous and at lucrative international organized crime and so we we ask for the full strength of the government to be brought against it I can't however give you any answer on the significant that you've raised for your bill about applying trade sanctions there's a host of issues that would go into that and I know that sure we always give in to the Chinese let them run a huge trade deficit and steal our jobs but maybe this is a time when would stand up for last remaining elephants on earth send them a strong message and say hey you want us to pay you 200 billion dollars more in deficit next year well guess what not going to happen unless you take and I know you can't go there with this administration but since the administration has not shown any inclination to act meaningfully it's I mean it's one thing to go after some guy was trying to bring in a piano back into the US and you know and and in you know thing I did see that load of stuff which was antiqued and that was massive and huge and I'm glad you got him but you need to be careful in writing this rule in terms of you know going so far that we end up you know there is a provision Congress passed and the Gingrich era rarely used the you know the Congressional review act where every rule of major importance has to come to Congress for 60 days and it can be essentially be towed by Congress so you know it'd be the rule needs to be very thoughtfully done I mean when you get people excited about you know little tiny embellishments and a gun stock and stuff like that that's that's something we don't need Thank You mr. chairman if I could just supplement my answer because I'm informed that in fact we are looking at that the issue of Pelle sanctions with regard to Vietnam and its role in the Rhino horde train trade and also looking at Mozambique so those things are being considered for those two countries Thanks let's look at China on ivory I know it's tough to ever stand up to China but we should do that if I could just add in supplement what mr. Dreier said I in our negotiations of the trans-pacific partnership as well as TT as well as our negotiations of the European Union or possibly a transatlantic trade agreement we are including environmental aspects including wildlife trafficking that would be subject and bound to dispute resolution and binding enforcement so that is one tactic we are taking to look at the trade side and specifically with regard to China we have certainly been elevating the issue of wildlife trafficking in our engagement with the highest levels of the Chinese government president Obama has raised it with President Xi I know that secretary Kerry has raised it will be using it again during a strategic reason again during a strategic and economic dialogue I know that the Treasury secretary raised it when he was just out in China last month and I I believe we have agreement to be raising at the highest levels and what we have found with China is that really change significant change is going to have to come from the top down we saw that with the success of shark fin so we believe that we are really making some progress and we are going to be continued on a sustained basis raising this at the highest diplomatic level I appreciate hearing that thank you for your generous grant of time as chairman thank you for being here one last comment to following up on an ambassador garber China's the by far the number one offending nation for us where this ivory ends up is that a is that a fair statement ambassador yeah yes that's our understanding and then Vietnam would be the number one nation where Rhino tusk end up is that correct yes well thank you all for being here members have five days to submit other questions and statements for the record and this subcommittee is adjourned thank you all

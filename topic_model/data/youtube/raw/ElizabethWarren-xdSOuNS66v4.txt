Eric Garner's life matters Andrew Pierce's life matters we stand united against police brutality that's why we're here that's why we fight shoulder-to-shoulder Angie tell people a little bit about your husband Angela he just came home from I'm due in two years you know in jail and I said only 15 15 days and he went up to Connecticut see a friend and as they ran a traffic stop he got pulled over and it placed them in the car AHA and several times he stated he couldn't breathe he said I'm feeling dizzy I'm getting numb can you help me please I'm begging you please help me and all each and every time mark officer mark we tonight has a medical attention that he needed as you died wanting me one many people he got to the police station you need me see hit in the dash cam you know you see death in his face not once did he call for medical attention not once did he check his pulse not once it did he do anything he placed it from Angela on the copy and you see all these offices come out this capacity keeps apartment and they're drinking coffee and then a speed and not not not not still not putting evidence from that day forward I said I'm gonna be his point I'm gonna be his you know his get him justice I promised him and it's been a three yeah right finally a must on Monday the advocate that was passed and now these offices will be held accountable they will have a simple charge right now but we sure help you his gonna go national and then Angela death will not be in vain and we could say so many and he will be living on in history the Android Kearse act that I'm sponsoring in Congress so that all across this nation says that someone who's in custody is entitled to medical care they need it and the failure to do so would be wrong would be a crime so emerald talked a little bit if you would about your dad and about the proposed legislation there my father you know he was our everything my mom and my dad together has six children I'm the youngest girl so I'm not consider myself baby girl that's my father called me baby I know that onesie you know a beautiful connection and it is between a daddy and her B and his baby girl yes and you know my father passed away I was 22 and immediately when everything happened we got national attention but I don't it wasn't enough for national change so when the Eric garner law was introduced last year by Hakeem Jeffries I was like yes this is it this is going to be the the pivotal moment for us where we're going to get justice because the murderer of pencil a oh he wasn't fired he wasn't fired until five years later he wasn't criminally liable for my father's murder and I thought that that cop should've went to jail for murdering my father and unfortunately we would never be able to go after him criminally and justice for me means having these having these bills and legislation in place my sister Erica she passed away at 27 from a massive heart attack she left behind a four month old and an 8 year old who are and now who I'm now taking care of and I have to one day explain to them what happened to their grandfather and what happened to their mother and what happened to their mother was a direct result of what happened to our Father so it's like you know I don't want to keep losing some people I would love to where should be here my father should have been killed and you shouldn't have been killed so we fight for those endurance this to me means having a piece of legislation that my children could look on to say you know what I lost my mother I lost my my art I lost my father my grandfather but we didn't lose his memory we didn't lose his legacy because this won't happen again so when the legislation with the push for national change with the push for print for police reform that is where the change is going to happen and that's where we're going to see justice yeah how about for you Angie how did it feel when Governor Cuomo signed in the wall bill named after your husband yeah it felt so many emotions so many yo I feel so happy and excited and I was crying and I'm not told the kids and I said yo did your daddy the daddy's little gotta got passed and they're like oh wow mommy they're my you thank you for pushing so hard Angie you and emerald have been willing to get out and fight to tell your stories over and over and you've been so important in the movement against police brutality what can the rest of us what can all of us do to help lift up your work everybody all the politicians and state that they want this law these laws to pass if the Eric garner law passes nationally no one could have the chokehold and he would say everything in the way he passed away will save so many when the anti kids at passes if anybody's in any kind of mental distress they will be held accountable even the seven o'clock floor what is it once it passes it's available if anybody is running no officer can shoot them in the back so these these negotiations are so important that they're Amissah path and everybody needs to go to each and every electric official state they want these three boys surpass pointman create so the first step is definitely to lean on all the elected officials in the democratic-led state and they move on to the public to the Republican last days we need you to make real change and pass this on a federal level we're gonna do this it's time take all right we're gonna take it national I like the way you approach this emerald did you say we're gonna do it in New York we're gonna do it the states where we came but at the same time we're gonna fight this at the national level we're gonna push this on every front yeah you two are tough women who are determined to get it done and that's why I like fighting alongside you yep we will

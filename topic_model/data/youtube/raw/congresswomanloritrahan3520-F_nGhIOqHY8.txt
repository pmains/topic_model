thank you madam chair and thank you to the witnesses for testifying today dr emmert it's great to see you again and not surprisingly my questions are are for you i wish i could actually aggregate all my colleagues remaining time and just [Laughter] ask all my questions but i think it's fair to say that for a long time the main argument against allowing college athletes to be compensated for the use of their nil was that it would effectively end college athletics as we know it but based on what you've seen as president of the ncaa in the past three months since the association's new nil policy when it went into effect do you believe that college athletics are on the verge of extinction thank you for the question uh congresswoman i think first of all the the resistance among the schools and it's the schools of course that make all of the rules of of the ncaa the resistance and concern of the schools where all those issues that we're discussing here and all the potential for this to go awry uh if we can in fact have a framework that creates the guardrails we're talking about here i think quite the opposite of being the end of college sports i think it can be a wonderful educational adjunct for students yeah i i agree i mean look if deals start to take the shape of resembling pay for play which has been discussed today i mean it just highlights what we've known for years uh and that that's that there is a market uh for paying college athletes and while nil is only part of the solution it is why we need to be really honest uh that athletes do work for universities and deserve the same rights as employees across other industries especially as it pertains to striking that balance with academic experience versus athletics their health and safety which has been raised and certainly uh equity dr emer you already stated for the record that a national standard is necessary on nil do you also agree that the national standard should be as pro athlete as possible i'm sorry this national standard should be as pro athlete as possible i do i think that again these are opportunities as we've just heard from miss marsh that students can can take enormous advantage of they can build lifelong skills they can generate some revenue whether it's modest or large i think that's all very very health help healthy helpful and healthy if we can do it in an appropriate fashion and so have you or the ncaa's legislative bodies identified what you believe to be necessary restrictions on athletes nil i know some of them have been shared but is there any other outstanding that you'd like to share with the committee as we sort of think about this legislation well we have and in fact the the membership with the ncaa the schools spent uh nearly two years trying to craft specific legislation that was about to go into place when the state laws were triggered and so we would be happy to provide the committee with the the proposals that the membership was about to agree on last june terrific we would love that in fact when typically what happens you know when we congress work on large long overdue issues like this one uh there's a temptation and frankly it's pretty common for power brokers you know like the ncaa to withhold their priorities uh and work behind the scenes against bills viewed not as in their favor as you know senator murphy and i have legislation that's central around protecting the value proposition for college athletes would you commit to working with members of this committee to craft a legislative fix that prioritizes college athletes and if so would you also pledge not to dispatch your lobbyists to sync a package that has the support necessary for that legislation to become law well i most certainly will agree to work with this committee or any other committee and i've i've done so for a good while now especially around this issue and i want very much to make sure that legislation supports and protects our student athletes and works to their advantage i'm a lifelong educator i know most people know me as president of the ncaa but i was first a professor in the university president for three decades i've spent my life in in that cause and so of course i would work to that end well i appreciate it as you might uh i just you might expect doctor emirate i'm uh i appreciate that commitment and you know i'm gonna hold you to that um my final question uh as you know as i mentioned or as it's been mentioned i think we're all um encouraged by the efforts from individual institutions chapel hill washington state it sounds uh like baylor as well um that have proactively provided support to college athletes with respect to their nil rights do you agree that in those instances they should also be required to provide the same level of support to all athletes in their program regardless of their race their gender or the sport they play i do great thank you this is a much longer conversation and we didn't get a chance to talk on some of the bigger issues in terms of the structure of college athletes but i really appreciate getting your input on getting the the nil legislation to a place that we can all be proud of thank you congresswoman i so appreciate the time um dr emmer according to data available from the equity and athletics disclosure act there are 2071 institutions of higher ed with athletic programs that are recipients of federal funds 90 of which are still out of compliance with title ix in fact you know 50 years after the passage of title ix females are being annually shortchanged by a billion dollars in athletic scholarships and nearly 150 000 sports participation opportunities it is also common knowledge that these institutions are providing significantly more dollars promoting and publicizing men's revenue sports which has an adverse impact on female athletes seeking nil employment in the open marketplace so i have two questions one in if a university only focus uh focuses on deals with its basketball uh and football teams are they in violation of title ix and second question is how is the ncaa ensuring that universities that assist athletes with nil deals do so in an equitable manner well i'm certainly not an expert on the legal nuances of title ix around whether or not the relationship you're describing would be in violation of title ix so i won't i won't offer an opinion on that i do know that the individual schools and the conferences with which i'm most familiar uh work quite hard as we do at the national level to promote uh sports as equitably and assertively as we can we do live in a society and indeed perhaps beyond our society where the majority of the uh the highest profile sporting events are male dominated that's a reality whether that makes sense or not is is a different matter and and so when you look at where are the largest revenues that are coming in from media deals for example or where do you get the largest audiences regardless of what a school's promotional model may be there they're typically football which is of course the largest national sport and then and then basketball so whether or not their engagement around that violates title ix i i simply can't say what i can say is that we would very much like to see in federal legislation policies that make clear that institutions in the implementation of any title ix engagement are doing so in a way that's completely equitable across genders and every other group regardless of their sport regardless of their gender and i think that's certainly possible and plausible within legislation that could be passed i'm going to move real quickly to yesterday's release of the nlrbs memo because the ncaa put out a statement saying that college athletes are students who compete against students not employees who compete against employees and added that both academics and athletics are part of the total educational experience you know i've heard from countless current uh and former athletes who experience the same thing i did right a system that rewards athletic performance first and then that full academic experience uh internships um you know uh um job opportunities travel abroad um you know that sort of comes close to near last so i am a proponent of giving athletes the power to organize and collectively bargain for fair and better treatment in a system that you know just for too long has a history of not having their backs i mean being a college athlete is a source of enormous pride um but also enormous sacrifice um and so making sure that we have a um an ability to give the power back to the athlete so that they can bargain for better athletic academic balance is is is key i know your position on the legislation i read your statement um after senator murphy and i launched it but since you're opposed to giving athletes a voice through collective bargaining what do you and the association propose to give athletes not just a voice but an actual say in setting the expectations of their performance in the classroom and in their sport well if i can say this quickly first of all i think student athletes uh commitment to their sports and their academic success is an enormous effort it is extraordinary to me when i see what student athletes do in both the classroom and on the court or the field and i'm incredibly proud of them i do believe that there are many ways in which they should be provided more opportunities to strike a balance between those two including more time to finish their degree or to con to continue in internships or a variety of other activities as you point out i think it's very hard to balance those two i think in terms of the student voice and vote we need to make sure and i i hope that we can continue to make progress on this is something that i've been very engaged in to continue to do that so that student athletes uh are more involved in every one of the committees and decision-making bodies of the association they're in 80 or ninety percent of them now but we need more and i support that clearly thank you could i just close madam chair right now did i just have a second to close a second thank you um i appreciate this i know that there's a lot on the table and i really do appreciate the testimony it's informative uh you know the scales of college athletics have been so dramatically tilted in the direction of everyone who isn't an athlete for so long um that one of the reasons why we take the tact that we do is because we're less concerned about going too far in the direction of giving athletes power then then not giving them enough so this is an issue of fairness it's an issue of equity and while i don't often find myself associating my views with justice kavanaugh i share many of the perspectives that were laid out in his concurring opinion in alston earlier this summer so i think it's important we get this right uh and that means getting it right for for college athletes first and foremost but thank you this was um it was very helpful

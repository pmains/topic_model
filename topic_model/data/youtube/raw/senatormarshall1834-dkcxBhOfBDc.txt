we've got pro-abortion activists swarming outside supreme court justice brett kavanaugh's home and this happened last night hours after a california man is federally charged with attempting to murder the supreme court justice 26-year-old nicholas roske was reportedly armed with a backpack full of weapons he called 9-1-1 to report himself admitting to the plot to quote give his life purpose after he found the justice's address online this brings back the words of both chuck schumer and jen saki about protesting supreme court justice's homes watch this i want to tell you gorsuch i want to tell you kavanaugh you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price you won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions so i know that there's an outrage right now i guess about protests that have been peaceful to date and we certainly continue to encourage that outside of judges homes this is so disturbing it's unbelievable joining me right now is kansas senator roger marshall he's a member of the energy small business and agriculture committees senator i know you just got back from the border and i'm going to ask you about that coming up but first what do you make of what's going on here the doxing of political enemies that has gone on now for several years the attacks on republicans and what you just heard from chuck schumer this matters and it has stoked a whole new you know stream of violence right maria good morning this is part of the double standard of the national media could you imagine if donald trump had stood on the supreme court steps and said what the leader of the democrat party said there i do fear for the lives of our justices because there's people out there that are responding to that call we have legislation that we've passed in the senate that's setting on on speaker pelosi's desk that would give them protection give our supreme court justices protection just the same type of protection that she's getting but i i do call on all people to put your guns down to stay away from the from the supreme court justice's houses that's just not right i think it's illegal but it's certainly not right or not proper well i mean it's not right and there's also real uh criminality going on when you consider what's going on at the border i mean the body administration reportedly is now considering a plan to either fly or bust illegal migrants deeper into the united states even as they face deportation the department of homeland security tells fox no official decision has been made but it is not denying the report as we know that they've already been flying migrants to big cities throughout the last year and now we're waiting on the largest migrant caravan ever as it marches toward the to the southern border senator how should we be viewing this well maria this is sad this is because joe biden has turned on the magnet he's turned on a bright light saying come everybody when he said we're ending title 42 what the cartel told everyone in the world has come and we'll get you across the border this is a crime shame people are dying as they trying to cross the border as they're going across the the the fields of texas as well but this is part of biden's open border plan as you know i took five sheriffs from kansas there every one of their planes on the way back was filled with these migrants my plane was filled with migrants as well so it they are coming to your cities right now that's why every state is a border state i mean how do we allow you know dangerous drug criminal cartels to be running the entrance to america and that's what's happening right now look at these figures that we got from border sources border sources told me that these drug cartels and these are cartels just on human smuggling okay these are dangerous cartels they're making 200 million dollars a week they are charging anybody from the northern triangle four thousand dollars ahead to get into america if you're from the middle east they're charging between twenty and thirty thousand dollars if you're from china china is uh ready to pay fifty thousand dollars ahead to get into america undetected migrants are coming from 160 countries can you imagine that we've got these dangerous cartels running the u.s border right and again i think we're almost understating the the problem here the cartel has has members on the border on the on the american side of the border they have members in kansas city recently some cartel members were arrested in kansas city recently fifteen thousand fentanyl lace pills were found in kansas city by our police officers as well that's why every state is a border state now the human trafficking exploding joe biden's policies have made the cartel rich unbelievable i mean this is a dereliction of duty my source tells me 234 000 encounters uh in in april over 118 000 releases and one other thing is that record number of fentanyl he tells me that cpp officials have seized hundred pounds uh in the in the month of april of fentanyl senator i know you've got a new bill that would allow the use of unused coven relief money for schools to go toward better school security measures tell me more about that because at the same time we're dealing with inflation uh gasoline prices food shortages potential short blackouts this summer we're also trying to figure out how to make our schools safer and of course legislation passed the house is it going to go all the way we'll see what happens maria but certainly we're all still mourning with the people of uvalde but one thing we can do one thing we all agree upon is we can make our schools more secure so i'm proud of what we did under president trump most of those schools became more secure they made one entrance for everybody but there needs to be a more of a layered approach now we need now to place the second and third layer of protection for the schools so there's a hundred and fifty billion dollars of unused school money from the coveted relief packages so this would allow the schools to go back and maybe put video surveillance they could put some type of a panic buzzer they could secure each room individually as well so we'll be introducing that on the senate side today and hopefully we'll get a path forward and help keep our kids safer yeah but senator i don't understand why this hasn't been done already all of this money went to the teachers unions a year ago what did they do with the money why aren't they securing our schools well maria i don't have a good answer for that there's a lot of money that's not been used over 150 billion dollars they've spent about 50 billion there's 150 billion left then there were constraints on how they could spend the money so what our legislation would do was expand it give the schools more flexibility that's a constant theme i hear back home in town halls is give us more flexibilities don't micromanage from washington d.c how we would keep a school safe in my hometown of great bend kansas may be different than how you would do in in manhattan all right senator thanks very much for weighing in on all of that senator roger marshall in d.c this morning we'll see you soon senator thank you we'll be right back [Music]

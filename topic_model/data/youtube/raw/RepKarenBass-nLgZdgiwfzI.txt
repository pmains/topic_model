welcome back to KCDC joining me now is Democratic congresswoman Karen bass of California she is also chair of the Congressional Black Caucus also with me former Republican congressman tom coleman thank you both for being here tonight and congresswoman bass let me start with you because you know quite frankly I'd like to hear your response to what has happened in El Paso in particular with this you know s a screed we have seen from the shooter now in custody referencing a Hispanic invasion a lot of other comments that are racist deeply offensive do you think the president and his rhetoric bears some responsibility for this event considering that absolutely I mean if you read the the quote-unquote manifesto it reads like a script from a trump rally I mean the Trump was very clear when he came down the escalator what was his first you know speech about attacking Mexicans he has called repeatedly against an invasion at our border I absolutely think his rhetoric was a contributing factor and I feel sad that my Republican colleagues have not spoken up at all what is the view from inside the Democratic caucus right now congresswoman about what to do next I know there's a call tomorrow with all of your members at noon there have been calls for Congress to come back to emergency session obviously the house has already passed a pair of gun violence related bills so what now I mean what action can the house take to try and do something in the wake of these tragedies well I think we need to look at white supremacy we need to look at white nationalism now I will tell you that in judiciary we have had a hearing on that I know a couple of other committees have too but we need to get the Republicans to admit that it actually exists because they are in complete denial they will not even accept a discussion around the issue in fact they brought african-american witnesses to who essentially said that the white supremacy was in the Democratic Party which means that they didn't even take the topic seriously but we need to look at domestic terrorism we need to look at what we need to do in order to prevent this because it's very hard to address a problem if you will not even exist that the problem if you will not even admit that the problem exists congressman Coleman it's been a little while since you were a member of the House of Representatives but you did serve as a Republican do you recognize this Republican Party and the rhetoric that this president has has put out there and that has you know found itself reflected in the manifesto well I certainly recognize it I don't agree with it and kind of paraphrasing Ronald Reagan he didn't leave the Democratic Party the Democratic Party left him the reverse for me the Republican Party left me I think Karen is absolutely right in what she's saying there it's disappointing I mean 50 years ago when I decided as a young person to enter politics I chose the Republican Party because in my home state of Missouri it was the Reform Party and that state now has turned completely opposite what it was it was all Democrats and then a few of us got elected now it's all Republican the whole party has changed in the sense that they don't want a big tent Trump has commandeered the party he's taken it over it was you know it was done in the 16 election and it's no longer the party of Republicans that I know and a lot of people I think unfortunately see that are or the Republican name and think it's the same party and it's certainly not Donald Trump is not the old Republican Party so from from what we can tell this is still one of the only statements from Republicans calling out this attack as white nationalist although we do have a tweet from Ted Cruz talking about the bigotry towards Hispanics this is from George P Bush and he wrote I proudly served in Afghanistan as a naval officer when our mission was to fight and kill terrorists I believe fighting terror remains a national priority and that should include standing firm against white terrorism here in the United States he goes on to say this is a real present threat we must all denounce and defeat I'm praying for the victims of the shooting in El Paso and I'm asking that all Americans stand firm against all forms of terrorism and he uses that phrase white terrorism why is it that George P Bush is so alone in using this language of in the Republican Party well first of all he's in Texas and it's going to impact his political career and life he's also the grandson of Herbert Walker Bush who I was very close to and I think if he were alive today he would be coming out with the same statement i congresswoman bass let me ask you about that you know we were having a much different conversation about race last week the week before that with the president's racist tweet about the squad with his comments about Baltimore you I know we're just on a trip to Ghana with our top leaders with Nancy Pelosi there was a picture that Ilhan omar posted of herself with Pelosi that really stuck out in my mind what was that trip like for you and what were some of the questions you got about the climate here in the United States from foreign leaders abroad well first of all it was it was a wonderful trip it was an incredible honor to be there with speaker Pelosi and 13 members of the Congressional Black Caucus you know this is the anniversary the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first Africans on the continent you know in the United States and so we wanted to go back to the origins of slavery and so we visited the dungeons where our ancestors were held for months before they were put on ships in the transatlantic slave trade we also had the opportunity to watch the speaker address Parliament so people on the continent and I traveled to the continent frequent frequently they are looking at the United States completely puzzled because people viewed the United States as the rock the solid you know light and now they're confused especially because remember what the President had to say about the African countries I took the opportunity when he made that derogatory statement to go to the African Union which is located in Georgetown and all 50-plus ambassadors are there and I apologized on behalf of the American people because I think it's very important that we are honest with people internationally and that we distance ourselves I think it's very sad let me just say one other thing too is that whenever there is a situation of domestic terrorism and we know that the majority of the time the individual is a white male then my Republican colleagues always want to talk about mental health O'Melveny O'Malley said today that a white supremists or people who are white nationalist that's a mental illness now if the person is of middle-eastern origin then of course they're just a straight terrorist but my Republican colleagues who always want to talk about mental illness when it comes down to it they won't put any resources there so they want to say it's a mental health issue and at the same time they're trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act so it's filled with contradictions and I hope that the representative that is there with you maybe he can organize other Republicans and they can take their party back cuz now it's been taken over by extremists congresswoman Karen bass with a mission for congressman tom coleman I thank you both very much for your time tonight

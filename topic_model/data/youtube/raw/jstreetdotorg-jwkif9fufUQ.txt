my name is Robbie damelin and I'm part of a group called the parent circle families forum and we are more than 600 families who've all lost immediate family member in the conflict so who better than us to know the consequences of no freedom for the Palestinian the consequences of no two-state solution to support Israel today means to support Israel to get out of the occupied territories because we can't go on like this you know how many more children need to die i paid a really high price for what I'm saying you see it's so easy for people in America not to compromise their children on standing at a roadblock every day think about your grandchildren or your children or your brother or your sister having to stand there and then maybe we'll recognize that it's time to stop that a child shouldn't have to wait three hours to come through a checkpoint to get to school that a grandfather should not be made shamed by having to hold his grandson next to the checkpoint while a young soldier of 18 tells him whether he can go through or not it's not a question there of security you know it's a question of creating more hate and so in the short term maybe you won a little battle but in the long run that is going to create more hate it's like so many other things that we do which are removing the dignity from the other we need to respect each other even if we don't love each other

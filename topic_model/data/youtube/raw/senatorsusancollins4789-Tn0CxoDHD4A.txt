listenin the senator from Maine Thank You mr. president mr. president I would ask unanimous consent that the senator from Minnesota senator Klobuchar and I be permitted to speak as if in morning business without objection Thank You mr. president mr. president Alzheimer's is a terrible disease that exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on the individual the family and society in addition to the human suffering it causes Alzheimer's cost the united states an estimated two hundred twenty six billion dollars a year including 153 billion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs these costs will only skyrocket as the baby boomer generation ages already our nation's costliest disease Alzheimer's is projected to cus more than 1.1 trillion dollars if nothing is done to change its current trajectory it is now estimated mr. president that nearly one in two of the baby boomers reaching age 85 will develop Alzheimer's as the consequence chances are that members of the baby boomer generation will either be spending their golden years suffering with Alzheimer's or caring for someone who has it in many ways Alzheimer's has become the defining disease of this generation and if we are to prevent Alzheimer's from becoming the defining disease of the next generation it is imperative that we dramatically increase our investment in Alzheimer's research at a time when the United States suspending some two hundred twenty six billion dollars a year caring for Alzheimer's patients we are spending less than three tenths of one percent of that amount under six hundred million dollars a year on research this makes no sense mr. president we currently spend 4.5 billion dollars a year for cancer research three billion a year for research on hiv/aids and to build billion dollars a year for cardiovascular research all investments that have paid dividends surely we can do more for Alzheimer's given the tremendous human and economic price of this devastating disease mr. president investments in research for other diseases have yielded tremendous results we see that with cancer with hiv/aids patients have access to new treatments and death rates for some of these diseases are decreasing at the same time mortality due to Alzheimer's is escalating Alzheimer's is one of our nation's leading causes of death with recent data revealing that each year more than 500,000 deaths are attributable to Alzheimer's and other dementias six times the amount previously estimated moreover Alzheimer's is the only one of our nation's top ten lius diseases without an effective means of prevention treatment or a cure fortunately there is promising research that holds hope for Alzheimer's patients and their families the research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and by investigating new therapeutic targets but adequate funding is critical to achieve this promise the national plan to address Alzheimer's disease was authorized by the bipartisan National Simers project Act which I co-authored would then senator evan by the national plan has as its primary goal to prevent and effectively treat alzheimer's disease by the year twenty twenty-five the chairman of the advisory council that was created by the Act dr. Ronald Peterson of the Mayo Clinic has testified before Congress that the United States should be devoting two billion dollars a year at a minimum to Alzheimer's research in order to reach that goal mr. president a dramatic increase in funding for Alzheimer's research will not just save lives it will also save money according to a report issued by the Alzheimer's Association last year of federal investment of two billion dollars a year between now and the year to 2025 as recommended by the experts on the Alzheimer's Advisory Council and the scientific community more broadly would be recouped within the first three years after a treatment delaying the onset of Alzheimer's by just five years becomes available I am therefore pleased to be introducing today with my colleague senator Klobuchar senator Mikulski senator Warner Senator Durbin and Senator Stabenow a resolution declaring that the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's is an urgent national priority in recognition of the fact that bold action and considerable increases in funding are necessary to meet that goal our resolution states that the Senate will strive to double the amount of funding that the United States spends on Alzheimer's research in fiscal year 2016 and that we will develop a plan to meet the target of two billion dollars over the next five years mr. president our bill is supported by a number of organizations including the Alzheimer's Association USA against Alzheimer's the leaders engaged on Alzheimer's disease or the lead coalition and the Alzheimer's Foundation of America I would ask unanimous consent that the letters from these organizations be included in the record without objection mr. president we have to face the facts that if we do not invest in Alzheimer's research at the levels that the experts tell us is necessary to develop effective treatments for this disease perhaps a means of prevention or eventually a cure this disease is going to continue you to cause untold suffering not only for its victims but for its families and it will bankrupt America's health care system I urge our colleagues to join us as co-sponsors and I want in particular to recognize my partner in this effort the senator from Minnesota senator Klobuchar the home of the Mayo Clinic is in her State and she has been stalwart in supporting the efforts to increase funding for Alzheimer's research with that mr. president and very pleased to yield to my partner senator Klobuchar

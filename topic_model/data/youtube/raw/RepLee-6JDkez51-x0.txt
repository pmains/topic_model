Mr Speaker I rise today to speak about a crises in our communities in our country I have watched in horror day after day as people of color a shot by the police officers sworn to protect them now we all know that the vast majority of the enforcement officers are committed to serving their communities and many do incredible work despite dangerous and sometimes life-threatening conditions I commend all of those speaking out and working against the injustice 'as of some and tragically as we've witnessed in dallas in Baton Rouge listen police officers have been the victims of violence as well however these tragedies do not change the underlying reality that our criminal justice system is broken since Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson two years ago 2195 people had been killed by police in our nation i has a mother of two black men and the grandmother of five black grandchildren the grandmother five black grandchildren I worry I worry that someone I love could become number 2196 and each time we lose a precious life to fear distrust and prejudice the list of things that will get you killed as a black person in America gets a little longer today I just want to spend a little time going through that list now you can get killed for going to buy a bag of Skittles like Trayvon Martin or you can get killed for riding on New Year's Day for instance in the subway in the bay area like oscar grant this is subway card or maybe you can get killed for selling cigarettes like eric gardener or you can get killed for selling cds like Alton sterling this is the CD you can also be killed for reaching for your wallet like falando Castillo and it doesn't matter if your child if you're black boy you can be killed by playing with a toy gun that's a toy gun now that's what happened to Tamir rice he was 12 and that's what's happened what happened to Terry King last week now he was 13 or you can be killed for a missing front license plate like Samuel DuBose and heaven help it if you're driving a car you can be killed for not signaling a lane change like Sandra bland or for having a broken brake light like Walter Scott are for breaking down on a highway like Terrence Crutcher now should any of this warrant a death sentence is this the America you want to live in in 2016 when you're black too often you're seen as a threat first and a person second when my boys were young I had some tough conversations with them about how to interact with police I taught them the black boys don't get the benefit of the doubt I told them to some it doesn't matter who you are it just matters what you look like I should have had to have these conversations with them this is America parents shouldn't have to live in fear that one day they will have the same call than Michael Brown's mother got that Sandra Bland's mother got the dontre Hamilton mother got that Oscar Grant's mother God we need action here on the floor of Congress and in communities across our country enough is enough we cannot stay silent while these murders continue unchecked we must act now that's why today members of the Congressional Black Caucus will march to the Department of Justice to demand action because black lives do matter I yield the balance of my time

thank you madam chair and you know just a general comment uh i'm shocked shocked that anything would be sensationalized out of washington or out of uh hollywood so i'm i'm sure that is uh news to everybody but a general question um and and i appreciate and i i got to tell you i have one of the utmost respect for my friend from missouri here and and his knowledge and background in it and uh i struggled to find anything uh even more intelligent or as intelligent to ask but it seems to me he's right as we're heading down this path of trying to make sure this never happens again i i'm curious if either of you believe that the notion just the notion of too big to fail has really been driven out of the marketplace well not yet certainly the to date uh the largest financial firms do have a something of an uplift it's called in credit rating parlance for the fact that they have this expected potential future government support as i mentioned earlier in my testimony or my response to questions the credit rating agencies have told me that it's not based upon the statutory authority today because they agree that the statutory authority to provide a bailout doesn't exist today they're concerned about their only concern is well what could what could happen under a future law adopted by a future congress in crisis that's why i think it's critical that we move forward aggressively to try to provide that simplification and to provide a more resilient and stable financial system to hire capital and other measures that's romero absolutely not i mean these these large firms are definitely still too big to fail they they enjoy all the competitive advantages the enhanced credit ratings uh by standard and poor and by moody cheaper access to to credit that doesn't take into account all the risks the ability to raise capital uh these are all things that they they currently enjoy and and and also there is a reduced market discipline isn't that somewhat what you counter to what you were saying earlier no no i believe it's the same thing i'm saying the enactment of dodd-frank itself did not change too big to fail okay and it seems to me i mean this was brought up earlier by our colleagues on the side that's now empty but that in many ways the the unknown is worse than than the known and this might be a case of the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know and we're talking about sifi and these systemically uh uh significant institutions but um you know i i had recently as a freshman i'm a freshman on this committee wasn't here for the uh for those debates i'm sorry that my friend from illinois has got illinois got duped twice uh to voting for uh for this and as he was pointing out in his diet i mean it wasn't a diatribe close to almost a question uh that somehow or another uh you know this this was driven by people who love big banks and who love wall street i had a visit up to wall street uh while i was here with a couple of other freshmen we sat down and and uh had a meeting with a ceo and a cfo from one of those major banks not not one of the nine but a major bank and they looked at us and and one of the statements was you know congressman if we ever find ourselves in this situation again you simply are going to have to do the bailout again at which point i said no disrespect but i'm curious where do you live well the answer was westchester of course said do you know anybody have any of your friends or neighbors actually lost their job much lost their home over what had happened and the cfo kind of paused and she kind of looked up at the ceiling for a second and she said well honestly no i can't i said here's the problem from zealand michigan i can i know people my family's involved in construction all right it has been a very very difficult time and those ripple of flag ripple effects that my friend from missouri is talking about are huge and i am concerned i mean moody's moody's made note of this a year ago that that this language was out there i think part of the problem is is the american people and the marketplace and i'm more concerned about frankly the american people than i am the marketplace don't believe our actions match our words here so i'm sure my friend from illinois who never dreamed he'd be coming here to bail out wall street but ended up doing it twice has every good intention but this institution does not have a good track record regardless of party label of making sure that our friends back home in those small community banks and in those credit unions and in those other areas that are trying to provide that credit for those whether it's rural or suburban or even urban areas that we don't have a very good track record of following our own words and it seems to me that that is a crucial element here that we do not have the markets that actually believe what we have been saying that we are doing and it seems to me in madam chair i appreciate you doing this hearing to underscore that and reiterate that for us thank you thank you mr graham five minutes

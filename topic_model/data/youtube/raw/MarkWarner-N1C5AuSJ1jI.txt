rural business service and collectively we're all interested in bringing economic development to rural communities and for broken up into the three actual services but it's a great program i'm going to focus primarily on the telecom programs but there are a lot of other opportunities that world development offers if if it's something that needs to be financed in a rural community rural development probably has a program that considered those needs from fire stations tribal colleges water systems within our US housing programs as was mentioned before we have a lot of grant and financial opportunities to help with rural communities so there isn't a program that I speak about today that might be interested but you know the business that wants to come to an area we have rural business programs so we'll give you some contact information there and one of the the key characteristics of rural development as we have a field structure and it's that field staff that makes our programs so accessible to rural communities and I have too much staff here Mary campanella need to stand up Mary campanelle works for me in Washington DC she's our outreach coordinator for all the telecom programs and Richard Jenkins is our general field rep we have about 30 some-odd general field representatives throughout the country that worked just on the telecom programs Richard is the person that he would get to know if you're interested in any of our telecom programs and we have GF RS throughout the country also as I mentioned we have our our rural development state structure our state office is located in richmond and ellen davis Matthews is our state director she or anyone on her staff would be more than willing to talk about any of our programs and she has a broadband coordinator in the state that can also help you we have about six major programs I'll just go into these in a little bit of detail on the first program is our telecom infrastructure program and those are to improve and build telecommunication services that's the program that started 60 years ago and it's for communities with a population of less than 10,000 then recently and we expanded the program to include funding for emailing 11 services we have our rural broadband loan program this is created in the farm bill got its start back in 2002 was reauthorized in 2008 if anybody knows anything about the farm bill that comes up for renewal every five years so if you add 5 to 2008 you know it's coming up for renewal the next year or so that program is just to finance broadband you're interested in providing telephone services and broadband you come in under the telecom program if you're just interested in providing broadband services that's under our broadband program we have a small community connect grant program I'll get into more detail on that since the window just opened for that and we have a distance learning and telemedicine relevant grant program that doesn't finance the broadband but it if I it funds the equipment on either end to bring distance learning telemedicine to rural communities we have public TV grants and weather radio grants very small programs but we can give you more information on those programs if we're interested funding available is a demented mentioned we generally have over a billion dollars and loan and grant funds this year in the 2012 budget we have six hundred ninety million dollars for telecom program we have seven hundred and thirty six million and broadband loans distance learning telemedicine grants is 16 million and Community Connect grants is about 15 million as needa mentioned I've got about a four and a half billion dollar portfolio that keeps me awake sometimes at night you know wondering how the portfolio is is operating those are all taxpayers dollars so we take that very seriously and we have about 3.8 billion dollars in principle outstanding and our infrastructure program the one that's been around for 60 years and we have that almost 500 borrowers and program we have about five hundred and thirteen million dollars outstanding in our farm bill on broadband program that's one that started in 2002 that's 73 borrowers and then the majority of the other principal there is from the recovery act as Nita mentioned we had three and a half billion dollars and loans and grants that were made available under the Recovery Act community connect this is a very competitive grant program and it's aimed at bringing broadband to the most rural and economically challenged communities since its exception back in 2002 we've done 215 grants and invested 112 million dollars one of those grants have been right here in Virginia and it serves communities of 20,000 or less and something that's very critical is the application window opened on May the third of 2012 and closes on jun 18 2012 so we're right in the middle of the application period I don't know if you notice but outside on the table we did bring a copy of the innova if you're interested that's the Federal Register Nova that's out on the table we also brought copies of the application guide and those around on the table for you and some information we also do webinars on the announcement on this one is for the webinar for June the seven there is one June May twenty-fourth but that's already booked up so we have to add another one on joomla 7 but those in that information is available for you out on the table and again the May twenty-fourth one is all closed up so I'm June the 7th is the next one it's a mention it's very competitive program this year we have over 14 million dollars last year we had 13.4 million dollars received a hundred and forty grant applications to hundreds of 17 million so it was about a ten to one demand for the program and we awarded 13.5 million dollars to 18 grantees in pretty much anybody would be eligible for this except an individual or a partnership Indian tribes are state or local government to co-op pretty much all of our programs are open to anybody except an individual or a partnership the requirements for the program it can only serve one community we have very limited funds that we try to get the money spread around as much as we can and the community has to be unserved by broadband at the time so if there's any broadband in half the community but not the other half you couldn't serve that community with the community connect ran program has been the entire community that would be served by the grant the population when it is 20,000 or less there's a minimum grant of 50,000 and a maximum of 1.5 million there is a matching requirement a 15-percent one of the nice things that we do with the project is required that there be a community center with at least 10 computers for public use at no charge to the public the two years and pre-service to critical facilities also has to be provided for two years and has to offer basic broadband service to residential business customers within the probe proposed service area and again the NOFA was just published on made third and grab them I think after the presentation again that's information on the community connect grant program very competitive program but it's a great program and it's a lot of times it's the stepping stone we've done a lot in tribal areas very unserved areas where somebody gets their start with a community connect grant program then they may come back to our programs and then come in for a farm bill broadband program loan or for an infrastructure program loan but it's a stepping stepping stone to get people started within broadband and our loan programs I'm distance learning telemedicine excuse my voices fading here DLT we published a notice on maybe eighth there is no application window for this year and hopefully beginning the next month we're going to be announcing the awardees board the fiscal year 12 funds what we decided to do is we had so many applications for the program from last year instead of opening a new window this year we just went back to the list of application from last year and funded the next one's on the list our goal is to publish a proposed rule and make changes to the program for the future so we thought it was best just to not open the window this year but announcements will be made in the beginning of June it was 400 to 65 million dollars in loans and grants that have been awarded in total and again this one has a population limit of 20,000 Maxima brand to 50,000 minimum granted 50,000 maximum of five hundred thousand in matching funds of fifteen percent required again distance learning telemedicine we're not going to be publishing nope inviting applications this year we do hope to have a proposed rule published this fall we've had some challenges with the program and we're trying to streamline it to make the application process easier for both the agency before importantly for applicants so we would certainly welcome comments on that regulation comes out nicely about that program even though it has a population limit of 20 valves and that has to be Han beneficiary so actually a university or a hospital in an urban area it could be an applicant for one of those Awards as long as they're providing service to communities of under 20,000 it's a great way to get first-class education from perhaps the urban area out to rural communities okay infrastructure loan program to mention that's the one that's been around for 60 years population limit on this is 5,000 or less and the loan funds are used to finance telecommunication services and rural areas has very low interest rate there said US Treasury rates depending upon the loan maturity and this is not a competitive program accept applications year-round on this program and we do have funds available for the program at this time anything that we do Finance has to be bribed and capable our broadband loan program this is the one that came out of the 2002 farm bill was reauthorized in 2008 and it's provide financing for broadband construction on a technology neutral basis again applications are accepted for this program on a year basis and we have funding available for this program at this time we've invested over a hundred and five million dollars in Virginia over the past several years for infrastructure development we've done Community Connect France is a DLT grand couple BLT mentions here and tell us is some of your pendant tell us okay they're one of the dip award is I didn't want to mention real quickly to other grant programs that we have they're not part of the rust programs they're part of our world business programs a lot of times we see startup companies that are interested in getting into broadband but they don't have the seed money they don't have what they need to get started before they come in and submit an application so there are two programs they're referred to as a bag and are bog the world business enterprise grants the opportunity grants that some of our smaller some tribal awardees have used to begin into our programs our bag is a grant program that is essentially it's for public bodies nonprofits for tribes the end result has to be to finance or develop a small emerging kind of business so this is a good opportunity to get a small grant to start a company that might be providing broadband and rural communities this one has a population of 50,000 it's a little confusing with an R do we have different definitions and we're all pretty much statutory in rd but this one is a 50,000 and you can see it's for you can use it for distance learning revolving loan funds an important thing is technical assistance so somebody trying to get into the business that needs some startup money for technical assistance this is a good grant program coming under these are the various grand purposes you can see startup operating costs technical assistance grow things that would be worthwhile to a telecom entity there's about twenty four million dollar appropriation for it and this is handled out of our state office it's not under a nofa you can just go and contact the state office and find out the availability of funds applications are scored but it's not competitive like the community connect grant program and you get in touch with the community programs director in our state office in Richmond if you're interested in this program our bog is a much smaller program it only has a little over two million dollars but it's promoting sustainable economic development that uses local resources and again this is a program that's been used by some of our grantees that have come in under community connect they've applied for these grant programs to help them get started up and come in and apply for we're going to expand eligible applicants of public bodies nonprofits drive coops this one has the 50,000 population with it and you can see the eligible uses of funds it's provide training to do business board leadership training it's to identify and analyze business opportunities that we use local resources so you can see how it could fit into the telecom business this one is done on an oppa it is competitive program nationwide the NOFA has not yet been published on this and opa should be out probably through next week to ten days and if you want your website you'll find out information on that program and again it's about 2.25 million dollars in the maximum grant is 50,000 um probably you're interested in learning more about our programs again Richard Jenkins is the GFR that covers Virginia we have a broadband coordinator in the state office and you can find out about our bag or are Bob and there is contact information that's out there a lot of people particularly want to talk about nofas or how to apply for the program the one hour we call our top 10 list how do I get money from our us so this is just our top 10 list and how you would apply say under community connector for one of our programs first step is you want to do your homework I'm getting into the telecom business is not for the faint of heart so you want to make sure you do your homework now that you want to actually get into the business do your research number nine is find out what assistance might be available from governor's office from the state public utility service and one of the resources are available out there that you could use to leverage perhaps one of our programs look at our website and we have success stories for all of our programs we usually contact information in there I'm going to see something that sounds like something that you're interested in doing you can call up one of the awardees and find out how they started the program with pitfalls they may have come under and they might be able to give you some practical experience number seven is to talk to the GFR I mean that's what they're here for that's the beauty of rural development we have field staff that are there to help you access our programs and if you can access our programs they no other resources to a lot of times and that you can access to perhaps help you with your business needs you want to make sure you read the NOFA and the program regulation the NOFA is be published regulation on how the program is going to operate if it's a competitive program and if it's not competitive we have a program regulation those are the rules of the road we have to abide by them you have to abide by them so you want to make sure you take a look at those application guides so I mentioned we have a copy of the application going out there for Community Connect it's pretty hands-on step-by-step application guide it gives you a lot of general information it gives you some pointers along the way things that we've found that I've been helpful for that you might want to look at that have been problems for some of our applicants we put a lot of information into the application why that should help guide you in the process if you're working under an OPA like Community Connect the application is jun 18 anybody know what happens if you submit an application on jun 19 we can't consider it and that has happened where we've had people that particularly in a rural area that we're off to the post office or to their fedex office to get an application and mail by the end of the day the car broke down or something happened and they couldn't get it in on time there's nothing we can do to make sure you know the deadline and down to try to beat the deadline by a couple days usually with the application guides you know there's a lot of things that we ask or there's a reason for all of them even though you may not know the reason why but give us everything we asked for even if you don't think it's applicable we ask for a list of 17 things and you give us 16 you're probably not going to make the application process everything that we asked for has to be in the app asian something that's important too is that you need to write the application is that the reader knows nothing about you and the agency has to be something that anybody can pick up and understand what you're applying for and the basis on which you're applying for it and all the support information Reliance's the proposal so make sure you write the application is if we know nothing about you and person looking at doesn't know anything about the agency and then one of the most important things that we find is to look at the application individually and as a whole lot of times we see applications that come in you may have like one team working on the technical aspects of the broadband performance you have another team working on the financial aspects you have engineers different people doing different parts and somebody puts it all together and submits it and oftentimes all the pieces don't make sense when you look at them collectively so make sure you look at all the pieces of the application individually and as a whole only for example will see that the technical plans call for the system to be built over three years but we see income coming in in the first year for where's the income coming in from if the system is going to be operational for three years to make sure you look at all parts of the application individually as a whole and this is all contact information for myself all my staff in Washington DC and you have the information for Richard Jenkins and there's a link to all the GFR throughout the country that parade help you and there again as Richards contact information our state office and Richmond that's everything for me for my voice survive for questions and answers we can certainly email them presentations around afterwards and so Michael will have you started and then we will M turn to questions yeah just good afternoon thank you again to lead and to the boss Center Warner for the leadership shown on this issue with the privilege to be here and thank you all for coming I am I'm going to talk about the FCC the Federal Communication Commission's Universal Service Fund program which is about a nine billion dollar program about four and a half billion dollars of which each year goes to fund telecommunications networks in rural America the Commission comprehensively comprehensively overhauled this program at the end of last year and so I want to talk you through and some of what we did and some of the exciting new opportunities that that's creating universal service program it's not a grant or loan program at least not in the usual way so it's a little bit different and from what r us does it grows out of the Commission's historical commitment to universal access to communications this was something that was written into the sort of founding DNA of the Commission when it was established in 1934 it was historically achieved through regulation of phone companies and through payments between phone companies and but things changed substantially in the 1996 Telecommunications Act which has helped convert this program over time to an explicit support mechanism to bring costs down for access to telecommunications for a variety of different kinds of users the way it works is contributions flow from telecommunications carriers through an assessment on their interstate revenues you've probably seen sometimes a universal service fee on your phone bills and that flows into from wireline companies wireless companies cable companies that provide voice service into the universal service find into four different programs high cost which is about four and a half billion dollars a year and goes to fund access in rural areas lifeline and which funds access for low-income Americans erate which funds telecommunications access for schools and libraries and rural health care I'm going to focus on high cost today and it's by far the largest of the four program doesn't had four and a half out of the nine billion and but I'm happy to talk about the others and the program as it existed prior to reform had a number of very significant problems which is why we've been hearing bipartisan calls for reform of this program for over a decade and why the Commission undertook reformed last fall they fall into two broad categories one is there was significant inefficiency and waste in the program as we inherited the most egregious example of this was the program would fund up to four or five or six carriers providing service in the same areas and there were other similar kinds of problems so that's number one number two the focus was the program was for the most part focus on phone service rather than broadband it had done a tremendous job of bringing phone service to rural America over the last decade decade and a half plus but we obviously now live in a world where broadband is the fundamental telecommunications infrastructure and so for both of those reasons and the Commission undertook what was essentially a once-in-a-generation overhaul of this program adopted in October of last year based around three essential principles one was to refocus this program on broadband bring robust home and business broadband to the over 18 million Americans who are unserved today and expand mobile coverage as well mobile voice and broadband coverage where it's lacking today while protecting existing voice and broadband service in rural areas that's point one point two at fiscal responsibility at fairness to the consumers who pay into this fund to be universal service fee and addressing the bipartisan calls to eliminate inefficiency and control costs recognizing that this was a very significant set of changes the commission also adopted through a recognition of business realities as the fun transitions attempt to phase in these changes over time and this is this is where we ended up so I'll talk through a little bit of how the program works or the focus on sort of the immediate opportunities what we did was we started off by taking a number of mesh measures to eliminate the inefficiencies that we'd seen in the program we wouldn't we said we were not going to send supplicated support to the same area we weren't going to support multiple providers writing serve to the same area we weren't going to spend scarce universal service dollars where there was an unsubsidized provider providing service and we were going to transition the program we're possible to competitive allocation of government money and we were going to increase the accountability for everyone who received support across the board and those changes freed up funding that allowed us to do a number of exciting thing so we for the first time directed the program to expressly make support for broadband capable networks a goal of the program we dedicated support for mobility making universal mobile service the goal for the first time and we created a separate mechanism to support the remotest area so let me sort of go through these in order we think about these in terms of fixed broadband so this is residential home broadband from you know maybe a wireline telco a cable company and this is funded has always been funded and I'm going to get the weeds here a little bit under it's always been funded in the universe program further than two streams one to larger phone companies called price cap carriers that serve the majority of the lines and has also have the majority of unserved customers the other two smaller carriers rate of return carriers for those who know this program very well you'll forgive me simplify a little bit historically the price cap mechanism had done a pretty good job of keeping costs down not a great job of incenting broadband build out the rate of return pump program sort of vice versa hopefully david will forgive me for that bathroom oversimplification but what we did was the following and price cap the larger company areas we fundamentally reform the system in two stages to refocus it on consenting broadband build-up and i'll talk about those in a moment in rate of return smaller company areas we largely left the system the same but we did create greater accountability for the broadband obligate for broad bed bailed out for those companies so starting july first the smaller carriers will have an obligation that receive money under this program will have an obligation to provide broadband upon reasonable request to the people in their service area that's the sort of Holman and business broadband side for mobile broadband again comprehensively overhauled the system and we're going to put out new funding for mobile service in two phases starting with three hundred million dollars through an auction a competitive bidding process in September which I'll talk about again in a little bit more detail and then in the second phase five hundred million dollars on an annual basis to support ongoing support and then finally recognizing that within any reasonable budget there's some extremely high cost outlying areas that it's cost prohibitive to support with the other mechanisms we set aside a dedicated fund to look at innovative technologies other ways of funding the very remotest areas whether that subsidizing satellite service fixed wireless other sorts of things so that's the basic structure of the reform let me talk about what we've been doing so start with connect America fun phase one this is the first phase of the reform to bring broadband focused on fixed areas we launched this at the end of April we announced the way the program works we announced availability of three hundred million dollars up to three hundred million dollars in one-time support to rapidly bring broadband to areas that don't have it today the way the program works within universe as a whole is the money has to flow to eligible telecommunications companies typically the telephone companies that provide service in these areas so this three hundred million dollars comes from savings in the program as it exists and and phone companies have the opportunity to accept the money they get seven hundred seventy five dollars for each unserved location they they would serve they have 90 days to let us know how much of the support that's allocated to them they would accept the new funding will come with a tough filled out and accountability requirements so for megabits down one megabit up speed requirement latency usage carriers will have to deploy to two-thirds of the locations within two years and finish the project within three years this is the first rapid injection of funds new broadband funds under their form and it's very exciting that's oh and let me let me so this is we've put up as we've done each of these things maps on the Commission's website this is a map it builds on the NTIA National Broadband map it shows unserved areas and you can go online and get a sense of what areas are available for support under phase one of the connect America fun let me talk now from in about mobility and the reforms you get around mobility where as I said very exciting it was the first time the Commission has ever recognized universal mobile service including Universal broadband as an express goal of the fund and as we did that again we did it in two phases so the first phase will be three hundred million dollars in one-time support to areas that don't have 3g coverage today it will be given out based on a competitive process a what we call a reverse auction basically the way it works is we've announced the areas that are eligible for support and and we've looked at the metric we're going to use is the number of road miles in those areas which we use road miles rather than homes because it's important for mobile coverage and so we have carriers come in and they tell us essentially and how much they believe it would cost to cover certain number of road miles we compare the bids and we fund the bids that give us essentially the best value for the universal service dollar we announced the rules ineligible areas may second applications for the auction are due july 11 and the auction will actually take place at the end of September of this year winners will be required as says to deploy three they have a choice of deploying a 3g network or 4g network and to incent providers to do 4g recognising also that the you know that for some carriers it's a little bit of a longer path to get there they're required to either deploy 3g in two years or 4g in three years and and again if you want to get a sense of where this funding is available our team has put up a great map on the Commission website that you can zoom in see different areas it shows you where we think broadband is lacking today these are areas eligible for support you can zoom in you can mouse over and see the number of road miles and so on in each in each area and this will be used as the basis for the auction and so that's that those two three hundred million dollar programs are sort of the immediate infusion of funds under this reform and so now let me talk a little bit about what's next so the way the fixed program phase two of the fixed program will ultimately work consists of two parts so we are currently in the process of doing a comprehensive modeling exercise to estimate the cost of providing broadband service across the country as we complete that process we will say to each of the phone companies who serve incumbent phone companies who serve a state or eligible carriers under the program will give them a choice to accept what we call a statewide broadband commitment so for the amount of funding we estimate it should efficiently cost to play it they will can take that funding and will be required to serve all the supported locations in their service territory across the state so essentially to bring broadband to all their locations across the state if the carrier we hope many carriers will accept they may not all we intend to strike a hard bargain to make sure we get good value for money to the extent carriers declined to make that commitment we will go to a competitive process to serve the areas where the existing incumbent carrier has said they're not willing to provide broadband that's ongoing the Commission's October order aimed to get the model completed by the end of this year and that's the target we're still shooting towards that's for again the home and business a sort of fixed location piece of the puzzle similarly for mobility fund and their will we have about five we have 500 million that will be available for ongoing support for extending mobile networks unlike the 300 million which is sort of a one-time shot in the arm this would be an annual revenue stream and will be awarded to a modeling process like what we're doing for home and business broadband or through reverse auction like we're doing in September and part based on the learning we get in September and that will be that will happen you know again we're aiming at foods the end of this year early next year and then finally the remote areas fun so we're working on those implementing those three pieces of the puzzle and and then a number of other significant implementation questions the Commission is working through and subsequent rulemaking proceedings and follow on orders by the staff and any sort of major reform of this type there's always a lot of tweaks to be made adjustments and following questions the answer that that sort of thing so that is the universal service fund overhaul that we did like I said this is just the rural peace we also have low income schools and libraries funding as well as rural health care and I'm happy to talk a little bit more about those in the community great so we will and we'll start questions and just so everyone has a sense of the timing our plan is to go till about 205 or maybe 210 and give everyone a few minutes the for center one arrives at 2 15 and but if there are you know a lot of questions and we're happy to accommodate them and of course get you contact information for the appropriate representatives and copies of live slides so anyone like to start otherwise I can some questions to which they may not like these rural is artist upon we have about 40 major program based upon the statute richa native from so I work in the housing programs they can't programs that all depends upon the recently that we were asked with every one definition so there is some consideration you have to be careful and look at and just so everyone knows think the definition you're referring to is going from 20,000 to 50,000 is that right is that a more consistent number or is it a different issue is there any distress comment um well the part of the whole formula d mission is to have the whole it go up to the 50 thousands of these point you get more consideration if you would probably town those and I think the other one of the discussion is the the Senate is getting ready to consider the farm bill and that's where some of these conversations are happening so you're curious about that and sorry I think I saw your hand first that's one of the things that we're considering changing to the future right now we required attire something build instead world like more regional approach or different approach we're going to be proposing future right now County representative the town in the county what a Judas house we have dsl County County separate your addiction doesn't really have deployment how would that work if you have the pockets with dsl in the middle of counter if there's any broadband there guess it's from so it's I only just apply and through those Arians of all goes as a community that's unser part of a community commonly referred to the community of sir we went up about 14 billion dollars and programs that we try to get it to the area we are the folks in here is that narrowly is typically held within the county law separate jurisdiction just home and that exclusion and is one of the considerations that we have that's that's another rule making totally we'll be putting and I think on the policy side these are exactly the kinds of issues that we would love to hear from you all about the senator has been engaged in discussions with both r us and FCC and i think that you're right the questions that we get the most often in the senate office is this issue of kind of you know whether it's a checkerboard or whether there are communities that are neighboring or you know some folks have high value broadband and other people have to 56k modem which is almost kind of a joke and it's not sufficient and i think for the senator at least he probably doesn't he does not think that that would be an acceptable baseline I don't know if you could maybe talk a little bit about the kind of the speed question but is there any discussion about kind of having that develop over time or is there somebody index that I guess it's really then our vision that the speed requirement we have areas that are ready for these indicate in the accelerated program a thousand people at Easter Loudon because i'm wondering if providers like the way the statute is written for us we have divided service eligible telecommunication that can include cable companies kicked a finding the state calls going through phone company the way we've set up the program on with respect to the home in Resident home in business projects with fixed bug and we've given the incumbent phone companies in many cases first bite at the Apple and that's you know you have on the one hand the principle that wanted to allocate this money headed Lee and quite possibly had on the other hand the program uses today instead of network existed today so the three hundred million dollars that we're making available in the short term will go to incumbent the incumbent phone company so probably not both not comcast but whoever the phone company is exert that area whether it's verizon down so verizon has a certain amount of money allocated within the program and it will have to choose internet 9j less than that whether or not to accept that and i truly encourage all of you to reach out to your carrier or settle any and you know that they'll be making a guess a business decision but at the same time i think they want to see the money accepted they want to see the carrier's partner that's actually exactly well we have carriers in our second panel to kind of start some of those conversations our hope is whether it's in community connector or em the mobility fund that there might be some relationships out there some companies that you're not familiar with or maybe who aren't familiar with you and where we could you know there are companies that do want to build out and there are obviously communities in Virginia that want broadband and so we're hoping that we might be able to encourage some of those partnerships and if you think the Senate Center Warner's office can help you please let me know where let Kelly Mercer know and thank you by the way first language County you're from if everyone else could just for guests here let them know which county or if it's Kenny might not know maybe tell them where it is I saw your hand wave before so 200 kilobit so does that say any County anyplace location to get a satellite based system is excluded from applying to lose a little treacherous satellite wouldn't be counted definitely and it's just for Community Connect ran program again that will be publishing of water probably tie in to the farm bill and Oh to the mobile provided wondering having permited them over a year ago on having several departments distal them they'd still be able that money will they've already have facilities forbidden to Fort Meade you've set up a number of safeguards to do and very best we can to make sure the funding goes to work areas where it wouldn't care to be building anyway I'm recognizing that it's not going to be perfect and we're trying to get sort of the racket injection funding what we've said is so first of all we built that map using commercial data we gave all the carriers not community to say either we're serving here or somebody else is serving here or we're not serving as we ran talent closet and the map I showed you as the result of that that sort of the starting point then we have a set of other requirements we're not allowing carriers to fit for funding in any place where they is in their corporate sellout plans to build within the next three years and we've also excluded areas where carriers made an enforceable commitment to a government entity whether it's but us whether it's at GI a what is part of Agriculture whether it's state or local government that those areas won't be sort of double blended and you know the bid came in and discovered that there was a problem well simply having a firm that permit local government may be different today and enjoy get some springbok factor I would like to reinforce the regulatory understand much of what we're dealing with but for us we have areas of our county after all man however program between your area catch-22 situation being excluded doing a lot of your program Facebook mapping that's our area are horribly nothing published yet about a clean easy way to correct so your math show my area having dsl they show my area have a wireless signal either but on top of that carrier she's making the best care we have less than six central offices covering the entire area rest areas served out of smaller wiring some of the wiring center that dsl dslam don't know where their rbs LP stands there pull no one can get on into someone moves or dies and there's no more investment in pain so will you tell me is someone was working very hard over county's economic development right now that we've got broadband we can attract business process because it applies they can't come in and get service which your Mac says we've got service and the extent that we can help you knew your regulatory process we have to address this we have to address scheme it is not high enough actually attractive we have to address mapping that you're basically program long but don't tell the whole story expectedly to help you those are two areas that absolutely come at the top of the farm bill day off we are changing put in a regulation community with an application herman's that area in life ok and I just had heard that Senator Warner is gonna be pulling or is pulling up now so he'll be joining us in just a minute but Pat that might be something where we can work with you all we've actually talked to our us a little bit about some mapping issues that the state of Virginia had also raised I think of other people have have feedback on that especially in a really like granular details please let me know I've got all my cards out there you can email Kelly if you know her and she'll get the questions to me we can kind of go from there I'm sure the extent you can work with your state it's very important for us problem for hopeful that you know historically at least at the federal level the map has been used as an information gathering exercise we are now starting to use it personal funds the hope is that that will get it right and one of the policy issues out there is Virginia actually has a better map than the national map it's at the address level which means all the data is very granular and part of again to your point pet because the National maps of the census block level there are areas that look like they are fully covered and in fact they or not and of course if you live in that community you know that but people in Washington may or may not know that but I think there are some folks were interested in or because we've been bugging them about this have a hard from us already and we would be really happy to kind of continue that conversation I just wanted to see if we get in a couple more questions please yes early boy Thomas Caroline County about a mile south winds over I think it was mr. Kawana mentioned that the distance learning program which I think most of us in York County folks and things like that we can work schools and two birds with one stone did that once you understand you to say that it is not being opened this year and you're actually awarding things from last year correct no I don't know about you but I couldn't do that in my County I mean you're the federal government so I'm going to assume you can but I couldn't do that my county is that most normal most of our programs are very oversubscribed ten to one we have so many eligible application changes in program no new applications 30 nations and so 13 is weak it's not modeling it but it's M it's the way that will be evaluating kids so when I the way this closet repetitive processes and it's useful we call reverse auction it's and it's an innovation in the policy space it's a way to take scarce dollars and fairly efficiently distribute them where they can do it was good the way we've done that is we mapped as you saw the areas where we believe their service and we've asked carriers come in and say how much money they would need to cover those areas and as we're waiting the bids against each other the metric that we're going to use his eccentric dollars for Road mile we're using roads well we're using we're so one way you could do it would be two dollars per home and we looked at that in there's a fair bit of correspondence between roads and homes but in any event there's also wrote go to workplaces and you know community anchor institutions things like that and then in addition people just want mobile coverage on the roads themselves and so you know legally camera operator all the drug the tectum Indian history I mean kids on school buses things like that and so just secondary roads readers plumber it's most wrote so I am happy but all we done something I don't know the exact definition that their federal dollars trying to get Oh network

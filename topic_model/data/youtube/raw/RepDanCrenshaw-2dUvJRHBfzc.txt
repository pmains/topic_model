[Music] everybody welcome to our second episode talking to Texans with me I have some great photos from Texas A&M Health Science Center welcome well thank you actually I like well I love Texas A&M I exist because of Texas and that's where my parents met I always very grateful to all and we had some really interesting conversations today we were talking about direct primary care so briefly what do you think about direct primary care what is it I'm a family physician so I actually like it it's it's a model of where people pay a small amount of money per month which gives them access to either a doctor or a team doctor a nurse practitioner maybe a social worker give us some better access than if they call them it's only about six weeks it gives them more clarity about what charges actually are well and it in a motivation to get continuity of care we know it makes a difference to see the same provider or a group of providers over time this makes it easy for them to do it in the monies are anything babe I love that and full disclosure have been working on this for quite a while and more to come on direct primary care we're gonna figure out how to totally revolutionize the health care market and finally get you that doctor-patient relationship that you miss so much so that's what we thought about today thanks for coming y'all thank you so much

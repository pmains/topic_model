good evening South Carolina it is my privilege tonight to make an introduction but first I want to brag on a few people I want to say on behalf of this campaign team which we call team Graham because it wasn't about one person there's about an entire group of people that came together for a Cause bigger than themselves we made this team into something powerful for the state of South Carolina and the Republican Party first first we want to say thank you to the donors that allowed us the resources to be able to run a strong campaign we want to thank the awesome best in the country interns and volunteers that got up early we built here in South Carolina one of the strongest political machines the Republican Party has ever seen and we are proud of it we had a hundred and seventy-six county chairman 5200 precinct captains we had coalition's of National Security leaders pro-family leaders sportsmen students young professionals and farmers those volunteers helped us distribute 20,000 yard signs 25,000 bumper stickers and ladies and gentlemen these volunteers volunteers made 1.1 million phone calls not to mention not to mention millions of emails that were sent Facebook posts that were liked tweets that were retweeted and photos that were posted we could not have done any of that without you all i also want to take a special moment to thank our staff the best staff and the best political team and the entire country thank you team brown thank you for working such long hours thank you to our families for giving us the ability and the freedom to work so hard for this man that I am now proud to introduce ladies and gentlemen the South Carolina's Republican nominee for the United States Senate Lindsey Graham not yeah Nicole's got to go to bed here first I want to thank my opponents and their families for participating a democracy a round of applause for all those who got into the ring it's no easy thing to do I've been called by several of them and I appreciate it and debt bowers prayed for me on the phone and I thought that was a very classy thing to do so thank you all so I want to thank the good Lord and I promise y'all try not to screw this up I'll try to serve in a way that would be pleasing I want to thank the voters without you we would all be crying right now do those who voted for me I'm not going to let you down I can't promise you you'll always agree with me but I promise you I will do what I think is best for all of us to those who win a different way I'll try to earn your respect and promise you that when it comes to South Carolina I will always put our state's interest ahead of my own and over time I hope I can convince you that we have more in common than we have indifference to the tea party activists to the traditional Republicans libertarians vegetarians Republicans who hop on one foot let's come together November I'm tired of losing when we lose we all lose when we win we all win so to the Republican Party we're back in the game folks to Sky if you ever want to run for the Senate have an anal retentive conservative running your campaign Scott farmer has done an incredible job is sacrificed time away from his family he has worked his well I can't say that he has put his heart into my campaign and I am so proud of him I could not be more proud of your own son to the people who gave me all this money god bless you but what we did tonight money can't buy it sure helps but money can't buy what happened tonight to team Graham the people who jump up and down with signs and who have been cussed out on the phone trying to yes I know I've got the most dedicated group of volunteers and you honor me by the way you've conducted yourself we put our signs up we don't take other people's down so without the volunteers this would just be business this is not business this is a cause to my Senate staff you will not get a raise but you're much appreciated anybody remember Strom Thurmond he told me two things he said life is short which I thought was very odd for him to say that to me it was 94 when he said it but he said take care of people they'll take care of you as to my staff you honor me by your hard work in your dedication and I hear everywhere I go in South Carolina about your efforts on behalf of the people of South Carolina politics is about big issues but to me is also about little people is about people have nobody to fight for them somebody has to intervene on their behalf to tell the v8 to do better to get their social security benefits to me as long as I'm the senator from South Carolina it will always be about the people and I do have the best campaign organization in the entire United States Senate and to my family i'll try to get through this cool i'll get back to this come back some observations conservatism to me is not about who i hate about what i love the Republican Party is doing well in 2014 because the Democratic Party really screwed up do you all agree with that I want an alternative to the Democratic Party I want a positive agenda laid out by the republican party for the American people I want some form of the contract with america i am tired just about I'm tired about complaining about Democrats all the time I want to say something positive about us and folks I've heard every everybody in every corner of the state feels that the Republican Party's got like to offer and we need to lay it out because I love my party and we've got a lot offered offer to the American people we need to tell them what we're fart not just what we're against another observation leadership and problem solving comes with some political risk you get a bunch of people running against you but I'm here to tell you it's very much worth it one thing I've said continuously is that I want to put the country ahead of party in the South Carolina Republican conservatives said you're right Lindsey so to the South Carolina Republican Party thank you for validating what I've been trying to do what this election means to me everybody's going to tell me what it means to me you're going to write about what it means to me and what it means to everybody else but I'm the best one to tell you what it means to me and I'm going to tell you a positive campaign can win we never run one negative commercial voters actually pay attention don't don't sell them short problem solving is not inconsistent with being a good conservative Ronald Reagan told us that and the people of South Carolina validated that tonight in the Republican primary one thing I've learned about this election what it means to me in South Carolina we love the military we love our troops and you know what we're going to have the back of those politicians who have their back and that was Lindsey Graham tonight you had my back because I have their back one thing I learned tonight is that we're not a bunch of isolationist in South Carolina we believe in peace through strength and when it comes to radical Islam we're going to fight you over there so you don't come here one thing I've learned that young people actually do care about politics unbelievable we had over 20 chapters of Lindsey Graham college people and I have embraced girl bling to party have you noticed I've embraced selling conservatism to more people conservatism as an asset folks not a liability but how you sell it really does matter it's okay to smile it's okay to believe that conservatism is the best hope for young people because it is the last six years has not worked out very well for you if you're an african-american or Hispanic young person there are better days ahead if you want them to be don't take our party don't write our party off make the other party earn your vote give us a chance folks take another look at the Republican Party and I hope we will offer you something that you haven't had in a while real hope now we made a big deal about me trying to get things done have you noticed the ads the conservative leader who gets results I really try to solve problems because I think that's part of the job and what my opponents so as my biggest fault which was trying to solve a problem south carolina republicans saw is my greatest asset now where do we go from here we go back to the Senate and we're going to win in November we've given away probably for Senate seats in the last four years this won't be number five we're going to win and we're going to win decisively and I'm going back with a trailblazing wonderful man call Tim Scott Tim my friend I look forward to serving with you I think you may have dipped under 90 but you can always do better but my number one goal when I go back is to set an we Republicans and Democrats and see if we can rebuild the military before we all destroy it nineteen forty levels in the Army the smallest Navy since nineteen fifteen the smallest Air Force in modern history is a dumb idea to the American people al Qaeda is on the rise we admit they may think we have forgotten about them but they have not forgotten about us and the only thing between us and them is a strong robust military I want to go back and repeal and replace Obamacare before it's too late but I don't want to repeat the mistakes they make I'd like it to be a bipartisan product where everybody has to say and we do something on health care that makes sense not just a liberal stream I want to build the Keystone pipeline not just talk about the damn thing i want to send less of our money overseas to people who hate our guts and give some to canada who come to Myrtle Beach and spend it to our Canadian friends thank you for coming to myrtle beach in march nobody else wants to go swimming I'd like to save Social Security and Medicare because they're important when I was 21 my mom died when I was 22 my dad died you've heard this story from darling if it weren't for Social Security survivor benefits we wouldn't made it that money we receive from Social Security helped us we moved in with an aunt and uncle my uncle passed man burnham a is she's hanging in there they never made over twenty-five thousand dollars in her life I know what social security can do for a family in need that's why I want to save it to my Democratic friends Social Security is worth saving if you need a partner Lindsey Graham is here Medicare is a safety net is falling apart we're on the road to Greece 80 million baby boomers are going to retire in the next 20 to 30 years where do the new workers come from strom had four kids after he was 67 if you're not willing to do that we got to come up with a new idea I've got a new idea merit-based rational immigration that will serve America to the Republican Party to those who believe that our immigration system is broken you're absolutely right to those who want better border security you're right there's no way to stop it if you don't secure your border for those who believe we need more legal immigration God knows you're right it's hard to find workers in certain areas of our economy to those who believe that we should control a job better than we do take South Carolina's Eve arif I and go nationally give an employer chance to do it right they cheek put them in jail or take their business I want to fix it once and for all I don't want a third wave of illegal immigration to the 11 million I will be firm and I will be fair if our democratic friends will help us control the border in a real way control who gets a job in a real way put legal immigration in good standing so our employers don't have to cheat I will solve the 11 million in a practical way you have to learn the language to stay here I say that not animosity but you can't be successful if you do not learn the English language to the felons among the 11 million you're not welcome off you go to the rest who have American citizen children and grandchildren I understand why everybody wants to come to America but we just can't let everybody come have you ever wondered when we're not being overrun by legal Canadians I've never met an illegal Canadian that I know of is a sound economy and a rule of law nation the people that are here illegally come from very poor in corrupt countries and I understand that but as a nation we have a right to control our own destiny to the 11 million you will have to learn the language pay a fine work pay taxes get in the back of the line and wait 10 years because that's what happens when you break the law then you got to wait to everybody clears the line ahead of you then you'll get a shot at the American dream you'll have many hurdles to overcome but I believe ladies and gentlemen that's the right way to solve this problem I believe it's the only practical way to solve this problem and my election had a lot to do with illegal immigration do you agree here's what south carolina republicans are saying tonight i can't speak for other Republicans we want Lindsay to fix this and lindsay will finally we're going to deepen the port of Charleston I think everybody in the country knows about the port of Charleston and we're going to get it to 50 feet

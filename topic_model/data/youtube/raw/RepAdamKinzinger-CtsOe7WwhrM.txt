THERE'S JUST NOTHING ELSE THAT  WOULD LEND YOU TO BELIEVE  THERE'S ANY FACTS. >>> JOINING US NOW, REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSMAN OF THE JANUARY 6th  COMMITTEE ADAM KINZINGER. CONGRESSMAN, I WANT TO GET TO  RAY EPPS IN A SECOND. FIRST THIS BREAKING NEWS. YOUR COMMITTEE SENDING A LETTER  TO YOUR LEADER, KEVIN McCARTHY,  THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM McCARTHY? DO YOU THINK HE'LL COOPERATE? >> HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING YET. I CERTAINLY HOPE HE DOES. DO I THINK HE WILL? WE'LL SEE. BUT HOLDING A TITLE IN CONGRESS  DOESN'T MAKE YOU EXEMPT FROM  HAVING TO BE -- TO BRING  INFORMATION YOU MAY HAVE RELATED TO SUCH A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION. IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN REPORTED  THAT THE PRESIDENT CALLED HIM ON JANUARY 6th AND SAID, KEVIN,  OBVIOUSLY, THESE PEOPLE CARE  MORE ABOUT THE ELECTION THAN YOU DO. THAT'S INFORMATION WE WANT TO  TALK TO HIM ABOUT. SO CERTAINLY HOPE HE DOES  VOLUNTARILY COOPERATE AFTER ALL. IT'S THE BODY HE SERVES IN DOING THE WORK THAT THE BODY HAS BEEN  CHARGED WITH DOING. WE'LL SEE -- HAVE TO SEE HOW IT  GOES P. LET'S ASSUME THE WORST  ABOUT KEVIN McCARTHY FOR A  SECOND. I DON'T KNOW WHY I'D DO THAT BUT LET ME PLAY THAT GAME. WOULD THE COMMITTEE SUBPOENA HIM IF HE OPTS TO NOT VOLUNTARILY  TELL YOU THE TRUTH? >> YEAH, I THINK AS THE CHAIRMAN SAID, IT'S ON THE TABLE. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A  NUMBER OF MEMBERS THAT WOULD  PROBABLY FACE US. YOU'RE NOT EXEMPT FROM HAVING TO COME AND TESTIFY. THAT'S AN ISSUE WE'RE WORKING  THROUGH AS A COMMITTEE AND  FIGURING OUT WHAT CAN THESE  PEOPLE PROVIDE THAT WE CAN OR  CAN'T GET SOMEWHERE ELSE AND  WE'LL MAKE A DECISION FROM  THERE. >> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO ASK HIM? THE LETTER SEEMED TO SUGGEST HE  KNEW THERE WAS A SCHEME TO  OVERTURN THE ELECTION BY NOT  COUNTING THE ELECTORAL VOTES. >> THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS  I'M CURIOUS ABOUT. WHAT DID HE KNOW PRIOR TO  JANUARY 6th. ON A CALL JANUARY 1st I DIRECTLY TOLD HIM THERE WAS GOING TO BE  VIOLENCE. I PREDICTED VIOLENCE AND IT WAS  VERY MUCH DISMISSED AND JUST  SAID NEXT CALLER. IT WAS A LARGE CONFERENCE CALL. HE MADE THE DECISION TO OBJECT  TO THE ELECTORS. ALL THAT LED UP TO JANUARY 6th. IT CONVINCED PEOPLE THAT, IN  FACT, JANUARY 6th WAS SOME  PATRIOTIC DUTY TO FIGHT AGAINST  THE STOLEN ELECTION. OF COURSE, HE'S VERY CLOSE WITH  THE FORMER PRESIDENT. HE HAD THE CONVERSATION ON THAT  DAY AND MAYBE MORE. AND I THINK THAT'S OF INTEREST  TO THE COMMITTEE AS WE GET TO  THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED ON  THAT DAY AND WHAT LED UP TO THAT DAY. >> YOUR COMMITTEE ALSO TALKED  WITH KAYLEIGH McENANY. DID SHE HAVE ANYTHING TO  CONTRIBUTE THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW  BEFORE? >> I'M NOT GOING TO, YOU KNOW,  TALK ABOUT WHAT WAS TESTIFIED TO OR WHAT WASN'T. I'LL JUST SAY THAT AS THE  SUBPOENA REQUIRED, SHE APPEARED  AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE. I'M SURE AS INFORMATION -- AS  FOLKS PUT THE PIECES OF THIS  PUZZLE TOGETHER, WE'LL FIND OUT  THE BIGGER PICTURE. >> LET'S TURN TO THE RAY EPPS  CONSPIRACY THEORY AND WATCH A  CLIP OF EPPS, WELL, THERE IS  THIS CLIP OF EPPS THE NIGHT  BEFORE THE INSURRECTION AND THEN DURING THE INSURRECTION. THE NIGHT BEFORE HE SAYS  TOMORROW WE NEED TO GO TO THE  CAPITOL, PEACEFULLY, PEACEFULLY, AND THEN ON JANUARY 6th, HE SAYS TAKE A STEP BACK. WE'RE HOLDING GROUND. WE DON'T WANT TO GET HURT AND  THE CROWD IS CHANTING FED, FED,  FED. YOU TWEETED A COLORFUL THREAD  ABOUT THIS BASELESS CONSPIRACY. YOU SAID, QUOTE, HE DIDN'T ENTER THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6th AND  WAS REMOVED FOR THE MOST WANTED  LIST BECAUSE HE BROKE NO LAWS. I'M PRETTY SURE THE FBI WOULDN'T BE DUMB ENOUGH TO PUT THEIR OWN  AGENT ON A WANTED LIST. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES  OF YOURS IN THE HOUSE AND TED  CRUZ IN THE SENATE PUSHING OUT  THIS NONSENSE, AND I DON'T EVEN  UNDERSTAND WHY. >> SO THIS IS PART OF THIS WHOLE FLOOD THE ZONE WITH CONFUSION,  WITH CONSPIRACY. IN FACT, NOW THE REACTION IS,  YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHY  WASN'T HE ARRESTED? BECAUSE HE DID SAY GO INTO THE  CAPITOL. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS ANY TIME YOU CALL THEM OUT ON BS, THERE'S A  CIRCULAR ARGUMENT AND ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. THE TRUTH IS THE CONSPIRACY SAID THAT RAY EPPS WAS AN FBI AGENT. RAY EPPS IS NOT AN FBI AGENT. AND THAT IS THE CRUX OF THIS FBI CONSPIRACY THAT SOMEHOW MAYBE  THEIR OWN BASE IS TOO STUPID TO  BE ABLE TO RESIST SOMEHOW AN  FBI-INSPIRED INSURRECTION. THAT'S THE KIND OF GARBAGE WE'RE DEALING WITH. AND THIS IS NEW. HIS NAME IS NEW TO A LOT OF  PEOPLE. FOR ABOUT THE LAST THREE MONTHS  IT'S BEEN GROWING ON RIGHT WING  TWITTER AND CONSPIRACY BLOGS TO  THE POINT WHERE WHATEVER PERCENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TAKE IT  AS FACT AS RAY EPPS WAS AN FBI  AGENT. HE WAS NOT. THIS WAS MAINSTREAMED YESTERDAY  WHEN TED CRUZ ASKED SPECIFICALLY TO THE FBI ABOUT RAY EPPS. THEY CAN'T COMMENT AS THEY DON'T ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THAT  WAS SEEN AS EVEN FURTHER OF A  CONSPIRACY. THIS IS WHY CONSPIRACY THEORIES  CAN'T BE IGNORED WITH THIS NEW  SOCIAL MEDIA ENVIRONMENT. THEY HAVE TO BE NIPPED IN THEIR  INFANCY. >> AND ALSO BECAUSE YOU HAVE  PEOPLE WHO YOU'D THINK WOULD  KNOW BETTER LIKE U.S. SENATORS  AND HOUSE MEMBERS MAINSTREAMING  THIS STUFF. I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO  SOMETHING I SAW TODAY THAT WAS  KIND OF SHOCKING. SO THE MAYOR OF D.C. MURIEL  BOWSER PUT OUT A TWEET ABOUT NEW REGULATIONS IN D.C. PROOF OF VACCINATION IF YOU GO  TO A RESTAURANT AND ALSO A  MASKING ORDER. YOUR REPUBLICAN HOUSE COLLEAGUE, CONGRESSMAN WARREN DAVIDSON OF  OHIO, RESPONDED TO THAT WITH A  PICTURE OF NAZI IMAGERY OF A  NAZI ORDER AND WROTE, THIS HAS  BEEN DONE BEFORE, #DO NOT  COMPLY. HE ADDED A COMMENT. LET'S RECALL THE NAZIS  DEHUMANIZED JEWISH PEOPLE BEFORE SEGREGATING THEM. A JEWISH DEMOCRAT CONFRONTED  DAVIDSON ON THE FLOOR OF THE  HOUSE TODAY AND TOLD ME, HE SAID I COULD REPORT THIS, I TOLD HIM  THE USE OF SUCH IMAGERY WASN'T  JUST REPUGNANT AND DANGEROUS AND FALSE EQUIVALENCY BUT DEEPLY  OFFENSIVE AND PAINFUL FOR JEWISH PEOPLE. I SAID I'D DEBATE WHENEVER HE  WANTS BUT THERE'S NO DEBATE ON  THE OFFENSIVENESS OF THIS POST. >> HE'S GOING TO RAISE MONEY ON  THIS. HE'S GOING TO BE KNOWN. THIS IS THE NEW POLITICS. IT'S NOT ABOUT -- IT'S ABOUT HOW CAN WE OUTRAGE THE OTHER PERSON  THAT JUST HAD THE GREATEST  OUTRAGE. LOOK. YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH VACCINE  MANDATES IN RESTAURANTS. THERE'S SOME OF IT I DISAGREE  WITH, BUT TO SAY THAT THAT'S  SOMEHOW EQUIVALENT TO ADOLF  HITLER EARLY STAGES? I WOULD ENCOURAGE WARREN OR  ANYBODY ELSE TO GO BACK AND  MAYBE TAKE A HISTORY LESSON OF  WHAT HAPPENED IN WORLD WAR II,  WHAT HAPPENED TO 6 MILLION JEWS. IT IS INSANE. THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO KEEP YOU HEALTHY. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, THE NAZIS WEREN'T INTERESTED IN KEEPING  THE JEWISH PEOPLE HEALTHY. THAT'S A BASIC START TO THIS. IF WE GO DOWN THIS LEVEL AS A  PARTY, SHAME ON US. AS WE GO DOWN THIS LEVEL AS A  PEOPLE, SHAME ON US AND EVERY  REPUBLICAN LEADER NEEDS TO BE  CONDEMNING THAT KIND OF BS RIGHT NOW AND SAYING THERE'S NO PLACE  FOR THAT. INSTEAD THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT  DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT LIZ  CHENEY AND ADAM KINZINGER SHOULD BE REPUBLICANS AND NOT SOMEONE

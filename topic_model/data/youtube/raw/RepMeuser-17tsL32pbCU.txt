thank you to ranking member luka meyer uh it is certainly a somber day here in the small business committee and um on a number of fronts but seeing our friend's name plate and him not behind it is very very sad jim told it like it was uh telling the truth was always the only option because our country's national security and economy is truly at stake so let's get into this the in my district you know all this idea that the biggest problem small business has is or small business has this big business in my district with the exception of big tech and i was in business for 25 years and i served as revenue secretary for the commonwealth for four years so i saw all the all the taxable incomes and who was doing what and so forth but the exception of big tech these days and online retailers and definitely amazon um there's big government is not the problem or excuse me big big business is not the problem for small business it's it's big government but so let's let's unpack this a little bit let's let's talk about it dr holtz egan so in the in the bbb uh our our friends uh who passed it i thought it was a wonderful idea to tack on a 3.8 percent surt tax on investment income for pass-throughs was that good for small business no and before i expand on that i'll just point out that you know if you look at the nfib monthly survey of small businesses that never is competing with large business mentioned as their biggest problem right that's mentioned by one percent okay people precisely precisely and my my me search reflects your research throughout all of my my district and i visit my small businesses regularly let's try to do a little bit of so the surtas just remember that more than half of all business income is taxed on individual income tax returns it's not taxed on on c corporations precisely and so that's where you're going to hit small businesses right and under 400k in income it's it's hurting their their their taxable income for a small business and then some would making the trump tax cuts permanent be good for small business yes the uncertainty predictability keeping it where it is they know where they're going to be the following year because as we well know a tax is nothing more than an added cost and if we think it's a great idea to make cost of our businesses large and small uh higher than it is worldwide um well then you know somebody's gonna have to have to dispute gravity for me because it simply doesn't doesn't work that way and of course profits lead to more investment in your company lead to higher taxable incomes which in fact lead to higher revenues in the in the coffers of our of our treasure treasury so are heavy regulations good for small business no doctor no i mean there are 210 billion dollars added this year that's not something that small business is benefiting by um so there are benefits to regulations they better be bigger than 210 billion so i have some questions about that you know very often government content is a far cry from what their the end results are because it's ridiculous to think that the regulations of 14 months ago somehow are so much better today at a cost of 210 billion dollars that are helping somebody it's not helping anyone but a bunch of bureaucrats uh work work on forcing it um and and so is um is government spending heavy government spending trillions of dollars in government spending a cause or an inhibitor of inflation it is one of the causes of the us one of the cause of inflation is inflation good for small business no no inflation is not not good for small business it robs small business and it leads to higher interest rates are higher interest rates good for small business no okay we're we're the small business committee we're supposed to be advocates for small business these policies aren't exactly advocating for small business wouldn't you agree uh they're not good for the business community as a whole so how about workforce is government competing uh providing benefits to workforce and making gov workforce less available is that good for small business well we have a very big workforce problem in the united states right now and it's in part due to the policies of the cares act and some successors uh it's also due to a failure to have an effective public health mission against the pandemic which has harmed labor supply in both the number of people and how much they can work big government meddling no question is higher gasoline prices good for small business no spikes and gasoline prices is an assault on our domestic energy industry which in my district contains many many small businesses suppliers providers is that assault that's taking place on our domestic energy let alone the national security issues is that good for small business that was one of the success stories of the post great recession recovery was there absolutely particularly in pennsylvania yeah so i think we should let small business uh be the most competitive in the world and uh and and uh and let small bit large business be competitive as well and focus on the things that we actually can control which are government regulations and taxation i yield back

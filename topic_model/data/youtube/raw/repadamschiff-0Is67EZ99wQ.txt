G THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AS HIS POLITICAL PLAY THING. TO PLAY CALL DONALD TRUMP, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, TO EXACT REVENGE AS YOU POINT OUT AND THEY PAVEMENT AGAINST TRUMP IN THE FIRST TRIAL. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A SERIOUS COMMITTEE. WE GOT MAJOR CHALLENGES FACING US WITH THE RUSSIA INVADING ITS NEIGHBORS, WITH CHINA GROWING STRENGTH AROUND THE WORLD, THREATENING TAIWAN. WITH IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM. WE SHOULD BE MESSING WITH ANY COMMITTEE, YOU SHOULD BE MESSING WITH THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO RAISE MONEY. AND THAT EMAIL THAT YOU SHOWED YOUR VIEWERS, LAWRENCE, YOU HAVE TO CLICK ON A BUTTON TO REMOVE ME FROM THE COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUVENILE, BUT IT DOES HAVE A SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE IN TERMS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMITTEES IN CONGRESS. >> YEAH, THE HISTORY OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES IN BOTH BODIES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE HAS ALWAYS BEEN BIPARTISAN, PRIOR TO THE TRUMP ERA. NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER OCCURRED. THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE DEMOCRATIC CHAIRMAN IS ASKING FOR AN INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING TO GIVE THEM A DAMAGE ASSESSMENT ON THE BIDEN DOCUMENTS, THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS THAT WERE FOUND IN THE OFFICE, THAT JOE BIDEN USED IN THE FOUR YEARS BETWEEN HIS VICE PRESIDENCY AT HIS PRESIDENCY. IS THAT A PROPER PURSUIT OF THAT KIND OF BRIEFING BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE? >> IT IS APPROPRIATE. YOU KNOW, WE'VE ASKED VIS-Ã€-VIS THE MUCH LARGER CASH OF DOCUMENTS AT MAR-A-LAGO. YOU KNOW, WHEN EVERY TIME CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS SOMEWHERE TOTALLY, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE RISKS? HOW WAS IT MAINTAINED, WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE FACILITY? IN TERMS OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, I THINK WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BARRY RADICALLY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. ONE INVOLVING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO REFUSE TO TURN OVER DOCUMENTS WHEN THEY WERE ASKED FOR. OR IF HE WAS WITH THEM WHEN THEY WERE SUBPOENAED. THE EXECUTION OF A SEARCH WARRANT UP STORE DOCUMENTS. IN ONE CASE, IT'S WILLFUL, THERE'S EVIDENCE OF A OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IN THEIR INVESTIGATION. THE RECKLESSNESS ALSO. THE OTHER IF IT'S A DEPARTMENT, BUT NONETHELESS, WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE AND WHETHER THERE IS A RISK AS A RESULT OF THEIR BEING IN SOMEWHERE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE. >> AS YOU GO FORWARD, ASSUMING THAT YOU ARE NOT ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE -- WE'LL HAKEEM JEFFRIES ON THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP BE ABLE TO PLACE YOU ON ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT CAN BE WHERE YOU CAN BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE? >> YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PLACE AND OTHER COMMITTEES, AND IN TERMS OF WHAT I WILL BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE, I'M SURELY THAT WE WILL HAVE A PLACEMENT FOR ME WHEN I CAN CONTINUE TO HOLD KEVIN MCCARTHY AND THE ENABLERS OF DONALD TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE. WHETHER THEY ARE ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT, WHETHER ENGAGE IN POTENTIAL CRIMINALITY, THEN THEY COULD BE HELD INTO ACCOUNT, AND THEN -- TRYING TO DO HERE IS DIMINISH THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO HOLD HIM TO ACCOUNT. YOU, KNOW YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SANTOS EARLIER. SANTOS'S DEFENSE WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE ETHICS COMMITTEE, HE MAY VERY WELL BE -- WHAT HE TALKING ABOUT, AND IS FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF THE LEADER OF OUR PARTY. DONALD TRUMP TOLD THOUSANDS OF LIES WHILE HE WAS IN THE OVAL OFFICE. BY COMPARISON, GEORGE SANTOS, THE FRAUDSTER IS JUST A -- BACKUP AREAS. AND HE COULDN'T DO HIS OWN PARTY LEADER, AND WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE IN CONGRESS THAT ARE GOING TO POINT OUT THE HYPOCRISY. I REMEMBER KEVIN MCCARTHY ON HIS OWN FABRICATION ABOUT THOSE -- OF THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYING THAT TRUMP SHOULD BE FORCED TO RESIGN, THAT HE WAS GOING TO HOLD TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE IN THOSE BAD CONVERSATIONS. WHICH HE LATER DIED, AND THEN BE PROVED THAT I'VE BEEN LYING ABOUT IT. SO I'M NOT SURPRISED LAWRENCE, WHEN YOU SHOW KEVIN MCCARTHY SAYING -- WELL, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE LIED ON THE RESUME. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE KEVIN MCCARTHY, DONALD TRUMP, MAKE UP COMPLETELY FICTITIOUS THINGS. AND I THINK THAT'S OKAY. BUT, I'M GLAD THE REST OF THE WORLD -- I HOPE, AND SOME MILLIONS IN OUR COUNTRY DON'T THINK THAT'S OKAY AT ALL. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH F

president I rise to speak this evening on a subject that with the grounds full of activism has once again captured our national attention and rightfully so many years ago I was a young naval flight officer stationed at Moffett Field Naval Air Station in the Bay Area out in California preparing for the first of what would be three tours of duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War and I joined with tens of thousands of people one day there to celebrate our country's first-ever birthday I'll never forget it this is back when polluters dumped waste into our waterways with impunity garbage littered our shores and too many rivers UD's instead of flow and the one of them up in Cleveland Ohio the Cuyahoga River is north of where I went to school at Ohio State actually caught on fire factories feud toxic fumes an acid rain fell from the skies the urgency was clear then it's even clearer today that very first Earth Day was a transformative experience for me and it serves as an inspiration for me for the rest of my life as I look at what is happening across our country today I I see the movement for bold transformative action to save our planet I see the faces of those who were there with me that day in Golden Gate State Park you know I had a lot of different jobs since then it's not lost to me that I stand here today on the brink of yet another watershed moment as the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works the committee that oversees our nation's environmental laws Madam President I'm here today to talk about climate change in the days and weeks ahead Senator McConnell intends to engage in a ploy to try and undermine the green New Deal by calling a vote for a resolution he does not even support I believe that he hopes that in turn there may be some in disruption and damage inflicted on the Democratic Party in the climate change movement the American people hear this simple message we cannot we will not allow cynicism to win not now and not with so much at stake when it comes to climate action there could not be a stark difference between Democratic Party and the Republican Party in this debate in this chamber we as Democrats may not agree on exactly how we should address climate change but we all agree it is happening we agree that human activity is the main cause and we agree that we must act now Democrats know that climate science isn't part of some grand hoax it is not an alarmist prediction it doesn't come from some left-leaning organization and does it come from talk radio it comes directly from a nation's leading scientists and leading scientists from all around the world just three months ago 13 federal agencies released a comprehensive climate report that described the dire and health consequences we face if we fail to take meaningful action to address climate change now I believe I may be mistaken but I believe those 13 federal agencies were acting under a law signed by a Republican president I believe was George Herbert Walker Bush this report is the third national climate assessment was developed over a three-year period by more than 300 federal experts and non-federal experts who volunteered their time who volunteered their time there's a brief summary of their report the science behind climate change is settled let me say that again the science behind climate change is settled from our warming oceans to our atmosphere climate change is happening and human activities such as burning fossil fuels are greatly contributing to this crisis our nation scientists have found a direct link between climate change and the extreme weather we experienced in 2017 which altogether costs the American economy more than 300 billion dollars that's 300 billion dollars in economic damages more than any year before scientists are no longer asking if climate change is happening but rather how bad is it going to be how bad is it going to be and numbers and the facts don't lie it will only get worse if we do nothing if we don't act on climate change by 2050 wildfire seasons could burn up to ten six times six times more forest area every year if we don't act on climate change will see more extreme flooding the devastates small communities like Ellicott City Mellon not far from here which has been hit but not by one 1000 year flood in the past two years but - these are floods that are supposed to occur maybe once every thousand years they've had two of them in the last two years if we don't act on climate change rising temperatures combined with increasingly frequent and severe rain mean that farmers are likely to experience the reduction in corn and soybean yields by up to 25 percent if we don't act on climate change will see more deadly category 5 hurricanes and storm surges like the ones we saw with hurricanes Irma and Maria just two years ago if we do not act on climate change we will see economic pain across every major sector of our economy in this country the 2018 National Climate Assessment concludes that at the end of this century climate change could slash our gross domestic product by 10 percent how much is that compared to what well compared to the losses that we sustained in the Great Recession just a decade ago 10% is more than double those losses more than double well it doesn't matter if you're from a coastal state or from a landlocked state I've lived in both doesn't matter if you care about public health or the environment or if you care about our economy or national security the fact is every person living in this country will eventually see or experience the effects of climate change if they haven't already done so today we have two options we confront this challenge head-on reduce carbon emissions enhance resiliency and support millions of new clean energy jobs or we could choose to ignore the problem and pass the buck to home to our children to their children and to their children Senator McConnell President Trump and Andrew wheeler at EPA want to pass the buck they prefer to walk away from the growing threat that we face and instead of pursuing any ideas to address climate change and protect Americans from its effect sadly the Trump administration is promoting policies that increase are dependent on dirty energy President Trump has even said he doesn't believe in climate change and the ejobs the credibility of his own scientists at NASA at NOAA as well as 97% of the global scientific community continuing to miss reform the American people and delay will climate action puts American lies and our economy at risk it doesn't have to be this way as Democrats we choose to confront climate change we choose to do so now you are we know our communities are feeling the pain now from the climate crisis because we see the effects of climate change every day across this country we may not yet agree on exactly how we must address climate change but we all agree on three things here they are number one we agree that climate change is real to human activity during the last hundred years as a dominant cause of the climate crisis we face today and three the United States and especially the Congress that's us the house and the Senate and the administration should take immediate action to address the challenge of climate change that's why I'll be introducing a resolution that says just that just that Democrats know that we can have a healthy climate and a strong economy they're not mutually exclusive anyone who says otherwise is preaching a false choice Democrats know this because of the work we started with President Obama in the White House where we accomplished real actions to put this nation on a path of Net Zero emissions and our Republican friends across the aisle should know this because of the work done by former president the late George Herbert Walker Bush years earlier that I've just alluded to a minute ago during your mob an administration starting with the Recovery Act the federal government provided economic incentives environmental targets and supported market developments to encourage investments in the clean energy of the future thanks to the investments during the previous administration consumers are paying less for energy and more than three million people in this country went to work today in the clean energy sector three million growing Democrats know we must build on his progress and that's why we continue to support policies that reduce our nation's carbon footprint helped create a fair economy and support those most vulnerable to climate effects but in the United States senators in most places it takes two to tango and for over two decades Democrats have put forth differing policies that use market forces make big investments in technology or set strict standards we've done them all and we don't seem to get very far with our friends on the other side of this aisle I know because I've sponsor I've co-sponsored many of these efforts well you say this we're not going to give up we're gonna keep on trying we won't back down we're gonna stand our ground let me leave our colleagues with this message today this should not be an issue climate action should not be an issue that divides us as a body and shouldn't divide us as a a country or as a world should unify us but I want to thank Senator McConnell in advance for allowing the Senate to devote a fulsome period of time to this important discussion how we choose to act today will not decide our faiths how he chooses to act today will decide the fates of generations of Americans not just our faiths the generations of Americans that will be here on this earth long after the rest of us are gone so let's get to work time is wasting let's get to work I yield the senator from Massachusetts we've done great work on this for as long as I've been alive so almost as long as I've been alive Madam President I ask unanimous consent that Caitlin Pritchard and Zac filching a legislative legislative fellows and a detailee and my office have privileges of the floor for the duration of the 116th Congress and with that I yield without objection to up to my friend and our colleague who has been a giant on these issues for a long long time a kid can used to be thank you

thank you mr chairman and ranking member thanks to all of our witnesses for being here um mr dunn um i i think we all it seems we pretty much can all agree to some degree on the problem um i will tell you in in listening to senator toomey's questioning my mind started going down the usual path of what what is the ultimate end to the constant government distortion of markets the sticks and the carrots that seem to just create a higher price and very little in regards to providing more supply i mean the biggest problem with inflation the cause of inflation is when demand outpaces supply so we keep incenting demand and don't do enough in my view to incentivize supply and i'm not really sure where it all ends but one part of that of that scenario that we don't talk about enough is the cost of regulation and there's been a study i'm sure you're familiar with um recently that that predicts about 40 percent of the cost of multi-family and single-family rent is regulation can you speak a little bit to government regulation and again and i am sincere when i say i don't i think we struggle to find the balance every time we try to solve a problem we incentivize one side or the other and all we do is escalate costs can you can you speak a little bit to that imbalance and what's what's the right balance if you have a sense what that might be yes senator kramer and you're correct um the national home builders association they did do a study and looking at all levels of government regulation adds about 40 percent to the to the cost of building homes and to the cost of building real estate and developing real estate and that is directly passed on to the very people we're trying to help so we have to make sure that we're dealing with the root cause of the issue which is a lack of supply and everyone even every witness here today we agree that that is the problem and we need to focus our efforts and focus our dollars on every level of government local state and federal level on making sure we're creating more housing and when we create solutions that in many cases i even understand why they're being created in the short term to help one side it doesn't help the problem and it doesn't solve the problem that we need more housing we have to make sure there's plans that create more units and not initiatives that pit one side against the other we have to make sure that tenant landlord bond which is sacred is you know has has a place to live in this country sure and we i you don't advocate i think any of us advocate no regulations obviously there needs to be protections put in place but i i agree honestly the the the the problem is easier to identify than the solution i i readily admit i mean when that when the incentives created a distortion to the point where um the cost of rent is going going up faster than the rest of the economy that's not the right solution um but i'm kind of with you i i i'd like to see us focus more on the supply side but i'm not sure that completely does it either because um sometimes you can end up with just an overabundance of that as well but anyway with that thank you all for and by the way i mean i still have a minute and a half if anybody else wants to comment on the same question either from a different perspective i'd be happy to listen well i'd be happy to share that related to um regulations or or state and local laws that one of the the biggest challenges to increasing affordable housing supply is often restrictive local zoning that inhibits the supply of any kind of apartments and especially affordable apartments and this drives up costs for everybody and it exacerbates segregation and other racial disparities so states and localities will need to do more to limit or entirely remove those restrictive zoning laws if we're to be able to build the number of homes that the country needs and the federal government can use the levers that it has primarily in creating incentives or requirements that are tied to federal funding especially the big pots of funding through the transportation the bipartisan transportation infrastructure bill that can create a very compelling incentive for local communities if they are able to receive those funds only if they do more at the local level to reduce restrictive zoning the the only thing that concerns me about that is that that sounds swell until the local community decides it doesn't it's not worth the funding in which case you've solved no problem well that's why we should think bigger than the housing funds where typically we do look at incentives for restrictive zoning and we look we should look to the much bigger pots of money that all communities want related to transportation funds highways etc thank you thank you mr chairman

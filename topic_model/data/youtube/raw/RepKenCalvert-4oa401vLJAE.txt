demo from California is recognized thank you thank you ranking member Granger and and I want to thank sure woman LOI I want to thank you both for your leadership and expertise throughout this process I would like to also acknowledge the work of chairman of Visclosky mr. chairman I'm grateful for your dedication to the US service members our national security your willingness to listen and work with us to put together this bill I very much appreciate the bipartisan way in which you've managed the defense subcommittee it's been an honor to work with you and I look forward to finishing our work on time there's a lot of good work in this bill however the United States faces an increasingly challenging geopolitical landscape one that requires a strong US military to help maintain global peace and stability well we've been at war in the Middle East for nearly two decades other regions of the world have been watching us and chipping away at our military superiority unfortunately the funding levels recommended in this bill are inadequate to enable us to address the needs of our military and maintain our superiority over our adversaries the fiscal year 2020 defense bill before the house today includes six hundred and twenty two billion dollars in base funding and another eight Billy R sixty eight billion dollars in overseas contingency operations or OCO funding for a total of six hundred and ninety billion the amount is roughly eight billion dollars less of the six of six hundred and ninety billion the amount is roughly eight million dollars less than request excuse me this funding level is not adequate to address the myrin issues that we face around the world including an increasingly aggressive Russia just last week a Russian destroyer came dangerously and recklessly close to one of our vessels in the Philippine Sea shortchanging defense funding would end or send the wrong message to our adversaries let's be clear we do not want a fair fight funding the department is to ensure our advantage over any threat is the best deterrent to war in addition to low funding levels in the bill it includes a number of troubling provisions adopted in committee including a new the department's ability to provide lawful assistance to other agencies in combating the real crisis of our southern border we cannot continue to ignore the reality along the southern border the sheer numbers of people coming across our borders in the hundreds of thousands now require the use of military bases to house and migrants the situation is intended and that Congress must update our immigration laws to make the process more rational and enforceable restricting the president's ability to address the crisis will only make the problem worse and put more people at risk as they embark on a dangerous journey I'm also concerned with the language striking the authorization of use of military force this provision would repeal the current authorization 240 days after enactment this is a serious topic that needs to be debated by the authorizing committees including this language an appropriation bill with little debate no committee hearings or witnesses is not the correct way to address this matter broadcasting to our enemies the stop date of any military operation is reckless and irresponsible then there's the issue of numbers in divided Gomberg government bipartisanship is essential unfortunately until we reach agreement on the top-line spending levels that the president will also support I remain concerned that the defense funding bill will be crafted in an environment in which we have no budgetary certainty without a top-line budget agreement and a two-year deal between the House the Senate and the White House to receive the but to relieve the budget caps put in place by the Budget Control Act we are making spending decisions based we're not making decisions based in reality if we cannot come to a reach come to an agreement on budget caps deal we face sequestration in the coming year the impacts would reverse all the progress on readiness and modernization we have achieved over the last two years sequestration would cut 20 billion from the Navy twenty-nine billion billion from the Air Force it would stop one hundred army programs we need all the parties to come together the table now and make the tough of critical budget decisions we know all too well how devastating budgetary ambiguity and continuing resolutions can be for the defense planning and the real-world impact it has on training and readiness and the quality of life issues that's a recipe for disaster for both our military and the American people and that's why I cannot support this bill at this time I want to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to develop bills for the fiscal year 2020 that meet our nation's defense and border security priorities in a fiscally responsible manner given the Chairman's nature I'm sure that he will be able to be an able partner and lead an effort to strike a budget agreement and I'm certainly happy to help to avert sequestration and finally I'd like to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for their hard work I appreciate their diligence and with that Thank You ranking member Granger you

well thank you mr chairman and thanks to the ranking member for those eloquent statements you stated the case uh i can save part of my remarks i do have written remarks which i would like to submit for the record uh if subject to your approval mr chairman uh i'll have some informal remarks now uh first i want to thank this committee and thank the full committee for the work that you've already done on this uh critically important subject uh the work that went into the national defense authorization act that of course has now passed both houses both bills from the senate and the house have a number of our recommendations uh they're they're not in 100 percent overlap so there will be some work to do in conference but we certainly have made a substantial start in really putting these recommendations implementing the recommendations because uh if if it's just a report that sits on a shelf it's not going to serve the public interest just a bit about the commission you talked about it mr chairman there were 14 members there were four members of congress four members from the executive branch and six from the private sector our work was entirely nonpartisan uh there wasn't a moment of partisan discussion in the 30-plus meetings that we had in fact i couldn't tell you the the partisan affiliations of pretty much anyone that was in the room except of course the ones the members of congress and that was the spirit with which we approached this this incredibly important uh problem uh i i don't really need to outline for this committee how serious this is this is uh one of the if not the most serious uh international relations problem that we face uh the ranking member listed the the attacks that we've already endured and and there was there will certainly be more to come uh we are the most wired country in the world and therefore we're the most vulnerable country in the world and as we've learned in the pandemic uh something which strikes at our essential economy and and government uh poses a grave danger to this country so let me just give you a brief outline of how the uh the work of the solarium uh sort of breaks down if they're really three pieces one is reorganization one is resilience and one is response reorganization means trying to develop a coherent structure in the united states government so that we can respond to cyber threats and cyber attacks the problem as is often the case is that the authority for cyber is scattered throughout the government it's in the fbi it's in cyber command it's in cia dhs it's in all areas of the government so one of our primary uh focus was on bringing some coherent organizational strategy to that to that silo problem which the chairman mentioned the principal recommendation there is one that you've already adopted in your committee which is the creation of a national cyber director to oversee and coordinate all of these various functions throughout the federal government the second piece is resilience which is building up our cyber defenses and it goes from simple cyber hygiene to being just more secure in how we deal with the cloud how we certify home uh routers and all of those kinds of things in order to be more resilient to make it uh less likely that an adversary will succeed the third piece is response how do we respond to a cyber attack and more importantly how do we notify potential adversaries that we will respond and we'll be talking about that and the all of these four three pieces come into what's called a layered cyber deterrence the the intention is to shape behavior we'll be talking about that in the international field of norms and standards the second is to deny benefits that's the resilience that i was talking about and the third piece is impose costs the truth is that we haven't done a very good job of imposing costs we've become a cheap date in cyber we can be attacked as we were with the opm breach the ranking member mentioned or other attacks on our democracy and there's no real consequences there are no real results there's no cost paid by our adversary we've got to make adversaries go through a cost calculation saying well if we do this they might do this something else to us and it may not be cyber it may be sanctions it may be other kinds of of a response but we have to establish that there will be a response otherwise because cyber's a relatively cheap form of aggression it will continue to happen so that's the overall focus of our commission and i have to say working with the two members from europe subcommittee jim langevin and mike gallagher has been one of the great pleasures of my life we've had a fantastic experience working together with the other 12 members of the commission really wrestling with some difficult issues working hard concentrating and coming up with what we feel is a is a solid a solid piece of work that will really help our country uh move forward in this critically important area so i thank the subcommittee for your attention and look forward to the hearing

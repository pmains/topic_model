a good evening to you uh tell us what's going to happen in your view tomorrow with the fastest impeachment ever will there be a vote uh to impeach president trump by the end of the day will it be victorious and what do you think of republicans joining the push by you and speaker pelosi i i believe that i expect there will be a vote uh it will absolutely be victorious there will be republicans joining us liz cheney is one of the leaders of the republican caucus in the house that's a significant development and you know don't don't forget in all of american history the first member of congress to vote to impeach a member of their own party was uh was mitt romney donald you know in in in the last impeachment investigation of donald trump uh we will have significantly more than one republican voting uh in in this case and and the reason is very very simple a lot of these people uh for four years gave their loyalty to donald trump uh some of them understood that he was bad news for the party but felt you know what if you confront him he only gets worse and worse and worse that didn't work he got worse and worse and worse anyway and now a mob that was mobilized by their president is trying to kill them that has a way of changing hearts and minds yeah and you're close to it so you know what some of your colleagues are saying after facing that down how important is your view is it in your view that tomorrow's debate which the nation will clearly be riveted on exactly one week out from the insurrection focus as much on barring donald trump from ever holding office again which is what speaker pelosi says is a important substantive result rather than it being however meritorious you feel it would be uh another discussion of democrats re-impeaching a president they already impeached yeah so the most important and most urgent matter here is that this is an ongoing assault it's not just something that happened on wednesday uh there there are uh people very well organized very well determined very determined who who want to come back to washington uh around the inauguration and probably many times after that to go after their perceived enemies at the top of their list of enemies again i want to stress our republicans who they perceive to be traitors to donald trump and so the most important thing for us to do right now is to play offense on all fronts so that these people do not believe that they are winning they have this fantasy that was formed by q anon in in their uh in their world of make-believe online that all they had to do was come to washington and the donald trump had a plan and that they would march on the capitol and the waters would part and the government would fall and every time we can set an example that disproves that fantasy that shows law enforcement is not on their side the united states congress marched back into that room we certified the election we are going to impeach donald trump with a lot of republican votes every time we do that they are weakened and the country is stronger and just briefly you said stay on offense uh what's your response to some like republicans wall street journal electoral board saying uh biden should call for unity now and back off impeachment uh biden should call for unity around the rule of law in this country i mean there are two ways to have unity either we have unity around the principle that whether you're liberal conservative republican democrat we don't tolerate a violent attack on our seat of government and we hold accountable people who commit crimes or we we have unity in forgiving that and moving on and allowing it to happen again so obviously i want unity around the ruled law i think we're going to have that and you know there are still going to be some republicans who are afraid and by the way they're not just afraid now of being primaried it's not just a political thing like they're literally worried about the safety of their families and that's where we are uh congressman malinowski thank you for joining me tonight thank you so much

even from the perspective of someone who's come under enemy fire it's clear to me that's not all of the biggest threats we'll face over the next thirty years will take the shape of a weapons attack the truth is climate change is real climate change is here and we can't ignore it any longer the Midwest is flooding the west coast is burning coastlines are sinking why the temperature is soaring and worldwide instability is rising and farmland keeps dying this is not just a partisan squabble at the strategic level this is a national security threat something that military leaders and president Trump's own intelligence officials admit as terrorist groups like Isis and Boko Haram used droughts to solidify their power in Syria and Nigeria a storms ravaged our military bases and rising sea levels threatened to swallow 100 more American military bases tell me that won't impact troop readiness at the tactical level when I served in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom 50% of all casualties that occurred occurred during convoy operations not kicking down doors going after the bad guys during convoy operations over 80% of all convoys were conducted to transport fuel diesel fuel and yet while I was in the House Republicans time and again and even here in the Senate blocked the Navy's efforts to invest in green technology because you see at the tactical level if our troops had better storage capacity and batteries that means fewer batteries have to carry in the rocks and more bullets they didn't go after the bad guys if I could have had more fuel-efficient vehicles that was one less 5,000 gallon him a tanker of a flammable fuel that I was putting out on the road to be hit by the enemy so it is important on a national security level that we make these investments and in fact the Republicans have time again blocked the Navy's own efforts to invest in green energy secretary Ray Mabus the former Secretary of the Navy actually ran an entire naval training exercise where every vehicle operated on a bio diesel and biofuel blend and yet they were stopped in their tracks I'm doing more look tell me that it won't make it hard of our servicemembers to do their job well get the meaning they need to protect the people we love if we don't make these investments I know that Donald Trump never deign to put on the uniform Bowens Perez didn't stop me from serving so let me clear something up for him he and the GOP should not keep claiming to care about our national security and our military if they keep ignoring the crises that are stopping its strength and putting Americans at risk they keep doing this more Americans will have to go serve in places as a result of the effects of climate change drought fights over natural resources this is enough I fought one war for foreign oil let's not do that again our troops deserve better American families deserve to know that their leaders are doing everything they can to keep their loved ones safe and their nation strong and that's one reason why this work is so incredibly important and why I'm so glad to join my colleagues here today to announce a special committee and with that I am so pleased to introduce my colleague senator Smith

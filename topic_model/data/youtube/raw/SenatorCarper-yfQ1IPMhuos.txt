as a lot of my hair colleagues have made me know addressing global warming has been an important issue for me since my early days in the the Senate I think the facts are indisputable today our planet is growing warmer we as human beings are a major contributor to that if we continue down the path that we started on the consequences will be for our planet and for our country and our people catastrophic it is up to us to ensure that America leads the world down a different path we must and we should the EPA estimates that unless global warming is controlled sea level rise will be by as much as two feet over the next 50 years I've heard even greater amounts by over the next 100 years for island nations and coastlines that could mean entire cities and beaches are wiped out it's also up to us in this body to ensure that those those beaches no cities those coastlines are preserved I gotta charge I just want to share with my friends those of us who've not been to Delaware this is Delaware about 100 miles from end to end and about from from east to west maybe 50 miles here this is the outline of our course this is a Louis this is a cape henlopen mrs. rehoboth beach this is Dewey Beach Bethany Beach fenwick island nation summer capital this is where the beach is today 50 years from now we don't do anything anything about global warming sea level rise has been at least two feet this will be the beach in delaware this is dover delaware our state capitol this past Sunday we we hosted 150,000 people from all over the country NASCAR racing 50 years from now if we're not careful this will be knocked over this would be Dover Beach and we won't be having NASCAR races at Dover Beach we may have sailing regattas we may have a motor boat races but we're not going to be having the stock car races unless we do something about it we also know that the United States is one of the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases along with the Chinese fact they may have overtaken us by now we account in this country for almost twenty percent of the world's man-made greenhouse gas emissions and for almost one quarter of the world's economic output I believe our nation has responsibility to reduce our emissions of co2 in short we have a responsibility to lead in the midnight 90s as part of a climate change initiative DuPont began aggressively maximizing energy efficiency that initiative has allowed to Pont to hold its energy use flat while increasing production as a result de pont reduces greenhouse gas emissions by more than seventy percent by doing so the company actually saved three billion dollars billion billion with a be three billion dollars but a patchwork of state initiatives combined with good corporate stewardship however welcome is not enough we must have a comprehensive national approach and not only to give a signal to corporate America that this is a priority but to the world the United States is prepared at long last to be a leader on this front as well I have enough faith in American technology American ingenuity and know-how to believe that we can provide that leadership without endangering our economic growth in fact if we're smart about it will end up strengthening our nation's economy will end up creating a hundreds of thousands of new green jobs and will end up creating products and technologies that we can sell and export around the world a lot of times people say me what can I do as an individual to help on global warming and as it turns out everybody can recycle everybody can do that here's a couple of reasons why in 2006 the United States recycled threw away literally throw away in a can in trash some 82 million tons of materials recycling rate of about a third we recycle about a third that stuff but we offset let me just back up me just say that again in 2006 the United States recycle about 80 80 million tons of material that's about a third of all that we would otherwise throw away offsetting the release of some 50 million tons of carbon that's the equivalent emissions that we saved by recycling of some 39 million cars each year because we recycle however we only recycler by a third of what we could however each year Americans discard enough aluminum to rebuild our entire domestic airline fleet every three months put simply increasing recycling cuts greenhouse gas emissions let me start off by you by addressing 4 p-4 p stands for for pollutants I appreciate that this bill of knowledge the dangerous air pollutants including sulfur dioxide nitrous oxide and mercury are emitted by the power sector in this country however acknowledge a problem is not the same as solving that problem I believe that in addition to reducing greenhouse gases we must eventually pass a comprehensive bill that also reduces these other three harmful pollutants Sox and NOx and mercury sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and Mercury some of my colleagues know because I've driven you crazy over the last five or six years on this visiting many of your offices but 12 of my colleagues that I have introduced the Clean Air planning act of 2007 we call it kappa CA PA we believe that the cleaner planning act provides an aggressive yet achievable schedule for power plants to reduce emissions and alleviate some of our worst air related health and environmental problems such as ozone acid rain mercury contamination and of course global warming this multi pollutant approach fits perfectly within the framework of this comprehensive global warming bill I believe that we would be foolish to address only one pollutant however important it is carbon dioxide coming out of a nation smokestacks while others sulfur dioxide nitrite nitrogen oxide and Mercury threaten our health and our environment to my state of Delaware along with the states around us Maryland Virginia Pennsylvania and New Jersey we're at the end of America's tailpipe and we continue to breathe dirty air the bottom line is as we develop an economy-wide solution to global warming we can't lose sight of the simultaneous need to enact stricter caps on mercury a nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide from power plants the transportation sector is responsible for about thirty percent of our nation's carbon dioxide emissions almost a third that is quite Congress passed legislation that I co-authored with a number of my colleagues last year senator Feinstein and others to increase auto fuel economy from an average 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 the bill before us today also includes a low carbon fuel standard and funding for developing alternative fuels as the only member of the center who serves on all three transportation related committees I look forward to attempting to bring those three committees together and create a comprehensive approach to reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector before we address climate change next year

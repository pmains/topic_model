uh well thank you chairman chicano and thank you secretary mcdonough for joining us appreciate you being in kansas uh a few weeks ago and uh meeting you at our via facility in emporia and also very much uh enjoyed our phone call a few weeks ago as well so a couple questions um first off on the war stopper program as you know that's a priority for me i just think it's a big opportunity to streamline cost and deliver a better supply chain for for the va what's the state of our negotiations with the va and dod about va's full participation in the war stopper program yeah so you and i have talked about this i owe you some answers on it i think john do you have an update on where our negotiations are on that the issue is there's an executive order associated with this oh i can't quite if you could speak up a little bit sir uh just very family secretary we have a little bit of a sound issue and mr man we'll arrest the clock here so that uh apparently we're sharing we're sharing a microphone here okay so we are that's much better yeah all right so we are working with that with eod but i think the larger issue there is a there's an executive order related to this and so we're also involved with an inter-departmental um initiative that's working to provide recommendations to the administration by july 20th and so all of these are sort of coming together and so i think in the next month you'll see a lot of recommendations coming out associated with this and then a projection going forward of how to interact with dod dhs hhs va all of those it'll be a more comprehensive i think look across the government but is that it's active uh my my understanding is that there's maybe a list that needs that va needs to generate um to provide the dod on what's actually needed in the balls in in the va's court to um provide that list is that right and yeah it is not done yeah it is and the the there's no hold up i think the issue is that we are working that with this um sort of you know cross-government initiative and the administration so that we do it i think more thoughtfully and uh i think more thoroughly so that is going on and and that list will come out okay any skinny commitment on when when we would try to get some traction here yep the recommendations are supposed to be to the president by july 20th okay okay okay great thank you and then um question for sergey madonna um specific to the budget there's a budget request you know that include 26.5 million dollars for the office of accountability and whistleblower protection or oawp i know we've talked about this before this is a 3.8 million dollar increase to add 27 positions however in the past the aowps director has testified on our subcommittee that roughly half of their disciplinary recommendations had been rejected and so i'm just trying to figure out why increase this program um by this amount of money and um add 27 more when when what we're currently doing doesn't seem to be working as effectively as it should be yeah it's a very very fair and highly logical question um so just one thing back on the other on the other uh piece of business uh mr man john and i and whoever else is appropriate would be happy to come sit with you about what our recommendations are to that uh process you know either before or right after the 20th after we submit our recommendations the president on oawp on oawp it's really it's a very challenging question because here's what happens the oawp does an investigation they come up with recommendations they pass those recommendations to who we call the responsible management official that responsible management official can choose to take some or all of those recommendations or none and if they take none of those recommendations they i am required to report to you all about what happened there why did the responsible management official not um implement the requirement the recommended uh fixes from oawp i think it's um obvious to me well it's obvious to me two things one is i hear from that office which has not yet been fully staffed since you all enacted it several months several years ago um that it needs more people i take their word for that but we also have a governance and management issue which is we have to figure out why there's such a disconnect and this is on me between the investigators in oawp and the responsible management officials and why is it that either the recommendations aren't what the management official thinks that needs to happen or the management officials are ignoring the recommendations we just have to increase that oversight and that's something that's on me and my general counsel we're actively working this this is one of the issues we'll address as soon as marianne donahue is in the job which is i hope is later this week if she gets through the senate um and i i think your question is highly logical it's something that is uh uh something it's an aggravation to me because this is obviously required in this department um and we have to get down to it and i hope that the next time i appear before you you don't have to ask about it because we've addressed it okay appreciate the time

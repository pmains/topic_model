Thank You mr. speaker I'd like to thank my colleague the gentleman from Kentucky for bringing this important bill to the floor to empower States to protect consumers from higher electric rates and to ensure grid stability in fact when I was in the state legislature back in Michigan I served as the vice chair of our energy and Technology Committee and spent a lot of work and a lot of time on that grid reliability and cost issues but under the clean power plan the EPA would set mandatory carbon dioxide emission levels for each state and we require that they submit state plans to meet their EPA established quote-unquote goals while I have many concerns about the proposed rule I am offering this amendment to highlight how the EPA's approached calculating emissions actually discourages the kind of emission reductions that are its intended to promote here's how the EPA's compliance formula does not include a way to calculate the benefits of clean energy storage Michigan is a prime example of the importance of energy storage via the ludington pump storage reservoir located in West Michigan in the second district ludington pump storage was the largest pumped storage hydraulic facility a hydroelectric facility in the world when it was constructed and I remember as a young man my dad was in construction and we would do sunday drives an hour and a half north just to see the progress on this it's a four hundred and eight hundred and forty-two acre reservoir that's two and a half miles long and holds 27 billion gallons of water and in the last couple of years it now includes a wind farm with 56 turbines that are generating an additional hundred megawatts ludington can generate up to 1872 megawatts which is enough electricity to serve a community of 1.4 million residential customers here's how the pump at night when electric rates are low and oftentimes the wind is blowing in West Michigan and those turbines are going letting tins reversible turbines down at the lake level pump water up the 363 Foothill from Lake Michigan to the reservoir then during the day when electric demand is high the reservoir releases water to flow downhill and it turns the turbines to make carbon-free electricity and that is very very helpful obviously especially in the summertime when we have peak times fact when I was in the state legislature I was standing next to those turbines and we got the call or they got the call that they needed peak electricity because the substation had gone down in southeast Michigan and literally within ten minutes those turbines were spinning and producing electricity and putting it back out on the grid thereby saving a whole lot of expenses they were going to look at needing to go out onto the my so system to purchase that electricity well in addition to it being carbon free there's no other emissions from being pumped from the storage generation either and ironically the proposed rule would penalize states like Michigan and Virginia that have prudently invested in energy storage technology because of the emissions and megawatt-hours from plants used to charge the storage system are included in the EPA's equation however the megawatt hours discharge from the storage system are not thus according to the EPA estates emissions intensity actually increases increases if they utilize Crean's clean storage energy its exact opposite what I hope is the EPA's goal of this rule the amendment simply encourages the EPA to explicitly authorize states to include clean energy storage in their compliance plans I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment and

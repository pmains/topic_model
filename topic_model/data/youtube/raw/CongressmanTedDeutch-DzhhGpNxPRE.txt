Thank You chairman Cohen ranking member Johnson and members of the subcommittee it has been ten years since the Supreme Court's disastrous decision in Citizens United and I am here today to call for a constitutional amendment to overturn it in the 5-4 majority opinion Justice Anthony Kennedy dismissed concerns about corruption caused by limitless spending he wrote quote the appearance of influence or access will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy but it has the decision knocked down long-standing bipartisan campaign finance laws now there are three primary problems that have crystallized in the citizens united decade first extreme election spending destroys any hope of political equality in America second current disclosure and anti coordination rules have not prevented corruption or stopped foreign interference and third very few very wealthy individuals have extraordinary influence government institutions too often focus on their pet projects rather than on the public will Citizens United unleashed a torrent of billions of dollars into our elections in the 20 years before the Citizens United decision seven hundred and fifty million dollars of outside spending in the ten years since over four and a half billion dollars dark money groups are not required to disclose their donors their spending jumped from one hundred and twenty nine million dollars in the ten years before the decision to a billion dollars since the ten families who spent the most in our elections in the citizens united a decade spent a total of 1.2 billion dollars now to put that in perspective it would take six million Americans spending $200 each to match the spending of these ten families this flood of spending has to store the agenda in Congress and we now know that it is sapping America's faith in our democracy and our government eighty-four percent of Americans think that special interests come first here last year the House passed the for the people Act and the Voting Rights advancement Act and these bills would require disclosure and end gerrymandering and make it easier to vote and protect voting rights but statutory changes alone can't fix the problems created by citizens united the democracy for all amendment would allow reasonable limits on campaign spending americans want to get big money out of our elections the amendment rejects the Supreme Court's claim that only quid pro quo bribes can corrupt politicians our amendment would level the playing field it would promote political equality and it would protect the integrity of our government institutions and elections I'm going to thank the millions of advocates and hundreds of organizations who built the movement to get money out of politics twenty states and over eight hundred local governments are calling for a constitutional amendment and we wouldn't be here today without them I wanna thank vice-chair Raskin representative McGovern representative Catco senators Udall and Shaheen for joining me in introducing this bipartisan amendment and I want to thank the 210 co-sponsors including congresswoman jayapala and many members of this subcommittee for their support and to be clear this issue is not partisan among the American people in 2018 the University of Maryland reported that 75 percent of Americans three-quarters of all Americans support a constitutional amendment to allow for limits on election spending that includes eighty-five percent of Democrats seventy percent of independents and two-thirds of Republicans we must overturn citizens united to fulfill the ideals we affirm that our nation's founding the democracy for all amendment is necessary because your status in our democracy should not depend upon your status in our economy whether you work three jobs and barely get by or you own three homes and you barely work the eyes of our law the eyes of our government our elections must see all Americans as equal this amendment will get money out of our elections and most importantly it will put voters back in charge with that mr. Chairman I appreciate the time and I yield back

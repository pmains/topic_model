thank you very much mr. speaker mr. speaker this Republican majority is prepared to adjourn the House of Representatives to leave for the August district work period without accomplishing what the American people have sent us here to do they want us to create jobs they want us to reduce the deficit and they wanted to give a middle income tax cut which the president has suggested and the American people overwhelmingly support instead we have no jobs agenda no tax cuts for the middle class no farm bill no violence against women act no cybersecurity strategy no balanced bipartisan plan to prevent the sequester the only thing the Republicans have done is to increase the uncertainty that threatens another debt crisis and undermine domick growth now they want a head out of town to campaign when Congress should stay in session to address the most pressing challenges facing our nation job creation growth in our economy and strengthening the middle class Mr Speaker I Democrats want to do you want us to get our job done when we go home to meet with our constituents we want to say what we have accomplished and what results we can bring that has been worked out in a fair bipartisan balanced way in spite of this the Democrats the Republican obstruction at every turn is preventing that let's get to work let's do the job our constituents elected us to do to create jobs with them and to relieve the uncertainty in their lives with that Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

mr. chairman the Trump administration's forced child separation policy will forever be a dark time in our nation's history the policy undermines our country's moral standing in the world that generations of Americans have worked so hard and in some cases have given their lives to build I am deeply concerned with documents that have been turned over by HHS that record a high number of sexual assaults on unaccompanied children in the custody of the office of refugee resettlement together these documents detail an environment of systemic sexual assaults by staff on unaccompanied children mr. Chairman I ask unanimous consent to submit for the record a document request submitted by the committee to the HHS secretaries are on the development execution of the administration zero Tom that objection an untitled document that describes or a zero tolerance tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse without objection charts for each fiscal year from FY 2015 through FY 2018 on allegations of sexual abuse reported to DOJ that objection charts detailing incidents of sexual abuse reported to DOJ that occurred in Orr s unaccompanied alien children program and without objection and finally mr. chairman charts from FY 2017 and 2018 listing incidents of sexual abuse dates when the incident was reported to Orr the FBI and the care provider without objection documents will be entered into the record Thank You mr. chairman commander white these documents demonstrate over the past three years there have been 154 staff on unaccompanied minor let me repeat that staff on unaccompanied minor allegations of sexual assault this works out on average to one sexual assault by HHS staff on an unaccompanied minor per week these documents tell us that there was a problem with adults employees of HHS sexually abusing children when you carried out the zero-tolerance policy for you and mr. Lloyd when you carried out the policy you knew that putting thousands of kids you knew that putting thousands of kids into a situation where they were at risk of sexual abuse was going to be the results did you discuss this issue before going forward did you discuss the threat of sexual abuse to these kids among each other were there discussions with staff representative let me first correct an error those are not HHS staff in any of those allegations that statement is false those are cows no no no no sir no those are not a commander working of allegations commander white yes again whatever my claim my time commander white I don't have a lot of time and you know what I've seen you know what I've seen in these reports that were delivered to us buried in stacks of documents this thick without any any notation I saw thousands of cases of sexual abuse if not by HHS staff then by the people that HHA staff oversees I'll will make that clarification it doesn't make what happen anything less horrific any less river let me just continue a hold on one second mr. white police commander white the question is when you went forward this policy did anyone discuss this did did was this a hesitation given given that these that you had this history did anyone worry about what was going to happen to these kids did this was the secretary aware of the numbers in these charts you're speaking of the numbers of our Priya reports and those 154 are allegations and this is a longer course it is a longer conversation commuter with every conversation that we had about separation we opposed separation I appreciate that was based on actual and was the secretary aware of these numbers was the secretary aware that in moving forward and doing the work that you do and for everyone on the panel do people consider that when you went forward on the zero-tolerance policy that we're moving forward on a policy that would put these kids at risk of sexual assaults that's the question and I and if the answer is you don't know I would ask I would ask staff to hand out to deliver to you these two charts in particular the one that you're right does contain the allegations it also contains the results of investigations those employees who were reassigned those who were terminated those who continued to be employed there are a thousand questions that we have but I would ask that you deliver these to the secretary so that we can have a full exploration of them the details of these sexual abuse allegations are shocking mr. chairman and chairman chairperson Lofgren I know will join me in continuing to press the administration on these issues it was our obligation the administration's obligation to help keep these kids safe child's best interest safety and well-being of alien children that's what we heard this morning mr. chairman we failed and this is just the start of when I believe to be a very important series of questions that this administration must answer and I yield back

mr chairman ranking member rich thank you very much for holding this hearing uh secretary general it's nice to have you here today thank you very much secretary general in the western hemisphere we've seen governments use illegitimate means to change or even nullify election rules and processes related to their democratic elections the illegitimate maduro regime in venezuela is the most recent example of this type of activity for example in may of 2018 the illegitimate maduro regime repeatedly changed abused and rewrote the rules in order to hold a sham election that failed to meet any sort of international standard for fair free and transparent voting and more recently the illegitimate maduro regime has sought to stack and manipulate in its own favor venezuela's federal election commission secretary general would you agree with the general proposition that the voting public's confidence in free and fair elections including impartial and transparent electoral processes is necessary and critical to a well-functioning democracy i completely agree it is that the starting point of democracy for the people to be able to elect in a free way transparent just and that the votes are counting counted properly that is all about it's about the integrity of the electoral process we have to see it from practically the very beginning and we have to monitor practically every single aspect of it today the challenges are big because technology is keeps improving and and of course we have to keep track with technology at the same time we need to be able to [Music] to read adequately the the political system and how it works we we observe elections we observe facts and uh and we denounce those facts and we document them and we prove them we and those countries that they want we can help them in order to uh have a better electoral process uh like we are doing now it plays in haiti and and in honduras it is it is a hard hard work sometimes it's a it's a very demanding work the venezuelan case is an extreme case because i mean elections there are not elections at all they don't have any pattern that is common with any election anywhere i mean they do fraud among them for example there was this election of the national constituency constituent assembly and that was the position was not participating nevertheless they pumped two million votes in in order to make one of the parties uh of that one of the the one of delsi rodriguez and syria defeat the other one of of uh the ohio that means they cheat among themselves during the election so that is the most extreme case that they have i have seen in the hemisphere so far well secretary general would you agree with the general proposition that a democracy risks fundamentally eroding itself when those in power change or negate election rules simply to stay in power i completely i completely agree i can sign below definitely i would agree with that too and we're witnessing happening right here in america today at least an attempt doesn't using government power to ensure you stay in power sound more like the maduro regime or chairman mao's regime than it does something would happen here in the united states yeah i think the american people see right through it uh that's why this senate has got to vote that is built down just to maintain if for nothing else maintain their credibility with the american people if you look at these state legislators and whether the bills that they're proposing are good or bad or ugly or what they're responding to their constituents they're responding to the american people they are closer frankly to the american people than the federal government is and and and and clearly people felt that because of the last minute rule changes and everything else uh the last election wasn't a good one from a process standpoint the 2018 and 2016 elections were much better

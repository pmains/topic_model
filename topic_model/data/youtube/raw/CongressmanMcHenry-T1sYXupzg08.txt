S RECOGNIZED.  MR. BISHOP: I AM PLEASED TO  YIELD A MINUTE TO A GENTLEMAN  WHO HAS NEVER BEEN ON OUR  COMMITTEE, BUT WE HAVE   APPRECIATED HIS FRIENDSHIP AND   HELPING TO TO MOVE PACKAGE, THE  GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA,   MR. MCMENRY. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. MR. MCHENRY: I THANK THE   BIPARTISAN WORK THAT WE ARE  ADVOCATING FOR HERE ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS  IMPORTANT BILL, FOR TWO REASONS. TWO REASONS DIRECTLY RELATED TO  WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE  I'M HONORED TO REPRESENT.  FIRST, IT HAS A PERMANENT  RE-AUTHORIZATION OF THE LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM THAT USES OFFSHORE ENERGY  RESOURCES TO FUND PROTECTING   LANDS THAT ARE OF NATIONAL   IMPORTANCE.  OUR RIVERS, OUR SCENIC BYWAYS,   OUR LAKES. CLEAN WATER IN WESTERN NORTH   CAROLINA, ACCESS TO THE GREAT  OUTDOORS HAS BEEN A GREAT DRIVER OF OUR ECONOMY AND LWCF HAS  HELPED FUND THE PRESERVATION,  PROTECTION OF THOSE AREAS. SECOND, I STAND IN SUPPORT OF  THIS IMPORTANT BILL BECAUSE IT   RE-AUTHORIZES THE BLUE RIDGE   NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA.  THESE TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION, THE LWCF RE-AUTHORIZATION AND  THE BLUE RIDGE NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA, ARE TWO ITEMS I'VE   SPONSORED INDEPENDENTLY OF THIS  PACKAGE AND I'M GLAD THEY ARE  PART OF THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE   US.  THE BLUE RIDGE NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA ENSURES THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNIQUE CULTURAL HISTORY OF   WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA, AND  PROVIDES ACCESS TO OUR LAND  SURROUNDING THE BLUE RIDGE   PARKWAY. .  THOSE TWO IMPORTANT AREAS ARE A  SMALL PART OF THIS PACKAGE   THAT'S BEEN HAMMERED OUT IN A  BIPARTISAN WAY.

this did not just happen mr. speaker it didn't happen it wasn't an accident it was planned that is the lowest thing you could ever read about a government that doesn't even wasn't even elected who the heck are these people that decide what we're going to do that was a very fiery bill Pascrell you know him he's that's what he is he's always very fire he's the Democratic congressman from New Jersey Tuesday night that was after a report in The New York Times the detail that the current government shutdown was actually planned way back in February by a coalition of conservative activists led by Reagan era attorney general ed nice here now to talk about where we are and all this it's congressman bill Pascrell who joins us live this morning from Capitol Hill congressman thanks for taking a few minutes I guess I just want to start by running by you we've been talking about it here on the show the basic parameters of the deal that at least are being reported of a potential deal house or the Senate Republicans kind of pushing this may be pushing this on the House Republicans and it would be reopening the government for six months funding it at the sequester level for that time extending the debt ceiling to the end of next January and then making another increase after that contingent on having some kind of long-term budget deal worked out between the Senate in the house in the third piece of that being a two-year delay in this medical device tax if those are the basic parameters you're presented with are you as a member of Congress okay was supporting that as long as we open the government as long as we agreed to pay what we all both sides have voted on these things we need to pay our bills then we can negotiate so whether it's the medical device thing which I'm not very happy about about removing because what are you going to replace it with but we are not going to essentially affect the Affordable Care Act thank God well can you pick up that point for a minute because I think maybe we should take a step back here in the medical device tax is everybody's been about this and I think everybody sort of reaction this is probably to shrug be like why is this thing such a big deal why is this tax on medical devices to begin he explained why this has become such a central issue and what it represents while we're talking about 40 billion dollars over a period of time it's one of the ways we're paying for the Affordable Care Act I think that there's been enough evidence over the last 15 years that parts of this industry I say parts of the industry have actually been in collusion with doctors have many times been indicted got away with it by the way by paying a fine I'm not so sure that that's not the way to go but Steve it's nothing to hang your hat on and say this is the essential point which I will not go beyond it's part of a package if it's reasonable I think senator Collins is heading in the right direction it's something that we can be talking about as we are right now as long as its reasonable i think democrats would go for it one thing for sure we're standing our ground not because of a party situation but because of america we are not going to back down from people who threaten who we are whether the small group or a larger group we made our point that's it the president supports us we support the president and that's what we should be doing right now this is not time for party politics congressman it's MJ Lee with Politico good to see you how you doing good how are you you know you've obviously been very critical of your colleagues across the aisle including a congressman Scott Garrett from your state I mean what is your sense right now in terms of Republicans and where they stand on you know defunding Obamacare or weakening Obamacare I mean do you think that most of them view it as a moral issue or do you think that the even the folks who you know in the beginning or initially for defunding Obamacare I mean how much of a concern is it for them you know just looking over their shoulders and you know being afraid being you know primary challenger who is considered more to their right come after them next year well I'm not questioning Scott Barrett's motivations or the clack that supports what he does he's been very very clear I think you would understand this that he wants an ascent essential changes it's not a total dismantling a delay in the Affordable Care Act Scott that's not going to happen so I don't know what you're going to do when you get to the point of whether you going to keep this government open or try to get it back open again and what you're going to do when you have the debt of the United States on your hands and whether we're going to pay our debts and not simply become afterthoughts I don't know what he's going to do about that and with you either have great motivations that's fine and the American people are more important than either political party we'll have to make a decision we're talking about ideologues we're talking about people who can't even communicate with their own party we've seen that we didn't make this up we didn't create this situation over the last two weeks who would have thought two weeks ago that we'd be talking about the dismantling of one of the great political parties and 20 30 40 50 people are not going to do that to America and they're not going to do it to the Republican Party I could I can assure you that all right congressman bill Pascrell going to be a busy day there in Washington thanks for taking three minutes we appreciate it our world-famous

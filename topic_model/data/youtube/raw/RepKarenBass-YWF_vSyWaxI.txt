welcome back just how far our Democrats willing to go to get the full unredacted Muller report the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said today that anything less than everything is quote inadequate and will go to court to get it with me now is House Judiciary Committee member and Democrat from California Karen bass congresswoman good to see you thanks for coming on yeah you heard from the Attorney General there that beep obviously does not plan on showing any unredacted version of Congress and I think he would argue that that isn't what the regulation says etc so what do you legally have at your disposal that makes you think you can make him do this well first of all we'll look and see what he presents but we certainly can't issue a subpoena as you recall we voted last week to give the Chairman the authority to issue a subpoena and if they don't comply with the subpoena then we'll take them to court I know this was done years ago in previous administrations and that might be what we have to do if we have to do that though I think it'll be a sad day but remember this is the Attorney General who auditioned for the job with a 19 page report saying he pretty much is gonna do exactly what he's doing well he clearly has an expansive view of executive power at a minimum let me ask you this the Watergate special prosecutor Philip Lacovara and Lawrence tribe a harvard law professor of some of some note have an op-ed today arguing that if bar is essentially being very aggressive with redactions due to the grand jury veto due to using the two things that i think he would rely heaviest on to do redactions the law governing grand jury secrecy and then the law that has to do with if you're not charging somebody don't you you don't want to besmirch their character if they're not very charged now they're arguing that if you start impeachment hearings then you're entitled to all of this in the same way a prosecutor is because this is suddenly a prosecutorial entity the you think you'll have to go all the way to opening an impeachment inquiry to force the Attorney General to share it all with you you know I certainly hope we don't have to do that I think that that would be very divisive I think not only do we need the full report but we also want all the underlying evidence so we're asking for even more and I think that it would be a shame if we had to resort to that I know we have not discussed that so far so hopefully it won't come to that I will tell you though I'm very concerned for him to say that he's going to redact things that he might that might be Smerch a person's character he could then give us you know a hundred pages of completely redacted you know material and that's just not gonna be acceptable what is a compromise look like here are you open to a where you get to look at it but not keep a copy of it it is it's held in a secure room you know there's all sorts of ways I remember the so-called torture report which is when something called it others called it the enhanced interrogation investigation there was some sensitivities there and many members of Congress went and sought themselves but couldn't take notes and all of that is that a compromise that's worth thinking about here I don't believe it is at all I mean this is an investigation that taxpayers paid for and not only should it be made available to members of Congress I think it should be made publicly available now I know that there might be some redactions that are needed some classified information and of course that's going to be acceptable but I do believe the signals coming from a bar though are not very positive so I would be very concerned about the way he is signaling now that it is going to be very heavily redacted but you asked you know what course we could take I mean perhaps we subpoena Muller you know it seems as though there's a number of people who were involved on Muller's team that are very frustrated with the lack of information that bar has put out so it might mean that we subpoena some of those people I won't be surprised if overtime if he really does do a complete you know whitewash job more people involved in the investigation are going to start talking now in fairness congresswoman we don't know anything yet though I mean you're assuming the worst here of the Attorney General in fairness why I am but I'm assuming the worst because I think he was pretty clear in his auditioning document how he viewed this whole thing and remembered during the confirmation process you remember he was asked to recuse himself he didn't do that he was also asked during the confirmation process would he release the full report and he was you know pretty much saying that he would have to wait and see so I think that given all the time that has been all of the suspense all of the taxpayers resources that there is an obligation for that report to be released in full I want to change subjects here on another congressional hearing today that you were involved with and what's amazing is you actually it turned out the way the hearing was watched proved the point during the hearing YouTube was covering the hearing live you had a Google representative testifying having to do with how to deal with white nationalism white supremacy white supremacist hate and this issue that Google Facebook have had a hard time dealing with it Google because they own and operate YouTube well there were so many hateful comments YouTube had to basically shut down the comments section basically proving they don't know how to deal with this well I mean exactly and I think that this was a very very important hearing unfortunately my colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted to use it for different purposes to show that you know there was discrimination on the side of Democrats and all and that really wasn't what the hearing was supposed to be about we do have a problem in this country with domestic terrorism we have a problem in this country with white supremacy we also have a problem with you know the way the social media is the fact that all of those comments came in and they literally had to shut the comment period down I think does Google and all believe that they are should be held responsible for what is on YouTube well I think that they feel that they should be held responsible but they are I hope they also feel that they can police themselves and so I think that the fact that they shut it down was them demonstrating that they have the capacity to monitor it themselves but obviously this is an issue we need to look at we know the impact this had on the last election in 2016 the fact that there were the hate messages trying to persuade African Americans not to vote to take things very negatively so we know that this is a serious problem does it prove they could shut it down as it proved that they don't know how to filter it out they don't have a filter that they claim they can use right right right well I think that that was pretty clear that's for sure congresswoman Karen bass good to see you Democrat from California thanks for coming out and sharing your views much thank you said having me

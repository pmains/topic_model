[Applause] thank you betty thank you everybody so i i'm i'm going to start this by saying the opposite of what i usually say when i give a speech i'm going to say i am not happy to be here with you today i'm i'm i'm pissed off that we have to keep on doing this and and i know that probably a lot of you feel that way as well um there are people in this audience who have been to these marches many many times before and there are kids who are probably here the first time and we don't want to have them do this 5 or 10 or 20 more times before we get chained but despite that i thank you for being here i thank you for not being too tired to come out at 8 a.m on a saturday morning to do what has to be done to keep our kids safe i thank you for not losing hope i thank you for having the patience to do what we have to do in america to make change and that is to understand that yes you have to work hard year after year after year because unfortunately that is how politics works sometimes when the news came of the the shooting in uvalde in the wake of the horrible massacre in buffalo i it's hard for me to describe how i felt i'm a politician i'm supposed to be good with words but but it's very hard for me to express it i will tell you i thought about my own daughter who has grown up now but i thought about all those days all those years when i was taking her to school and thinking about what it would have felt like if i'd had to think every single time i dropped her off for school that this might be the last time i saw her something that i know so many parents in america have to think about every single day today even if the chances of one of these school shootings is so low just the fact that we have to think about it is terrorizing moms and dads and kids all across this country but we know what needs to be done because we've done most of it in the state of new jersey think about this we are of all the states in this union we are one of the top two or three states in terms of safety in our schools safety for our kids we have we have one of the lowest rates of gun violence fatalities in the united states of america and why is that why is that is it because we have less mental health problems in the state of new jersey no is it because we have less crime in the state of new jersey no is it because we have kids not playing video games in the state of new jersey is there less evil in the state of new jersey i'm sorry to say no right we got all the same problems as all of the other states all the same challenges that they have and yet we are much safer because we have strong gun laws because we have we have leaders like joe crying who came to politics from a career in law enforcement who understand what it takes to keep us safe and so what we have to do is to take what we have learned in the state of new jersey and apply it to the country as a whole for the sake of our fellow americans living everywhere else and also for our own sakes because as any of these police officers will tell you almost every single gun that is used in a crime of violence in new jersey comes from one of these other states where they have much weaker gun laws so what have we done in the house of representatives and this is this is my job you know i i when the valdez happened i i mourned for those for those victims i prayed for their families but i remembered i have a job that very few americans have just over 500 people in this country have the job that i have my job is not to mourn my job is not to pray my job is to act and so last week in the house of representatives we we tried to act again we we have passed very strong background check laws i don't actually don't even call them background check laws i call them violent history check laws that's what we're talking about we're not interested in your financial history we're not interested in your shoe size we are only interested in whether you can safely own a weapon in this country we pass that we're gonna we're gonna try our very best to strengthen those rules we we passed legislation to ensure that the red flag laws that allow police officers with a court order to take guns away from dangerous people apply to every single state in this union just like they do in new jersey we passed a safe storage law to make sure that people who have kids in their home safely store any weapons that they may own we passed this is the simplest thing in the world we passed a law that says that you got to be 21 years old if you're going to buy one of these assault rifles i think they should be banned all together but but if you've got to be 21 to buy a pistol you want to be 21 to buy an ak-47 or an ar-15 that's just common sense we passed all of those laws and we are going to move to do an assault weapons ban as well in in the united states house of representatives but now here's where where i got to mention the p word and that's politics um a lot of these common sense laws that are supported you know this right by 70 80 90 of the american people the overwhelming majority of gun owners support these laws and yet they go to the united states senate and we get very little progress 20 years ago we passed in the congress a ban on assault rifles which unfortunately expired after 10 years it passed in a bipartisan way in 1994. it was championed by president ronald reagan who is the ultimate republican in this country these last 50 years and last week when all we tried to do was raise the age of purchase from those assault rifles for 20 to 21 we only had 10 of my republican colleagues voting with us ronald reagan was for this 20 years ago and now we only have 10 left i'll tell you another depressing story about the politics that we are facing i've got a colleague in the house a very conservative republican member his name is chris jacobs he comes from the area around buffalo new york you can imagine how he feels about this today and after that horrible shooting he got up in front of a press conference and he said you know what if they put an assault weapons ban on the floor of the house for a vote i will vote yes because i got to do something i cannot in good conscience just do nothing after something like this happens that was two weeks ago a week later he announced he was not running for reelection because the gun industry got to him because his party said you're through that's the politics that we are facing right now so remember that when it comes time for the election this november we know who stands where on the gun issue in america today we know who is willing to act to protect our kids and we know who would rather lose more kids than lose some vote in a primer that's the difference right now in our politics and the problem is we're all in agreement here we care about this but we have not been voting on the basis of this issue and in america if you want the power to change you've got to vote your beliefs you've got to hold politicians accountable based on what you believe and if you believe this is the most important thing and it ought to be because what is more important than protecting our children then we've got to make sure that we come out there this november and we vote for people who believe that our kids need to be protected and i know everyone here is going to vote if you're 18 or older right but whether whether whether you're you're 18 or older everybody here can go out and get 5 or 10 votes everybody here can knock on doors everyone here can talk to members of their family and their friends and their co-workers and make sure that they're out there in this midterm election where historically not enough people vote and remind them that this is important people ask me what's it going to take this gets back to our frustration and our fatigue that we have to march so many times and i'm not going to tell you that it's easy but i am going to tell you that it's actually very simple we can get change this is a math problem we can get change if we get two more united states senators who are willing to break the filibuster to pass common sense gun legislation so long as we also have a majority in the house that keeps on passing these bills and that's our job in the state of new jersey because our two senators are going to do the right thing so remember that this november it is on us we have the power to make sure that america is no longer the only country in the world where our parents have to worry about not seeing their kids every time they drop them off from school are you ready to march for that are you ready to organize for that are you ready to vote for that thank you

I come to the floor to remember my good friend and our late colleague representative Walter Jones Walter Jones was someone who deeply cared about this institution and the constitutional principles that undergird our service he was a respected member of the Armed Services Committee where he was a passionate advocate for military families and against endless senseless Wars that seemed too often to have a small percentage of Americans bear a disproportionate burden for the decisions that are made by this body and others Walter was a deeply caring individual he was an encourage her when he saw members on the floor regardless of your seniority or your status within the institution he referred to everyone as chairman he thought that that was a distinction that that should be shared and one that he used to revere those who he served with in this body he had friends on the right on the left and in the middle because Walter treated with everyone with respect and was the ultimate Southern gentleman I will miss his friendship his guidance his mentorship and this institution in this country will miss the principle with which Walter Jones served our great nation I yield back mr. speaker

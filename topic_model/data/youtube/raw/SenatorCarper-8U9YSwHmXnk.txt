almost eight eight years ago when George Bush was becoming our president our country found itself in a situation where we had the strongest economy of any nation on earth we actually had balanced budgets and budget surpluses or as far as the eye could see we were now not at war we did not have our troops committed in Iraq or or RF Afghanistan we're just coming off of a century which was arguably the American Century the next president who takes office in a little more than eight months from now will not have that that luxury or that position they're going to huge challenges at that president faces will have a involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan which is likely to continue for some time we have enormous health care costs in this country much greater than anybody else in the world the outcomes are not as good we face the huge threats of global warming and climate change we know our earth is getting warmer we're not sure just how to deal with some of us have a pretty good ideas that Joe Lieberman and all but the other thing this president is going to inherit next January is a mountain of debt and instead of surpluses as far as far as the eye can see red ink for as far as the eye can see we know we have to deal with these issues and one of the foremost issues we need to deal with is how to rein in the cost of health care and improve the outcomes the next president is going to need a blueprint we talked about roadmaps to piece the next president is going to need a road map the Democrats and Republicans can support which will rain in the cost of health care increased improve the outcomes and do so in a way that doesn't break the bank but actually creates a little bit of income stream for the bank Ron Wyden bob bennett and others around that are part of this this group had done wonderful work thinking outside of the box to develop that roadmap that blueprint for the next administration more importantly for our country and i applaud them and i'm happy to be a part of this effort thank you

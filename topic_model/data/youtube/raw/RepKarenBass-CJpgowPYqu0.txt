congresswoman Karen bass said this that Angelenos will remember the rapper as a protector inspiration father brother--and unabashed son of La quite a statement so we wanted to see if we could talk to the congresswoman now who we understand has taken time to join us on the phone thank you so much oh you're very welcome glad to be here the title there miss bass son of LA what does that mean to you well I mean I think that you know he made such an incredible contribution to our community you know a neighborhood that is awfully Mullah often maligned marginalized and he could have moved anywhere he could have moved to me Beverly Hills Malibu he stayed in the neighborhood he used as wealth to contribute to the neighborhood and I think that he is an example that we need to hold up to to all young people and he also showed that redemption is real I mean he had a troubled time period in his past and his youth he turned that around and he made positive contributions and I think that this is something that we can all learn from people can turn their life around they can be positive and we are talking now about going forward and how we go forward from here how do we do that what do we need to do to take his message on to the next level well I think teaching people who did not know about nips he did not know about his work teaching them for decision-makers for lawmakers to understand that communities need resources that punishment is never going to change communities and I think lifting him up to young people who might be experiencing challenges in their life to show them that they can succeed and they can make positive contributions and they can be leaders yeah we have all set with us Tammy Mac with KJ LH and she said that's Nipsey Hussle wasn't knee-deep in his community in terms of trying to turn things around I want to know from you what can lawmakers learn from someone like Nipsey Hussle well and then let me tell you that's one of the reasons why I spoke on the floor and did the Congressional Record because I wanted my colleagues who didn't know about him to hear about him he was more than a musician he was a leader he was a businessman he was an entrepreneur and what I want them to learn is that again Redemption is real resources need to be put into communities not incarcerated people who have challenges in their life and congressman what was the reaction to that what what did your fellow lawmakers have to say maybe those who really didn't know who Nipsey Hussle was well the reaction was very positive you know people ask me about him they said they never heard about he they knew that you know that a young man was killed who was famous and so they wanted me to tell them about him but I also used it as an opportunity to speak about him informally with my colleagues and to talk about you know what this individual had done and the fact that he was a businessman and I think people don't often think about that when they think of a rapper yeah you might be famous you might make a lot of money but they don't think about the fact that you know people can be entrepreneurs and and start businesses where he hired people from the community and you know South LA is an area where unemployment is high representative bass so you take this to lawmakers you inform them now they know what is the endgame when it comes to communities underserved communities like South Los Angeles well I will tell you the endgame is legislation of resources I'm working on legislation right now that would call for model programs to help people transition into civic life who have been incarcerated so re-entry programs you know we were able to pass bipartisan legislation on prison reform we called it first step because there needs to be a second a third and a fourth step and so I'm using nipsey's Life to say you know we need to continue putting resources in the community now unfortunately we went through so many years of mass incarceration and now we are just beginning to understand how detrimental that was and how in many ways it actually caused the opposite it was supposed to reduce violence it caused violence because if people do not have a legal way to support themselves then we shouldn't be surprised if their illegal behavior continues and a Nipsey Hussle seem to understand that because he did help people who were incarcerated who were just getting out of jail and we're back on the streets they needed food I needed clothing and they needed a fresh start he was doing that and you can be sure that I'm going to examine what he did closer and use some of his lessons in the legislation so we need to have programs that support people when they come out and you know we need to get past the error of just punishment because again people who are incarcerated tend to be concentrated in particular communities and so if you concentrate them without an opportunity for them to interact in legal life employment then don't be surprised that the communities continue to have challenges represented the best we have live shots here from the ground and in the air of what is happening at Staples Center here right now from what we understand half of Staples is full as of right now this was supposed to start at 10:00 o'clock obviously running a bit late but you look at the throngs of people out here right now are you at all surprised by the large crowds and the number of folks who are spending their day down at Staples no I'm not surprised at all the only thing I wish that I could be there with everybody in Los Angeles and what about the fact people are willing to stand outside they don't have tickets to get in tickets were handed out on a first-come first-served basis but they're willing to come and they're coming from Seattle we heard from London and it's okay just stand outside what do you make of all of that it's amazing well I just think it shows how far wide and deep his reach was not just his music but his message all right representative Karen bass we appreciate your insight here this morning again calling and nipsey hussle the son of LA we want to be back in tamii Matt from kjh you've been listening to what the representative said today and she says you know we need more resources we need more programs here in these underserved communities absolutely she's telling the truth I mean she knows

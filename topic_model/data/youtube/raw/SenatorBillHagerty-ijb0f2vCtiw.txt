that's just looking for it it's all good this bill calls for statehood for washington d.c my amendment strikes this bill's findings regarding d.c statehood and instead provides that it's the sense of the senate that d.c should not be a state because it's inconsistent with the constitution and the framers purpose in establishing the federal district it's based on the following findings i quote washington dc was intentionally created under article 1 sectionated the constitution of the united states as a federal district not beholden to nor dependent on any state which was confirmed by the 23rd amendment to the constitution of the united states which reiterates the federal district's non-state status and grants the district whatever its size three electoral votes d.c statehood is therefore inconsistent with the purpose of washington d.c as a federal district that ensures that the federal government will never be dependent on a particular state to this end united states attorney general robert f kennedy said in 1964 i quote it was indispensably necessary to the independence and the very existence of the new federal government to have a seat of government which was not subject to the jurisdiction or control of a state and given the constitution establishes washington d.c as a federal district under both the cardinal and the carter and the reagan administrations the justice departments concluded that accomplishing d.c statehood would require a constitutional amendment the whole point of creating dc as a federal district a district that's not a state was so that the federal government wouldn't be beholden to any particular state the constitution establishes it as a federal district and it would have to be amended to accomplish d.c statehood to illustrate that point the 23rd amendment provides that the federal district shall have three electoral votes so if as the d.c statehood legislation that recently passed the house proposes the federal district was shrunk to the size of a few buildings whoever occupies those buildings would get three electoral votes in the presidential election who would get those three presidential electoral votes the first family a billionaire that buys up all the housing space nearby this is an absurd outcome there are serious possibilities here that would result with inconsistency with the constitution you know like the rest of this bill it's nothing but a blatant power grab it's a ten it's an attempt clearly to place two new democrat senators i certainly urge all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment thank you well thank you madam chairman and certainly opinions differ over this issue but this bill doesn't establish statehood for d.c it does have findings that address the fact that american citizens in dc should have that ability or supportive of that concept and i i must say that the vision has been that we would still have a federal district the the boundaries of that district would be redrawn by legislation as it was previously redrawn so there's nothing unique in in that well anchored in our history and that the citizens in the non-federal district would constitute more american citizens than in two of our states and there's certainly the vision of our constitution is equal representation not unequal representation and so it would be the right thing to redraw the federal district around the federal buildings the dis the federal entity would not be inside the the the newly founded state and the newly founded state would give fairer and equal representation to citizens who do not have that at this point any any other discussions on this okay clerk will call the role senator feinstein no by proxy senator schumer no by proxy senator warner no by proxy senator leahy no by proxy senator king senator merkley no senator patilla senator oshoff no by proxy senator blunt votes yes senator mcconnell aye senator shelby aye by proxy senator cruz senator capito aye senator wicker aye by proxy senator fisher aye senator hyde smith aye senator hagerty aye nine eyes nine nodes you didn't get two i didn't vote oh i'm so sorry ma'am my apologies no you're doing your job chair one chairwoman clove a child yes no nine eyes nine no's my apologies

feels about let's bring in California Democrat congressman brad Sherman congressman Sherman is a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and sits on the terror subcommittee sir thank you for joining me and very quickly before we get to presidential politics I do want to ask you about what's happening in Iraq how serious is it in your mind that the perimeter of the green zone has been breached it's one of many factors that demonstrate that Iraq is poorly governed you've got a sectarian regime in Baghdad with corruption that face is not only Isis it has wrought to have better relations with the Kurds it has not reached out to the Sunnis this is a government that's in some trouble not because of today today just reflects that it's in trouble okay congressman let's move on to presidential politics here is this week we saw Donald Trump laying out his foreign policy agenda in his speech he not only attacked the Obama administration's policies on Isis but also the Bush administration policy of nation building in the Middle East did you find anything workable or reassuring in mr. Trump's speech I think that he's a very bad spokesperson but he does mention a couple of ideas I mean a broken clock is Right a couple times a day we can no longer ignore the bird ensuring issue when Japan wants us to defend their Islands you'd think that they would DV defending their islands as well but they have a hard stealing of one percent of their gdp that they're willing to spend on defense likewise this huge trade deficit I know you had the professor on just a few minutes ago we cannot ignore the fact that we're importing half a trillion dollars more goods every year than we're exporting and there it does hurt jobs it has reduced wages prevented wages from rising and all three presidential candidates have focused on the fact that our current trade policy needs needs a replacement as you know yesterday in your home state there and mine i should add mr. Trump turned back to his domestic agenda how are his proposed playing in the Golden State well I think they'll play real relatively well with the Republican electorate but the Republican electorate is as little as twenty five percent of the state I the polls indicate my own sense indicates that he will do better than either of his opponents in California whether he goes to the convention with 1237 is hard to judge at this time and Indiana being winner-take-all may turn out to be just as important as California mr. Trump's rally in burlingame I know you've seen that it was met with protesters big time yesterday they forced the candidate to use an alternate entrance in fact and come in on foot instead of in the car in a tweet today Donald Trump wrote here's the quote the protesters in California were thugs and criminals many are professionals they should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement what do you think about mr. Trump's response well I think he's doing what you'd expect him to do to rally his base and I think the protesters in Costa Mesa and burlingame did Donald Trump a favor those people who already hate Donald Trump don't need to be persuaded in November but if Trump can say that can it can juxtapose himself not with Hillary Clinton who I think would be a very good American president but juxtapose himself with violent demonstrators attacking a cop car and and police officers then he can create a picture that will help him get elected so I as someone who has won 25 or so elections I'm I I don't I think that the demonstrators may have met their own psychological needs but they're not helping us keep Trump out of the White House congressman brad Sherman there in California and congratulations on 25 elections that's something to be very proud of sir thank you for your time appreciate it you

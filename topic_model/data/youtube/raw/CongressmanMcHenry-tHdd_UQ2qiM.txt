Services Committee my good friend the gentleman from North Carolina mr. McHenry gentleman is recognized I think the Republican leader on the Rules Committee for yielding it's unfortunately we're here today to debate a bill like this this bill is nothing more than a partisan power grab that is the sum and substance of what has been offered here as HR 1 this is about the priorities of Democrats in the house and the priorities of Democrats in the house is to change our election laws in such a way as to benefit their party and and hurt the American voters and the will at the ballot box that is the deep problem here with HR 1 this is a partisan power grab by one party to seize power by manipulating our laws to get an outcome counter to the will of the people it's not about fairness it's just the opposite this is a problem even the process that the Democrats went through the majority went through for this bill we had one markup in one committee even though we had multiple committees including the House Financial Services Committee that's how big this bill is it had multiple Committees of jurisdiction that we're supposed to have markups on this and they did not go through that full process and so this bill at the end of the day seeks to limit free speech it uses taxpayer dollars to fund partisan campaign efforts and mandates outcomes designed to get more Democrats into power this is not about fairness it's just the opposite let's vote against this rule and let's vote down this bad bad bill

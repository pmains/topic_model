just Madam President senator from Virginia I'm president Tim first of all I wanna thank my good friend my colleague from Virginia senator Kaine for appropriately saying to the balance of the Senate yesterday this is not business as usual and for objecting to us going into recess as 800,000 Americans many of them who are working and as we heard earlier this morning many of them working overtime are getting paychecks that have zero on senator Kaine is probably already outlined where he just came from I want to give the same comments and I'm going to also thank that the chair because I know she has come to the floor as well and raised this concerns we have a lot of debates here in this Senate and there are legitimate policy differences we have and part of our job is to resolve those the part of our job should never be to shut down the enterprise of the greatest government in the world the United States of America and I think about mr. Trump who has spent a bunch of time going on TV and running to the border my goodness I I just wish that Donald Trump or someone from his white house could have sat in the room that Center cane and I just sat in with 1516 federal employees and just heard their stories what we heard and I'm sure Center cane has already acknowledged this as we heard from virtually all of them the fact to be viewed that public service in serving the government within that was a noble calling heard many of them who had been either Air Force ER or army or Navy who had served in our nation's defenses but felt that they were continuing to serve when they joined public service we heard another person who works in one of the part of our government that I'm a little familiar with that probably frankly not that much that does investigations into chemical spills it's a small tiny agency 40 professionals there was a chemical spill in Houston a week ago and no one has done any investigation about what the effects of that spill might be on that community and she was sitting there saying you know somehow she doesn't feel like her job is non-essential we heard from a young man who'd moved to Virginia just a few years ago bought a house thought he could get through one more mortgage payment helped to approve food stamp approvals and actually the grocery stores will who apply to take in food stamps so I think it's got 2,700 grocery stores during this period that are in the process of trying to get to approval to take food stamps haven't got approval and just say to him that somehow making sure that folks who are hungry in this country get food that is a non-essential job was both insulting and frankly a little bit demoralizing to hear as well from which organization he works for but someone who was saying you know understood that as a federal employee when he came and joined the federal workforce he gave up his right and many ways to organize to strike but he felt like he gave up those rights but the the deal was the government was gonna pay him for his job and that in many ways what's happening right now is kind of in labor terms the effect of the government locking out our workforce and I don't want to steal senator canes thunder he may have already mentioned this comment but I thought it was oil boy it was telling we had a number of air traffic controllers there and these folks are not only working without pay but many of them are working overtime without paying and with our air traffic controllers about 35 40 none of them are at the age eligible age of retirement today they could throw it throw it in cash it in say we're done one of the things about the shutdown as well as we've been working for some time Paul Rinaldi the chair head of the air traffic controllers you know I would advise any member to go talk to him because he can scare the Dickens out of you about the safety of our air system but we've had a challenge for the last decade of making sure we would place those air traffic controllers well the next class of air traffic controllers is shut down and as Senator Cain made mention and I think mr. Renaldi made do you really want your air traffic controller who's working an 80 hour week overtime to be not spending a hundred percent of his his or her focus on keeping the the skies safe but it's probably spending twenty percent of his mind thinking about paying the mortgage and another ten or fifteen percent of the time thinking about can he pay his kids tuition is that really what we want from folks who are tasked with such an important job now due to the good work of Senator Kaine now there's a the presiding officer we passed I think two days ago the fact that all of our federal employees are gonna get reimbursed I think the house has passed it now as well and the president signed it but let's not presume by any chance that that's gonna make everybody whole we heard from a lady this morning who you know hadn't saved very much but had done what we would all urge put some money away in her IRA she asked she's taking your money out of the IRA paying the tax penalty of taking that money out so she can get by she gets her back paycheck that doesn't replace the penalty in taxes she played on her savings we had another person who took an advance on a credit card we all know credit cards have some value but it's not exactly those rates are not cheap if you take an advance against we should pay from your credit card and if you get even back pay that's not gonna make up for those penalties and against the no cane may have mentioned this already we in Virginia I know molasses got the same issue yeah we've got tens of thousand nine hundred thousands of workers who were contractors who even when we reopen the government had absolutely no guarantee that they'll be reimbursed a matter of fact again senator Cain may have mentioned this already there was a veteran's own small business contractor had about nine employees this week is probably going to shut down because he can't pay his workers he maintained as long as he could but couldn't continue to pay his workers or what about the folks who are never gonna get the hours back who worked providing food services or cleaning up our buildings who were the lowest paid employees oftentimes contractors who we're never going to get those hours back who are still going to be stuck with Christmas presents but never get the income from that time and the list goes on and on it's not just again federal employees contractors Alaska and Virginia are both blessed with great heritage sites great national parks Shenandoah Valley around senator cane lives a lot of battlefields around Richmond I'm sure the same in Alaska there are a lot of private businesses that are the restaurants or campsites or other facilities that may not be on national park ground but they get all their business from tourists who come during this oftentimes during the holiday periods those folks get even when we reopen the government goose eggs so I thank the presiding officer I thank my friend from Virginia as well you know I believe we will find a way to get this government reopened my hope is that our colleagues when they're home this weekend will be refreshed by hearing from workers who are doing their jobs without pay and that we will find a way to get this this government reopened but we should be very clear that the damage that has been done the damage that has been done in terms of how Americans view all of us regardless of where we are in this policy debate how Americans view our federal government how the rest of the world views us now that we have got to just this shutdown I believe by tomorrow become the longest federal government shutdown in American history I hope and pray that we'll all maybe in the aftermath of stepping back one find a way to make sure that people who paid undue penalties financial penalties because through no fault of their own the government shutdown we find a way to compensate that we can sort through all complicated the issue around contractors and that for those private businesses who are around federal facilities that we try to come to some kind of joint agreement that never again never again will we use a non connected policy issue to hold hostage 800,000 folks who work for us and hundreds of thousands of others and frankly millions who depend upon these services going forward we ought to find and again I may be being overly optimistic that somehow or the other that we'll get this resolved but if we do we ought to find those of us who are part of the groups that find common Accord to put some marker down that we never ever ever do this again and my closing comments and I've got stories from a variety of Virginians here and I know that the chair is going to want to get out of the chair one o'clock so I will submit these stories for them for the record but I also and as somebody who's been in the private sector longer than the public sector and like my friend my colleague from Virginia we've both had the honor of being governors of Virginia so we've both been in executive positions we both been in positions where we've had work forces and I know as a as a as a business guy you could tell how well a business would do on how you treated your workforce because that's the most important asset you've got your human capital and if we think back over the last decade we've even through tight financial times we found ways and appropriately so for our military to get funded we've even found ways I think irresponsibly to dramatically cut our taxes particularly for folks at the top and every time we've had to try to make cutbacks where we've made cutbacks has been in what we call domestic discretionary which in English his things like the TSA like air traffic controllers like the Agriculture Department like the Coast Guard and each year whenever we find sort we've cut those programs matter of fact domestic discretionary spending is that the lowest percentage it's been since the 1960s so we've asked all these folks who are furloughed who are being asked to work without pay we've asked them to do more with less we didn't great for the work force morale and now we've had a White House and my gosh I wish them somebody from the White House could have sat there today because I would have loved them to try to explain how they ought to go back and negotiate with their landlords about the rent do or how they ought to make do with a side job or how they ought to do is some folks who are doing as we've I was gonna report from some of our genes who are selling their personal possessions on eBay to pay the bills the fact that this White House is willing to go to the border for a political photo-op the president's words not mine or get on television and blast his political opponents but not be willing to send anyone from this administration to sit down and listen to the concerns of our federal workforce is disgraceful so I think again my colleague from Virginia for his great work on this I I think it is appropriate that we are in session today raising these issues I think the level of angst that's going to take place over the next 48 hours is more and more people get those paychecks with zero on it we haven't seen anything yet that kind of angst that we felt perhaps disproportionately in Maryland the district people are going to feel all over the country we need to bring this government shutdown to an end we need to put our workforce back to work we need to make sure the services they provide are are being applied in a way that makes our country safer and we need to find a way to make sure that never ever again will we use these folks lives as what they are being used right now their words not ours political pawns they are more important their jobs are more important their lives and more important than the way they've been treated over these last 21 days with that Madam President I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum

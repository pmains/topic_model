this GOP congressman Michael McCall is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and he joins me now congressman welcome good morning to you I good morning thanks for having me what do you think about that I think it's be comical for one dangerous it's very insulting to the Prime Minister of Israel insulting to our greatest ally in the region and it empowers Iran with their nuclear weapons facility and you know marked at a time when we have such a crisis in the Middle East with the Muslim Brotherhood and al Qaeda trying to fill the vacuum taking over our embassies killing our ambassadors and he has a chance to meet with the world leaders to discuss this very issue and he declines I just think it's unconscionable and furthermore why hasn't he responded to this crisis he has yet to go on national television and dress the American people and the world to say that we are not going to tolerate this kind of action to our embassies on American soil it's our embassies you know this ambassador was he did do that right afterwards he did come out and make a statement but I think a lot of people agree with you that you know the more we learned about it and the deeper the problem appeared to become when al-qaeda looks to be behind it we have not heard from him since since then on it I think he's been sort of radio silent you know and I think he needs to come forward and address the nation I hope tomorrow before the United Nations that he'll take that opportunity but I hope he takes a strong stance I hope he doesn't call into question our alliance with Israel because that will embolden again Iran and these al Qaeda Muslim Brotherhood forces I think that'd be a serious mistake listen to Robert Gibbs who was his former press secretary and now with the campaign on this with with chris wallace on Fox News Sunday they have telephones in the White House last week he talked to the president of Egypt he talked to the leader in Libya we don't need a meeting in Washington just to confer with leaders we've got but he doesn't date the time did be out of here we have a strong diplomatic I'm sure if he was doing an interview with you on Fox News you'd have no problem with that hmm so he says we you know the leaders talk by telephone it's not as if there is in communication going on like this is the largest attack on American soil because it wasn't embassy really since 911 I remember President Bush getting on the national television addressing the American people after that why would I get the view is the perception he's trying to downplay this and I think he needs to treat it more seriously and addresses there's no question they're having back channel conversations and I hope that he's using the carrot of foreign aid with Egypt to say look you know we give your military 1.5 billion dollars where were they protecting our embassy when it got stormed and the fact is they were AWOL the Egyptian military was not there so you know we need to condition this foreign aid with with certain conditions and strings to better protect our diplomats overseas let me let me take you back to the Israel and Bibi Netanyahu topic for just a moment here Bibi Netanyahu in a video soundbite that we just showed moments ago said wait you know wait for what because he's very upset that he is being asked to sort of you know hold off on potentially on a strike back against the the progress that Iran is making towards nuclear weapons he believes that the United States should have a red line and that if Iran crosses that red line that there would be some form of retaliation do you think that that pressure is the reason that the President Obama does not want to sit down with him at this point well there's no question there's tension between the President of the United States the President of Israel and I think that needs to be bridged but I better think again that you know I think what Netanyahu he was doing is waiting patiently he's been very patient till after the election to see he was elected but his window his window being able to defend himself is closing very rapidly in terms of what he can do to that nuclear facility this is a very serious issue because of the strength of Hezbollah not only in the Middle East but also in the Western Hemisphere I recently went down to South America tri-border area Buenos Aires where they blew up the jewish community center eze both in the United States if this situation is not handled properly we could see Hezbollah operatives lighting up all over not only the Middle East but also this hemisphere and the United States of America frightening scenario thank you very much congressman McCaul good to see much for having me so the president has said repeatedly

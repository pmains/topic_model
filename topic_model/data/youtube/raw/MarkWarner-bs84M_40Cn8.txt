PUSHING FOR DEMOCRATS FOR MONTHS TO PASS THE BILL BEFORE THE  ELECTION THAT HE ENDED UP  LOSING. JOINING ME NOW IS THE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA, ALSO  FORMER GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA,  MARK WARNER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME, SENATOR. SO YOU ALSO HAVE BEEN CALLING  FOR THIS BIPARTISAN  INFRASTRUCTURE BILL TO PASS FOR  MONTHS. HAD THAT HAPPENED, WOULD TERRY  McAULIFFE BE THE GOVERNOR-ELECT  OF VIRGINIA RIGHT NOW? >> DANA, YOU KNOW, WHAT A  DIFFERENCE A WEEK MAKES. IF WE WERE AFG THIS SHOW A WEEK  AGO OR TWO WEEKS AGO, REMEMBER  WE'VE HAD TWO MAJOR THINGS  HAPPEN. ONE, A GREAT JOBS REPORT,  531,000 NEW JOBS, A COUPLE  HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS ADDED IN  PRECEDING MONTHS. IF WE COULD HAVE HAD THIS  BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL  WHICH LARRY HOGAN IS RIGHT, THE  HOUSE COULD HAVE PASSED IT IN  AUGUST, WE COULD HAVE SPENT THE  LAST THREE MONTHS GOING AROUND  VIRGINIA TALKING ABOUT CLEAN  WATER SYSTEMS, IMPROVING OUR  TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, MAKING  SURE OUR AIRPORTS DIDN'T APPEAR  TO BE THIRD WORLD, MAKING SURE  EVERY HOME IN VIRGINIA HAD HIGH  SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY. WE HAVE A LOT OF COASTAL AREAS,  FINALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  IS STEPPING IN ON RESILIENCY, OR AN ISSUE LIKE THE COUNTRY IS  GOING TO BUY 25,000 NEW SCHOOL  BUSES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. CHANCES ARE THEY'LL BE ELECTRIC. WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF WE MADE  THOSE BUSES IN AMERICA OR IN  VIRGINIA? WE HAVE MONEY FOR THAT IN THIS  INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. I THINK IF WE COULD HAVE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT THAT WIN, AND  SHOWING THE KIND OF JOB CREATION THAT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN TAKING  PLACE, THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN  DIFFERENT. >> DIFFERENT IN THAT YOU THINK  TERRY McAULIFFE COULD HAVE  PULLED OFF A WIN? >> ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, THIS WAS -- THE VOTERS  IN VIRGINIA AND THE VOTERS OF  AMERICA GAVE US THE PRESIDENCY,  THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE. THEY EXPECTED US TO PRODUCE. THEY'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS  BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL  FOR MONTHS AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THE BILL. I WAS ONE OF THE SO-CALLED GANG  OF TEN THAT PUT IT TOGETHER. IS IT PERFECT? NO. BUT IT IS THE FIRST TIME IN 50  YEARS, 50 YEARS WE'VE MADE THIS  KIND OF INVESTMENT. >> SO THE FLIPSIDE OF WHAT  YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE  DEMOCRATS WHO CONTROL CONGRESS,  THE DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, BY NOT GETTING THIS DONE,  THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRY  McAULIFFE'S DEFEAT. >> WHAT I'M SAYING IS I WISH THE HOUSE WOULD HAVE MOVED EARLIER,  BUT ALL OF US KNOW, I KNOW AS  WELL, WE NEED TO PRESS THE  SECOND HALF OF THE PRESIDENT'S  AGENDA AS WELL. I WISH WE WOULD HAVE SPENT LESS  TIME TALKING ABOUT TOP LINE  NUMBERS AND MORE TIME TALKING  ABOUT WHAT'S IN IT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ALL KNOW WE WANT TO SEE THE ECONOMY COME FURTHER  BACK. WE WANT TO DEAL WITH THE SUPPLY  CHAIN ISSUES. PART OF DEALING WITH THE SUPPLY  CHAIN IS GETTING FOLKS BACK TO  WORK. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS  WE CAN GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK  IS IF WE HAVE CHILD CARE THAT'S  AFFORDABLE, AND UNIVERSAL  PRESCHOOL. THAT WILL GET PARTICULARLY WOMEN WORKERS BACK INTO THE MENTIONED  >> TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE ALL  GET VACCINATED, WE'RE SAFE. THE PRESCHOOL AND CHILD CARE ARE PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S SECOND  PART OF THIS AGENDA. >> THOSE ARE TWO OF MANY  PROVISIONS IN THE OTHER BILL  THAT IS NOW WAITING TO GET  PASSED IN THE HOUSE. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT  TO CHANGE, BECAUSE AS YOU WELL  KNOW, IT TAKES EVERY SINGLE  SENATE DEMOCRAT TO VOTE YES FOR  THIS SECOND BILL TO ULTIMATELY  PASS. >> I THINK THINGS LIKE CHILD  CARE, PRE-SCHOOL MAKE A LOT OF  SENSE. LOWERING PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION  DRUGS. I GOT A TYPE ONE DIABETIC  DAUGHTER, I CAN AFFORD TO PAY  FOR INSULIN. MANY FAMILIES CANNOT. THIS NEW BILL WILL CAP INSULIN  FOR EVERY FAMILY AT ABOUT $35 A  MONTH. THAT IS AN ENORMOUS BENEFIT TO  MILLIONS OF FAMILIES, MAKING  SURE WE TAKE THE APPROPRIATE  MOVES TOWARD MAKING SURE WE HAVE A CLEANER ENERGY DEALING WITH  CLIMATE CHANGE. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S KIND OF THROWN US ALL FOR A  LOOP, MOST ALL OF US, THE VAST  MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS THOUGHT  THAT THE WAY WE WOULD PAY FOR  MOST OF THIS IS BY GETTING RID  OF SOME OF THE TRUMP TAX CUTS,  RAISING CORPORATE RATES, CAPITAL GAINS AND RATES FOR FOLKS AT THE HIGH END. THE FACT THAT IS NOT THE CASE  MEANS WE HAVE TO GET THE PAID  FORCE RIGHT AND WILL TAKE THE  CENTER MORE TIME. I'M PREPARED TO VOTE FOR THE  BILL. >> YOU'RE PREPARED TO VOTE FOR  IT. I WANT TO TAKE IT UP TO SORT OF  10,000 FEET AND ASK YOU ABOUT  SOMETHING THAT YOUR FELLOW  VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT ABIGAIL  SPAMBERGER HAD TO SAY. PRESIDENT BIDEN AND HIS AGENDA,  NOBODY ELECTED HIM TO BE FDR. THEY ELECTED HIM TO BE NORMAL  AND STOP THE CHAOS. SO ARE YOU MISREADING WHAT  AMERICANS WANTED OUT OF THIS  PRESIDENT, OUT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS THAT IS NOW IN CONTROL? >> I THINK WHAT THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE WANTED WAS TO DO RATIONAL PRAGMATIC THINGS. I GOT ELECTED 20 YEARS AGO WHEN  VIRGINIA WAS A VERY RED STATE. THE INITIAL PLAN AGAINST COVID  IN MARCH WAS WHAT THE ECONOMY  NEEDED AND AMERICANS WANTED. I THINK THE INFRASTRUCTURE  INVESTMENTS WERE LONG OVERDUE,  BUT I DO THINK COMING OUT OF  COVID, WHEN VIRTUALLY  EVERYBODY'S LIFE HAS BEEN  DRAMATICALLY CHANGED, THINKING  ABOUT AND PUTTING FORWARD  PROPOSALS ABOUT CHILD CARE,  ABOUT PRESCHOOL, TO GET FOLKS  BACK INTO THE WORKPLACE, TO  RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT BRINGING DOWN THE  COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR  30 YEARS, AND WE'RE FINALLY  GOING TO DO IT AND RECOGNIZING  WE'VE GOT TO GRAPPLE WITH  CLIMATE CHANGE, I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HIRED JOE BIDEN TO DO, AND I  THINK ONCE WE DO IT, I THINK  YOU'LL SEE THE PRESIDENT'S  NUMBERS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE. >> I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO WHAT  DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST MEMES  CARVILLE HAD TO SAY ABOUT WHAT  HE THINKS WENT WRONG FOR  DEMOCRATS. >> IT WAS STUPID WOKENESS. JUST DEFUND THE POLICE LUNACY,  TAKE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S NAME OFF  OF SCHOOLS? PEOPLE SEE THAT, AND IT'S JUST  REALLY HAVE A SUPPRESSIVE EFFECT ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE  DEMOCRATS, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE  NEED TO GO TO A WOKE DETOX  CENTER OR SOMETHING. >> ARE DEMOCRATS TOO WOKE,  SENATOR? >> LISTEN, I DON'T SUPPORT  DEFUND THE POLICE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I THINK YOU SAW DEMOCRATS ALL AROUND WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE MAYOR OF NEW  YORK YOU'LL HAVE ON IS TALKING  ABOUT INVESTING ADDITIONALLY IN  OUR POLICE FORCES. ARE THERE WAYS WE NEED TO MAKE  POLICING MORE COMMUNITY-BASED? ABSOLUTELY. DO THE NOTION OF WHAT HAPPENED  IN VIRGINIA, THERE IS NOT A  SCHOOL IN VIRGINIA THAT TEACHES  CRITICAL RACE THEORY BUT  GOVERNOR-ELECT YOUNGKIN STIRRED  UP THE CUTURAL POT THERE. I HOPE HE GOVERNS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. >> CAN I STOP YOU FOR A SECOND  IT'S TRUE IT'S NOT IN THE  VIRGINIA CURRICULUM AT ALL BUT  DID DEMOCRATS MISS A CHANCE TO  SIGNAL TO PARENTS IN PARTICULAR  THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR  ANXIETIES? I TALKED TO DEMOCRATIC  CANDIDATES AND OTHERS WHO SAY  THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A  GOOD ANSWER TO QUESTIONS ABOUT  CHILDREN AND NOT ONLY WHAT  THEY'RE BEING TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS  BUT THE ANXIETY AS WE COME OUT  OF THE PANDEMIC. >> DANA, I THINK GLENN YOUNGKIN  TOUCHED A NERVE THAT WAS FELT IN VIRGINIA BUT FRANKLY FELT ALL  OVER THE COUNTRY, AND I THINK  SOMETIMES OUR RESPONSE, YES, WE  NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE  INCREASE TEACHER PAY. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE PUT --  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PUT  MORE MONEY INTO EDUCATION BOTH  UNDER TRUMP AND UNDER BIDEN, IN  THE LAST 18 MONTHS THROUGH COVID THAN EVER IN OUR HISTORY. I DO THINK WE NEED TO  ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S BEEN HELL  FOR EVERY PARENT LIVING THROUGH  COVID, DISRUPTING THEIR LIFE. I THINK WE NEED TO THANK OUR  TEACHERS, I THINK WE NEED TO  THANK OUR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS  AND I THINK WE NEEDED TO HAVE  ACKNOWLEDGED THE CHALLENGE THAT  PARENTS HAVE FELT AND THAT WE  NEED PARENTS' INVOLVEMENT IN  THEIR KIDS EDUCATION AND  CANDIDLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT  ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SCHOOL, I THINK ONE OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT  THINGS WE NEED TO HAVE TALKED  ABOUT AND SHOULD BE TALKING  ABOUT IS I THINK A LOT OF THOSE  KIDS AND A LOT OF FOLKS,  FRANKLY, THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING  IN SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO NEED  SOME MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE. I THINK THE AFTERMATH OF COVID  IS NOT GOING TO BE SIMPLY SOLVED AS WE GET THESE SCHOOLS REOPENED BUT GETTING SCHOOLS REOPENED  DOES REQUIRE THE KIND OF HARD

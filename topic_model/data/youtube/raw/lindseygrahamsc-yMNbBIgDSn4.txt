senator it's great to talk to you again here and thanks again for being on this weekend on the Fox show I love your show but your sep tember statement was uh was pretty unnerving really back in September right after this thing happened I think you smelled a rat early on and so did I well it was so to me obvious that this was not the result of a video and a spontaneous mob something this elaborate and this effective against a consulate was not you know you don't have people with RPGs just showing up at an embassy late at night just saying hey we'd like to have a little demonstration that just didn't it made no sense well it made no sentence but there was a breakthrough on fox news sunday at a democratic congressman from method jesus i think his name was lynched but he admitted that there never was a protest and the whole storyline about a spontaneous riot caused by a hateful video mimicking cairo never never was legitimate and that's important when Susan Rice took to the airwaves she told the story most favorable to the administration because the difference between a spontaneous event in a pre-planned terrorist attack is night and day you don't hold people nearly as culpable for an event they can't control versus something that was a long time in the making so I think the President himself kept telling this story that it was a spontaneous event rather than a pre-planned terrorist attack which takes you back to the warnings of Chris Stevens so the storyline given by the white house is crumbling and never forget this is not about Susan Rice this is about the White House and President Obama Susan Rice obviously went with talking points that have been supplied to her by her own admission by both the White House and agreed to by the CIA which we now learn was pressured these talking points were thoroughly edited over a period of several days prior to announcements being made senator it seems that the the difference now is that other networks are paying attention to it CBS had darrell Issa on CNN now is covering this story this is no longer going to be relegated to just fox news and talk radio 1 or shoot it because the reason that you and I are so insistent on getting to the truth a bond has been broken by those who serve in dangerous areas in their government I think trust has been broken between the people of the United States and this administration clearly the storyline they tried to push after the attack was most politically beneficial if the facts had come out this was an al-qaida-inspired attack pre-planned that cuts into the narrative they were selling seven weeks before the election but what you're going to hear from these witnesses about what it was like in Benghazi and Tripoli during the attack is going to make you mad and I just can't thank their lives and jason Chaffetz and hopefully some Democrats this should be bipartisan don't you think might this is about people being left abandoned for seven and a half hours by ignoring warnings that were there for all to see and manipulation of the facts after after the event for political reasons I hope Democrats will take this seriously I don't see how they cannot and I think you're mentioning Stephen Lynch taking you know the position he did over the weekend was very significant it reminds me back what happened when the Watergate story started breaking and for a while it was as third-rate burglary you know this is so in material and then when republicans face with facts had to start breaking with their own president and calling in to account for what had happened with the cover-up of Watergate it was the beginning of the end for Richard Nixon it appears to me that it's going to be impossible after these witnesses come to Capitol Hill this week you've talked to some of them you visited with some of the people who are first person witnesses to what actually happened senator is it fair to say that the story that they're going to tell is going to directly contradict the official White House and administration version completely and fully it's going to be a hundred and eighty degrees out and I hope that once Bardem because mr. Hicks who is the number two guy there is there's not a political bone in this guy's body I'm I've been talking to him for months and there are other people that have come to me on the CIA sighs are very afraid to come forward there's more information going to come I think the dam is about to break and they're going to find a system failure before during and after you're going to find political manipulation seven weeks before Election you're going to find people asleep at the switch when it comes to the State Department including Hillary Clinton and we got to learn from this and not only you can learn is to get to the truth and you got to remember the President himself for over two weeks push the narrative that we think this was a spontaneous event inspired by video there's no way in world with any investigation that he could have kept saying that so I just think the White House has to be looked at long and hard about manipulating the facts here will we ever find out the highest level official who gave the order to not send in any special forces we now know that special forces were poised and ready and had repeatedly asked for permission to go in and try to intervene and they were told to stand down and I know that mr. Hicks will testify that his jaw dropped when later Hillary Clinton said she did not know of any requests for assistance and that there were no request for assistance I think if we keep pushing what Fox found out last week with a special operator but they're serious CIA folks who have been contacting me to third persons that are very much in in the camp of we could have done more we should have done more during the attack is very important to get to the facts and who did stop special operators from coming in if they were available and if we find out there was a c-130 in Croatia with suspect special operators available if that turns out to be true that contradicts the highest level of the Pentagon you got the state department here in a compromised situation you got the White House manipulating evidence in fact and now you may have the Defense Department not telling telling something that will not hold withstand scrutiny I hope the American people will want to keep pushing I'm going to keep pushing because the bond has been broken Mike between those who serve us in harm's way and the government they serve is this huge and to me every bit as damaging as Watergate well and in fact I would say far more so because nobody died in Watergate we have four Americans who are dead with not really a very good explanation as to why they died senator it is always like it going yes sir go ahead well I just the explanation was false I mean it was like it was a contrived explanation that was beneficial to president politically not borne out by the facts and this hearing winters can be very important thank you Mike for keeping this in the public eye and the next coming months or going to be very interesting we got to stay on this it really matters we will so they're always a pleasure thanks for joining us and we're anxious to see these hearings this week 855 840 4825 more some that will shock you when we return this is the Mike Huckabee show

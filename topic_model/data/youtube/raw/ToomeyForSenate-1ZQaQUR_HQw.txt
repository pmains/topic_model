40 as I mentioned at the beginning of the program an opportunity to spend some time with one of the candidates running for the US Senate he is Republican Pat Toomey former congressman from the Lehigh Valley and also represented parts of Montgomery County and pad thank you so much for your time thanks for having me Darrell how are you I am well where are you today in the Lehigh Valley I am in my Allentown often allentown odds you didn't get hit by too much snow today did you get that we've got you know it snowing pretty steadily but it hasn't accumulated very much ok so it's still snowing oh really how about that now what's I was talking earlier at how much problems even a little bit of snow can can create so we had accidents and delayed school openings and all of that but I'm I'm glad to know that you're safe and warm right now and talked to me a little bit about your take on where we are with health care reform I know we've talked about this topic on this program before and you've got a lot of concern about the direction Congress seems to be moving in I'm as disturbed as much by the process as I am with the the product or what I think is going to be the product what's your take on it well I think the process is is terrible how could you describe it and it is a direct contradiction to what the president repeatedly promised in the campaign I'm sure you remember hmm he insisted that it was going to be open and transparent and he was very specific he said we're going to have c-span in the room everyone is going to be televised there will not be back rooms secret deals we're going to have this discussion in the in the you know the antiseptic some of sunlight and and and that's what we should do should have an open process but we don't we have a backroom process Republicans are completely excluded from any consideration or any discussion and we saw what this process produces in the Senate Darrell arrangements whereby single state gets to be exempted from the cost of the Medicaid costs that would be imposed on all the other states so Pennsylvania for instance in addition to being course to incur higher Medicaid costs ourselves we're also going to pay for Nebraska's uh higher Medicaid costs simply because ben nelson held out and sold his vote for a higher price than our senators did hmm then we find out that there are three counties in Florida they will not be subject to the Medicare cuts all the other counties in America pretty much are going to are going to be subject to those cuts in Medicare yeah but the the florida senator said well if you want my vote graphic them these counties so that's a terrible process it's just absolutely horrendous and it is leading to a very bad product and it is part of you know one of the things that barack obama said when he was a candidate what was he was a lot of people expected that he was going to be a transformational figure in terms of how government was done versus the way government would be done but you know and you hear the term once in a while chicago-style politics yeah where he came from and it does seem to be more of the same well that's right and you know he promised them that it wouldn't be more of the same and the fact is it's true that this is congress that is engaging in this in this particularly reprehensible behavior in this with regard to this bill but if president obama came out publicly and said i'm going to insist that we do this in a transparent process they would have to go along there's no way they could not and in fact let's face it the white house is at the negotiating table as well at the end of the day nothing comes out of this conference that hasn't already been blessed by the white house because they're not going to send the bill a bill to the president that he can't sign so so the president is every bit as much to blame as Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and I just think it's it's very unfortunate is there a few cents a momentum for change change was of course the the motto two years ago but but it seems like there may be an even greater change in this election cycle you've already had died from Connecticut and organ from woodsy from north dakota and south tech from North arctica one of those Dakotas a man they've already announced that they are not going secretly action and there does seem to be this desire for change a dissatisfaction with what people thought they were going to get two years ago and the desire for some other kind of change well that's exactly right the fact is of very many people voted last year for change and that was Barack Obama's great strength was that he appealed to many people across a broad spectrum as an agent for change with the hope that it would be constructive change but but I'm here to tell you that what they have been doing is not the change that people had in mind people did not believe and did not really vote for a massive expansion of the federal government they didn't vote to have cereal bailouts of failing companies which continues to this day you know just a couple of weeks ago another 3.8 billion taxpayer dollars going into gmac the caps lifted entirely on the amount of subsidies that taxpayers are going to have to put into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so the cereal bailouts continue spending is that a breathtaking staggering and totally unsustainable level you know I was very critical of budget deficits last year when they hit four hundred and sixty nine billion dollars and I argue that's too big that's dangerous and it's and it's just not right well this year it's 1.4 trillion dollars in three times last year's well and it's going to be another 1.4 trillion next year if this is this is not what people voted for having government as taking enormous control over health care is not a priority of the folks of Pennsylvania that I talked to they want to get our economy going again they want to see job creation and a government of living within its means and that's what we need to be focused what what is your what are the ramifications of running those kinds of deficits what is the impact of this going to be on the occurring question great question and I think that first of all they're very very negative but it's hard to know exactly how it manifests itself and the timing is difficult no but when you impose an unprecedented and staggering amount of debt at some point something gives so one thing that can happen is we can discover that we're unable to sell that the staggering volume of Treasuries that we need to sell hmm it's called the failed auction when the government shows up to sell a bunch of Treasuries to raise a bunch of money and there aren't enough fires out there to meet to buy all that the Treasury needs the issue remember what happens well that's a huge problem not because you know then how do you pay your bills where do we do them you know don't then where do you go exactly no it's a huge problem and the obvious most immediate consequence typically is a huge increase in interest rate eventually you can get people to lend the money but you have to pay them much much higher interest rates in order to persuade them to do so that's one scenario the other scenario that worries me just as much Darrell is when you consider the staggering amount of money the Fed has pumped into the system the fact that the Fed is monetizing some of this debt by which you know does that mean the Fed is simply printing the money to then give it to the Treasury the danger that we have a collapse of the dollar or a huge surge of inflation is the very real danger and and until unless we get our fiscal house in order III think that's actually inevitable at some point so so I and you know huge inflation means that everybody who's a saver is in deep trouble because what you've saved is no longer worth very much people who have fixed income suddenly discovered that all of the daily necessities cost much much more this is not unprecedented fact it happened many times in our own history you know a US dollar today is worth a small fraction of what it was worth 50 or 60 years ago and and you know it could happen all over again it's terrible for our economy it's terrible for job creation and a terrible for people who have saved and people who live on a big thing is there is there going to be enough of a political backlash to change the direction the government is moving and even if there are changes as one would suspect in the Senate and the house is there enough to change the direction that this is all moving in that you know that's the that's the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question i I you know I have been campaigning gustan since I got into this race need a campaign for ending bailouts and fiscal sanity and getting the economy moving again in the private sector which is the only source of real growth and sustainable jobs my my opponents whether it's joe Sestak or arlen specter they are big advocates and have supported all the bailout all the stimulus bill they want more stimulus they want to continue to grow government so we're going to have a big debate in Pennsylvania we you know which direction do we want to go in now if guys like me if I can win this race as I think I will and if candidates like me in other states and other congressional districts win then I do think we will be able to change this direction and get back on a more rational and responsible fiscal footing but it's right it's going to it's going to be determined by the outcome of the election thanks this year later this year joe Sestak was on the programmer nobody this weekend and to me Joe Sestak is sort of a classic liberal candidate in that he truly believes in in government activism and any believes that that is the direction that the countries are given that that is the role of the federal government what is your take on on the boats at Arlen Specter is cast in terms of whether he is a true believer or he is doing some of what he is doing for political expedience now that he's on the other side well let me first say I completely share your assessment of joe sestak I also happen to find him a likable guy yeah and he's and he's a bright guy he's a very very liberal man he is for the left of Barack Obama on virtually every domestic policy issue that I can think of is in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi he is an advocate a very forceful advocate for a much bigger federal government higher taxes more spending uh that that is clearly something he believes strongly in his voting record is consistent with it he's campaigning with us I give Joe credit for being a principal liberal there's only one principle it's important Arlen Specter and that's his own re-election I think that's abundantly clear this man will join any party he'll take any position he'll say anything I mean I where to begin you know when he announced that he was leaving the Republican Party one of the things he said was I will continue to be independent I will not be a rubber stamp for the Democratic Party hmm as soon as Joe Sestak emerged as a serious primary challenge arlen specter lost all independence and precisely became the rubber stamp that he is he has been voting his lockstep with Harry Reid you notice there was no discussion about him holding out for anything on as there was with respect to ben nelson and Blanche Lincoln and other Democrats in the Senate Arlen Specter has been as liberal as he can be and he will continue to do that for as long as he needs to in this Democratic primary if he managed to win the primary oh he'll do 180 all over again but remember this is a guy who was in favor of the card check you know the legislation to deny workers a secret ballot went voting on that union he was opposed to it then no no he was initially for it then when he thought he was running against me in a Republican primary came out against it then when he joined the Democrats he's forward again likewise 180-degree reversal on the government-run health care on our troop level in Afghanistan on gay marriage I mean it's it's actually it's sad to see it I mean that this is a man who is just desperate and it's quite clear there are no guiding principles accept whatever he thinks is in short-term political interest well it's certainly going to be interesting to follow that that Democratic primary coming up in the spring and the general election to promises to be interesting as well in pennsylvanian we've got a governor's race in the senate race and a lot of things to follow that's right yeah it's going to be a very a variant she I think it's a very important here because we're really at an inflection point we have a you know a very liberal wing of the Democratic Party is in complete control of the agenda in Washington we have one Party rule right now and they've been very clear about where they want to go they have a very liberal agenda I think they really want to move us in the direction of the European welfare state model as opposed to the traditional American model of democratic free enterprise so we're going to have in some ways I think Daryl we could view as a referendum on that that approach that philosophy that remaking of of our society I I think people are going to vote to keep the traditional America well we're out of time but I hope we talk you given soon well thanks for having me dial I'd love to come back to me appreciate it Republican candidate running for the US Senate

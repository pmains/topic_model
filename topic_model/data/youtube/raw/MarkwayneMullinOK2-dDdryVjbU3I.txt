hey guys there's a lot of stuff going on in washington d.c right now and the most important things happening isn't happening in our nation's capital it's happening across the street in the supreme court yes here in the nation's capital we are without question working on funding but we're going to do a continued resolution because the democrats can't seem to get their stuff together which in a way is probably a good thing because the way they want to fund the government is completely opposite the way most people would run their own finances but let's talk about what's happening across the street the supreme court for the first time in decades the supreme court is actually looking at abortions and what it is that the states can do and re-looking at roe versus weight i mean if you really sit there and you think about it science has changed dramatically since the first time we visited versus wade and when you start thinking about abortion and you start thinking about science which is what the left always wants to refer to well let's talk about science we know a lot more about the baby inside the womb not the fetus the baby we know a lot more about conception and when life begins than what we did even when they were arguing the case the first time guys we have killed hundreds of thousands of babies now tell them how many liters we have lost to abortions i can i understand there's a lot of bad situations that happen out there but abortion isn't is it the option or isn't even the solution you know as a father of three adopted beautiful kids to whom christy and i love i can tell you somebody loves that baby somebody will care for that baby as much as anyone else and they'll take care of that baby as their own so we don't have to have abortion we can have adoption and we can move forward as a nation and make sure these leaders that unfortunately have probably been lost will be able to raise up and be their full potential one day guys i'm excited about what could happen across the street at the supreme court we need to continue to pray for leadership and for wisdom guys thank you so much for this opportunity to serve the great state of oklahoma may god bless you and may god bless united states of america

is now congressman Lance Gooden I believe it's a Republican from Texas and I believe that is accurate good morning congressman good morning how are you I'm really good thanks sum it all up the impeachment process so far what do you think it's been totally non transparent it's been done from the basement of the Capitol and Democrats heard Republicans saying for weeks this is illegitimate you need to put this up for a vote so Democrats thought they'd get cute and put it up for a vote and silenced us and now they're saying we've moved the goalposts but the goalposts have been the same since day one and that is give us the same rights that we gave we the Republicans gave you during the Clinton impeachment that the minority had during the Nixon impeached way they haven't kept this because they they are allowed to make their own rules in the house and that's what they're doing and the American people I believe are seeing through it and the American people want transparency and a few public hearings next week are just not going to cut it now how long does this go on for because yeah you're right there's public hearings next week I don't know whether they're televised or not I presume there will be but after that I mean are we gonna be hearing impeachment impeachment impeachment until next year I think Nancy Pelosi who really didn't want this from day one before she came to the far left is sitting in rooms with her leadership team probably every night saying how are we gonna end this cuz I don't think they have anything so I do I mean she they know that if they set this thing going you think she wants to end it once they know I think she wants to know how it's going to end because they know that once they impeach him and send it to the Senate then it's over what are they gonna do they're gonna stop investigating him and actually respect the wishes of the Senate if they say the president is innocent okay if it drags on throughout the rest of this year there's only what seven or eight weeks left right and into next year what gets done in Congress anything before last week I would have said nothing but in the last few days we've heard talk from the Democrats that they are feeling confident to the US Canada Mexico trade agreement may actually move forward and so I think they're hearing from some of their vulnerable members and these swing states that went for Trump last election or in the last presidential election they're saying we've got to pass this we know we have the votes speaker Pelosi please let it let this bill come forward so I'm hearing talk in the last few days that it may actually happen before Christmas the Senate seems a little less optimistic but rumors from the hill are saying that that may be the one accomplice the one thing that could get done Kosar Lance good and republican texas thank you sir heat it here

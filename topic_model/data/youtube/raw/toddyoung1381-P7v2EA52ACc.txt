last week Indiana lost a legend and America lost a true original Rex early died Friday at age 88. after a long battle with illness now Rex was a lot of things in life he was a United States Marine he was chairman of the Indiana Republican Party he was a candidate for governor of the state of Indiana he's one of the few people in Indiana you had to go see if you wanted to run for public office but Rex will be remembered mostly for his sense of humor his way with words many of his stories and rexisms can be found in his book it's a mighty thin pancake that don't have two sides after being stationed in Japan in the Marine Corps Rex went to Indiana University on the GI Bill he married his sweetheart Barbara and they moved to Indianapolis now Rex said that when he first went to register to vote in Indianapolis the ward chairman said you want to be a Precinct committeeman the last guy went to jail of course Rex responded quickly sure and that's how he got involved in local politics or so Rex told us now Rex said that one of the highlights of his professional career came during Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign when Rex hosted an event at his home for the future president Rex said he was considering hanging a plaque that read on May 4th 1980 Ronald Reagan used this bathroom but as Reagan left his house that day Governor Reagan told Rex all those people were wrong Rex and Rex said what people Governor Reagan said all the people who said you had no class so Rex decided not to hang that plaque in his bathroom the Republican party in Indiana today has enjoyed a long period of governing success helping our state become one of the best run and most fiscally sound in the nation and you can trace that success directly back to work Rex early put in in the early 1990s one of Rex's 19 rules of politics was you might be important but the number of people who attain your funeral will be dictated by the weather I don't understand what Rex is trying to say don't think too highly of yourself perhaps that's what Rex had in mind don't become as Rex would call you a sophistic suck but I disagree with Rex perhaps on on this point Rex's memorial service was well attended and not because the weather was good but because he made an indelible impression on everyone he met Semper Fi Marine

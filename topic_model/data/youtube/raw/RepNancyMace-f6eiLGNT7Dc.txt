the white house's so-called compromise a 1.7 trillion dollar infrastructure proposal actually cuts down on spending for roads bridges and other major projects or there were any republicans who are falling for it joining us now is nancy may south carolina congresswoman on the transportation and infrastructure and oversight and reform committees uh congresswoman thank you for joining us first of all you said i kind of like your your language here you said president biden's just playing footsies uh with republicans on infrastructure on any kind of compromise what did you mean by that well he's just been playing games for weeks now he's had republicans from both the senate and the house they've met multiple times and he keeps pushing back on on fiscally responsible proposals that our side is trying to put together and and in their last package they're they're just shuffling money around they're not willing to cut some of the crazy spending that's in the original infrastructure bill and as you just said they're actually cutting from roads and bridges funding i just i just brought my kids home from school and every hard-working american we know what our roads are like we know what real infrastructure is and it's not school lunches no no no but we we did hear of a counter proposal and i i talked with about it with the senator danes to to spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure real infrastructure and use 700 billion that's uh from previous covet money that's still in the treasury do you know anything about that and would you be willing to accept that kind of a counter proposal well i've just heard that being floated around today in the media and i believe if we could repurpose billions of dollars of unspent covered relief funds and avoid raising taxes to pay for the infrastructure package i believe on the republican side you will see an appetite for that in the senate and in the house because the last thing we need to do in the middle of a pandemic when businesses are suffering is to raise taxes on them yeah well and then we have uh transportation secretary budage pete buda judge who says uh that he is going to go back to the two that the biden administration or at least parts of it or want to go back to the 2.3 trillion dollar plan bypass republicans entirely and go to reconciliation and pass this by a vote of the vice president uh if there's a 50-50 split in the senate do you know anything is is that a real possibility first of all would the parliamentarian in in congress allow that to happen well it's hard to say yeah we are hearing that budget reconciliation is one route that that democrats may try to take i know on the house side on a transportation infrastructure committee we keep hearing timelines and deadlines for a markup and full committee for a package but those timelines keep getting pushed back so time will tell and if it doesn't get done this summer then i believe after august recess if it's not done then that they will try to push it through a reconciliation process which likely means republicans will have no say in any package that comes out of there but again do you know whether that would be deemed acceptable by the parliamentarian who's supposed to look at the rules well we thought we couldn't do it with cove with the kobe belief package and they did it anyway so really be up to the parliamentarian to make that decision it's amazing the needles that are being threaded by uh by the democrats control now of all this now uh there's one part that was of of one of the plans there are many american plans there's there's the american jobs plan there's the american families plan etc the america's families plan hasn't even begun the negotiation yet but they we already know they want to put this tax plan and to give the irs enormous power to not only look at the incoming uh the money that comes into our bank accounts but to look at how you spend that money as well of course that could lead to uh to trying to do profiles with algorithms of what kind of people are they're looking into and that could lead to targeting individuals politically are you are you upset about that and are you looking to kind of make sure that doesn't make it in the final cut oh absolutely and what we've seen over the last couple of months and years even is is the overreach of the federal government we just saw it a few weeks ago with the post office uh who you know they can barely deliver the mail they lose five billion dollars a year and yet now they have a spying program on americans and so the overreach of the federal government is problematic it is troublesome and we've got to do everything we can to ensure that doesn't happen to innocent american people we saw in the irs too with lois lerner targeting conservative groups and conservative individuals i i want to ask about wuhan it's it's a big jump here but but it's it's so important to find out how the virus originated and how it became a pandemic what do you plan to do in the minority in order to try to pursue this the the the bite administration wants to let the who which of course many people say has been compromised by the chinese government so that's that's not going to do a lot of good to but but is there any way you can investigate it on your own as the minority party in congress well i know there's an appetite for that with republicans on the oversight and reform committee and we are trying to do just that but because we're in the minority it's very difficult just last year dr fauci told us that that covet 19 is of natural origin and then we're hearing today you know president trump said there could be a possibility it originated from a lab and all the media attacked him for it said it was a conspiracy theory and yet today we have media like in the new york times a prominent reporter uh saying it was trump's fault that the laboratory as a matter of fact it's interesting you mentioned that because uh we have a sound bite from from one of the mainstream reporters trying to put it on trump even though a year ago when trump was talking about it the media didn't want to hear about it let me play that sound bite and get back to you i do think it's important to remember that part of the issue when this was first being reported on and discussed back a few months after the pandemic had begun was that then president trump and mike pompeo the secretary of state both suggested they had seen evidence that this was formed in a lab and they also suggested it was not released on purpose but they refused to release the evidence showing what it was and so because of that that made this instantly political that was uh maggie haberman from the new york times and it's just extraordinary they were the ones who were casting a great shadow on the the so-called conspiracy theory that it originated from the wuhan lab and now they're blaming trump somehow in some circuitous logic for this whole thing what do you think it's complete irony and and now i look at it today it's been 15 months since coven 19 really has entrapped the american public and there are two answers we should have is one what is the true origin of covid19 and who covered it up number one and two why has it been 15 months so we know nothing more today than we knew 15 months ago nothing literally nothing well i i wouldn't say nothing forgive me for pushing back but if it wasn't for the wall street journal's reporting perhaps you'd be right but at least there are independent investigators in the wall street journal and we're trying to do it irritation absolutely to try to look into it but but the question is will we know or is it possible that that the leads have gone cold well republicans are going to try but in oversight and we're seeing the way democrats operate another biden administration i'm doubtful that congress will do anything to investigate the original origins of kobit 19 and who's actually responsible i have i have little hope in that happening in this administration representative mace we thank you for coming in appreciate it

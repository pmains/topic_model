  SHERMAN OF CALIFORNIA. THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEMAN FROM  CALIFORNIA, MR. SHERMAN, AND A   MEMBER OPPOSED EACH WILL CONTROL FIVE MINUTES.  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE   GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA. MR. SHERMAN: THANK YOU.  ONE PROGRAMMING NOTE, AT THIS  POINT IN THE SCHEDULE, WE WERE   SCHEDULED TO DEAL WITH THREE   SHERMAN AMENDMENTS, NUMBER 21,   NUMBER 21 AND NUMBER 22. NUMBER 83 WAS INCLUDED IN AN EN  BLOC ADOPTED BY THIS HOUSE LAST  EVENING. FLOOR NUMBER 20, RULES COMMITTEE NUMBER 301 IS NOT BEING  CONSIDERED AT THIS TIME BECAUSE  IT WILL BE INCLUDED IN AN EN   BLOC THAT COMES UP LATER TODAY.  SO WE ARE NOW FOCUSED ON NUMBER  21, RULES COMMITTEE NUMBER 82  AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THAT  AMENDMENT. ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1983, KOREAN   AIRLINES 007 WAS SHOT DOWN.  269 CASUALTIES INCLUDING A   MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE,  CONGRESSMAN LARRY MACDONALD. ON JULY 17, 2014, MALAYSIAN  AIRLINES NUMBER 17 WAS SHOT DOWN , 298 CASUALTIES.  IF THERE'S ONE THING THIS HOUSE  CAN AGREE ON, IT IS THAT WE ARE  OPPOSED TO SHOOTING DOWN   ESPECIALLY DELIBERATELY SHOOTING DOWN CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT.  AND YET, THE GOVERNMENT OF AS  EXPENDITURE BASE AND WITH  RESPECT TO FLIGHTS GOING INTO  THE AIRPORT THAT THEY ENVISION   THE PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION OF  AIRPLANES LANDING IN THAT  TERRITORY. THIS THREAT HAS BEEN REPEATED  SEVERAL TIMES BY THE OFFICIALS   AND IN TIMES PAST, THEY HAVE   ACTUALLY SHOT AT CIVILIAN  AIRLINERS GOING INTO THE   AIRPORT. THAT IS WHY THIS AMENDMENT IS  NECESSARY. IT PROHIBITS THE TRANSFER OF   DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ARTICLES  UNLESS THE PRESIDENT CAN CERTIFY THAT THE WEAPONS BEING   TRANSFERRED WILL NOT THREATEN  CIVILIAN AVIATION. IT WOULD BE A TRAGEDY IF THE   CIVILIAN AIRLINER WERE SHOT AT   OR SHOT DOWN AS IT LANDED OR   TOOK FROM THAT THE TERRITORY.  IF THAT GOD FORBID EVER HAPPENS, LET IT NOT BE AN AMERICAN  WEAPON.  WE ARE ON NOTICE THAT  ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS  TRANSFERRED TO THEM MAY VERY   WELL BE USED AGAINST CIVILIAN  AIRCRAFT.  THAT IS WHY IT IS NECESSARY FOR  US TO HAVE THIS PROVISION. AFTER 23 YEARS OF STUDYING THESE ISSUES ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS  COMMITTEE, I'M NOT CONVINCED   THAT WE SHOULD TRANSFER ANY  WEAPONS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES  TO THIS GOVERNMENT UNTIL IT  COMES TO THE TABLE AND RESOLVES  THE DISPUTE. BUT CERTAINLY WE SHOULD NOT  HAVING BEEN PUT ON NOTICE  TRANSFER WEAPONS THAT WE CANNOT  BE SURE WILL NOT BE USED TO  SHOOT DOWN CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT.  I'M PLEASED TO HAVE THE  CO-SPONSORSHIP OF THIS AMENDMENT BY REPRESENTATIVES SPEIER,   SCHIFF AND PALLONE.  AND I BELIEVE THIS IS A  NECESSARY STEP BECAUSE AS WE   PROVIDE WEAPONS TO COUNTRIES   AROUND THE WORLD, WE SHOULD NOT  PROVIDE ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS  THAT WE BELIEVE MIGHT VERY WELL  BE USED TO SHOOT DOWN CIVILIAN   AIRCRAFT.  I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE   AIRPORT IS LOCATED IN THE  REPUBLIC OF ARZOK AND  HISTORICALLY ARMENIAN TERRITORY  THAT WAS LUMPED IN BY NO LESS  THAN JOSEPH STALIN IN A  DELIBERATE EFFORT TO CREATE  ETHNIC TENSIONS IN THE CAUCUSES  TO THE BENEFIT OF THE SOVIET   UNION AND IN AN EFFORT TO PUNISH THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE OF ARZOK ESTABLISHED  THEIR INDEPENDENCE DECADES AGO   AND WHATEVER YOUR VIEW, YOU  SHOULD SUPPORT THIS AMENDMENT  UNLESS YOU BELIEVE IT IS   APPROPRIATE TO SHOOT DOWN  CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT  THE AMENDMENT. AND I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY  TIME

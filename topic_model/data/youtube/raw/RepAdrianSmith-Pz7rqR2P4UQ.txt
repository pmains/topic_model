even folks in California who qualify for an ACA plan only 40% opt for that plan and I think we need to get to the bottom of why and how that has has come to be the situation I think of of Pam in in my district who liked her plan before all of this came about she had a plan that she liked it covered her pre-existing condition you she was cancelled and and that's unfortunate she she lost coverage through no fault of her own four times because the government said they were trying to help her and and that that should be unacceptable to us as policymakers and certainly we want the American people to have more choices for coverage and I am glad that the Nebraska Farm Bureau has at least given another choice to its members because we've seen choices diminish certainly in in Nebraska and since the ACA came about thank you I yield back

Thank You mr. chairman and thank you for holding this hearing I'd like to thank the witnesses who are here today who have spent years now i think advising this clients at this congress on on the challenges that we face with respect to our fiscal sustainability I'm actually very hopeful that we might have a good hearing today in which we discussed this in an honest fashion where we acknowledge that very significant progress has been made in the last five years against an unsustainable budget almost four trillion dollars by some estimates found that we will acknowledge that that has not come free that the workers at sikorsky in my district that people who rely on food stamps that our infrastructure and this investment in this country has suffered dramatically because of those choices and I hope that we will acknowledge that the fix here is actually not that challenging mechanically that if we just find some targeted cuts and some egregious preferences in the tax code we could get there on the current budget and that if we're willing to do the hard work to make Medicare Social Security and Medicaid sustainable in an equitable way in the future we will have solved this problem no topic of course activates the moral high dudgeon of my colleagues quite as much as this one and I'd like to just offer a couple of thoughts having spent a lot of time in rooms with the witnesses number one if you can't agree that defense where we currently out spend all of our conceivable enemies combined by a factor of four to one if you don't see that as an opportunity to produce spending you're not serious if you can't find a single tax preference in the code to eliminate you're not serious if you voted against raising the debt ceiling and preserving the Full Faith and Credit of this country you are not serious if you don't acknowledge that Medicare and Social Security in the long run need some equitable reform you are not serious about this conversation we're having today I hope we can be serious because this is important let's use this to continue this discussion not to pillory the president not to score partisan points not to suggest that it's my way or the highway mr. chairman if I may close with a quote from your editorial this morning in the Dallas news this is America we can and must do better I yield back the balance of my time

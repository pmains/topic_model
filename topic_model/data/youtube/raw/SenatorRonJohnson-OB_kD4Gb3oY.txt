this is the Joseph project in Wausau we saw a need for it I don't think people talk about is that it's so hard to find good meaningful employment Kolbe & Kolbe is proud of the fact that we are family owned and working at Colby we want you to feel like you are part of the family folks in in Milwaukee who've gone through the program successfully gotten work turn their lives around you're here because of that they go through a very arduous intake process so only those that really want to succeed end up in those seats down in Milwaukee we've heard just been saying oh the daughter's coming up sang-hee dad and proud parents yeah it started my summer out living in a tent I was homeless yeah it prepped me very well and did a very very nice job they're going to learn things like teamwork they're going to learn things about accountability they're gonna things like communication they're all working towards a common goal they're going to learn a lot about themselves and every day that goes by you stay on the job you keep learning you become more valuable for Kolbe & Kolbe and I wake up in the morning I feel I have a purpose to feel proud of myself that I'm doing something I'm being productive and I'm making a wage you must go in with an attitude of I work in this community I live in this community isn't it a responsibility to help those folks that need the help so it's much bigger than just filling a spot literally from the bottom of my heart thank you thanks for making that commitment to succeed and maintain that adversity will may help them to maybe build a better future for themselves and for their family and in so doing for the community of Wausau

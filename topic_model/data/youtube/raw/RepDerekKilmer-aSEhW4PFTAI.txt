thank you madam chair I yield myself as much time as I may consume the gentleman is recognized thank you madam chair I rise today as someone went to college with the help of Grants and loans and the support of a family and a community that had my back and it's in that spirit that I rise today to offer an amendment designed to help students and borrowers get access to more information about sound financial practices we know that financial literacy is important it helps provide people with a roadmap for making sound financial decisions to avoid or get out of debt to prepare for emergencies and to save for a brighter future studies have found that 20-somethings have an average debt of 45,000 dollars primarily from student loans but also from car loans mortgages and credit card debt when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development provided an international finance or financial literacy test American students ranked below average we need to do more to promote financial literacy and it's particularly important that students who are getting federally supported loans are getting the tools that they need to keep their finances on track we need to support resources that teach students financial literacy and provide them with tools that they need to improve decision-making and strengthen their household budgets helping more students shore up their financial management skills also has a direct impact on the economic and financial stability of our country Congress took a critical step forward in providing these resources by creating the financial literacy and Education Commission as part of the fair and accurate credit transaction act of 2003 legislation that passed the house with overwhelming bipartisan support and was signed into law by president george w bush the financial literacy and education commission developed resources that help consumers better understand financial products it offers guidance on how to financially prepare for and respond to major life events it gives tips on savings and borrowing and to determine the amendment that offered today would direct universities and the department of education to provide students with information about the financial management resources provided by the financial literacy and education commission for many students a student loan is the first loan of their lives as students consider the financial assistance that they need to get a decent education it's critically important that they have the information they need to responsibly manage their finances I particularly want to applaud the ongoing work and leadership in promoting financial literacy by the co-chairs of the house financial and economic literacy caucus including representative Anna Hossa who's been a strong advocate of financial literacy initiatives and played a critical role in creating this commission I'm also pleased to be joined by my colleague from Alabama mr. Bachus who sponsored this legislation that helped create this commission and I reserve the balance of my time

back here at 9 44 you've probably heard about chat gbt by now it's an artificial intelligence basically a computer program which simulates human conversation not only in voice but in text form like speeches or term papers there are concerns about how it could be used in the future it certainly caught the attention of Congressman Jake auchenkloss the Newton Democrat joins us live via Skype this morning Congressman good morning to you so you helped call attention to this type of AI yesterday you read a speech on the house floor written by chat gbt what was your point that you were hoping to make good morning thanks for having me on I worked in tech for a number of years before coming to Congress so I've been staying abreast of this technology and as one of the youngest parents in Congress I'm especially attuned to developments that are going to shape the careers and futures of the Next Generation and AI has the potential to be a general purpose technology which means that in any sector that you work Financial Services Health Care education it's going to be highly Salient and I want to call attention to this in Congress because we can't make the same mistakes we made with social media 15 years ago where the technology and the companies got so big so fast so powerful so quickly that they really outpaced thoughtful intentional policy making this can be a tool for good this can Empower and amplify creativity and productivity but we need to be purposeful about what we want it to do for us made your point also by pointing out uh putting out a tweet we're gonna take a look at it this this was written and generated by chap gbt as well I mean it looks like a a regular Tweety a human tweet if you will and and that's a concern isn't it that people just can't tell what is being generated here by AI that's right we're already seeing this with K-12 and University education where administrators are concerned about students using this to plagiarize content we're going to have to update the operating system of a lot of different Industries to account for the fact this technology is really good and I got to tell you having seen sort of the next wave that's coming this spring and summer it's going to keep on getting even better really fast we have got to stay abreast of this development and get ahead of it two ways to do that one we've got to ensure competition and fair access right now the best work is happening with a Consortium of private tech companies in California we got to make sure that small companies that non-profits that universities government officials can access this computing power and quality of data and algorithms so that we can have the public interest uh brought to bear and then second is we just need to think about and start legislating regulations that make sure AI is a tool not a master you would also mention proposing a partnership between the United States and Israel to sort of deal with this what types of outcomes do you think might result of that I proposed a center of excellence between the U.S and Israeli governments and it helps Advance what I was just referring to which is public access for the for the Commonwealth for uh the general interest to ensure that it's not just big tech companies that have the computing power that have the algorithms that have the quality and quantity of data that we can partner with other governments to create best practices that everybody can share in and help develop because I think putting these applications and ethical guidelines around the technology early is going to be critical in making sure that it works for everybody well AI is certainly worth keeping an eye on and Congressman just for the record we want to confirm that none of our conversation was generated by artificial intelligence I can confirm that on our end on my end as well you're just getting human intelligence Here For What It's Worth right cars for Jake Hawkins appreciate your time this morning sir thank you so much for joining us okay

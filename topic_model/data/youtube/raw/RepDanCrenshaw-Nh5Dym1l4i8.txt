we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw all right welcome back folks another great episode here uh a return guest actually scott gottlieb uh doctor also former head of the food and drug administration and um you may remember him quite a bit from especially the beginning of the pandemic uh dr gottlieb was all over the media really really walking americans through what to expect from the pandemic and has uh now written a book on maybe some lessons learned uh from how our response was to to the pandemic scott thanks for being on thanks for having me i'm going to go into your biography just a little bit more you're a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute as well you returned to ai in 2019 after serving as the 23rd commissioner at the fda and of course to work on uh you continue to work on public health through entrepreneurship and medical innovation and expanding regulatory approaches to maintain patient and physician autonomy um which is obviously much appreciated uh from my point of view um there's a lot here but and we'll get into it what's the name of your book uncontrolled spread by harper collins great um so let's dive right into that and i i think it's worthwhile to be examining our actions um you know across the board what we did well uh what we didn't do well where we could have done more and where we should have done less uh you know that's a that's a big um it's actually a big uh part for me specifically because um you know i i think in in many cases we overstepped and we overreached and maybe not in other cases we in other areas we didn't do enough so um where do you want to start uh do you want to start with what's the best way to mitigate this in the future uh do you want to start with what we did right what we did wrong um and how our government got in the way of of of doing it right from the get-go well look the book focuses a lot on the more systemic shortcomings in our response that i think made us successfully excessively vulnerable to this pathogen i think that there's been a lot of narrative focusing on the politics of the response and whether political leaders made the right decisions the wrong decisions at various junctures i think there's been far less focus on where there were systemic weaknesses in the structure of our response and the agencies that we entrusted to mount a response to this crisis and how we're going to fix them going forward and that's really what i've tried to do with this book is focus on those more structural features a lot of it really comes back to the cdc i think that there was an assumption made early on wrongly that cdc was going to have the up the operational capability um and the culture to be able to mount a response to a public health crisis of this magnitude and they just simply didn't and i think that in in fairness to the cdc we voiced them in a position that they weren't equipped to execute cdc isn't an operational organization it has a very retrospective mindset it's backward looking it's accustomed to doing very careful analyses of scientific questions with looking at bespoke data feeds that only come into the cdc and doing these exquisite scientific analyses that sometimes take months to complete and issuing the results of that into the morbidity mortality weekly report not actioning the kind of real time data that policy makers need to inform current decision making and it doesn't have an operational focus it isn't fema it isn't the dod and there was a an assumption made wrongly that the cdc sort of had this mission and you know in criticism of the cdc they never raised their hand and said hey guys we don't we can't do this and it's very hard for an agency to self-organize around a new mission in the setting of a crisis and so we we we spent months expecting the cdc to roll out a diagnostic test and promulgate guidance that we could use to try to inform our lives and and make ourselves more safe and inform us how the coronavirus was spreading what the modes of transmission were what the circumstances were that was setting up spread was it spreading in confined spaces was it spreading on contaminated surfaces and then give us practical advice on how we could reduce our risk we expected the agency to be doing all of these things and they struggled because it was the wrong agency and it was an agency that wasn't equipped to manage a crisis of this magnitude so that's really where i focus a lot of the book on what went wrong what were the systemic shortcomings in the structure of our response and it wasn't just cdc although a lot of it the cdc was a fulcrum of a lot of it and then how do we fix this going forward how do we make sure that this doesn't happen again let's focus on the cdc's for a second i think it's one of the reasons people have that impression of the cdc is because of hollywood uh i can think of multiple instances uh movies or series the walking dead comes to mind where everybody's like we gotta get to the cdc you know i think it's in the stands also you know so there's this sort of pop culture reference to the cdc like it's it's this fortress uh where all the best scientists are working and and you know where you can live underground for years at a time i mean i don't think any of this is true as far as it i don't know um but it's it's it's sort of been glamorized by pop culture and so people think that it can do anything um but but as you're saying it it can't um talk about one of the more egregious things that the cdc did that is pretty hair-raising that you bring up in your book which was uh actually not only being incapable of developing a test quickly but actually being in hindrance to the commercial sector developing that test that's right so there was an assumption made the old playbook the old pandemic playbook always envisioned cdc developing the first diagnostic test for a new pathogen because cdc would be the agency that had access to the viral samples first and so the vision was that cdc would design they would get access to a virus of a new pathogen they would design a diagnostic test they would manufacture it at a small scale deploy it to the public health labs around the country there's hundred public health labs distributed around the states each one is capable of doing about a hundred tests a day and if that still wasn't an adequate amount of testing to keep up with a new pathogen they would then work with the clinical labs which are inside academic medical centers get them stood up to develop laboratory developed tests so they would start doing testing and if that still wasn't enough they would turn to commercial manufacturers the problem here is that that highly sequential process and i actually got a copy of the cdc's plan for how they were going to execute this and envision this unfolding over six months we didn't have six days we didn't have six weeks let alone six months for uh cdc to work to get an adequate amount of testing into the public domain but that highly sequential process basically froze out commercial manufacturers so on the one hand commercial manufacturers that could have mass-produced diagnostic tests early and and the lack of a diagnostic test was the root of a lot of our early challenges with this virus a lot of our early failures so just sort of lay that out but the fact that the the manufacturers couldn't get access to the viral samples because only cdc had them and cdc actually wouldn't share those viral samples a sample of the sars cov2 virus until the end of february they held on to it for two months meant that the commercial manufacturers couldn't design their own test so then they their second option if they can't design their own tests their second option is to copy the cdc's test design but cec then turned around and said well if you want to copy our test design the the test that we've designed you've got to sign a license agreement with us you've got to license it from us and they threw in front of these companies these complicated legal agreements where the companies agreed not to appropriate cdc's intellectual property and there actually had been examples in the past where cdc had tried to claim royalties on its inventions and actually had suits cdc employees individuals at cdc had sued manufacturers for royalties that they wanted paid back to them this was part of the culture of the organization and so what i was talking to the manufacturers over this time period that could have been making tests and they said to me it's too complicated you know we're going to wait we're going to see what happens these agreements that cdc are putting in front of us over these complicated legal agreements we can adjudicate this and so they sat on the sidelines and so the only entity that was in the game for the first couple of months really was the cdc um and the commercial manufacturers really didn't start getting in this in this game until really by march it wasn't until march and the only reason that the testing void was actually began as to get filled in march if you remember the the fda commission the vice president went out and said we have we can do run millions of tests uh a week now uh because they had test kits ample test kits available those test kits actually were made by a commercial manufacturer they were originally made for quote research use only so there was a single commercial manufacturer making these these coronavirus test kits that they were giving to labs for research purposes and fda realized that these kits actually worked well and the fda could license them for use on testing patient samples and and the fda actually intervened to prod cdc to bring these tests under its under its own emergency use authorization to allow these tests to be shared publicly with doctors and hospitals so that we could start getting testing underway for the coronavirus but that's the only reason we actually solved the testing void in march basically the fda went around cdc to get a commercial manufacturer that wasn't intending to distribute a test commercially into the market you know let me throw it somewhat of a curveball comment into this because i'm always searching for some kind of consensus as to what the right strategy is you know and it doesn't seem like there's any consensus at all on the correct strategy moving forward if we're faced with a pandemic like this there continues to be massive disagreement on on lockdowns on masking on who should be masked on on uh what kind of parameters there are for vaccinated and unvaccinated or what kind of restrictions i mean and back then i remember during this whole testing thing right it was it was everybody was banging the drum like politicians i mean you know testing testing testing and this is if we scream testing enough then everything would be okay um and i remember getting the impression that that that too many people were under the impression that somehow if we tested everybody would stop the spread and it was almost like this sort of this sort of false sense of of hope or you know this false sense of security to me anyway it just as an observer kind of seeing this all play out that's how it seemed to me you know agree or disagree but because i i am not convinced in hindsight i am not convinced that mass mass testing um did anything to slow the spread it it seems to me more and more the more again hindsight with hindsight but also at the time but with hindsight that there is truly only so much we can do to mitigate the spread it's a virus and it does what it it's going to do and it seems to have proven that to us over and over and over again with every single spike all throughout the world um and so you know how i guess what my question is for the next time is how important is testing and maybe we should talk about administering those tests is it important that we make sure that there's lines of hundreds and hundreds of random people getting tests is that really helping us with the virus or is it more important to be more strategic about how we test in the future that's it that's the short end on the question yeah yeah so let me challenge that on a couple of notions and i don't disagree with your underlying sentiment around the primacy of testing but i think having diagnostic tests generally accessible to consumers as a matter of just public health is going to be exceedingly important now and going forward now those tests in the future are going to be many more point of care diagnostics that you can use in the convenience of your home because we now have the technology to do that there's a there's a change in the regulatory orientation of fda that's that's facilitating that so i think the way that consumers get tested is going to change and i think we're all going to expect that we could test in our home for flu for covert for strep we're not going to want to go into the doctor's office as much anymore absolutely this this pandemic has changed the way we receive health care in terms of testing early on testing in my view was very important in the early days of this epidemic because there were points in time when the virus wasn't pervasive enough around the country that by getting people diagnosed and getting them into voluntary quarantines and being able to trace their sick contacts could have controlled the spread it would have prevented the pandemic we would have had a pandemic but it could have slowed it down it could have probably prevented it from being as severe as it was at least in the first wave and bought us a little more time and more importantly it could have told us not just where the virus was but where it wasn't so when we did the 15 days to slow the spread a historic decision to basically shut down non-essential activity in this country and then followed by another 30 days where the president shut down non-essential businesses 45 straight days that there was basically a nationwide shutdown very clearly new york had to do that new york's healthcare system was breached probably boston had to do it new orleans had a pervasive epidemic chicago parts of the pacific northwest but wyoming didn't have to austin didn't have to jacksonville didn't have to the virus hadn't spread everywhere this was a highly regionalized epidemic for a very long period of time before it became a national confluent epidemic but you know what no one knew where not only where it was we didn't know where it wasn't so if we had had testing in place we could have said you know there's not a lot of virus in wyoming why would we shut down wyoming we can just continue to test people use testing as a way to control spread and maybe even contain the virus but what happened was we did a simultaneous national shutdown because we didn't know what parts of the country hadn't been infected yet hadn't been affected and by the time the virus actually became epidemic in phoenix and miami and parts of texas when we could have implemented some mitigation to slow the spread when they were having very dense epidemics in the summertime the people rightly said look we've already shut down you told us to shut down in the springtime we did it we probably didn't have to we're not doing that again so we lost the political capital to implement the mitigation when it was needed because we did it when it wasn't needed so the testing would have been exceedingly important not just to try to slow the spread and get people diagnosed but also tell us where where what parts of the country were still safe yeah well okay so maybe we agree that because i mean what i would advocate for is a better a better use of testing and more strategic testing it did seem to me that that it was it was just seen as an immoral good to get as many tests as possible but that but that's that's not strategic you know um and you know even to your point about some places having to lock down others not that continues to be a disagreement uh and this is what's frustrating to me is this this lack of consensus over what these common sense lessons learned um and it seemed to me especially on the left exclusively on the left to be honest it didn't matter what the level of virus was it's like one is it one is too many for them and it requires a lockdown and everybody masking i mean that's you know that's that's the extreme end of it but it it it seemed that way to a lot of people over time um actually let me you mentioned contact tracing this so here's that's another one i'm very skeptical of in hindsight it doesn't seem to me that anybody did any successful contact tracing globally anywhere there was a myth that south korea did it but that's just that it's a myth they did it like with one church i think um but overall when a pandemic spreads the way it did as quickly as it did does contact racing really have any role because i know we hired a bunch of people in houston for instance and it just becomes a completely impossible endeavor and i think they eventually just gave up it could have a role in at a local level i i think that you you know you can contain spread within an institution within a school within a hospital if you have an exposure in a hospital trying to contact trace with employees who might have been exposed it's hard to do at a scale that it would have been required in order to have some downward pressure on this epidemic in a big diverse country an open society like uh like ours but you don't need to actually engage in large-scale contact tracing to make the diagnostic testing very important because by giving people a diagnostic test and letting them self-identify whether they're infected that they're going to change their behavior most people are going to be responsible actors and if they have access to a diagnostic test that tells them that they're infected they're going to self-quarantine they're going to notify their friends they're going to stay home and so the diagnostic test especially for a virus that spreads through asymptomatic transmission or where people may be mildly infected not know that they're infected they think they have a cold but actually be spreading the virus having ready access to diagnostic testing so people could self-identify and take responsible action on their own can actually have a very big impact on on the overall um contours of an epidemic and that's why the testing becomes important but not just any testing not not the kind of testing where you're to your point where you're getting in your car and spending an hour lining up to get swapped but the kind of testing that you can buy something that's inexpensive and do it in your home test yourself closer to that how close are we to that we have it i mean the binax now and there's other tests that are available over the counter in your home um they're not inexpensive but but they're affordable to many people i think we should be doing more to try to provide access but the buy next now for example um it's a box of two tests for 25 in most parts of the country uh it's pretty accurate it's very affordable i mean these other tests that we've been taking the pcr tests are still i think like 150 bucks or more that's right so that these are 25 and you can just 25 for a box of two and um they're they're 80 90 sensitive at detecting the virus probably even better with the delta variant because it's the delta variant you shed so much virus the tests themselves probably have greater sensitivity but here's a question everybody has online okay twitter has this question for you um there is no test for the delta variant correct or is there i mean i know actually okay i know that some hospitals can't test specifically for it but they have to do an extreme amount of testing to make to assure people like that right so so and then how we how has the cdc come up with these numbers about who has the delta variant who doesn't they model it um so in order to actually tell who has the delta variant you'd have to sequence the virus to be able to tell that it's the delta sequence but at this point the delta variant is so pervasive that the presumption is most people who are getting infected with chronovirus have the delta varying right and you know it's i don't know the exact figures currently but it's well more than 90 of all the infections occurring in the united states based on the sampling that we're doing are the delta variant got it um you mentioned in the book too again and this gets to it the the larger question of the the lack of trust in our public health institutions now especially something like the cdc especially uh fouchy at nih so one of them was that you talk about is the uh the six foot rule you know it and also i remember seeing a playbook uh from by the cdc for pandemics and uh mass uh you know universal masking was never mentioned the sort of six foot distancing was never mentioned uh shelter in place was was never really mentioned i could be wrong you studied those playbooks better than i do um so feel free to correct me if that's true but i do remember seeing it and and thinking so did we all just make this stuff up as we went because even fouchu you know was was going back and forth on masking that you know whether mass are effective for for for a virus like this has been debated for decades um and so where did we come up with this stuff and and what's our assessment now is it is it is it still debatable is it is it based in good science or is it or are we just kind of throwing our hands up and saying look it can't hurt so let's just try it yeah i don't think we made it up i think that we weren't fully honest about the level of uncertainty around some of the recommendations that we were making and that if we had more humility more candor and and if cdc was compelled to actually um promulgate the level of certainty and underlying science around the recommendations it could have allowed people to make more informed judgments about which public health guidance they were going to follow religiously and which they weren't right and cdc didn't do that so the the six foot rule we don't really know where it came from we have an idea that it came from science around the risk of the spread of influenza that's influenza typically spreads through droplet transmissions and if you're more than six feet away it dramatically reduces the likelihood of flu spreading but but we learned early on coronavirus wasn't spreading like the flu it was spreading through aerosols it was transferring over longer distances the the flu data probably wasn't applicable and if we were more if cdc was more transparent about the basis for that recommendation states could have made a decision to make some accommodation and florida ultimately did florida decided they were going to adopt a three-foot distancing requirement in schools and that allowed them to open their schools the six feet was the single costliest measure that cdc imposed or recommendation of cdc made because it forced many schools to say stay shut because they simply couldn't provide for six feet of distance between students as far as the masks are concerned you know and i was involved in some of the early discussion around the recommendation coming out of the chronovirus task force for masks and i and i i was in favor of it so i was trying to encourage the task force to take that take that position but it's important to remember what the genesis of that that recommendation was it was that it was a time when we know we were learning that a lot of the spread was through asymptomatic transmission people were going out they didn't know they were infected and they were spreading the virus and we knew we had literature that showed in the setting of flu again it wasn't in a setting chronovirus so this was in flu but that if you had a virus that spread through droplet transmission like flu if you wore a mast even a cloth mask it could cut transmission by 50 so your likelihood of spreading that virus would be reduced by 50 by wearing a mask and this was research that osha had done and so we said to ourselves if we could get masks on everyone then all these people who are going out and are asymptomatic and spreading the virus now their likelihood of spreading the virus was reduced but what happened was the perception got created that the mask was intended to protect you and what really the the intention of the mask was was to protect you to protect me from you so the mask wasn't meant to protect um me it was to protect other people from me if i was infected if you're following me but if you actually wanted to wear a mask to protect yourself from other people the quality of the mask really mattered if you wore a cloth mask it provided about 20 protection from aerosols if you wore a higher quality level three surgical procedure mask of about 40 if you wore a kn-95 mask or an n95 mask that would provide 95 protection but we didn't explain that to the public the public mistakenly thought that the masks were to protect them really the initial recommendation for people to wear masks was to protect other people from you if in case you were that person who is an asymptomatic carrier or the virus and going on to spread it unknowingly and actually the reason why the task force resisted and i was i was having these discussions with them at the time and i document this in the book was this was over a time period when they were saying to people around the country try not to go out people should be trying to stay home and so they worried that if they said people should wear masks it would be a conflicting message that they would be saying on the one hand please don't go out and then they would on the other hand saying please wear a mask so so inadvertently what they're saying is you can go out if you wear a mask and that's why they were reluctant to issue the mask recommendation uh initially so again once again we weren't we weren't fully candid with how these decisions got made and i think that ended up um sapping some of the integrity of the process by which we issued these public health officials broadly issued these recommendations and ultimately consumers became discouraged they they became not to trust the public health advice because they didn't feel that they were getting all the facts and in some cases they weren't no they definitely weren't i mean when there's flip-flopping on something as simple as as masking people people start to dismiss it and now i do think the public eventually did get that it was about protecting others which is why you know people walking down the street in dc would call you a murderer if uh if you were walking your dog without a mask you know because you're gonna murder grandma if you're not wearing a mask outside and uh that's actually so i think that still remains the case that sentiment out there uh so they eventually did get it um and and then it then it sort of divided americans in this this very profound way and i think that division to your point does come from treating treating the american people like dumb children and uh and not giving them all the information and uh instead of instead of allowing them to assess their own risks and and take responsibility for those risks uh based on some some clear data and some probabilities i mean one of the things that that frustrated me a lot hearing from our public health officials like dr fauci and he would come out and just say yeah i mean if you're you're 12 years old you could die of covet i mean it could happen okay well add some context to that statement you know because the reality is is i believe under 20 years old there's still less than a thousand deaths from covet it's actually much less than a thousand deaths that might be less than 500. so that context matters i mean you're like 128 more times more likely as a person that age to die from any other cause of death than covid is there a risk of course there's a risk um but but we still continue down this sort of um safety at all costs kind of mentality and um and i just i just wonder if we're ever going to self-assess i wonder if we're ever going to have an introspection about that mentality of of of getting covet down to zero you know crush this this idea this policy idea this campaign promise that biden had to to crush the virus and i would argue you never should have made that campaign promise you cannot possibly crush the virus of course he's learning that now because there's only so much you can do you can mitigate it you can prepare for it um but but i think some of the steps we have taken and the infringements that we've we've done on on people's livelihoods um are so extreme and worse had no had no identifiable benefits um and it's it's it frustrates me to no end well look this is going to continue to be a pervasive risk this is going to this will become an endemic virus we're going to we're going to exit the pandemic phase at some point and this is going to be a persistent risk coronavirus this covid virus is going to circulate every winter it's going to develop a seasonal pattern it's not clear when we're going to go from the pandemic phase to the endemic phase i think that that it's after this delta surge i think this is the last major surge of virus and we'll be sort of entering the endemic phase of this virus when it just becomes an omnipresent risk it's kind of like a recession we won't know we won't know when we entered that point until you know a year after it happens but this will be more of an endemic virus i think with respect to the risk of kids though and i'll just challenge it gently if i may you know the we talk about the extreme um death and disease particularly in older individuals from covet and the excessive burden that this is imposed on our older communities i mean this this is very deadly if you're of advanced age you're right that the data on actual deaths in in children um thankfully children are spared from this virus i mean if this virus killed children at anywhere near the rate that it's killing old people this would have been a whole different ballgame i mean this would have shut down society in a way that's unimaginable if this was taking our children from us but i think what worries us as public health officials around the risk to kids and why there's a pervasive sense that you want to keep this from becoming epidemic in kids is that this virus the more we learn about this virus the more that there is evidence that it has sequelae that it has long-term implications that we don't understand and you worry about mass infecting children to a virus that you don't fully understand where you know that a certain proportion of kids are going to have some persistent symptoms particularly neurological symptoms i mean the loss of taste and smell is a neurological impairment and so what is the virus doing we don't know we may find out five years from now that we overestimated the impact that this virus was having but what we don't want to be in a position is finding out that we underestimated it but we let this become epidemic in children i think that that's the hesitancy and the caution that you see people trying to exercise in preventing this from becoming epidemic of schools i know i know you share that that that concern but that that's where a lot of that stems from it's not just a question of you know how many lives have it has it claimed but it's a it it's it's a surprisingly dangerous virus in other regards as well as as we're learning i'd have to look at a day for children i mean but i'm like i'm a policy maker i'm not a public health official so so i have to look at trade-offs and there are in public health officials this again this is why the public health sector lost so much trust because they never talked about the trade-offs right so so our leaders talked about it in terms of this has to be crushed to zero if we have to reduce risk to zero and it's fine like that's what my doctor tells me to dan you shouldn't drink you should have two to five drinks a week that's good other than that if you do more than that you're basically an alcoholic right so because that's a doctor talking and everybody's like okay yeah i hear what you're saying but i'm just gonna go ahead and do what i'm gonna do and take that risk okay and as the policymaker i have to actually assess trade-offs so so yeah is there a is there a tiny tiny probability and this is again public health they never talk about it this way is there the tiniest probability that there might be some kind of long-term effect from this disease on a child yeah tiny tiny probability is there a very high probability there will be horribly detrimental effects to this child being kept out of school or a two-year-old being forced to wear a mask absolutely absolutely that's a guarantee and so it becomes about trade-offs i mean and and i would also look at some of the data that showed that rsv um i forget what that stands for but it's a it's a virus that hurts children pretty bad really had an uptick this year because kids have not been able to build up their immune system so you know it's about trade-offs and and um this just our our leaders just never talked about trade-offs and it's frustrating now look i think that we underestimated or didn't fully appreciate not just the impact that the mitigation had on society but the disproportionate impact it had on societies the the burden of the things that we did were born more by some people than others um you know people who ran small businesses and had to shut them down people who couldn't uh zoom to work um so i don't think that that was fully recognized but if you look back at the pandemic planning that we did back in 2005 and i was in the bush administration when we when we worked on some of this planning that envisioned really for the first time the idea of using population-wide mitigation as a way to control an epidemic closing schools closing businesses it was never envisioned in that plan that we would do this nationally was always envision that these would be targeted measures used on a limited basis just when a virus became epidemic in a particular part of the country if you had an epidemic in a local community you shut the school for a week you didn't shut it for a year you had an epidemic in a city you slowed activity maybe you closed public transportation for a period of time you didn't do it for the whole year because it was envisioned that we would have diagnostic tests to know where things were and weren't spreading um that we could target these interventions much more effectively so the plans that we had prepped that envisioned the things that we did against the against this coronavirus they were used in a far more pervasive way than anyone ever envisioned you go back and look at that plan there was never a mention of the idea of a national shutdown right right and you know i totally agree with that and the problem is is that we elect people who aren't real leaders we elect people that that refuse to do their own kind of deductive reasoning and use their own judgment uh especially at the city level apparently because that that's where that's where these most extreme measures happened you know they again a doctor tells the public health official a doctor tells them look there's some risk here and then politician says got it we'll crush it we will do everything we can you know and and frankly unfortunately it was it was politically popular depending on where you're and not not so much in texas um and it just it just speaks to such a lack of critical thinking um by the leaders that we elect i think um unable to absorb what a doctor is telling okay god i see what you're telling me here give me the context though let's assess the risks and probabilities and now let's assess trade-offs and they just refuse to do that second part um it's it's very frustrating i mean you know is it's like you said they did it down down to the local level in such an extreme way because it's not as if the president shut down the country he just all that was was actually just cdc guidance the president can't shut down the country thankfully um and and yet it happened anyway and it gets to just um the the scaring of people i mean there's an interesting uh and i think this is a current survey this is recent and if you're pulling democrats a majority of democrats believe that you have a 50 chance of hospitalization if you get covet even though the number is closer to 2 percent chance and that's a that's a fascinating psychological experiment there i mean how do we how do you explain something like that look i think even now people there's people who both overestimate and underestimate their risk of covert i think people who are vaccinated um there's there's a contingent of people who overestimate their risk of covert um because after vaccination your risk is substantially reduced that you're going to develop severe disease and certainly hospitalization um even older individuals and i think a lot of people who choose to go unvaccinated are under underestimating their risk of covert so you know as as consumers we talk about this in the in in the medical profession all the time it's very hard to um sort of assess personal probability around your health you know people read studies and they say there's a 50 this causes a 50 increase in x from happening well if you're underlying probability of x occurring is extremely low to begin with a 50 increase doesn't increase your absolute odds of of having an event by a whole lot but you hear 50 percent and it sounds like a lot even though your absolute risk might remain very small so i think i think we have uh you know sort of we're all challenged with trying to use statistics and probability to assess our personal risk we all learn algebra in school most of us are never going to use it i mean unless you go into physics or you're a sophisticated trader on wall street you're not going to use algebra none of us learn statistics in school it's not taught in high school i think we would all be better off if we all had a mandatory class in statistics in high school yeah that's probably true so real quick i mean from your book what what are some concrete steps we could take uh to prepare better for another pandemic look i think we need to look at public health preparedness through a lens of national security and try to think about how we build better resiliency into our systems here in the united states to do things like scale the manufacturing of diagnostics have a very clear handoff with industry in the setting of an emerging pathogen have the ability to have a hot base of manufacturing for things like sophisticated antibody based drugs which are going to be a first line of defense against a novel pathogen like this we didn't have that preparedness we we had built as a strategic national stockpile and it was a technocratic illusion um the idea that you could just put stuff in a warehouse and it would be ready to be used it was it was expired it wasn't kept up to date what we really need is the capacity to actually manufacture things domestically in the setting of a crisis when other markets are going to be closed to us and then the other part of looking at public health preparedness through a lens of national security that i talk about a lot in the book is relying more on our tools of foreign intelligence to gather information overseas we've had this sort of pollyannish view historically that we could come together under the world health assembly or the who and sign these multilateral agreements that we're all going to share information when a new virus emerges somewhere around the world and countries are going to actually adhere to these agreements they make and we've seen time and time again countries don't fulfill their obligations china has been a recidivist they've they haven't fulfilled their obligations multiple times including in the setting of stars club v2 so i don't think that we can just go back to the who sign a new international health regulation as the body administration is currently working on and expect that this is going to keep us safe in the future we should do it we should work through the multilateral agreements we should you know engage in capacity building and hot spots around the world but we can't rely on it we have to get our tools of foreign intelligence our tools of national security more engaged in monitoring for these threats and that means gathering information that means actually using the tools of the cia and the nsa in this public health mission and historically it this has fallen to cdc and the public health officials didn't want the foreign intelligence agencies anywhere near this because they said you're going to besmirch our ability to work on a multilateral basis the reality is we can't we can't um afford ourselves that luxury anymore um it's a cruel world people countries don't divulge information and if anything covet conditioned countries to be even less forthcoming because what we what happened in covid was we normalized the idea of trade and travel restrictions in the setting of an outbreak what's the first thing that happened when the british raised their hand and said we have this concerning new variant called b117 that's more contagious the french closed the tunnel they isolated the isolated britain so is britain going to be as willing to divulge the next variant now britain will they're they're an ally but what about indonesia what about thailand what about china so we we've got to get our national security agencies engaged in monitoring for these threats and the final point i'll make is if you go back now and just look at what's on the public record about the information that was available in mid-december that could have been obtained in terms of what was flowing out of china or flowing around china if we were actively actively looking for that information we could have found it we could have found that there was human human transmission because there were doctors that were known to be infected we could have had human sources telling us that this was spreading through asymptomatic transmission the sequencing there were multiple dozens of samples of this virus sent off by doctors to labs to be sequenced it by mid-december that's electronic information that could have been intercepted if we knew what we were looking for so there was and so and that would have told us that this was a novel sars-like coronavirus so there was information that could have been had if we were actively looking for it to alert us to this threat weeks before we were ultimately alerted to it and you know in the hands of a um political authority that is astute to these risks and and prepped to try to react to these things early three four weeks is an enormous head start yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense and it's frustrating to know that those connections between the intelligence community and the public health community just just don't exist to any real extent um and you know we've done this on another podcast but it's also very frustrating to to see that our taxpayer dollars were making their way into the wuhan lab which was indeed doing gain of function research what's your expert opinion on gate of function research i hear different from different sites some people say it's important some people say look with the current modeling that we have it's unnecessary it's an unnecessary risk to take yeah i think we need to be very careful and get much better governance globally around not just the kind of research we're willing to engage in because pathogens escaped from labs sars one escaped from labs the last known six out six outbreaks of stars one were all escapes from labs including four from a single lab in in china we need to be very careful about what we're willing to do in labs in terms of creating novel pathogens that have pandemic potential and we need to make sure that when we do high-end research it's done in sophisticated labs that have the right precautions in place the researchers in wuhan and in wuhan institute of virology we now know they were doing research on novel coronaviruses including we believe their gain of function research but certainly infecting transgenic animals meaning infecting animals with fully human immune systems which creates the conditions that the virus viruses can evolve in ways that can infect humans and escape more easily or infect humans more easily they were doing that not in their highest security bsl4 lab they only had one by the way the wave only had one bsl4 lab they were doing it in their lower security bsl2 labs that should never have been allowed to happen we shouldn't publish sequences of novel viruses that get created in laboratories so when we create these these novel viruses with pandemic potential we've been publishing it to to enrich the academic literature we shouldn't be doing that i think we need to get better governance around all of these activities and this is why it's very important to get an assessment about what the probability is that this came out of a lab people people think this is just about blaming china and finger-pointing the debate over did this come out of a lab or did it come out of a zoonotic source a natural source was there an animal source of this the reason why this is important is because if we ultimately assess with a higher degree of certainty that this came out of a lab that is going to force us to have to confront these issues of getting a better international governance around bsl4 labs conduct around research conduct around what gets published and the problem right now is that there's so many of these bsl4 high security labs and mind you this coronavirus research wasn't even going on in the bsl4 lab but let's just take take the high end research that goes on in the bsl4 labs there's so many of these labs growing up around the world that the highest risk research ends up going to the country willing to engage in the riskiest research you know if you take a really risky experiment to a bsl4 lab in new york city they're going to say we're not going to do this so that research ends up going to another country that has even poorer controls in place and so people are literally forum shopping to do their their their highest risk research in countries operating bsl4 labs and willing to you know cross certain lines that that other countries might not be willing to do so i think we need the equivalent of you know the international atomic energy agency around the conduct of research and again getting back to the original point if we ultimately make an assessment here that there's a high degree of probability that this came out of a lab that changes the equation around how vigorously we pursue this international mission or getting better governance around these activities yeah i mean it better because uh i've seen the intelligence it's extremely high probability there's it's it leaves like it's not a smoking gun but it it it leaves no opportunity just to look for another option um it's it's it's extremely uh compelling i want to ask you about the fda though um you know we were talking about cdc and all their failures and nih and all these things but um you know you're from the fda and um fda has not suffered the same level of i think um distrust as the uh as these others and deservedly so i mean fda got got record approvals done for operation warp speed the emergency use authorization uh proved very very useful for variety of treatments and vaccines so that's all good um you know kind of moving away from the talk of the coronavirus there's still a lot of frustration from uh innovators and biotech startups people really trying to save lives and and create that next generation medicine or technological device medical advice that's going to save people and especially coming from houston i see it all the time i mean and it's the simplest of things that they just they just cannot get fda approval for and it's a very risky endeavor for these for these folks they have to go through round after round of fundraising and getting investors to do these studies and we're talking about something that's you know any layman can look at and say look this is safe what are we talking about here you know whether it's stem cell therapy or another example i have is um it's a company called intuitapp and they and and instead of doing a manual spinal tap they have a machine that does it and gets and gets it right every single time as opposed to a doctor that i think misses every every three times or something which is very painful for the patient you know and um but it takes years to get this stuff approved and um what can we do you know you were you were really outspoken very aggressive at the fda on trying to get those approval processes through so can you speak to maybe what we can do better and also speak to what what this is what twitter says okay twitter this is it's always a good way to start a question but a lot of people would suggest that it's big pharma big pharma tries to get in the way at the because they've got their hooks in the fda a lot of there's a revolving door right the people who work at big pharma are working at fda and there's they're actually preventing some of these startups from getting traction because maybe it's a cheaper maybe it's a cheaper therapy um and it'll put this long-standing drug out of business you know i mean it's maybe that doesn't maybe that doesn't happen consciously but can it happen subconsciously is it i don't know you know so it's a lot to throw at you so yeah look and i sit on as you know i sit on the board of pfizer so i'm on a receiving end of some that some of that criticism around regulatory capture and you know the revolving door and big drug makers um being proponents of of complicated regulatory schemes because only they can navigate those schemes right that's the criticism and and i'm not going to sit here and tell you that those kinds of ethos don't exist i mean peop humans are humans and human nature is is what it is i i i will tell you having sat in that seat the the debate around this issue about trying to promulgate policy reforms that will facilitate earlier market access to promising treatments is intense because every time we stepped out to try to advance a framework that was more permissive in terms of allowing treatments to come to the market earlier with less complements of data there was an equally uh vocal contingent fighting us saying that we were we were you know weakening the standard we were going to kill people um everywhere in the media in congress and so you know you were always at the intersection of this intense debate the debate recently about the drug from biogen for alzheimer's i think illustrates this point we promulgated a guidance in 2018 when i was there that basically said for neurodegenerative diseases like lou gehrig's disease als alzheimer's diseases where by the time you actually manifest symptoms to be identifiable as having the disease so by the time i can do a mini-mental status test on a patient and demonstrate cognitive decline in a patient with alzheimer's by the time you can do that you know you draw the picture do the memory test on them they've had so much progressive loss of neurological function that it's irreversible the damage is damage is done they're not going to be able to reclaim that they're not the cognition is not going to improve maybe you can intervene to stop the progression of the disease or slow it but you're not going to help that person regain their function same thing with a disease like als once someone loses physical ability to you know hold a cup walk it that you can't you there's no theoretical way at least available right now therapeutically to restore that function so the question became how do we approve drugs early enough in the course of these diseases that you can actually arrest the disease process enough to prevent the onset of the symptoms that are so debilitating and so what we said was we are going to start creating avenues to approve drugs on the basis of measures that serve as surrogates for uh disease activity and in the case of this alzheimer's drug they approved it on the basis of the ability to show that it it changes um it it prevents certain changes on brain imaging that are thought to be consistent with the disease process now that isn't a certainty it isn't certain that those changes on the brain imaging actually are what's driving the disease process there's the fda believes there's enough scientific basis to make that assumption but this proved to be exceedingly controversial people said this was you know a horrible decision by the agency congress is investigating the decision that the agency made and aspects of how it was made so it shows you how intense these debates are yeah that that and again final point congressman anytime these kinds of considerations are made in a political or quasi-political context and when you're investing a regulatory agency that's accountable to congress and to the president from making these decisions it's it's political it's quasi-political anytime it's going to be adjudicated in that kind of realm you're going to have these competing forces trying to influence that process so so that gets to another question so it sounds like this particular alzheimer's drug that you're talking about is the fda is the fda already sure that it's safe but is then just assessing what it's effective for so i mean good question and it was approved so it was approved under accelerated approval it's proven to be very controversial um there the critics will say not only is there not very definitive evidence that's providing a treatment benefit but there are safety issues associated with it and in fact if you look at the clinical trial data there were patients who had side effects including serious side effects from the drug so it's not it's not an inert placebo it's not a completely benign drug and you know most drugs aren't any i i always tell patients any time you put an active pharmaceutical ingredient in your body make sure that that you're doing it for a purpose where you hope to derive a benefit and you have a reasonable basis to believe you're deriving a benefit because the most benign drugs still are active pharmaceutical ingredients and they're going to have some untoward effect on your body well or potentially the reason i i bring up the safe and effective dichotomy is because it's not obvious to me that the fda really should be spending a lot of its time determining effectiveness it should be determining safety because effectiveness is a very subjective term um and effectiveness can be figured out through through the market system as for our health care system largely and a good example of this question is stem cell therapy so it's safe i mean we've been doing it for years but but uh but stem cell infusions where you're you're taking your own fat cells you're you're getting the stem cells out of that and they reproduce it and then they just reinject that back into you that has a lot of trouble getting fda approval then they have to say well what are you treating um and and it's difficult to say what you're treating because there's there's potentially lots of benefits to it that can't be studied unless you approve it um so it's proven to be safe but the fda says well we have to say what it's for what what treatment it's going to be for well it's like look it's useful for joint repair it's useful useful for cognitive um uh you know it seems like it seems like it's useful for cognitive abilities uh it seems like it's very useful for uh recovering from parkinson's um we've even seen amazing cases where somebody with a spinal injury has recovered after stem cell therapy so you know if safety isn't the issue but affect it you know but trying to identify what disease it's it's targeting you know is that an overstep from a regulatory perspective i mean and stem cells is an interesting example i mean this is another area where there has been competing pressure on the agency from people who hold different views including you know a sizeable um thoughtful people who hold the view that you just very clearly articulated and this was a place where when i was there i tried to advance policy that tried to carve a reasonable path that accommodated the competing views that the agency was being too stringent or not stringent enough and what we said was we we effectively carved out from fda's active regulation people who were using stem cells deriving your cells and implanting them back into you for things like orthopedic procedures or um you know dermal procedures things that were cosmetic procedures we said look these are low risk we're not going to regulate this at all even if we have the legal authority regulate we're not going to regulate this but in situations where you were extracting cells and doing what we call more than minimal manipulation you were adding chemicals to the cells you were changing their physical characteristics so the cells behaved a lot differently and it was more than what we defined as minimal manipulation that's a term of art it was actually defined in statute the congress has said that if something's more than manipulated it's subject to fda regulation uh and it's being used in a high risk way that would be subject to fda and so this was a place where we tried to um define a middle ground and and create sort of clear rules of the road now clearly there's people who feel we stepped too far when i was there there were people who said how could a cell that's taken out of my body ever become a drug no matter what you do to it but you know the regulations in the statute said something else um and ultimately you know we're accountable to congress and congress sometimes so in congress in congress we need to change that one line and then we can if we can you guys put it in you now you weren't there congressman i know we've been trying to figure this out for a while um you know and that's very specific to stem cell therapy but it's you know it's relatively cheap and there's potentially lots of benefits to it um so you know it's it's just an example right but it's it's something we're interested it's a good example because because there's strong feelings on both sides of this debate yeah but but my side is right anyway um you know in our limited time left um i want you to address the fda's process for the vaccines look when when when trump was president every democrat alive said that we shouldn't trust the fda that uh that changed a little in the last eight months although i would i would actually i look at the data who doesn't want who doesn't want to take the vaccine or is distrustful of the vaccine it's actually still both sides but there's a lot of people and they're distrustful of the vaccine and a lot of the reasons they cite look at first they cited well it's not fda approved okay and it became fda approved and and now but now there's no long-term studies that that's one reason people cite that to not not to trust it can you just walk us through okay what does that mean when it was it was a available but not approved what does it mean now that it's approved but without long-term studies so what is like i mean i mean specifically what does that mean and how would you explain that to people and how would you explain that it's it's safe yeah so just to back up for a second you know we hear a lot of criticism about vaccine hesitancy and the difficulty getting people vaccinated and convincing people that you know the vaccines can be beneficial to them we've given at least one dose of vaccine to 76 percent of adults over the years that's a good that's a that's a good point that's a very good point and a lot of people have taken a lot of people have taken it and most of those people will complete the vaccine series and i would argue just based on our current trajectory if we didn't change any policy right now we didn't impose a mandate on businesses we would get to 80 that's extraordinary i mean 80 of adults in this country have made a decision to take a vaccine so to your question about emergency use authorization versus full approval this vaccine these vaccines now have been 380 million doses of these vaccines have been distributed in the united states 5.8 billion doses of vaccine have been distributed globally now not all of them are the vaccines used in the u.s but 380 million doses of mostly the mrna vaccines have been used in the u.s and we now have data that's at least two years old on the people who were vaccinated originally that is an enormous data set the clinical trials done with this vaccine and again i was on the border pfizer i was involved in this development process from that side these were the largest clinical trials ever undertaken the largest clinical trial i remember prior to these vaccine studies was the rotavirus vaccine which was 60 000 patients each of the trials for the mrna vaccines the maduro and the physio vaccine were at least 45 000 patients that's 90 000 patients collectively that's a an enormous undertaking the emergency use authorization allowed the fda to get these vaccines on the market without going through all the usual bells and whistles of a full approval and so what are those bells and whistles well if you want to approve a drug for normal distribution you've got to do a lot of stability tests to prove that when a drug is put into the normal supply chain and it goes to you know cardinal health a warehouse and it sits there for a little bit and then it goes to cvs and it sits there for a little bit and that and the pharmacist takes it out but leaves it out on his shelf a little too long you know something put in normal distribution is han is handled and mishandled in many different ways and you have to do a lot of studies to prove that when you put something into normal distribution and you allow for some mishandling it's not going to ruin the integrity of that product that work wasn't done up front that's what you would need for a full license or license sure of an of an application these products were put on the market just based on the clinical data showing that they were providing a benefit then the companies went back and did all that work to show that it could be stable at room temperature or normal refrigeration that it could sit on a shelf for six months that's called the cmc portion of the application chemistry manufacturing controls that work takes much longer because if you want to prove that something can stay in a warehouse for six months you don't leave it in a warehouse for six months and test it you leave it in a warehouse for a year and then you test it at intervals and you you demonstrate when you reach a point where it starts to degrade so that now takes a year to do so the companies got these products on the market quickly on the basis of the clinical data and then at the same time continued those long-term studies to prove how they could be distributed in normal supply chain and that's that's not to say that the full approval the only thing that happened with the full approval was all these stability testing and all this cmc portion fda continued to look at the clinical data the long-term safety data the long-term efficacy data but a lot of it was stuff that doesn't really get to the issue of is it actually working a lot of those questions about is it actually working were resolved a while ago um you know the the sort of remaining question around the vaccines is what is the long-term uh immunity that they offered how durable is it and that's a question that's going to take us time to answer and we're it's also going to take us time to answer the question what is the durability of natural immunity we now know people who are infected they get immunity and the immunity is robust but what we don't know is what the durability is is it going to last the whole their whole life probably not at some point they're going to need to get vaccinated in order to maintain their immunity we just don't know how durable it is oh and and what is a long term like what's the length of time for what would that would make people comfortable um for a long term study you know so there's long-term studies of the flu shot people seem okay with that well some people some people don't but yeah and in a con in the context of of a vaccine the idea of having um data that goes out to years is pretty long term i mean i you know in sort of if you're asking me about a in a regulatory context or a medical context what is long-term data most um side effects are manifest within the first three months it's very rare that you'll see what i would refer to as a latent side effect where some with the introduction of some medical product into a large population causes some subtle untoward effect that's not going to be manifest for many many years there's a couple of places where this happens like the risk of carcinogenicity so you know the risk that something at a very low incidence can increase your odds of developing cancer that that is a latent risk that might not become manifest for many years because it takes time to develop cancer so if you take something today that slightly increases your odds of developing cancer that cancer may not be manifest for 10 or 15 years but actually the systems for ferreting out carcinogenicity the cancer-causing potential of drugs is are very good the fda the regulatory process has gotten very good at that so that's one risk that's a latent risk but it's uncommon that you see drugs induce latent risks that don't become manifest for a very long period of time most things become manifest quickly and you can observe it quickly right well that's good to know um okay limited time left i've only got a couple minutes sorry about that but i really want to get your take on hr3 i mean you wrote an op-ed on this recently and the thing you noted from so hr 3 for everybody is basically a a price control scheme for drugs okay because we all want drugs to be cheaper and now now getting to that point is difficult it's it's a complicated ecosystem because you also want there to be new drugs uh you want there to be innovation you want people to invest in research and development and so price controls uh tend to afford that you noted in your op-ed that look this this is primarily gonna hurt the development of those breakthrough drugs like a cure for alzheimer's because because drug companies aren't gonna aren't gonna invest in that but the more specific question i to ask you um you know being from big pharma right but far at pfizer would hr3 really hurt the big drug companies that much or does it just destroy the small biotech firm startups that require that that seed funding and require that risk-taking yeah i think it's going to hurt the small companies more i also work on the venture capital side of this of this business and you know anything you do to either increase the cost of capital or reduce cap the expected return makes it harder to fund a new venture big big drug companies aren't getting out of the business of developing drugs they're in it you know there's they're stuck in it that's their business model um they're going to continue to invest in new drugs their margins might go down their profitability might go down they might have less money to invest but they're in that business model but a venture capital firm that invests in clean tech and and media and you know internet and biotech if the expected returns on the biotech investments start to go down because the government's now stepping in to cap those expected returns and the cost of capital the cost of actually engaging the endeavor continues to go up because the regulatory costs are going up and there's more regulatory uncertainty you could shift around your portfolio if you have a 100 million dollar portfolio no one's forcing you to put 20 million dollars into biotech you could say you know what my expected returns on the next social media company are going to be better i'm going to shift more money into that and that's in fact what you've seen over time as you know policies change in different areas of commercial activity investors shift around capital that capital is very fluid and that's the capital that supports those those biotech companies and those startups where quite frankly a lot of the innovation is coming from a lot of the innovation that's coming into big pharma is being unlicensed from those entrepreneurial companies that are more risk-taking right like pfizer buys that you know they then that's the goal of the startup they just want to get bought out by something bigger but you know you have these this horrible regulatory system pfizer can keep figuring that out you know they'll they'll figure out how to shift around in order to keep making profits and i just think that's so important for people to understand because they want to take it to you all right they want to take it to big pharma right and i totally get that sentiment but but you know this isn't but but but there's uh there's there's people who get hurt a lot worse and i i don't think it's actually big pharma um and i just think it's important to point that out you know sorry you're just the brunt of a lot of uh a lot of anger but it is what it is it comes with the job right it comes to the territory i'm a politician so i get that well scott we gotta we gotta run but that was really informative uh and and really appreciate any parting words i appreciate you taking the time to uh to discuss the book congressman look forward to staying in touch with you thanks a lot absolutely thanks scott

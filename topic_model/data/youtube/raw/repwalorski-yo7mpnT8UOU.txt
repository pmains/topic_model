and this legislation builds upon the bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 where we made a significant step forward in helping those unemployed through no fault of their own by pairing unemployment benefits with services over the last few decades there have been a been a focus on automation that has removed all human interaction from the benefit claims process beneficiaries really have become just another number entered into a spreadsheet or a computer database during the last recession we saw that merely providing 99 weeks of unemployment benefits was not enough to help individuals return to the workforce that's why in 2012 we offered reemployment services and eligibility assessments known as Reese's to the long-term unemployed based on successful state efforts to engage UI beneficiaries since the recession many states have rebranded unemployment to reemployment and focus efforts to promote rapid reemployment because it's better for workers their families and an economy where we have 1 million more job openings than we actually have unemployed the bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provides states with funding certainty so they can invest in these services and serve greater number of workers that's why HR 1759 is so important it makes permanent a technical correction first made in FY 2019 appropriations to clarify that reemployment services and eligibility assessments shall promote quicker reemployment to shorten benefit durations for all unemployment insurance claimants not just those most likely to exhaust unemployment benefits in my home state of Indiana risa was redesigned in 2016 to assist you I claimants through early intervention to aid in a quicker return to meaningful employment and eliminate UI fraud Indiana's risa program is twofold the initial risa expects beneficiaries to make an in-person visit to a work 1 Center on approximately the 6th week of benefits during that visit they attend an orientation to learn more about the services and then meet with Arisa counselor for a one-on-one assessment interview to develop an individual reemployment plan that plan may include workshops to improve job search or interviewing skills or referrals to other support or services beyond the UI agencies any of the risa initial participants who are still collecting at the 15th week of their UI claim are contacted for re-engagement as part of the subsequent Risa program these long-term claimants are brought in for a one-on-one reassessment interview to determine if additional barry's barriers to reemployment or present at any point in the process where it becomes apparent that additional more intensive services are needed the customer then moves into WI o ei services Risa's are a valuable reemployment tool to those who have lost their job through no fault of their own and for that reason I urge all my colleagues to support HR 1759 the bridge for workers Act and with that mr.

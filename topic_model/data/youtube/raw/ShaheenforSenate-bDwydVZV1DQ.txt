i'm heather ledoux and i've lived in litchfield for almost my whole life i work at elliott hospital and i'm in the emergency room i've been a nurse for 18 years i am voting for jeanne shaheen for senator because jeanne cares about the community she's been in new hampshire she knows our people she knows what our values are and what we need from the nation and what we need as a state and she is willing to back us up at every point my personal experience working in a pandemic has been watching people who are alone because they can't have family members in with them when they're sick with kovid they're afraid they don't know if they're going to come out of the hospital but knowing that at least at our state level representing us in washington d.c jeanne shaheen has our back i know that i don't have to make phone calls to my senator to beg for the help i need in my hospital because she's going to ask for it on my behalf i don't have to worry about whether she's working in our best interest i know that that's where she is jeanne shaheen has been on our side for decades she knows new hampshire she's ready to fight for us she's done so as our governor and now as our senator in d.c we need a voice like gene shaheen in washington on our behalf

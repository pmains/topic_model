well a lot of people in our country have uh coverage it's sometimes very expensive but uh we pay way more uh for health care in this country than any other nation like one and a half times more we have we don't get better outcomes in some cases we get worse outcomes we have a bunch of people who don't have health insurance today about 40 million plus today 14 000 people who had health care insurance uh now yesterday will go to bed today they won't have it and we have big companies like the gm and like chrysler that are the little companies too finding it hard to compete with their competitors around the world because of the cost of health insurance so the idea of doing nothing and just say well we're going to give up because this is hard that's not a very good option we've got too much riding on this and we need to see it through and at the end of the day figure out and we know we have really good ideas on how to reduce the cost of health care slow the growth of health care costs and actually improve outcomes and with the money that we save to extend coverage to people who don't have it so that's what we should do as far as who will be helped by the enactment of this legislation i think among the people who will be helping folks who already have health insurance we're lucky to have it uh but we're paying about an extra thousand dollars a year to cover people who don't have it who end up in our emergency rooms and our hospitals for uncompensated care we pay for that the rest of us pay for that so we'll we'll be helping those of us who've seen our health care costs arise i just talked to an employer today they said their healthcare costs were going to go up next year by like 18 on top of about 16 last year and we're going to help folks like that because we're going to give them better choices a lot more choices and let competition work to bring down the cost of health care for a whole lot of families a lot of businesses and for it for individuals so there'll be help and i think we're going to be helped because we're going to get better outcomes we actually know some ways and a lot of ways to improve outcomes the a lot of that will flow from from this legislation so there are any number of folks in their country from people without coverage to who don't have it today are going to be helping but a lot of others as well i know people think this has been an endless debate actually the debate uh goes back not just for a year the debate goes back to when harry truman was president he first called for addressing the need for quality health care for just about everybody in our in our country my hope is that the senate will pass legislation comprehensive legislation that focuses on improving outcomes reducing the growth of costs extending coverage to people who don't have it and we do that by by christmas they then we then figure out how to compromise our bill with the house bill and i hope they will largely accept what we are going to pass um and then the president i expect would sign that legislation before the end of of january almost immediately among the things that will happen is the the inability of people to get insurance coverage with if they have pre-existing conditions that will will go away we're going to again improve the quality of reduce the cost of prescription drug medicines for for senior citizens who use the medicare prescription drug program um the uh the idea that uh folks can have their literally have their interests cut off uh is is gonna because the cost of their coverage has gone up that will will go away those are just some of the things that will change almost almost immediately and in the long run uh there'll be other things to come along but uh there uh uh one other i mentioned for people have children that maybe are still in school or uh unable to they're out of looking for a job and but they don't have health care coverage they'll be covered by their parents uh health insurance up until age 26 so for a lot of families with with kids that are coming up out of school that's going to be a help as well that will happen almost right away

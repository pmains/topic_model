so we're here today gathered at Camp Hale home of the the original home of 10th Mountain division I'm a 10th Mountain veteran myself I'm here with Mr Francis Lovett who's an original 10th Mountain veteran who trained here at Camp Hale we are advocating for National Monument status for Camp Hill and the Continental Divide Wilderness on the surrounding hills around Camp Hale here how do you feel Francis Mr Levitt about how accessible Camp hell is now um versus how it was when you first got here well it's accessible now before when I was here you got in and out with guards at the gate and so on sure so it was not accessible and I don't think very many people wanted to come and play in Camp Hill right I also heard it had a nice nickname they called it Camp hell yeah but no matter what people remember about us or like me think about it in retrospect where I'm really straining my memory to think of all the good things that were here it sounds like there was quite a few there were there were the experience with the outdoors was for me one of the most gorgeous times of my life I would give anything if I could go again out into all these woods and mountains and and just look see and feel and smell and I that's one of the reasons I'm so interested in having this declared a National Monument not just this little tiny oval bowl that used to be a camp put all the things around it I agree that belong with it and [Music] it's so easy to tear things down [Music] and you can't put them back [Music] serving with the 10th in Afghanistan and then with the reserve component back in uh back in Connecticut Vermont um and then moving out here to Colorado after I got out of the service I've found nothing but Solace nothing but um relief and peace here in these surrounding hills around Camp Hill yeah um I I live a short a short distance away and uh I always tell people that the these lands specifically right here around Camp Hale they act as my therapist my gym yep my church uh and my playground yeah yeah and it sounds like that's similar to to your experience yes and the experience of a lot of the Vets who served here and who have served afterwards a lot of my experience in academics involved being part of music okay and I came to recognize along the way that what a lot of people say is a silly sentimental song the hills ReSound with the sound of music I believe it you too because in my music insights there is music in being here and there should be like coming to A Philharmonic concert you come to relax to think peaceful things to remember good things and to anticipate let's do it again and I would I would look to see this as a National Monument I come back and say oh they did it how important it's history and history needs attention that it does and the more we can protect and Preserve the more grateful some generation is going to be not only honor those who have served here and have given their lives in defense of democracy and defense of our nation I think there's no better way to do that than to protect the physical lands where we live you know we can disagree with our government we can disagree with our society we can disagree with politics or news or anything but uh yeah when it comes to to public lands it's something that belongs to everybody and it's worth protecting after every single one of us to today future is gone the land is going to be here right and it will regenerate itself if we insist on ruining it yes it will so I'm in favor of protecting every acre we can and am quite willing to write speak argue on behalf of having a National Monument for instance and I feel grateful for the opportunity to say that it means that much that I would do anything in speech writing whatever it takes to help persuade people it's that important to me is that important to me as well yeah and I think that's something other than our military service that we absolutely share yeah it's maybe a little bit of the influence of our respective service help lead us to be so similar in our attitude and well I think especially folks who go and see combat yeah and and see the horrors that war is yeah um and has been um and it probably always will be um but yeah to come back to a place like our public lands a place like Camp Hill uh in order to come back to Camp Hill specifically well Francis I really appreciate your time um I'm so thankful to have met you well I too I'm so glad to know there's somebody not of my generation who still cares likewise yeah let's check your hands it's so nice to meet you it's an honor truly well I appreciate that I'm sorry only that I can't go home and tell people what you look like don't worry you're not missing much

work in the place that I do and and good behavior is not something that's rewarded a lot of the time I unfortunately you have to look far for an example that I've been able to follow and that's the example Gary Hart said for me and I will be forever grateful for that and I'm grateful that he invited me here tonight and that the school of and in that the Iowa school is hosting this important important discussion you know last week I had the chance to go back and be sworn in again to the United States Senate which is a great privilege that and the day before uh we had that ceremony my wife Susan and our three daughters were in Washington DC and we all went to the African-American history museum there I've been there uh several times before in it's impossible to walk through that Museum without feeling the weight of history and without having to confront the Injustice that Scott was talking about of what previous generations of Americans did to their fellow Americans from Solomon Northrop to Emmett Till that's why museums matter but when you leave a museum like that it can be tempting to imagine that you're also leaving behind the history and of course nothing could be further from the truth that history lives with us every day and you can draw a straight line as I've said all across the state of Colorado over and over again over the last 14 years in red parts of the state and blue parts of the state a place where people might vote for me in places where people will never vote you can draw a straight line from slavery to Jim Crow to the redlining of our housing and our banking Industries to the mass incarceration today that we have in the United States to the Deep educational inequities that we have to the disproportionate number of black Americans who died during the pandemic or who face eviction in this country or whose kids can't go to school online because they don't have high-speed internet at home that isn't history this is our American reality today I was born in 1964. I pointed out to my nephew who had come with us to the African-American history museum the other day that that meant that the year I was that I was born less than a hundred years after people owned human beings here in the United States what I was trying to tell him was that's not ancient history that's two 50-year lifetimes connecting the year that I was born to the to the the end of the Civil War and that was also a year of Dr Martin Luther King's March on Washington when I was born and before I was five years old incredibly America had passed the Voting Rights Act we passed the Civil Rights Act we confirmed Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court of the United States of America which then overturned bans on interracial marriage when I was in college in the late 80s studying history and protesting apartheid there was a sense that America was making progress that we were making steady progress that we would always make from slowly slowly but surely and when I graduated from college it would have been inconceivable I would not have believed it if you told me then 30 years later America's racial wealth Gap would remain virtually unchanged that it would be the same if you had told me that our Urban Public Schools would be just as segregated in the year 2023 I wouldn't have believed it I couldn't have believed and I wouldn't have believed that we'd ever elect a president of the United States who began his campaign by calling Mexicans rapists and ended ended it with the big lie but it's true and the value of studying history in my view is that you appreciate that Americans faced moments like this before and we have overcome them because of the choices that Americans have made and that's what I'd like to leave you with tonight last October you might have noticed that President Biden came to Colorado I was in an election for my re-election and I have to confess that my campaign wasn't very happy with my inviting the president because his approval number is not actually very high and their view was that it wasn't going to be helpful to my re-election but I thought it was really important for him to come because the reason he was coming to Colorado was to designate Camp Hale as the First National Monument of his administration the veterans of Camp Hill deserved for the president of the United States to be last year we also made Camp amachi an official part of the National Park Service on the Southeastern Plains of Colorado and what I said on the campaign over and over again this year was think about those two cans those two camps in Colorado 80 years ago it's not ancient history I always say when I come to this part of the talk that there's somebody here who's 80 years old and they usually say yeah it was yesterday that I was graduating from high school 80 years ago 80 years ago when my mom was surviving the Holocaust miraculously in Warsaw with her parents who were Jews living in Poland at Camp Hill you know I told the story with the president of the people that had come from all over the country who'd come there to train on skis some of them were the best skiers and Mountaineers in the world some of them had never seen snow before and they spent two years training under conditions that were unimaginable because we're in a religious place I'm not going to say what some veterans from remember or some kids remember their kids of veterans that that we'll have to say the coldest son of a in the world is what they said that's what they said the mountain was that they trained them but in two years in two years they trained to go to Northern Italy break through the Nazi lines and they did it and they began that was the beginning of the end of World War II that is a great Colorado story that is a great American story but at the same time at campomachi on the Southeastern Plains of Colorado 10 000 people mostly Japanese American citizens we're locked up behind barbed wire stripped of their constitutional rights trip of their property rights on the order of politicians in Washington D.C it is such a profound reminder that our history has always been a struggle of contrast as the president said always been a struggle between the highest ideals that have ever been written on the page the words in the Constitution of the United States and the worst impulses in human history in our case human slavery and the displacement of an entire indigenous culture and in Camp a Machi locking thousands of up behind barbed wire just 80 years ago and that's the struggle that we are still in today when a Supreme Court when a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States rights as justicer Leo did in Dobbs versus Jackson that if a right didn't exist in 1868 before women had the right to vote for black Americans had the right to vote if a right didn't exist in 1868 it doesn't exist exist today you know we're in that struggle when we have an education system that instead of liberating kids from their economic circumstances reinforces the worst income and equality that we have had in a century in this country you know we're in the struggle when people feel like they don't have Economic Opportunity they they and they lose confidence that this democracy will actually deliver for them and then a that uh that uh that uh ambitious politician would show up as they always do in human history and say I alone can fix it you don't need a democracy you don't need the rule of law you know we're in the struggle and when our fellow citizens storm the United States capital two years ago under their racist banners and flags and with their anti-semitic t-shirts you know that we're in the struggle but in the end it's really up to all of us Gary's saying you got to stop and I will stop it is not it is up tall the problem is you picked a topic that I really care about but it's really up to all of us the people who trained at Camp Hale could have used [Music] all Americans in campomachi instead of doing what they were doing they chose not to they chose America's highest ideals the people who face fire hoses and police dogs had poll tests had every reason to give up to question America's commitment to our highest ideals there's every single reason why John Lewis when he was sacrificing his skull on the Edmund Pettus bridge to those building clubs should have doubted whether the Democracy stood for him but they didn't and he didn't give up they asked America instead they asked Americans to live up to our highest ideals from Frederick Douglass to John Lewis to the hundred other names honored on the walls of the African-American history museum that my wife and kids visit and even many of the people at Camp amachi believe it or not never lost faith in America people like Marion kenishi a senior at a Machi High School who wrote a valedictorian speech to her fellow classmates from behind Barb wires and she wrote sometimes in this I'm quoting her sometimes America failed and suffered sometimes she made mistakes but she always admitted them and tried to rectify the Injustice that flowed for him can we the graduating class of emoji Senior High School still believe that America means freedom equality security and justice do I believe in this do my classmates believe this yes with all of our hearts because in that faith and that hope in my future our future because in that faith in that hope is my future our future and the world's future so I want to leave you tonight by saying thank you for caring about our country thank you for caring about our democracy and thank you like Marion for caring with about the world's future thank you for having me

hi everyone thank you so much for joining us for this evening's backyard chat i'd like to i love that your mayor has taken it literally and she is sitting in the backyard um way we're going to do this is that the mayor and the congressman are going to chat for a little while if you have questions put them into the zoom chat and in about half hour i'll start calling on people to ask their questions so without further ado mayor it's all yours thank you lisa good evening everyone mayor jackie benjamin lieberberg here and i want to thank you all for zooming in tonight for our backyard chat with tom malinowski thank you to lisa mandelblad for all your assistance in organizing this event and a warm congratulations to you on your new role as director of community engagement so thank you so very well deserved i might add thank you to spencer caroline lauren choi and lauren grober for their help in getting this all together a quick shout out to some of my participants or our participants essence county freeholder pat siebel maggie miggins and sanji viniak milburn township democratic nominees for next year's township committee annette romano our democratic chair fellow committeeman richard wasserman district leaders melbourne short hills residents and friends it is really a thrill for me to be here to host this event with tom the residents of melbourne township and for that matter the entire district seven are so fortunate to have such an accomplished smart well-respected and honorable man to represent us in the house of representatives over the past two years i've been privileged to get to know tom and work with him he's been a visible partner in melbourne at the delhi for a conversation with residents at a town hall meeting at melbourne high school and most recently at the black lives matter march two of his many virtues that make him stand out to me are first are his empathy that is genuine as an immigrant he understands what it's like to be uprooted and oppressed second he is always accessible and approachable your staff is available 24 7 to assist with any issues resident concerns or logistical help during this pandemic residence or myself on behalf of residents have reached out many times to your staff and the first response is always how can we help whether it's an unemployment a ppp social security or veteran benefit issue to name a few their dedication to melbourne and our residents is the embodiment of public service and we are so very grateful so without further ado let me invite our congressman from the 7th district of new jersey tom malinowski to offer some insights and i turn the virtual floor over to you thank you thank you um thank you mayor thank you lisa why can't we have further ado you like more ado yeah let's have more do um we have more to do we have a lot more to do we have a lot yes that's true the more i do the less we do um so uh we're doing a lot and i think that's what i'm particularly focused on right now i'm um just back in dc we're about to start uh two at least weeks of marathon legislating um and the most important there's a lot we're going to be trying to get done in by the first week of august but the most important thing is to finally get to some resolution on the heroes act which we passed in the house a couple of months ago or you know more to the point the next response the next congressional response to the most important issue of the moment and that is how our country is fighting this pandemic and the economic crisis that it has um spawned i am very very um well i'm very angry about where we are right now um we uh we the congress spent about two trillion dollars of your money to buy our nation time to mount a proper public health response to the coronavirus we put the economy on life support we took care of a lot of folks who lost their jobs whose businesses had to shut down all of this again was to buy time for our national and state authorities to do what was necessary to beat the virus and here in new jersey we did what was necessary and we have seen the results um all of our numbers uh went way way down hospitalizations rate of infection testing positivity um everything moved to where it needed to be but our national government led by the president utterly abdicated responsibility and um our number of other states encouraged by the president uh opened um way too soon without even having um done the things that new jersey that all of us sacrificed so much to do and as a result we are the only advanced democracy in the world that has failed to beat this thing and that is still seeing a massive spike in cases and it can only come back to haunt us in new jersey god forbid but we are we are not an island we are vulnerable to the mistakes of um so-called leaders in texas and florida and georgia and elsewhere uh who have allowed this thing to spread out of control all of that creates a context for legislation that we have to pass unfortunately it means we need it more fortunately it means that senators representing those states who were operating under the delusion that this was sort of a coastal problem a few months ago now realize that it is a national problem and so their incentive to actually pass something is higher and i think that's one reason why mitch mcconnell is now saying okay we gotta pass something um so they're gonna do something in the senate they're gonna do a bill that's less ambitious than our heroes act and then we get to start to negotiate which is what we should have done two months ago what they should have been willing to do two months ago most important piece of that really important uh i know to you mayor um is relief for state county and local governments not just to help you buy ppe and test kits and stuff like that but to again make up for lost revenue in this economic crisis so maybe i should start there and just ask you to talk about this from the perspective of the town you lead um where where are you guys in terms of your budget your revenue project projections and what will that mean to your constituents because it's going to touch everybody's lives well it's it's it's certainly still a work in progress our august tax bills are due and in sort of next week and we'll have a better understanding and a better picture certainly we're worried about uh our schools reopening on time in some capacity um we're worried about our uh our revenue shortfall um and we continue to be very very mindful of all of all of those things our our economy from milburn we are a large large percentage of our residents our new york city commuters which kind of leads me to my next question about about uh infrastructure spending so we're uh we're we're we're cautious and we're we're gonna weather this as best we can and uh um we're going into this we were fiscally strong um so we're we're hoping that we uh we may be able to weather this a little bit better than some of our our neighbors but it's certainly going to be very mindful and we're going to be um very judicious and very cautious about our expenditures going forward yeah um well you know um obviously if we could just pass the heroes act it would pretty much take care of your needs um it's not gonna be that generous i don't think because inevitably we're going to have to make some compromises we passed a three trillion dollar bill that's maybe too big mcconnell has said it shouldn't be more than one trillion the difference between one and three is pretty big now there is some money from the cares act that was not spent um because we were very generous uh including to like the airlines there's ppe uh ppp money sorry paycheck protection program money that has not been spent so we we can repurpose some of uh what we provided at that moment of high emergency um but i do think we're gonna still have to be generous um this is this is a moment when you have to spend there's just no no no question about it and as the as the municipality we're kind of third in line after our schools and the county so you're aware yes i know explain that to explain how that works to everybody because not everyone may be aware well based upon our our budget and our expenditures the the first um percentage has to go to fund our schools uh our school programs next has to fund our uh our account our county um demands and third is the municipality so um so we have to be make whole those first two items before we look at ourselves and our municipal our our our roads our police our fire where we're third in line after the first two so to speak so um so like i said we we really do need to be very mindful and very cautious that we uh we exercise tremendous care and and fiscal responsibility going forward um my question is uh sort of about my next question might be to you to ask you about um uh infrastructure spending as you know a large percentage of our population our new york city commuters um kudos to you on our portal board jackie i think he froze died freeze my back so we are very grateful for this the success in the funding of the portal bridge and your commitment to infrastructure um a large percentage of our computers are of our of our population our new york city commuters uh do you think anything will be done with respect to the gateway tunnel funding for before year-end or is just that we'll put in the 2021 bucket um so uh let's dwell on the portal bridge for a moment first yes let's bask in that glory let's bask a little bit because remember you guys know obviously how important gateway is the gateway project and you know the gateway project is not just one thing it's not just the tunnel although that's the most important part it is a series of improvements between newark penn station and new york penn station um the busiest railway corridor in the country that piece of track between those two stations because it's all of new jersey transit and all of amtrak all coming together and narrowing to two trucks with bridges in a tunnel that were built in 1910 and by the way in 1910 you could get to new york from milburn in about the same amount of time as you can today and it included a ferry ride wow that's how much progress we've made we're little um so a lot of stuff needs to get fixed or replaced and and in fact the first part of that project first step was always going to be this bridge the portal bridge which is falling apart and every train has to slow down to cross it and they're called you know it just it's a bottleneck even when it's working um so that got all cut up in the gateway controversy trump didn't want to spend a penny on gateway because it's in new jersey and he doesn't like us um you know um schumer and all the you know he he likes people who like him and government programs don't go to people who don't like him that's where we are as a country so um that was the challenge that uh i faced when i came in and so we worked on this relentlessly and we did a couple of things number one we decoupled the portal bridge application from the gateway application so that he might not notice it so that he might see it as just some dumb bridge in new jersey and let it go and then number two we we just put relentless pressure on the department of transportation to approve this because the excuses they were making were not good excuses um and we were successful uh because the portal bridge is now approved it's in the engineering phase it will soon move into the construction phase and when that new bridge is built you will see improvements in service even before the new tunnel is constructed so let's you know let's pause to recognize a rare success infrastructure spending for new jersey under this administration um and then um the tunnel is next and they're still making excuses for the tunnel they've been sitting on the environmental impact statement uh two years past their own self-imposed deadline for releasing this [Music] and so what can we do about it number one we've provided funding so if if we got the signature approving it there would be funding to start the project that's good news we've worked on that number two uh obviously if biden's elected um will get the approval um so you know that would be good um if he's not elected we i'm i'm trying to put as much into legislation as possible right now um to make it as hard as possible for the department of transportation to continue holding this thing up so for example we just passed this big infrastructure bill in the house and we put language in it that would take one full-time position away from the secretary of transportation for every month that an environmental impact statement is delayed past deadline so that would apply to any place where they're doing it but it so happens the place they're doing it is uh new jersey um and uh and you know and there are other things that we will do in that bill in the appropriations bill just to tie their hands a little bit more so that they have to actually um deliver this money to the project that congress intends them to fund it'll happen i'm not i've no doubt but it only happens with pressure uh another question that that is also comes to mind for a new jersey residents is the the salt deduction that has had a uh tremendous deleterious effect uh on our communities here you believe that could potentially be restored in 2021 with under a uh biden leadership yeah so um the transportation stuff we can make progress this year it's not easy but i put that in the realm of the possible even with our divided government the salt deduction we we've made as much progress as we can um with this president in the white house and mitch mcconnell in the senate what we've done is pass a bill in the house of representatives restoring the salt deduction and i was um you know i think you've heard me say this i was extremely annoying with our leadership all of last year uh making sure that that would happen because that was a promise i made to you all and i promised that i would only vote for a speaker of the house who helped us keep that promise i reminded nancy pelosi of that on numerous occasions and she kept her promise to me so that i could keep my promise to you and we passed that bill what does it mean um even you know with the senate refusing to take it up what it means in practice is that democrats have committed themselves to this and when we do tax reform in 2021 which i think we will do i will certainly fight for it if we have a different configuration in washington um when we do it salt is going to have to be part of the deal because in fact it is the one piece of tax reform we've passed in the house under the majority that we won in 2018 it could be a full restoration of the deduction which is my preference uh it could be a partial um could be partial relief there are proposals out there to allow each member of a married couple to take the ten thousand dollar deduction rather than both only being able to take it once um or simply raising uh the cap so that it's more or much more than ten thousand there are different ways to do it all of which would be beneficial to us um i will push for the maximal uh solution because i think it's fair we've always had deductibility of state and local income taxes state and local taxes from our federal income taxes since there was a federal income tax um [Music] and that's what i will continue to fight for okay should we open this up now to some questions from our guest great i think we're going to start with uh where are you going congressman um darkness is falling so i hit a light okay we're gonna start with jordana horn who has a question about ways to bridge the gap um with our fellow cd7 residents go ahead jordana okay am i unmuted you're unmuted you're good to go hi congressman um thanks so much it's nice to see you um when you go around the district when you're um and you are everywhere um which we all appreciate um in contrast to previous uh representatives who were not um do you find when you talk to people you find that anyone's mind is changing or do you find that people are hunkering down in their um opinions exacerbated by all the science denial and fox news and the other things basically what i'm asking is if you see the possibility to bridge a gap with our fellow residents of uh our district yeah so if i didn't if i didn't feel that was possible i would not be in this business because we need it desperately as a country i i do have to um say that i'm not really going around the district and talking to people in the same way as i would have been before a coronavirus you know i can't go to a train station and shake hands or into a diner or well anything like that i just stepped out really for the first time recently to talk to small business owners because they're reopening um gradually and so i've you know gone out and talked to restaurant and bar owners and um [Music] and other small businesses about how they're feeling about things but you know it's not like there are crowds of people than in those stores talk to there shouldn't be [Music] but i do sense from my teletown halls my virtual town halls that there has been some change in people's perceptions of the administration because of the coronavirus this isn't just dumb tweets anymore it's not just bad rhetoric where people can say yeah look i know it that guy's a jerk and i wouldn't want my kids to follow his example but um give him a chance he's doing some good things for the economy you guys are crazy too it's now 140 plus thousand americans dead and a president who's saying it's not my responsibility the states are on their own it's a hoax liberate michigan trying to get rid of fouchy you know and i think i think there are a lot more people scratching their heads and asking can we do a little better here because this affects this touches every one of our all of our lives in the most profound way um so can we measure that no not until the election um and that will be the ultimate test as it should be i had one interesting conversation recently i was out in phillipsburg uh visiting a bagel shop as part of this small business tour that i was doing and when we walked out of the bagel shop my staff member wanted me to shoot a little video saying i'm congressman tom malinowski and i'm visiting the bagel shop right something silly like that and there was this couple sitting on a bench eating bagel outside the shop and they heard me and the guy who was a big big guy with tat you know tattoos and um and he said you know i heard you i heard what you were saying and i can't help telling you i used to be a democrat and i will never vote for democrat again all you people do is rail on trump and i'm tired of it and uh and the woman next to him was a sister he introduced her there was some stuff that was said that i cannot repeat on a family zoom session uh but i kind of got into it with them because i had some time and i thought you know what you know you're talking to me so i want to talk to you and we ended up having a very boisterous fun edgy conversation i'm being diplomatic um but the whole issue of uh the police and george floyd came and you know after you know he railed on me for you know democrats and there was a little bit of george soros conspiracy mongering and all that he said you know what all of america was together behind george floyd and if i had been an african-american if i'd been a black man in minnesota after that happened i would have wanted to march down to the police station and burn it down and this was a after he like told me about you know young leftists tearing down monuments and how that was wrong i think i got him to trust me because i told him you know i actually think tearing down monuments is wrong too tearing them down rather than taking them down legally he said all right you know but i gotta say i would have wanted to burn down that police station and i'm like no we don't actually want to burn down anything but like there was this moment of complete empathy um and and we talked about it and it just it was not the first or certainly hope i assume not the last time when i felt like you could just talk to somebody not mediated by facebook and twitter and all those algorithms that push us apart we'd be fine because i could see his humanity and he could see mine and as we left uh as we parted his sister who who fully took part in the kind of pro-trump parts of the conversation um said to me you know i i did vote for you last time so yeah i think you can reach people if you can have a chance to talk to them and listen to them that's why we're trying to make sure that you're in front of as many people as possible um jackie did you have anything to add or should we go into that session okay i have one tailor made for you tom from david boyco he wants to ask you about restoring the us's standing on the world stage hi tom thanks for taking the time this afternoon sure turning to a a conversation perhaps near and dear to your heart and thinking hopefully ahead to post january 20th 2021 have you or anyone in the democratic caucus given thought to what we need to do or can do to rehabilitate our standing and role in the in the in the world uh not just in terms of reputation but the treaties the international organizations the alliance relations that have just been trashed and decimated over the last three three some years it's a it's a mess um yeah i've noticed um so as we build gateway don't forget that i said that um yes of course we've been thinking a lot about that and there's a long list um and it begins with getting right with our allies our democratic allies countries that are our allies because they share our values and our objectives for a better world um and we can talk a lot about what that means in in detail some of it is pretty easy it's like don't pull out of germany recommit to nato um don't treat south korean japanese australian allies that host our troops like they're you know like they're supposed to be paying us as if we're mercenaries um as if everything we do in the world is just to get paid which is trump's foreign policy so there's some fairly easy steps we can take to restore our alliances um but here's kind of let me step back a little bit this is the way i'm really thinking about it the um the reason for our good reputation in the world i think people admire about america is it's not primarily the stuff we do in our foreign policy it's not um [Music] what we lead the world towards it's who we are and who we are um is not never has been a country that's perfect but it has long been a country that takes seriously the the um cause of building a more perfect union of constantly acknowledging and repairing our imperfections through this marvelous system that we created that we invented of checks and balances and individual liberties and our constitution that's what we're advertising and [Music] so if we can um overcome this set of difficulties that in and of itself is going to be very inspiring to people who have admired us around the world who who by the way have many of these countries have faced the same kinds of trumpy politics as we have right simultaneously so like they know they're susceptible they're vulnerable just as we have shown we're vulnerable um if we can show that through a free press through independent courts through the ability of all of our citizens to go out and peacefully protest and to organize locally and nationally and people running for office and two elections 2018 and 2020 in which the american people came together to reject this kind of politics um we can do that i think that will in and of itself do a tremendous amount for our reputation and and then i think our foreign policy if it were up to me would be in a sense um taking what we've done domestically to renew our democracy on the road um taking on those who violate democratic norms around the world uh taking on corruption around the world which i think should become an organizing principle of our foreign policy standing with ordinary people in china and russia and turkey and saudi arabia and venezuela who are tired of governments that steal from them using our power our financial power to stand by those powerless people um and and mobilizing our allies to do it with us i think that becomes our foreign policy and um it would be the logical extension of what we've all been through domestically yeah thank you very thoughtful answer really thoughtful somebody is not muted that needs to be muted i don't know who okay it's often entertaining it always is you're like ooh what are we gonna hear um we are gonna go on to a question from regina truett who had a question about ppe ready i think i'm a muted hello everyone thank you so much congressman for joining us this evening um full disclosure i'm a nurse my question regards ppe and specifically n95 face masks how can how can we in new jersey be assured that direct care health care providers have the n95 face masks and other essential personal protective equipment so that they can protect themselves and render the best care to stick patients with coronavirus and other respiratory pathogens well thank you so much and thank you for you know what no i'm gonna thank you so stop it i freedom of speech allows me to do that um but um i can't assure you of that unfortunately that's why i'm angry um you know we make uh we we manufacture in the united states enough uh cans of soda every single day to equip every single man woman and child in america with i think two or three cans of soda we ought to be able to manufacture enough n95 masks not just for our medical professionals and first responders but frankly for every american an advanced economy like ours should be able to do that we don't do it because you know there isn't the kind of steady demand for n95 masks that there is for coke and pepsi um and so the market doesn't quite work in the same way which means that the solution to the problem is something that our laws provide for which is the president has this authority to command the market to command the private sector in moments of emergency make things like if it's a war you can command general motors you start making tanks rather than cars that's the defense production act which i think all of us have heard of right now we've been begging and pleading demanding that he do it he's not going to do it i'm not going to keep pretending that that's even a possibility he said explicitly you're on your own the states are on their own so what is plan b plan b is congress provides a lot of money which we did in the cares act and are trying to do once again and the states the governors basically um substitute for presidential leadership and ideally working together in compacts which we have as you know in the northeast new jersey new york connecticut pennsylvania et cetera try to use their buying power to make sure that particularly those who need it most in our health care system have the basic ppe that they need it's not perfect um the other variable here is the spike in the epidemic itself right because we we geared up we made a lot of stuff we imported a lot of stuff we distributed a lot of stuff thinking this might last two or three months and now it's exploding again in all those other states which means they're eating up a lot of ppe you know probably that um if you want to get a coronavirus test in new jersey it's now super easy a lot of us worked on this anybody can get a test go to your local cds or write aid they'll do it today or tomorrow with the latest and it's free but it's virtually useless because the turnaround time for the result is now i was told yesterday 10 days what's the point of getting a test if you're not going to know in 10 days right and that's because of in this case reagents mostly that's not ppe but it's again another critical element in the supply chain that is being used up now by the floridas and the texases because they're spiking and we didn't have enough so we're gonna keep fighting this um i was texting with the governor this morning about the testing part of it um we're gonna try to pass some version of the heroes act with more money and we will piece something together final part of my answer i know this is long but it's probably it's like the most important encouraging thing right now for the next pandemic i have legislation which we put into the appropriations bill this is the funding bill that we're passing this month for the department of health and human services which aims to fix the national strategic stockpile of ppe very simple solution it basically says that hhs has to tell all of us the public and congress at the beginning of every year here's how much we have and here's how much we would need in all of these different items to meet a global pandemic and if that shows we need more ventilators than it's put before the congress and we've either got to say yes or no if we say no shame on us i don't think we would say no if it's that public right um so that that will pass the house i'm fairly confident and hopefully we'll go all the way through thank you sure thank you so our next question is going to be from sam reckford and before i let him ask his question i just want to point everyone to the chat that one of our fabulous interns lauren choi has been putting in their ways for you to get involved with the campaign you can click on the link it'll send you right to a sign up page and while we are still doing everything we need to do to get tom reelected we're having to do it virtually so you can do it from the comfort of your own home but we really do need your help so thank you all right uh sam you should be unmuted i am thanks uh congressman i was wondering what you thought about the future of the unemployment benefits they're about to expire the federal unemployment benefits uh in a couple of weeks and what the likelihood of them is of getting extended for how long and would they be at the same levels i know there's been a lot of complaints about whether they're you know from some quarters about them being too generous correct so it's a 600 a week bonus on top of your base unemployment benefits and it expires at the end of this month it was absolutely the right thing to do in march in my view because at that point we didn't want anybody working apart from the most essential workers we wanted every business to shut down and so it made sense to be generous to everybody um who had to stay home uh now um there are arguments on both sides um on one side well these things are expiring um at a moment when a lot of people still can't go back to work and you don't want to go from 600 to zero that's um that would be a huge shock to the economy not to mention potentially cruel to people who still can't go back to work um on the other hand there are small business owners many i've spoken to who argue that that it's a disincentive for people to go back to their jobs and so you know we're asking businesses to reopen their ppp is expiring but they can't get the labor some of them argue because we have we're basically paying people not to work at a time when actually some of them could go back to work um so what's likely to happen um i don't think so in the heroes act we extend the 600 i don't think the final bill will extend the full 600 um i think uh what's more likely is that you will see kind of a gradual slope down in the size of the benefit and or we come up with something more targeted um there are of course industries that are reopening faster than others um there are some that are particularly hard hit whether it's through unemployment benefits or through some other mechanism i actually would prefer some other mechanism i think we've got to do something special for the restaurant industry the independent restaurant industry because honestly i don't we don't want restaurants to be reopening at 100 capacity with indoor dining right now um and yet even if it's like 50 or 25 capacity it's very hard to keep a restaurant going so it's not fair to those those folks who've invested in those businesses so i think we got to do something special there um i would personally if it were up to me if i were all powerful i'd replace the whole darn thing with direct income support through the irs to businesses to subsidize salaries if the business is still suffering because of the coronavirus that's what a lot of european countries did i think it would have been much more efficient um i don't know if we can pull a rabbit out of the hat in the next three weeks and create something like that in place of the 600 bonus um but that would be my ideal the react the likeliest outcome would be something similar to what we've already done but with a number that is in between 0 and 600. so rachel has small children with her so she's afraid to be unmuted but she's asked me to ask you about um school this actually would be for both of you about school reopening what you your thoughts on it whether you think it's safe for the kids and for the teachers and what you think should be done yeah it's not my it's not my job to decide whether it's safe it's my job to help make it safe that decision will ultimately be made by parents and teachers and school administrators they all have to be comfortable with this doesn't matter what i think and certainly doesn't matter what the president thinks we should do um the job of politicians is to try our best to make it as safe as possible for school to reopen i i agree with trump in the sense i would like to see schools reopen i think it's terrible you know it's def it's not ideal that kids are um uh are trying to get an education through zoom at home um it exacerbates all kinds of inequalities it's a horrible situation so absolutely i want schools to reopen fully but you know i don't want to hear people saying you must reopen or even worse conditioning federal aid to schools as trump has proposed and betsy devos has proposed on school's reopening don't tell us to do it help us to do it by fighting the pandemic thank you mayor do you have anything that where milburn is only to add that uh it's mandated at the end of the month by by governor murphy that each municipal each school district presents their plan and i i know that the board of ed and the uh melbourne school administrators have been working around the clock to figure out what would be a safe way and to file to follow guidelines and protocols that would certainly be in keeping with keeping the the red the school age population as safe as possible and whether um i i'm not uh i have not seen the plan yet but whether it's going to be these split sessions or every other day or certainly smaller class sizes um those are all on the table so stay tuned and i'm confident that that the administrators will will certainly do as best they can given the restrictions the size of our buildings our infrastructure our buildings are older for the most part which presents its own set of challenges um going forward thank you both i think we have time for one more question debbie taffett has been waiting since the very beginning um she had a question about federal tax equity so debbie take it away debbie hi debbie i'm trying to mute you just if you could press the unmute button on your end i think that would do the trick any luck i see debbie's question if yeah do you want to just answer it then go ahead you want to want me to read it to you sure you i'll read it i'll be reading it to all of us read to us i will i will bedtime what can be done to assure that new jersey and the other states that contribute more to the federal tax role than we receive from the federal government don't subsidize those states like arkansas mississippi louisiana alabama et cetera which have enormous deficits and taxes paid to the federal government and funding received yeah um so we all know this new jersey gets the short end of the stick here we're the state that gets the least back from the federal government for the tax dollars we send it you know year to year it varies between like 80 or 90 cents that we get back for every dollar that we send and there are states that get a buck fifty two dollars uh last year the the champion was mitch mcconnell state of kentucky which got about i think two two dollars and forty cents back for every dollar so there's no federal deficit um when it comes to new jersey um could i ask you to hold on one second this may be my dinner arriving at the door one sec should we mute him all right well the congressman is doing that let me remind you all that okay are you downstairs forget it [Laughter] okay i'm gonna go get my order and then i'm gonna add five minutes don't worry i'll answer this question in in full and we get a bonus question or two all right bonus question all right sounds fair give me one minute all right just to remind folks we love your help um with phone banking the field team is trying to be making it's trying to make it as fun and interactive as possible so it's a zoom and then you're making your calls but that way if you've got a question you can quickly turn to one of our field organizers so we'd love your help sign up um also next saturday the 25th is 100 days to election day so we've got a lot of work to do we are going to so sign up on the page to get the updates on what we're doing for the 100 days we're going to be having a big virtual presence we're also hoping to possibly have the congressman out and about but we're gonna see if that's feasible or not so as we all know with covid things change hourly um so we're just waiting for the congressman to get his food and jackie anything new and i just want to say that um i really uh you know we are the outlier in uh in tom malinowski's district and i am grateful that essex county has really really stepped up for testing and for communication and for that you know melbourne has been very very lucky you can get it you can go anywhere in the county any day of the week and and get in a in a drive-in testing and have your results within 72 hours i mean we just had milburn head testing two weeks ago july 2nd we had 300 people it was a drive-through it was a saliva test it was painless it was well organized and i'm just grateful that that essex county has put their resources and and that we as you know we've been particularly uh hammered by the coronavirus is the second worst county in the in the state but essex county has really stepped up and and for that that the leadership of essex county has really served us extremely well all the residents to ensure that testing is is very much uh possible and accessible so just wanted to mention jackie is the turnaround still 72 hours though yes yes yes i i i last and matter of fact i had my test the day before the uh july 2nd and on saturday now yes well i know but that was two that's two weeks ago i'm wondering if it still is i think it's still pretty for our own for our own um yes i think i i believe though okay actually i could ask you maybe we'll talk offline about that but i would love to know like right now if if i'm a resident of milburn and i need to get tested um you could go to one yeah it's monday and friday at wheatquake park and then mobile testing tuesdays and thursdays around um around the county good i just i'd love to i'd love to know what the turnaround is for the results right now okay because all the labs are telling us at least a week i'll get that um okay back to the the the question so yeah there's this huge imbalance now that said you know we're not going to have a lower tax rate you know for some states than in others that's not going to happen number two you know i don't i don't mind subsidizing the education of a child in arkansas i don't mind that we have a military defending us and there's a base in texas or california that um contributes to the economy of those states more than it does some others i don't mind that you know we're we're paying for national parks and national forests in new mexico um where the taxpayers basically own most of the land of those states what i mind is that when my state of new jersey which contributes more to the wealth and genius of america than just about well than any state in the country when we're hit hard by something like the coronavirus and we need help and then representatives and senators from these states that take everything from us say oh no it's a blue state bailout you know then i want to punch somebody right um i don't call it uh whatever you are bail out when we're we're paying to educate your kids i call it americans helping their fellow americans and i want that same attitude from them when we're in trouble or when we need a bridge or tunnel built or when we complain rightly about our salt deductions getting taken away and that's the solution right it's not i mean we're going to pay taxes because you know we're you know relatively wealthy state but i want to make sure that we bring back the infrastructure spending um that we bring back education spending and we bring back the sort of things that would actually help new jersey more and write that imbalance a little bit all right bonus question and this is from sanjeev i'm going to let him ask you sanzibe you should be unmuted hey sanji it looks like you're logged in on three separate accounts is there there i want to i want to say this is actually not me someone else have probably used the same link and in the beginning i saw a comment uh that that i think joyce burtner is under my name maybe she's the one asking the question but anyways hi congressman nice to see you i enjoyed opening up my video here i don't have a choice [Laughter] or sanjeev yes this is sanjiv there's some technical difficulty going on here it's okay all right thanks for joining us i don't if i don't know if it's joyce i don't know if we can figure out how to unmute choice so i will ask it for her because you went and got your dinner we're putting you in the hot seat i think should be the vp choice for joe biden um the vp choice for vice president biden should be i'm not going to give you a name i'm sorry [Laughter] captain america or there we go i know captain america he he interviewed me for a website recently um how's this for a change of subject i think yeah i think the the main criteria this is going to sound very um almost a cliche but it's it bears repeating main criteria should be it's got to be somebody who can be president right away and there's more than one person being discussed i think who needs that but you know joe's got to be confident of that and it's got to be someone who can work well with the president and and then there are a lot of other things to consider but those are the most important things thank you so i just want to i just want to give essex county shout out that it is i i just texted and it is 36 to 48 hours so really for the best results yep yep what lab can what lab are they using you don't have to tell me now but i'll get that information to you thank you okay all right everyone thank you so much i apologize if i didn't get to your question um if

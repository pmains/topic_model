Florida was the epicenter of the explosion of opioid abuse over a decade ago in Florida opioid addiction related deaths increased eighty percent from 2003 to 2009 addiction is cruel ruthless and unforgiving opioid pills prescribed after an injury or to treat chronic pain can too easily drag anyone in pain into the depths of addiction the crackdown on pills has meant turning to street drugs for thousands of Floridians mr. chairman we've used mandatory minimum sentences since 1951 and we boosted penalties through the last three decades of the 20th century at the height of the war on drugs but tough mandatory minimums for drug charges haven't cut off access to drugs in the past and they aren't likely to stop the brutal tide of overdoses that we're facing today I'd like to share a story that I heard from Broward County public defender however Finkelstein just to caution the work of this committee he told me about a 40 year old woman in Broward County Florida who had no criminal record and was unable to work due to a disability she was described by those who knew her as a sweet lady after being pursued multiple times by a confidential informant seeking pills she gave in she sold 35 Laursen pills a blend of Tylenol and hydrocodone to the informant after living 40 years without a criminal record she was sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years in prison does keeping this woman in prison until she is 65 do anything to help her to help her family continue without their mom in the home to help others who were addicted to our or to our society now paying for her incarceration this committee needs to take a close look at the impact of our policing and prosecution policies around the country that do a lot to drive up the numbers of arrests convictions and fill our prisons but may not be helping treat addiction or save lives hyper deadly drugs like fentanyl are finding a way into our communities the rise of these synthetic opioids requires that we meet this challenge on its own terms their extreme potency makes it harder for law enforcement to stop them with a few clicks on the internet there is no longer a need for cartels or street dealers last year Florida passed a law to impose mandatory minimum sentences for possession of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs but evidence shows that boosting punishment is unlikely to stop the spread of these drugs this March I held a roundtable on the opioid crisis with my colleague congresswoman Wasserman Schultz in my district to talk with law enforcement public health officials and families about the response to the needs of our community and what we heard what we heard was that fundamentally addiction is about mental health and to save the lives of those in the grip of addiction we need to get them help not lock them up criminalizing addiction locks people out of our health care system and cuts off a real chance at recovery we need a comprehensive solution and we've delayed too long and giving a comprehensive response through the house to address this crisis we need to focus on broadening access to addiction treatment that would truly save lives instead just over a year ago my Republican colleagues celebrated a vote to overturn Obamacare that would have taken comprehensive coverage from over 20 million people some Republican states including my own state of Florida have failed to expand access to care with federal dollars by expanding Medicaid expansion can allow more than 800,000 Floridians to gain access to comprehensive health coverage that includes mental health and substance abuse treatment as essential benefits it's estimated that 300,000 of those 800,000 Floridians already need some level of care right now and they're struggling to get it but apparently my colleagues who voted for Trump care last year think that we should go the other direction that we should add Medicaid expansion and fundamentally change the program structure it would replace guaranteed funding with a limited account for opioid treatment Tulloch recovery clinic doors to those who desperately need to help it will undermine the emergency response needed to pull up the deep roots of Florida's addiction crisis twelve Floridians are lost everyday to the scourge of addiction it's a public health emergency and treatment can help save the lives of our fellow Floridians mr. Patterson I would just ask you given your experience do you think that broader access to substance abuse and mental health coverage would help people struggling with addiction treatment stay in treatment so we're talking about addicted populations theythey had a couple things combined in there okay the sensing issues put aside I think for for people that are not distributing drugs and and obviously DEA you know doesn't look at a certain level the treatment availability should be there for those that are addicted to drugs I think distribution is a different issue though than what you just talked about thank you very much thank you mister

lawmakers are telling the president they want to say in this drum beat to military action one of them is senator tim kaine he's a democrat from virginia joins us now senator welcome to new day thank you for joining us thank you chris you bet glad to be with you let me ask you do you believe the president can go it alone and make this decision unilaterally or do you believe that this decision triggers the constitutional process of having a congressional vote chris the framers of the constitution created an ambiguity and they understood what they were doing congress has the power to declare war the president's the commander in chief those framers during the debates as early as 1787 understood that there could be emergency circumstances where the president would need to act prior to congressional action but that congress then would have to come in and ratify and approve what the president had done so there are some circumstances where presidents to defend the nation or to avoid a catastrophe can act prior to congressional approval but getting congressional approval is in my view constitutionally required the president has been very prudent about this thus far as you know there's been urgings of the president to intervene militarily more directly in syria before now he's been very prudent about it i think he should continue to be prudent and that would involve uh in-depth consultation with congress answering some of the questions that have been asked the speaker speaker boehner addressed a series of questions to the president today and i hope that that dialogue continues because when you get congress on board you have the best chance of getting the american public's support and you also send those americans and virginians who are asking to fight wars you send them in with the knowledge that the public and the political leadership of the country is fully behind them well we saw the president then senators standing up about this issue and saying that president bush criticizing him saying you should have put this to congress for a vote when he was dealing with iran it came up with iraq do you believe that congress should come back early that there needs to be a vote that the president should not move forward without that authorization from congress chris i definitely believe that there needs to be a vote um whether or not the the congress needs to come back early the inspectors are still on the ground in syria they're not scheduled to complete their report until over the weekend and then they'll issue the report we are scheduled to come back in session a week from monday i think there's ample work that the president can do in consultation with the congressional leadership about this until we're back but i do think we are going to be back soon and it would be completely consistent with the president's prudence up to this point for him to continue to have that dialogue i mean you know again i'm just struck by this as a virginian we are the most connected to the military of any of the states in terms of our veteran population the the soldiers and sailors and airmen and women and marines who are here uh ships from virginia are already deployed potentially to take action we shouldn't ask people to fight war unless they know that they've got the full weight of of our political leadership behind them and the american public supports the mission and that that presidential uh consultation with congress over the next few days i think could be very critical in in reaching a consensus that will then support uh whatever action needs to be taken obviously the issue of consultation versus a contingency meaning that you have to have congressional approval something you'll have to figure out for yourselves but let's talk about what the basis of it would be uh there's been quick movement here since last thursday when we spoke to the president he was unsure about linking chemical attacks to the regime now it seems like that is a certainty to the u s administration but then comes word uh just within the last few minutes that there is concern within the intelligence community that the intelligence showing that the regime was responsible for these chemical attacks is not a slam dunk now slam dunk a little bit of a term of art that's what we heard from then cia director george tenet about wmds in iraq it's a scary phrase uh what does that mean to you that the intelligence may not be a slam dunk that we cannot show in the u.s that the assad regime has sought himself responsible for what was done well chris that's why it really is important to let the un inspectors come continue and complete their work we have our own intelligence the british do and others do as well but let's let the u n inspectors complete their work because you're right congress does need i believe ultimately to weigh in and approve but the real issue is what is the mission use of chemical weapons violates a clear international norm that's been in place since the geneva convention adopted an anti-chemical weapons position after world war one it is completely over the line uh for the uh for a government or any uh uh entity to use chemical weapons and there has to be a consequence for it but let me ask you senator determine let me ask you senator you know because we have to be careful about the language if the ap reporting is right and the intelligent community hasn't connected the call to use chemical weapons to assad himself uh that maybe it was a rogue operation by a member of the regime does it matter to you if that's true does it matter those are absolute those are important factors now look the question of whether it's a rogue element that ordered it or whether it was done in a chain of command i don't think that you had to have assad's signature on the order uh to hold him accountable for it again the use of chemical weapons is a violation of clear international law there has to be a consequence for it if there's no consequence for it we're sending the signal that that international norm now doesn't need to be respected and we in the and humanity will reap the whirlwind if if we don't have a consequence for this but determining the consequence the mixture of of diplomatic economic and military strategies is important and those strategies should be very focused designed to deter and degrade the ability to use chemical weapons in the future senator help me with this if you if the us does what's being bandied about right now and there's some type of punishing action done to the regime but not to topple the regime the rebels fighting against the regime include al qaeda elements right now that's the that's the understanding from the intelligence community wouldn't that then put the united states on the side of al qaeda in this conflict well chris that's why the president has been very prudent over the course of the last couple of years despite calls for intervention it is the case that the opposition probably now is militarily dominated by elements connected with al qaeda and that's why it's been smart to be prudent but the use of chemical weapons there has to be a consequence for that there is some possibility that chemical weapons could be used by the opposition there's been some suggestion that they may have been in the past i don't think the intelligence is good on that but we want to make sure that if the opposition gains control of chemical weapons they don't use them either so the strategy in tandem with our international partners is to deter the use of chemical weapons and to degrade the ability of any party in syria to use those weapons in violation of international law but you believe that you and other members of congress congressional leadership are aware that you may be giving advantage to al-qaeda elements if you go in and damage the regime um you know chris what i've said i'll say it again what we need to do is take a limited action designed to deter the use of chemical weapons either by the assad regime or by the opponents and to degrade the ability of those weapons to be used by any party the this is what is a the changed fact on the ground if that international norm has been violated a norm that's been in place for 90 years and chemical weapons have been used to have there be no consequence for that would be intolerable senator thank you very much for the discussion please come back to us here on new day once you get the information from the president so we can keep the dialogue going for the american people

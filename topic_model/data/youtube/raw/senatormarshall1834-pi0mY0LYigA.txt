for over two years we've been investigating the origins of covid and our efforts have hit many roadblocks frankly it feels like a massive cover-up and we can get the answers we deserve congressman jordan thanks for joining me today good to be with you you know why don't you just give us a little bit of an update on your on your work right now and what you think about this cover up well let me first thank you because you've been uh a leading voice on this and uh you know talking about gain of function and your bill that you've you've got to get rid of that which is which is great um and just as a as a position and someone uh in the united states senate we appreciate your leadership um i think what's interesting today is we just had a select committee there's there's one select committee in the congress on coronavirus been in existence now for a couple years and we just had a hearing today uh the whip in the house mr clyburn is the chairman of the committee and our whip steve scalise is is the ranking member we had a hearing today and and it was dr wolinski uh dr murthy so you got the head of the cdc you got the surgeon general but no fauci i found it interesting that you know fauci we you couldn't go a day without seeing him in the news somewhere and what time made him uh a guardian of the year and now he won't show up and we invited him to come so um it's been now almost a year and fauci since he's last testified in front of the house so i find that interesting in this this whole investigation but the key is we know um or we're convinced that dr fauci dr collins and others knew right from the get-go that this thing most likely came from a lab and i think they took they took real concerted steps to make sure the country didn't get that information and i think you could almost say um try to conceal that tamp that down and frankly attack people we've seen some emails where they said we're going to take down this these these other physicians and virologists who said something different and who said they should do different things so i think i think the key factor in my mind is you and i have talked about the senator is they knew right away they knew right away or they suspected right away that this thing came from a lab and because i think they they were concerned about what that meant and the money that was going to that lab they tried to conceal it i want to go back and talk a bit more about the significance of the february 1st 2020 meeting led by dr fauci and nih head dr francis collins these scientists who in january 2020 described in emails and public statements there was a significant chance covid was made and leaked from a lab in wuhan china these same scientists suddenly flip-flopped and co-authored articles in respected journals like lancet and nature and oh by the way the national media jumped on those publications to chastise independent thinkers and big tech used than censored any of those who questioned dr fauci congressman jordan why why did these scientists flip-flop in just a matter of days they said you know when january said there's a significant chance that this could have came from a lab within days they flip flop say there's no chance it could have came from a laboratory matter i think in in four days time and in the intervening event was that that that meeting on february 1st so january 31st 2020 so more than two years ago dr fauci at 10 32 p.m that evening gets an email from dr christian anderson one of these virologists around the world well respected yeah well respected but we've been receiving our tax dollars your constituent my constituent our the american uh taxpayers money to do research and and and different things so he dr anderson sends an email to dr falchi 10 32 pm january 31st 2020 email says virus looks engineered virus is not consistent with evolutionary theory that is a fancy way of saying this thing probably came from a lab so what does dr fauci do he starts emailing his top assistant austin close dr oshkosh has worked with him for 15 years emails him at midnight email someone else at two in the morning he goes into full tilt in my judgment full till cover your backside mode next day he organizes the meeting you talked about this conference call where it's dr fauci dr collins and 11 virologists including christian anderson who sent him the initial email and also on that caller dr gary and the the readouts and the emails we've now gotten via foia and everything else that we've been able to look at the emails we've now looked at they showed that the consensus on that call was this thing probably came from a lab the one that stands out was there was a email after the call a few hours after the call from dr gary to some of the other doctors on on the conference call and he says in an email says i don't know how this happens in nature it would be easy to do in a lab so that's the consensus on the call it's pretty clear and then within a matter of days as you said senator a matter of days they changed their position and it's just like what what caused seems to me the only thing that really sort of happened was this conference call that fauci and collins are so eager to do after that initial email on the 31st of january at 10 32 p.m from dr anderson and then as you point out they do they do the article in nature medicine magazine that becomes then the article that gets cited in the lancet um uh and then that becomes the gospel that this didn't come from a lab and we go with sort of that narrative and anyone who smart people like you who are physicians start questioning no no no you're crazy they all say and they they do a takedown on people who who disagree with them um and they push it and then of course the end of the story is in may of 2020 so a few months later dr anderson and dr gary get an 8.9 million dollar grant from the american taxpayers that dr fauci and dr collins control and decide who gets that money jim we're hoping that you have a gavel back in your hand come next year and could you imagine getting to ask the people that attended this secret call and asking them what they what they talked about and why why can't we get a readout of that particular meeting would that be standard for there to be some type of readout of this well one of the things we've done is we're we're putting those 11 virologists on notice and you're thinking like a good oversight person should and like a legislator should um those are the first people you want to talk to you want to talk to the 11 guys on that call and you want to find out what what exactly did happen we've seen the emails and the correspondence after the call subsequent to the call but what all what all happened and there's a whole series of questions we want to ask them and we want to find out what exactly dr fauci and dr collins may have had to say on that on that particular phone call so yeah that's how you start investigations you don't you don't bring in fouchy for a deposition right away you start by looking at these folks who are on the call get all the documents you can unredacted form so that's something that needs to happen i'm hoping the senate is going to be in republican hands we're hoping the house is going to be that way as well and we're already talking about joint type of investigation we can do because the country deserves the truth here's the key i mean we want to know how this happened we want to we want to pass your legislation make sure that that comes along we'll see if joe biden would sign it but we got to think about what they did to our first amendment liberties over the last year i mean i tell people every talk i give around the country or in our district every right we enjoy as americans under the first amendment your right to practice your faith your right to assemble right to petition your government freedom of press freedom of speech every single one has been assaulted by the left democrat mayors democrat governors members democrats here in congress so that's why this is also critically important why we need to get to the truth and then of course we never want this kind of thing to happen again i'm not sure what you're hearing back home but kansans are mad as heck about losing our civil liberties and they're ready to fight yep well said and they and well they should be i mean we're and there was a memo that the the attorney general put out uh when this first started in april 2020 attorney general barr and he said in that memorandum that went out to u.s attorneys across the country he said the constitution is not suspended during a crisis an amen to that and i would actually say that in fact is when it's most important when times are tough is when when the rules and the fundamentals and and the principles that make us the greatest country ever that's when they count the most and what we saw was democrats run roughshod over the first amendment over the constitution and that's why kansans and ohioans are ticked about it i think if you're going to understand the story and the cover-up you have to know who eco health alliance is so eco health alliance is a u.s based non-profit non-government organization led by peter dassen yeah and if i could get one witness yeah it would be peter peter dasic but but eco health uh is is a go-between they they specialize in in researching emerging infections they budget 10 to 15 million dollars a year from our taxpayers dollars from dr fauci from the department of defense from dhs and they often function as a conduit a go-between so what's in this particular case is so vitally important to understand is dr fauci gave money to peter dasic and eco health who gave the money to the wuhan institute of virology dr xi and that's the story here we studied genetics a little bit in medical school but but just like fingerprints every organism has a unique set of dna it's like the blueprint for that particular organism it's what makes your eyes brown and your and your your hair hair brown it makes you a higher proceeding your hair gray in the in our case as well but each one of us have a very unique blueprint these dna sequences tell a story of your family so i could look at your grandparents dna your cousin's dna and i could find the similarity and this information is so valuable when a scientist studies an organism they store that exact sequence in the special dna in a genomic lag bank now as you can imagine dr she uh she's the bat lady of this story at the wuhan institute of virology had a computer bank full of dna sequences from bat chronoviruses she was the expert in the world on back chronoviruses any back chronovirus for the past 40 years dr xi had it in the baltimores but suspiciously as we found out in september of 2019 september 2019 four months before you and i even heard of the word covet virus she took down her genomic lab bank so that's very significant that's another reason we think that this outbreak probably actually started in august or september of 2019 now additionally the wuhan institute of brology was storing similar data of dna sequences in a lab bank at the nih she was able to get those taken down with the united states nh's blessing in 2020. this is all data that you and i would have loved to have seen we would think that if if we could find the grandfather of covid the cousin of covin that we would be able to trace it to that laboratory they had the opportunity if they would show us that data they could prove their innocence or it might prove their guilt u.s lawmakers want more answers too with ranking members of the house oversight and judiciary committees republicans in recent days asking president biden's hhs secretary for greater access to dr fauci and nih emails and notes from the earliest days of the pandemic jim again you've done many of these investigations this is probably my first major one i can't believe how hard it is to get simple information from the government uh an unredacted email uh readouts on phone calls has it always been this hard what how are you guys doing over there yes it has uh and what the one of the frustrating things is you know we do letters after letter you've sent letters to uh different agencies on on different subjects but on this this particular one you know as you were talking cdc we're talking other other hhs and places you've sent but it seems that the people who do the foias on the outside actually get the information before we do uh which is frustrating we're an equal separate equal branch of government in fact you know the founders put together the constitution the first branch they talk about the legislative branch so um it is it is it is frustrating um frustrating to see that uh so yeah i i we've seen it when we did when the irs and death you know when they were the irs was targeting people we saw it in the whole trump russia stuff the russia russia russia as president trump says and of course we're we're seeing it here we actually had one of our staffers on the oversight committee and also on the select committee on coronavirus go to um had to go to the hhs into the room and and copy those some of those emails we were just talking about from the um that february first conference call emails subsequent to that call about the call itself i had to go and just copy those down because they wouldn't give them to us for goodness sake so yeah it's it's always frustrating but the truth is it you just got to keep pressing because the folks back home want the truth they don't want this to happen again they like we said before they're concerned about what happened to the rights so um you just got to keep going and then i think there'll be a whistleblower there'll be someone come we've had whistleblower come forward on this um right on this this issue of uh the justice department targeting moms and dads and school boards who show up at school where me treating parents as domestic terrorists we had a whistleblower from the fbi come forward there so i think that will happen as as we get if we take back the majority we get an investigation like you and i want to um i think you'll have someone come forward and start to give us more information i do too and i think that there's going to be a scientist especially that's going to sit there and say oh my gosh what have we done congressman jordan when i go back home one of the most common questions i get is why why would dr fauci want to cover this up what's his motivation you know you're investigating a crime usually there's a there's a motivation what what's going on yeah here today no great question what's the motive uh i think the motive is dr fauci and dr collins controlled this called a fiefdom call it whatever you want but they control this this the grant money that goes out millions billions billions of dollars that goes out and they're in control of that and they did not want to have this this this black mark this this problem on their record um you know when you're handing out money like that and you're that you're the guy in charge and you can control what kind of research and change that study if you want to get this money kind of thing and then you have a a a virus a deadly virus on the loose from china in in likely comes from a lab where you're doing research on coronavirus and a lab where our tax dollars went to i mean think about it you've got three key facts there uh because because patchy sort of denied all these at the front end but it sure looks like they're all actually true um looks like they were doing gain of function research there looks like our tax dollars went there eco health dollars to eco health to the wuhan institute of virology lab and and it looks like that's where the virus started so you got a deadly virus on the loose and you find out on january 31 2020 that it looks like it came from the lab and oh by the way american tax dollars were gone there and it was gain a function research looks like that's a concern and so let's downplay that as quick as we can and i think that's was what put him into his you know the old cover your backside mode that he instantly went into uh there on january thirty first and february first yeah i think we can't stress enough about power corrupting absolutely dr fauci's been there for some 40 years he literally controls i think it's five or ten billion dollars a year eco health all these scientists every year depended on upon him giving each one of them million dollars of each year creating this conflict of interest i think i think two i think they're like 30 some thousand employees when you look at cdc and nih i think it's like 30 some thousand employees and i think it's in the neighborhood of like 50 some billion dollars and and the thing i come back to is guess how many real studies on natural immunity they've done you know zero but but oh we're gonna we're gonna fund with american tax dollars a lab in china i mean one of the first questions i would ask is we shouldn't be doing gain of function research and again you've been the lead on that uh and you're you're so right but also why are we funding research in china at the beginning we don't have great universities great labs here in the united states for goodness sake so all of that's scary uh and then it happens and you're like shazam dr pat's like we got to do something let's down play it and you know just even recently we're doing some type of bio research in ukraine and i don't know how much fire is there with that smoke but it is very frustrating to me to see taxpayer dollars doing this research out of the nation and you've got to sit there and think is it so dangerous we can't do it here or why are they doing it someplace else i i've asked the same questions and it shouldn't happen again if the american people put us in charge and we have the majorities in the house and senate we should pass your bill we should say we're not going to be funding stuff in in communist china for goodness sake and in some other places around the world let's bring it home here i i compare this to like doing nuclear research with iran that's what we were doing with china compares good comparison jim take us into the oval office in january of 2020 if dr fauci had come clean at that moment he walks into the oval offices president trump uh there's a there's a virus out there this could become a pandemic and oh by the way this virus maybe was made in a lab so all bets are off you're going to ask me what's this virus going to do and my answer is going to be i don't know we've never seen a virus like this before do you think that president trump would have responded any differently well the short answer is we don't know but what we do know is dr factor should have told him i mean he didn't even tell him that that that there was american tax dollars going to to the lab so um the idea that you you go back to january 31st at 10 32 pm he gets that email and he's like oh sugar look at this email this this is we got a deadly virus on the loose we got a lab in in in in china that got our tax dollars maybe gain a function and it looks like it came from the lab according to one of the virologists that i've had enough confidence in to give millions of american tax dollars to that's his first his first call shouldn't have been to his top assistant shouldn't have been to uh that i forget he had he had an email at two in the morning to someone um so he should have got on the phone and called the president or certainly the next day say hey mr president commander-in-chief uh i need to i need to let you in on something or if you didn't want to give potentially bad news which that certainly seems to be pretty darn bad news if you didn't want to you know the bearer or bad news as you say call the chief of staff you and i know mark meadows right call mark meadows call the chief of staff because i mean call him up and say he worked with mark meadows and dr fauci was running this task force or call the vice president who was going to be in a few weeks named as the head of the task force call someone he didn't do that he got he organized a conference call with 11 virologists and him and dr collins who control this fiefdom and all the money and power that you talked about senator they said we're going to handle it this way we're going to cover it up that's what i think happened i think the evidence points in that direction but you're that is such a good question he should have let the commander-in-chief after all this is in china this is not in like some you know 190 some countries whatever there are in the world this is not this is a pretty important adversary pretty important country that we're talking about uh he should let the president know jim we've been at this for two years trying to figure out the the origin of covid you and i feel like there was a cover-up make your case to america what's your what are your final thoughts well the first thing i would say is just sort of step back in a in a broad sense and and remember just about everything the bite administration and dr fauci told us turned out to not be true right i mean joe biden when he came into office he said i got a plan he obviously didn't i mean it's been a disaster he told us there would never i will never put a mandate uh for a vaccine well he did so much so that the supreme court had to tell him it was unconstitutional dr patchy said it didn't come from a lab it wasn't gain of function we didn't pay for it all three of those things look like they're false they told us the vaccinated can't get it they told us that the vaccinated can't transmit it both of those turned out to be wrong they basically told us in different words uh forget about natural immunity that doesn't count we all know it does and then they told us mass work and then of course fauci said zero mass one mass two mask no mass one mass two masks back to one now we're back to zero i mean he's been you so i i think you start from there like and and then it's pushed by the administration i mean jin saki said we're working with social media platforms to limit the information americans i'm like talk about an attack on the first amendment right it's exploding yeah i mean like from the white house press room you're making a statement saying we're going to limit the press it's it's frightening so you you start from that then you get into the specifics which we touched on he knew from the get-go from that initial email in late january then the conference call they get people to change their positions they get them to write the paper pouchy gets a chance to edit that paper that paper then gets cited in the lancet which becomes the gospel for them to tell tell the whole world that oh no no it didn't come from a lab it was a bat to a pangolin to a hippopotamus to joe rogan and then you know millions of people i mean it's like well do they think we're all stupid you know we you and i might be in flyover country but the folks we represent smart people with a lot of common sense and they figure it out so that's the case you make and when you do that and you you let people know some of those key facts that you know and then you add in you get to add in the science which i don't you know understand the country gets it they know that they were misled and that's why again to get to the bottom of it to make sure that there's truth out there so we can protect people's fundamental first amendment liberties and hopefully prevent this from happening again and save people's lives you know that's why we do it there you go jim thanks for you bet thank you senator keep up the good work you

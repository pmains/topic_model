honor to welcome to the stage to the podium congressman rodney davis let's show appreciation thank you thank you thanks everyone just so you know i did come here to try and grow a beard as nice as riches clearly even from the front row you can tell it's not as nice so i just really appreciate being able to speak to the farm bureau members again and i i look around and i see some of the folks in in my district i see a lot of friends a lot of folks that helped us actually craft two farm bills in my time in congress farm bills that have given us great policies farm bills that have used the private sector to help us reduce the amount of money that we actually spend in washington dc and there are attacks all the time there are attacks all the time on the programs that each and every one of you and the illinois farm bureau worked with me on on things like crop insurance crop insurance is a private public-private partnership that works to reduce the amount of taxpayer dollars that we spend responding to disasters in the ag industry right why in the world would our colleagues attack it i don't know but it's that balanced approach that you all taught me when i first got elected nine years ago and got a seat on the house ag committee that we still continue to take to dc today but that fight that fight sometimes was with republicans and democrats when it came to the ag sector now the fight right now is with the biden administration it's with nancy pelosi it's with chuck schumer just when i thought the ag economy couldn't be hit any harder what we see here president biden and speaker pelosi and leader schumer's attack on each of you through their build back broke program this is a reckless tax scheme and it's going to destroy some of the good agricultural policies that we put in place democrats they know how unpopular this buildback broke program is because and while the tax provisions uh were recently pulled from the house bill they still haven't outright abandoned their plan to bankrupt our country with the changes in stepped-up bases and also the estate tax these were changes that we negotiated with president trump with the trump tax cuts and oh by the way for those of you who heard a lot of commercials against me saying that i only cut taxes to benefit the wealthy i think the irs just put out something this week that said you know the majority of our trump tax cuts went to the middle class families in this country that's each of you give yourselves a round of applause for that thank you for helping us pass that [Applause] you know this buildback broke program combined with the constant attack on on the ag industry and each of you and what you do with reinstituting the new reinstituting the wotus rules that president trump helped us pull back these are the types of issues that we're going to continue to fight in washington as republicans from the great state of illinois this fight's not going to end when we take the majority back in on january 3rd of 2023 we're going to have to continue to get the support of each and every one of you to make sure that we don't put a partisan litmus test on the on the fight that we have let's put a right and wrong litmus test on what they're trying to do to what you do every day to feed your families and frankly and you don't get enough credit for it what you do to feed the rest of the world we've got issues with infrastructure in this country we need to rebuild our locks and dance i was really proud to see the first investment in the locks and the lock and dam system along the illinois mississippi river come from president trump at a time when i served under a different administration while in congress we saw zero dollars dedicated towards actually rebuilding and renewing our locks and dams along the illinois and mississippi rivers locks and dams that allow you the ability to get your crops and get your products out in the global marketplace i was really proud when then omb director at the time before he was chief of staff mick mulvaney called me and said they're going to invest in lagrange and you know what i made him talk tell me twice just so i heard it right but we've seen that update we've seen that upgrade and we've seen what an investment in our infrastructure like that can do but we need promises and this administration has given us zero promises that they're going to use any of the trillions of dollars that they now have at their disposal to in to actually implement the changes in the upgrades we need on the mississippi and illinois rivers and frankly if you look back at some of the same people who were in the administe in the previous administration the previous previous administration not the trump administration they're the same ones that are back now didn't invest a single dollar in doing what all of us in this room knew was the right thing to do you know we've also got to do what we can to hold the administration accountable on the house agriculture committee through our oversight responsibilities while i certainly wish sonny perdue was back as a secretary of ag he hands down was my favorite cabinet secretary that i had a chance to work with in my career in congress this is a guy who said what he he said what he was going to do and he did it he helped us lead this country through a pandemic he helped each and every one of you be able to be sure that you were going to continue to provide the food and the fiber that's necessary to feed this great country and feed this great world now we've got a fight on our hands when it comes to things like pesticide registration that i helped lead the fight in the last farm bill we're going to continue to fight the far left priorities of this administration and frankly we're going to fight the far left priorities of speaker pelosi and the house ag committee we're doing now united we're doing that together and that's what i need and that's what i ask from each and every one of you in this room as we move forward to fight for you and to fight for what's best for illinois agricultural economy we need you to continue to stand up as the illinois farm bureau make your voice heard make sure that you are a loud voice in this state and do not be bullied by those who are in charge in state government do not be bullied by those who are in charge in the federal government stand strong for what we know and what we all believe is working and will work way into the future thank each and every one of you may god continue to bless you and your families and may god continue to bless the greatest nation in the history of the world the united states of america thank you you

and I recognize the gentlelady from Ohio where I enjoyed my weekend just south of your district very much and for a michigander to say that about Ohio that's pretty special I thank you very much mr. chairman come anytime thank you I thank you all for your testimony today clearly there's one thing we agree on and that is that the Fair Labor Standards Act is outdated and is in need of updating I also agree that we need to look at what the purpose of the bill is and that is to be sure that we don't leave behind the very people the law was intended to protect which are the American worker now mr. Koretz want to be clear on something that you said you indicated that oftentimes when the investigation is completed they come and give you kind of a take-it-or-leave-it right now now if in fact that's the case I'm with you I don't agree that that's appropriate but I do want to be clear on this the investigator does not determine whether an employer has legal counselor not do that the investigator does not determine in these the strictest sense what they are doing is encouraging well no no that's not my question okay the question is they don't determine it the employer determines whether they have legal counsel internet that is correctly oh thank you thank you thank you thank you mr. Richardson I will have to admit that I've eaten many too many of those when I was in college at Ohio State we appreciate your patronage thankies having Ohio let me say that first but let me ask this question what is the average salary of your managers and how many hours do they work on average for our general managers they work on average about 40 hours we think it's important to have work like a general manager the level below that 10 the level below that yes um for those team members who've been with us a bit longer they're working somewhere between 35 and 40 hours for the most part we have with new hires they start out as part time so that's below 30 hours now and so with those who are below 30 their hope is to be able to be available and be able to get the full time but my question is what is the salary and on average how many ours do they work oh sure okay so you're talking about not our general managers but our hourly team members correct the average hourly team member at White Castle makes close to ten dollars per hour is that close to like eight or is it no no no nine dollars and seventeen cents somewhere in there it's about thirty-eight percent ahead of the federal minimum wage okay now tell me at what level do you not think it appropriate that they should receive over time when you're talking about the general managers or anybody just pick anybody well for our team members it's about work-life balance so our focus as a people focused business and happy employees making happy customers is to really meet them where they are the biggest but I need that the answer sure let me just share the one part that shapes it because each person's choices are different we offer a lot of flexibility that that can that can shape that pretty dramatically thank you so much mr. Harris let's go back to the compound proposal I'm a former mayor so I worked in the public sector I understand calm time very very well please explain again for me why you think it is not appropriate for the change that the house is talking about to be in law please explain it for me again I'll do it really quickly because there's a long discussion I think first is the myth that the FLSA is perfectly inflexible is just that it's a myth there's a great deal of flexibility the difference between the comp time proposals in the FLSA is that with the flexibility workers get paid less under the comp time proposals and more under the FLSA so if you're concerned about wage stagnation if you're concerned about income inequality the compound proposals are the wrong way to go the second is workers don't need time or money they need time and money and i think that the premise of the bill that they should have to buy over time from by time off from their employers by sacrificing their overtime pay in addition to be morally dubious is really problematic as an economic matter and as a matter of where we are our country and then and finally I would say as I said before in response to the ranking members question I don't think that workers get the deal that they're being a promise because employers still control the comp time in large part thank you very much and just let me say lastly I understand that there's some issues with the investigation I'm going to look into that to see what's happening with that but I do know this one thing you wouldn't have an investigation if you didn't break the law thank you very much I yield back mr. chairman

THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE. MR. CARPER: THANKS SO MUCH. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF TWO U.S. POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNOR NOMINEES THAT ARE BEFORE THE SENATE THIS AFTERNOON AS WELL AS A THIRD NOMINEE UNDER CONSIDERATION LATER THIS MONTH. LIKE OUR PRESIDING OFFICER, I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING OUR COUNTRY IN TIME OF WAR, IN TIME OF PEACE, THREE TOURS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, A GOOD DEAL OF TIME IN THE COLD WAR. AFTER THAT, MY DAD MANY YEARS IN THE NAVY AND MY UNCLE, MY MOM'S YOUNGEST BROTHER WAS A -- AN ENLISTED MAN, THIRD-CLASS PETTY OFFICER ON HIS AIRCRAFT IN 1944, THE U.S.S. KAMIKAZE ATTACK, NEVER RECOVERED. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO MY UNCLE, TO MY DAD, TO MYSELF, WHEN WE WOULD RECEIVE MAIL. WHETHER IT WAS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, WHETHER MY UNCLE WAS DEPLOYED ON HIS AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR MY DAD DEPLOYED AROUND THE WORLD, HOW IMPORTANT TO ME IT WAS, POSTAL SERVICE. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THE POSTAL SERVICE WAS TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED LAST FALL IN MULTIPLE ELECTIONS, IN STATE ELECTIONS, IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. MORE THAN EVER, EVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE IS IRRELEVANT, NOT SOMETHING WE NEED. ASK THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED NOT JUST THEIR MAIL TODAY, NOT JUST THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE ORDERED TO COME AND DELIVERED BY THE POSTAL SERVICE, ALL KINDS OF STUFF, BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE MEDICINE, WHETHER THEY ARE VETERANS OR OTHER PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. THE POSTAL SERVICE TODAY HAS A PROFOUNDLY CHALLENGING YEAR -- HAS HAD A PROFOUNDLY CHALLENGING YEAR. A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, DRASTIC REFORMS ARE MADE WITHOUT FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SERVICE, AND A BUSY HOLIDAY SEASON CREATED TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES FOR THIS VENERABLE INSTITUTION. DELAYS IN MAIL AND PACKAGE DELIVERY INCREASED LAST YEAR WHILE EMPLOYEES STRUGGLED WITH THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. AT A TIME WHEN RELIANCE ON MAIL AND PACKAGE DELIVERY WAS PERHAPS HIGHER THAN EVER, THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE STRUGGLED TO DELIVER MAIL AND PACKAGES IN A TIMELY AND A PREDICTABLE WAY. DELAYS IN THE MAIL SERVICE HAVE REAL-WORLD IMPACTS. MR. PRESIDENT, IN COMMUNITIES LARGE AND SMALL. IN DELAWARE, VETERANS OF OUR ARMED FORCES HAD TO WAIT LONGER FOR LIFESAVING MEDICATIONS AND DELAYED PACKAGES. OUR DELAWARE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION HAS HEARD FROM LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CONSTITUENTS FROM ONE END OF OUR STATE TO THE OTHERS OF MISSED PAYCHECKS, CREDIT CARD BILLS, AND COURT NOTICES. MOM AND POP SHOPS IN MY STATE AND I GUESS IN ARIZONA, THE HOME OF OUR PRESIDING OFFICER, MAY HAVE SUFFERED FROM DELAYS THAT MOM AND POP SHOPS IN MY STATE AND ACROSS THE -- ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE SUFFERED. FROM DELAYED DELIVERIES OF IMPORTANT SUPPLIES TO RUN THEIR BUSINESSES. TO SUSTAIN BUSINESSES. LISTEN TO THIS. MANY POULTRY FARMERS, PARTICULARLY IN MORE RURAL PARTS OF DELAWARE, DEL MARVA, WERE SHOCKED TO FIND THAT BABY CHICKS HAD DIED IN THE COURSE OF DELAYED POSTAL DELIVERIES TO THEIR FARMS. THESE IMPACTS ARE UNACCEPTABLE. THEY WERE DRIVEN BY THE PANDEMIC AND BY MISGUIDED DECISIONS LARGELY MADE AT THE VERY TOP OF THE POSTAL SERVICE. FOR POSTMASTER GENERAL DEJOY RELEASED IN MARCH A TEN-YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN THAT DOESN'T DO ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES BEING FACED RIGHT NOW AT THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE. THE PLAN LIMITS OPERATING HOURS AND LOWERS SERVICE STANDARDS WHICH WOULD HARM MANY SENIORS AND RURAL DELAWAREANS UP AND DOWN OUR STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IF IMPLEMENTED, SUCH A PLAN WOULD MAKE IT HARDER, NOT EASIER, TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE POSTAL SERVICE. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY. BY SELECTING THESE NOMINEES FOR THE POSTAL SERVICE'S BOARD OF GOVERNORS, IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN RECOGNIZES THE DIRE NEED TO GET THE POSTAL SERVICE BACK TO ITS CORE MISSION OR MISSIONS. RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE AND ON-TIME MAIL DELIVERY SERVICE FOR AMERICANS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THESE WELL-QUALIFIED NOMINEES -- AND THEY ARE WELL-QUALIFIED NOMINEES -- ALSO MAKE CLEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN'S DESIRE TO DRIVE INNOVATION AT THE POSTAL SERVICE THAT CAN KEEP COSTS LOW WHILE BOOSTING REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES AND PROTECTING THE LIVELIHOODS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK TIRELESSLY TO DELIVER OUR MAIL. RON STROMAN WHO I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING FOR MORE THAN A DECADE IS HIMSELF A FORMER DEPUTY POSTMASTER GENERAL, A ROLE HE SERVED IN FROM 2011 TO 2020. A LONG-TIME FEDERAL SERVANT -- AND HE IS A SERVANT. MR. STROMAN HAS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS INSTITUTION OF HOW TO MAKE LONG-LASTING AND POSITIVE CHANGES IN LARGE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE. AMBER McREYNOLDS. SHE IS CURRENTLY THE C.E.O. FOR THE NATIONAL HOME INSTITUTE AND COALITION. THEY MAKE IT EASIER FOR AMERICANS TO VOTE SCURRILE, TO VOTE SAFELY, AND TO VOTE CONVENIENTLY. DELIVERING BALLOTS BY MAIL IS ONE OF THOSE SOLEMN OBLIGATIONS THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS. IT'S THE UNDERPINNING OF OUR DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND FINALLY, MR. ANTON HAJJAR IS THE THIRD NOMINEE WHOSE NOMINATION WE ARE CONSIDERING LATER IN THIS WORK PERIOD, NOT TODAY. BUT MR. HAJJAR IS THE FORMER GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE AMERICAN POSTAL WORKERS UNION, AFL-CIO, WHERE HE FOUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MAIL CARRIERS AND OTHER POSTAL EMPLOYEES GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY DESERVE. AT A HEARING THAT WE HAD LAST MONTH IN THE HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, MR. PRESIDENT, I WAS THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED WITH EACH OF THESE NEAMS AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEEDS OF THE POSTAL SERVICE -- OF THESE NOMINEES AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEEDS OF THE POSTAL SERVICE. ALL OF THESE NOMINEES EXHIBIT THE PROFESSIONALISM, THE EXPERTISE, THE LEADERSHIP, AND THE COMMITMENT, THE COMMITMENT THAT WE NEED AT THE POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. THINK OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS ALMOST LIKE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR A COMPANY. THEY DON'T RUN THE POSTAL SERVICE EVERY DAY, BUT THEY HELP SET THE TONE, POLICIES, AND OVERSEE THE OPERATION. FURTHER, EACH OF THESE THREE NOMINEES AGREE THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD. THE POSTAL SERVICE IS CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF A ONCE IN A LIFETIME UPDATE TO THE POSTAL DELIVERY VEHICLE, WHICH IS -- WITH THE PRIME OPPORTUNITY TO BE A LEADER IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. THE POSTAL SERVICE WILL REPLACE UP TO 165,000 VEHICLES. EVERY NOW AND THEN -- WE SEE POSTAL VEHICLES PROBABLY EVERY DAY. YOU PROBABLY LOOK AT THEM SOMETIMES AND THINK THAT LOOKS LIKE AN OLD VEHICLE. THE REASON WHY IT LOOKS LIKE AN OLD VEHICLE IS BECAUSE IT IS. MANY OF THEM ARE OVER 25 YEARS OLD. THEY RUN ON GASOLINE, THEY RUN ON DIESEL, THEY POLLUTE, AND THEY BREAK DOWN. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO REPLACE THEM WITH A NEW FLEET OF LOW-EMISSION OR NO-EMISSION VEHICLES POWERED BY BATTERY, OR POWERED BY HYDROGEN WITH FUEL CELLS. THE NOMINEES WE ARE CONSIDERING TODAY AND LATER THIS MONTH ALSO AGREE THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO WORK WITH CONGRESS TO ENACT IMPORTANT POSTAL REFORM LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD HELP THE AGENCY SAVE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. HOW MIGHT THAT HAPPEN? ONE, BY BETTER INTEGRATING POSTAL RETIREES' HEALTH CARE WITH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND BY REPEALING A BURDENSOME RETIREE HEALTH BENEFIT OBLIGATION. MOST OTHER LARGE COMPANIES DON'. I OFTEN REFER TO A SAYING MADE POPULAR BY ALBERT ANNE STEIN. I'M NOT SMART LIKE ALBERT EINSTEIN, BUT I'M SMART ENOUGH TO QUOTE ALBERT EINSTEIN. ALBERT EINSTEIN USED TO SAY IN ADVERSITY LIES OPPORTUNITY. THINK OF THAT. IN THE BIBLE, IT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE IN ALL THINGS GIVE THANKS. I THINK IT WAS HENRY FORD WHO SAID IF YOU THINK YOU CAN OR YOU THINK YOU CAN'T, YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT EINSTEIN SAID IN ADVERSITY LIES OPPORTUNITY. THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS FACED CONSIDERABLE ADVERSITY OVER THE LAST DECADE OR TWO. THIS HAS BEEN PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT STRETCHES IN HIS LONG AND STORIED HISTORY. THE POSTAL SERVICE WAS ACTUALLY NOT AN IDEA THAT SOMEBODY DREAMED UP 30, 40, 60 YEARS AGO. IT'S IN OUR CONSTITUTION. THE FIRST POSTMASTER GENERAL WAS A GUY NAMED BEN FRANKLIN. AFTER THAT STORIED HISTORY, WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FACING THE ADVERSITY THE POSTAL SERVICE FACES TODAY, AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFIRM THREE WELL-QUALIFIED POSTAL BOARD OF GOVERNORS, PUBLIC SERVANTS AT THEIR HEART WHO WILL BE READY ON DAY ONE, NOT A MONTH FROM NOW, NOT A YEAR FROM NOW, BUT DAY ONE TO ENSURE THAT THIS INVALUABLE INSTITUTION IS ABLE TO MEET ITS VITAL MISSION. I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THEM, PROUD TO SAY I KNOW THEM, AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THEM AS WELL. LATER TODAY -- TWO OF THEM LATER TODAY. ANOTHER ONE PROBABLY LATER THIS -- THIS MONTH. MR. PRESIDENT, WITH THAT, I

hi I'm congressman Brad Snyder I hope as you see this you and your loved ones are safe and well over the last three months the k√∂ppen 19 pandemic has rocked the world like a global earthquake as we actively strive to be back the virus and deal with its consequences we must not lose sight of the ongoing epidemic of gun violence that continues to claim thousands of lives each year across our country including here in the Chicagoland area June is gun violence Awareness Month this is a time set aside for extra reflection and a call to action we must hold fast to the memories of each life senses obsess Leslie cut short to the immeasurable loss to their families to their communities and to our nation as a whole and we must raise our voices to demand that Congress and in particular the Senate finally pass legislation to stop the bloodshed every day an average of 96 people die from gun violence in America including 8 children and teens the United States has 5% of the world's population but we have more than 30% of the world's mass shootings it doesn't have to be this way we can and must change the reality with concrete steps steps that are supported by the vast majority of the American people and that respect the Second Amendment because if we truly want to honor the memory of those lost we need to take action to prevent future violence in the house we've already taken several significant steps On January 8th of last year I helped introduce HR 8 to institute universal background checks and HR 1112 to close the Charleston loophole to stop guns from ending up in the hands of dangerous individuals both these bills promptly move through the Judiciary Committee and then passed the House a year ago February with bipartisan support it is stunning that despite an immense public support despite the daily tools of lives cut short the Senate after more than a year still refuses to act one reason is the inordinate influence of the gun lobby on political process personally I've taken the fight directly to the NRA working in Congress to hold them accountable for abusing our tax code gutting Violence Prevention Month Gun Violence Prevention Month gives us the chance to raise our voice it's a reminder to all our political leaders of the terrible tragic cost of inaction on making our communities our schools our houses of worship the safe places they should be I hope you'll join me in committing to fight for common-sense gun-safety reform this month and throughout the year thank you

madam Speaker we've heard my Democratic colleagues say that passing the Equal Rights Amendment is necessary to secure basic rights under the law for women not only is this untrue it obscures a fundamental fact this er a-actually denies the most basic human right the right to life this er a uses gender equality as a smokescreen to create an unlimited constitutional right to abortion instead of working to craft legislation that protects women's rights without trampling on the right to life Democrats have put forward today an unconstitutional partisan measure not only with this result in Adam on demand abortions across all 50 states but also clear the way to provide taxpayer-funded abortions throughout all nine months of pregnancy costing millions of dollars every year this measure is not above Advaita about advancing women's rights especially as women across the country Republicans and Democrats alike are increasingly horrified by the practice of late term abortion and by recent comments made in New York in Virginia that life-saving treatment should be denied to some newborns allowing women to discard their unborn children at taxpayer expense is not ensuring gender equality it is not protecting women it is not empowering women it is not providing women equal pay for equal work it's simply another step down the path of devaluing all human life and dignity I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote no on this measure and I yield back

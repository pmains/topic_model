hi I'm Congressman Troy Carter Hurricane Katrina made landfall almost 18 years ago devastating families and whole communities the road home was started shortly after to provide relief to louisianans the program started with good intentions Governor Blanco wanted to create a path to bring people home and for some that worked however it's flawed quickly flaws quickly became obvious it was successful for some people but others were left behind and I was determined to get them help After the Storm most new lenians struggled to Cobble together enough money to rebuild their lives the road home was supposed to be a solution but for many it wasn't Hud's Inspector General found that some folks have spent the money that they received outside of program guidelines a few of these were in fact Bad actors but the vast majority were not most were just people who needed the repairs for their homes the people who were impacted by the holes in the program were the most in need are senior citizens who did not have sufficient resources to either rehabilitate their homes or to elevate them to Safe standards the state of Louisiana began suing people who spent this money in good faith even though some were told they could use the grants for repairs for many low and low-income homeowners the suits threatened Financial ruin several preemptively declared bankruptcy and others failed to defend themselves in court some feared their homes would be taken away when I learned about this issue it was hard to Fathom that this was even happening the state believed that the federal government was forcing them to sue these innocent victims the federal government was adamant that they were not forcing the state to sue anyone as time went on we began discussing that if Hud's recovery programs were closed these problems would go away at last we had all the elements that we needed to make this happen first a HUD secretary who was eager to assist we also had a governor who did not want to sue his citizens additionally there was a friendly ear in the White House all I needed now was to get all the bureaucrats out of the way and put everyone at the same table so that's what we did I pulled together all the parties together and we talked just facts and here we are now a solution a solution we can live with free of debt hurt and stress I was honored to hold secretary Marcia fudge in Louisiana when she made the big announcement announcement that road home program would finally come to an end in this agreement the state pays back some money it got back from its contractors HUD gets State money spent in projects in line with the programs that will help our entire region but most importantly people who in good faith fix their homes and rebuilt their lives will now get to sleep peacefully at night knowing no more lawsuits no more judgments no more liens after all this whole thing was supposed to be a road home the goal was to provide louisianans with a path to come home to their communities now that will be possible with a total closure of Road home none of this could have been done without our secretary Marshall fudge and the help of our governor I am so happy to deliver this good news

inspired the gentleman from Florida madam Speaker I yield one minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from Massachusetts miss Sun gentlewoman from Massachusetts is recognized for one minute madam Speaker recently I got an email from a constituent from my hometown of Lowell Massachusetts that said quote I think Republicans are focusing on the wrong thing we need jobs unquote our constituents are pleading with us to focus on jobs yet here we are again debating an ideologically driven bill that does nothing for the economy as it endangers women's health for women to receive the best possible health care they need we need access to all legal and appropriate medical procedures decisions about these procedures should be made by a woman in consultation with her doctor and her family I believe a woman's right to choose is fundamental to a woman's freedom but this bill puts the government in the middle of that decision this bill discriminates against women and go so far as to prevent those who want to buy a health plan that covers abortion services with their own money from making that choice this bill also permits hospitals and hospital workers to choose to deny women care that could save their lives putting ID law ideology above women's health let's focus on the right thing and vote down this bill when late a gentleman's gentlewoman's excuse me as time has expired gentlemen

u.s. Democratic senator Jon Tester invites president Donald Trump to tour the devastation from the major wildfires burning across Montana that have torched more than a million acres so far this summer but I really think it's critically important that it would be the president could come out and take a look at these fires and see the damage and destruction and see the huge amount of land masses taken in and if we could get president Trump and the director of FEMA to come out I think it could help better help him understand the impacts of these fires and also understand need for some help and support to get these folks back on their feet that have been impacted by the fires

here to talk more about these unusual talks and what's ahead for us and North Korea is Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin he's a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has been encouraging the administration to continuous pressure on the rogue state to denuclearize welcome senator the devil is in the details when it comes to denuclearization very fine that actually this is happening do you expect anything substantive to come out of the Trump Kim meeting I sure hope so but I think the only way that's gonna happen is if we maintain the maximum pressure campaign that there's brought Kim Jong on to the table hopefully in good faith but we absolutely need denuclearization it has to be a dismantlement verifiable irreversible it's pretty tall order but that's really what this administration must demand before we relax any of the pressure mr. Pompeo is meeting with Kim Jong and I have to say came to us as a surprise to me he's now taking the lead in high-level negotiations as this putting it in a better position and increases the chances of this confirmation and Secretary of State I hope there's no problem confirming mr. Pompeo he sees a extraordinary individual he's well suited to the task which is experienced now at the CIA I think really serves him well as we're seeing right now in terms of his diplomacy with North Korea senator you are in the Foreign Relations Committee and we have any number of questions now arising about what the proper role of Congress is in working through foreign relations with the presidency we have the issue of the agenda being set for the summit with Kim jong-un we also have the question of those missile strikes against Syria what do you think the proper role should be for example should the president should the administration have come to you in advance or soon afterwards at least on the Syrian missile strikes well they did and we just had a briefing with secretary mattis and general Dunford yesterday together with the DNI coats so they are consulting with us and you know presidents have have by and large complied with the War Powers Act although they've never really acknowledged that it constrains them from their article two constitutional powers so I think Congress's role is oversight its appropriation if we are really talking about a significant pterri involvement I think declaration for of optimization for use of military force which will be bringing up in Center Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow to discuss how we can actually craft a AUMF that really is going to address the very difficult issue of Islamist terror around the world going beyond the missile strikes from last Friday night into Saturday now we have reports maybe conflicting reports about further sanctions against Russia tied to those chemical attacks with of course the ambassador at the United Nations nikki Haley may be getting over her skis a little bit getting dialed back do you have a view does Congress does the Senate have a view on whether there should be further sanctions at this point against Russia I wish Russia were no more than a friendly rival but unfortunately there are unfriendly adversary we do need cooperation from Russia you're one of my questions in the briefing yesterday is what is Russia's relationship with Iran in Syria Russia wants stability Iran is not providing stability so we would like to be able to work with Russia stop their aggression that's gonna retake strengthen resolve with all of our allies and NATO and in Europe pushing back against Russia's aggression I think sanctions can sometimes be a double-edged sword can be used against the West in terms of Putin's popularity so we need to target them we need to target them toward their the oligarchs there's some sanctions that work really well some that can be somewhat counterproductive and again it's it's the president that has the authority under under the article 2 of the Constitution to conduct foreign policy and you know sometimes it's pretty messy world and you need to be somewhat flexible so I'm a little concerned about Mike Congress micromanaging the administration when it comes to some of these very delicate relationships that we must engage in around the world senator let me now turn to trade because you've welcomed the president's willingness to re-engage in the trans-pacific partnership but we have seen the president backpedal a little bit on that overnight we had a tweet talking about it why do you believe that a multilateral approach would be better than what the president wants which are more bilateral free trade agreements say with the likes of Japan first of all I believe in free fair and reciprocal trade I think it helps all nations that engage freely fairly with reciprocal treatment I think you have to prioritize what's the real problem area in terms of reciprocal treatment it is China President Trump is absolutely correct on that what is the best way of making sure that China adheres to the rules of the governing bodies from my standpoint is is with a unified front of the other trading countries in the world you know TPP for example without the u.s. is about thirteen point five so the world economy with us it's about 40 percent that is a very powerful bloc demanding the China actually adheres to the rules of the WTO and other world trading rules so we have to identify that the main cause the problem we have to have an effective way of doing it engaging in trade wars with the trading partners that we're going to need to rely on to make sure that China adheres the rules I just don't think is an effective negotiating strategy but the US has already left the TPP there's a reason that countries wanted to become the initial members of the TPP they've already had an agreement so what are the chances that you're gonna get a better deal out of these members who've already said that they are happy with what they agreed on certainly my discussions with a lot of those individuals and representatives of those countries they would welcome the u.s. coming back in we still are the world's largest market we're the world's largest customer and so people want to do business in the United States so we do actually have a great deal of leverage in negotiating free and fair and reciprocal trading agreements I just encouraged the administration again their negotiated it let's let's make sure we conclude NAFTA negotiations let's let's be engaged in TPP and then let's really identify that the main source of trading woes and that really is China but also recognize that the China is at a different place today that was ten years ago they are began to innovate IP protections becoming important to the Chinese economy so rather than look at all these negotiations as a you know somebody wins and somebody loses let's face that China has been winning and the rest of us have been losing let's try and negotiate agreements where we win win because that's really what trades all about is a win-win situation so before we get to the leverage of negotiated trade deal what kind of leverage does the United States Senate have with the administration Debrett's changed president Trump's mind right away I mean he was against it then he was for it nice you say against again you've made clear your view are they listening to you I believe they have remember we've exempted an awful lot of the countries from the steel tariffs for example so now I think this administration definitely is listing against the reason why President Trump said let's take another look at TPP so I think the best thing we can do is just make persuasive arguments from the standpoint of the states and the districts that we that we represent but also just from the standpoint of why free fair and reciprocal trade is really in the best interests of not only America but the rest of our trading partners senator thank you so much for your time today Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin

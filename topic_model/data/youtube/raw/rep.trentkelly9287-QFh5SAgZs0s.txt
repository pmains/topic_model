so you've seen this you've been there in charge of a lot of uh soldiers men and women black and white and brown and and you're telling me it's not that big of a deal as far as uh when you start looking at the barracks yeah well you know soldiers are very resilient and uh and and i use uh when we had the capital response from mississippi we had the most diverse group from mississippi and all those guys and girls were are volunteers so no one was made to come up here to do the capital response and we had the most diverse group here and and i'll tell you most of the people don't focus on those things it's just sad that some of the top leadership starting at the president uh is trying to push a woke agenda on people and try to make them see the differences in each other but i'll tell you in the military most of the time people don't pay attention to that stuff uh they just continue to do their jobs we got more important things to do than focus on woke agendas we're focusing on defending this great nation

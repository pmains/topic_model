Texas congressman Lance Gooden joins us now do you think that any part of Texas or the state as a whole needs a second lockdown absolutely not and those numbers you cited our result of increased text testing it stands to reason the more people you test the more positives are going to be identified our prisons have been infected for months now and they're finally getting tested so those numbers are going up but the hospitalization number you cited we're not even approaching halfway or a quarter of capacity there's absolutely no reason to go backward and really the whole purpose of this shutdown originally was to slow it down and make sure the hospitals could cope our hospitals are coping just fine we have plenty of capacity and we're not opening back up because we think the virus is gone or perhaps it's safer we're opening up because we can't afford to stay shutdown anymore there's no appetite to move back and close things down across the state of Texas people are sick of being at home they also can't afford to be at home businesses are struggling and this is really hurt people that have to physically be at their at their workplace yesterday I spoke with someone who works at a salon she hasn't made any money in the last two months it's not like some people who can just take their laptop home and still be productive there are people who have really suffered and we can't afford to close back down all right no going back says congressman good now how about this the house and the white Diaz the Congress is talking about with the White House maybe a two trillion dollar new stimulus plan here's what Arizona congressman Andy Biggs had to say about it in the last hour bear with me congressman roll that tape please you need to get rid of that that incentive pay to stay unemployed that's what you need to get rid of so people will come back I've just talked with people yesterday in my state they said our biggest problem is we can't get the people to come back to work for those entry-level jobs that we're paying 15 16 bucks an hour for because they're getting that bonus payment I think we can do this without spending a whole lot more money okay you heard him Collison think we can do this without spending a whole lot more money are you in agreement absolutely a hundred percent it's absolutely crazy that now that economies are opening back up that we are paying people and encouraging people not to work small businesses are struggling they can get people back to work and an interesting proposal came out was floated by the White House this week of incentivizing people to go back to work they have jobs I'd be much more inclined to vote for something that incentivize people to go back to work rather than incentivizing them to stay at home so it's a job you're going unfilled you don't object to any and all new spending you object to spending which might keep people at home for longer can I summarize it like that you absolutely can that's job well done okay thank you very much but the objective from your point of view is to get the president re-elected and for that you might need to spend some government money right yes and to be clear my objective is to do what's best for the country and I think combined with all the other things that will help our economy reelecting the president is at the top of that list yes Carlson Lance good and you always answer the questions directly we like that thanks for much for joining thank you

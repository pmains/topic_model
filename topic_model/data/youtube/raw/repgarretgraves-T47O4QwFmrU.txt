hey it's Garrett Graves we're out here at one of the many sites for the five bayous project this project is designed to do clearing snagging opening up concrete revetments and enlarging some of the choke points on five by user creeks in East Baton Rouge Parish that includes Beaver Bayou and Blackwater Bayou in the northern part of the parish Bayou Fountain Ward Creek and Jones Creek in the southern part of the parish so we're right here on Jones Creek which means that our Neil Lane is right behind you and then Jones Creek is over there Jones Creek Road and then white oak landing area is here behind me so you can see what's happening here right here on this on this right side of the creek here you can see how they've done all of the clearing and opening this area up to allow for it to drain and on the left side they haven't touched it yet so what they've done is they've gone from the center line of the creek 70 feet off to this one right side and they haven't done anything yet on the left side but it will ultimately look like that where they're going to remove the vegetation station remove the debris then what this does is it opens up Jones Creek and allows for this to be able to handle flood waters even faster allowing for faster evacuation faster velocity of the water and ultimately at the end of the day what we're all looking for is safer communities better flood protection this is part of a 255 million dollar project we secured funds for a few years ago this project started in the early 1990s and was completely Frozen had not progressed at all toward construction and so we came in and were able to secure that 255 million dollars so projects underway progress is being made right here on this 3.3 mile section they've already removed 14 000 cubic yards of material and going to keep moving forward and keep making progress ultimately to uh to improve flood protection in Baton Rouge so there you go more progress

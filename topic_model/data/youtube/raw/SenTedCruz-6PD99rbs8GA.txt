when senator Ted Cruz of Texas walks through CPAC you bring a lot of company with you you're still a very very popular figure here senator Cruz well I love the people at CPAC these are the activists these are the people who work these are especially the young people who have the passion for liberty the the passion for defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and and I have been coming to CPAC many many years and and and there are a few things that more uplifting and invigorating for the spirit then than seeing the energy and passion have you noticed this year it seems to me the crowd is actually even younger than it has been and in past years is there a hunger within younger you know college students because all they're getting is well anti Liberty messages well you look at what's happening in our universities where they've really gone nutty I mean I mean the the active censorship of the extreme left listen listen it's really a sign of weakness if you believe what you're saying then you're not afraid of a dissenting voice right the socialists don't want to actually talk about substance because their ideas don't work socialism has produced poverty and suffering for billions across the planet so they can't defend it on the merits I tell young people all the time you don't know what socialism is take a look at Venezuela Venezuela it was once one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America you now have people starving and eating food out of trash cans the beauty of free market principles of conservative ideas is that our ideas work which means that we're perfectly happy to debate any left-wing numbskull and I do think young people they when their schools and universities are trying to censor and stop them from hearing in a point of hosing view I think a lot of young people are smart enough to say wait a second what is that telling me what are they hiding from me and I think the people here know they know that freedom works and it's powerful I'd love to ask you senator Cruz during the 2016 campaign a lot of conservatives were concerned that if Donald Trump became the de facto leader the Republican Party because the United States he couldn't make impassioned arguments about freedom in Liberty because he doesn't have the same is he considered given that and given many concerns we had what did you make of his speech that he gave about Venezuela in South Florida just last week look I was very glad to see the president standing up addressing Venezuela and he has been making the point that Venezuela it's not the socialism didn't work it's that it worked exactly as it always does that's that that point is exactly right and I'm glad to see the president making it I also think there's an obligation for all of us for you for me for every activist here that that waging the battle in the arena of ideas is all of our responsibility you have the universities you have journalists and the mainstream media you have Hollywood all trying to propagandize and so we need all of us to come back and and I can tell you my priority the next two years my number one priority is winning people's hearts and minds not the same two and a half million people who are watching Fox News each night who have preaching to the choir but reaching young people reaching Hispanics and african-americans and women and the people whose lives are impacted by these policies but who aren't necessarily hearing the message and and we need to be using humor we need to be using stories we need to be defending ideas that were taking it out of the realm of ideas and and and bringing it right into policy we're talking about Venezuela quite a bit in terms of how the idea of so she hasn't failed them what is America's role there now I mean this is a nation in turmoil yes we saw conflicts on the border with Colombia from your position as the United States Senator and you may be called upon to have your voice heard about our policy even deploying military do we have a role there with our military well I think we have an important role and I think the the approach that the president the administration has been taking has been right with which is that number one Maduro is illegitimate deal the election his last election was a fraud the legitimately elected leader of Venezuela is Juan Kaido because the National Assembly which is legitimately elected selected him in that role and what the president has done the administration is done is recognized why doe as he legitimately elected leader and Maduro is not Maduro is a dictator who is violating the law and after the United States did that Europe did as well country countries throughout Europe and across the world have recognized that Maduro is not the legal ruler of Venezuela he's a dictator using military force to oppress the people but dictators don't go quietly and and given that do we have a role our responsibility at the very least to protect our allies like Colombia in the region as things start to get by perhaps and but illicit let me be clear I'm not calling for military force in Venezuela now here's an exception there are Americans there they're Americans on the ground if Maduro were to make a move and threaten American lives we would absolutely respond with military force to protect the lives of Americans and I don't think Maduro will do that because he understands that that we have a responsibility to protect Americans short of that I don't think we should be intervening militarily but I think the administration is exactly right that we should be using economic sanctions in particular sanctions on their oil to put pressure and you know you said dictators don't go quietly well sometimes they do and sometimes they don't if you look at Venezuela right now there there are roughly 3,000 generals in the Venezuelan military I've met with the leadership the democratically elected leadership events Venezuela just the last couple of weeks in DC and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee those Venezuelan generals are deciding right now where they're gonna stand who they're going to align with and and if they make the decision that Maduro is on his way out he's illegitimate he's lost and he's going out and Guido and and and and a freely and fairly elected leader is on his way in if the generals Flip Maduro is done and and so so much of what we are doing and should be doing is a combination of carrot and stick for those generals carrot of you should be standing with the democratically elected legitimate leadership of Venezuela but also stick if you stand instead with a dictator there will be consequences and sanctions directed at you mr. general that it's gonna have real consequences senator Ted Cruz is our guest from Texas and Senator over the last couple of months you've had one of the finest ideas I've seen anyone in Washington come up with so of course it seems like not a whole lot of people are responding that's to take out shadows money all the money that we seized from this murderous thug yep and use that how to protect our borders why is that not good who's what's the resistance to that look this is the essence of common sense because the legislation I introduced would take all the money criminally forfeited from El Chapo and from other drug lords and use that to build the wall and secure the board yes it's blood money why not put it in some good use and protect American citizen it makes enormous sense we haven't voted on it in the Senate I'm continuing to press for it to come up for a vote and one of the values of voting on it is it will put the lie to the position of the Democrats you know a lot of Democrats as we were debating the wall they said oh it costs too much we don't want to spend that much money now set aside for a second that it is very difficult to think of even a single instance where Democrats have ever thought anything cost too much I mean they're willing to pour money down any rathole they can find it must have hurt them physically to form those words IIIi suspect more than a few of them were twitching as they were saying but the beauty of this idea is is that if we pass the El Chapo Act it wouldn't cost a penny of US taxpayer dollars we could use the billions of dollars el Chapo's global criminal net worth is is estimated to be roughly fourteen billion dollars we can use those ill-gotten gains and those from other drug dealers directly to build the wall and secure the border and there's a justice to using billions made trafficking narcotics illegally across our border using them to prevent future narco traffickers from doing the same in the meantime it looks like it both of you and your colleagues in the Senate will have to deal with is that House Resolution is passed trying to prove another president from declaring a national emergency how do you plan to vote and also do you share the same concerns as many that well at the Democratic president they'll use that same trick if you want to use that word to do something that we wouldn't i absolutely share the concerns about democratic abuse of power we've seen it before and i think you think we are likely to see it even worse again look how the Senate resolves this time the next two weeks you're gonna see a lot of debates we've had really robust internal discussions within the Senate I think that will continue for the next two weeks I don't know how it will be resolved but I'll tell you this regardless of how it's resolved the wall is going to be built it's going to be built and there are ample funds available that the president has to spend the 5.7 billion that the president lays out is needed to secure the border and so what I think matters is the substance that we build the wall that we secure the border and ensuring that those funds are available I'd like to do it in a way that doesn't set a precedent doesn't create a pathway for a Democratic president to abuse power and and say to a declare an emergency on global warming or on gun control or healthcare or whatever other else so let's get the job done but also ensure that we're protecting Liberty going forward senator Cruz I grew a goatee for a few weeks and I did one appearance on Tucker Carlson and my wife said it's done I had to shave it I'm guessing since the beard is still here mrs. Cruz is on board with this so so Heidi started out pretty skeptical I've never grown a beard before and and it was just over Thanksgiving vacation I was with the family I usually don't shave on vacation and Monday morning going back to work I normally pull out the razor I just figure out what the heck I'm not going to I will admit I'm having fun with it Heidi has warmed to it she started out skeptical she's warm to it but but the single best thing about growing the beard is is that it is driving lefties on Twitter out of their minds it is I'll tell you owning the libs with your eye I also told Diane Feinstein I said Diane next thing I'm gonna do is start wearing Birkenstocks and grow a ponytail and I'm coming after your base Diane senator Ted Cruz from Texas thank you for joining us today thank you thank you sir

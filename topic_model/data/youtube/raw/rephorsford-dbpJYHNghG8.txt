Across the country, outside investors
are buying homes in our neighborhoods. They aren't living in these homes. They aren't part of the community. Yet they bought one in seven homes
last year on average. In some markets it was one in four. They are intentionally targeting
communities of color. They are targeting communities
with a high rate of single parents. They go after seniors. They didn't want to invest
in our neighborhoods before. But now they want to buy your homes
and price you out. We need to take action to ensure
transparency and fair competition for Americans hoping to purchase
or remain in their home. We need the Housing Oversight
and Mitigating Exploitation, or HOME Act. It will crack down on the abuse
and manipulation of housing markets, especially targeting based on race, gender or socioeconomic status. It will direct the HUD Secretary
to investigate exploitative actions,
including artificially reduced housing capacity
and price gouging and manipulation. It will empower the HUD Secretary
to monitor home purchases within housing markets across the country
to fully understand the impacts of outside investment
on our communities. The homes purchased by outside investors may never resurface on the housing market. They will force many families to rent instead of buy. They will put the American dream
of homeownership out of reach for too many. Every American deserves the chance
to buy a home. The HOME Act will
ensure they get a fair shot.

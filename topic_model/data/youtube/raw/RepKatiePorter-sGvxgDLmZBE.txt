hi everybody this is katie porter i represent california's 45th congressional district and i'm coming in to you tonight with my whiteboard wall um and what i'm gonna do i've got a lot of markers here i've been testing them out i have the best colors for this kind of large group event and and so we're going to be going through the buildback better act and the infrastructure bill there have been a lot of months and a lot of news stories and a lot of twitter chatter and a lot of confusion about what's in these bills so what i'm gonna do in just a few minutes um is let more people join here and then i'm gonna start walking you through what's in that bill not a bunch of mumbo jumbo not a bunch of numbers with millions and billions behind it but straight up alphabet one by one what are the building blocks that we need to put into place to have a strong stable globally competitive economy i'm going to literally show you those blocks with my whiteboard i have my dr pepper here in case i get parched which seems likely even this is going to last like an hour and i have an eraser because sometimes even i make mistakes um and we are ready to go so um everyone welcome again i'm congresswoman katie porter i represent california's 45th congressional district um headquartered in irvine and thank you so much again to everyone for joining in tonight i'm going to be going through what congress has passed in the infrastructure bill and the buildback better act and why it matters for you and for every single american these are really important bills they are going to change lives they are going to improve our economy they're going to make a brighter future for us and for our children and grandchildren and so i'm really excited to walk you through them so to begin last month um i voted to invest in what our country needs to grow our economy and those things include modernized infrastructure affordable child care lower health care costs climate action and more and our global competitors the nations that we are competing with for jobs and for economic growth have been making these kinds of investments for years and that's why president biden talks about this as building back better it's not just enough to get back to where we were before the pandemic because that was an economy that left a lot of people behind that was an economy that didn't invest in kids that didn't really tackle climate change so these bills are about doing it better and i'm really proud to be doing my part to help make sure the united states remains the strongest most stable economy in the world but that's not going to happen without the government stepping up and doing its part so one of the bills that i voted for the infrastructure and jobs act which you sometimes hear referred to as it's got a really bad nickname biff which is short for bipartisan infrastructure um that has already been signed into law by president biden um that happened before thanksgiving um and that's terrific a lot of those infrastructure problem projects are both long overdue and it takes a little time to build things like roads and bridges and highways and cyber security so we're glad we're getting those things started the second bill the buildback better act the house has voted to pass it i was proud to vote for it it is over in the senate and we are hoping that they will pass it and the president biden can sign it into law and we'd like them to do that sooner rather than later because a lot of the issues that we're dealing with like i said we have already waited too long um so the infrastructure bill which is already the infrastructure we shouldn't say bill we should say the infrastructure law it creates a lot of jobs it puts a lot of money into our economy but one thing about the infrastructure law is about 90 of those jobs are going to go to men and i was elected to represent everybody and so i want to make sure that we're making investments that will help everybody and making sure that we're taking care of all of our workers and all of the generations and addressing all of the investments that we need and so that's what we're going to be unpacking tonight is what's in the buildback better act um and encouraging all of you around the country to make sure that your senators and your representatives support these bills and that they know how important they're going to be to you so what i'm going to do is start breaking things down and i'm going to start with my first letter here i'm thinking about this i said as building blocks because these are building blocks for a strong stable globally competitive economy and you're going to hear me talk about these as investments because that's what they are they are money that our government that we as taxpayers are putting into our economy and they're going to pay us back by having the stronger economy going forward so the first one i want to start with our first building block here is w and the w here is for wildfire now california has had a lot of wildfires climate change is making things worse um and so it's really really important that we start engaging in wildfire prevention um and so this bill has significant money for states that have faced increased wildfire risk like california um it also has money to make sure that we're developing resilience against wildfires for example there are resources in here for the department of energy to make sure that we're modernizing energy transmission lines and grids so that they're not starting fires and that there's they're able to continue to provide energy during a fire there's money in here for weatherization assistance okay admittedly weatherization assistance is not a big issue in orange county because pretty much the weather is perfect every day but i grew up in iowa it gets cold some of you are watching from around the country weatherization assistance to help make buildings more energy efficient um and put up things like roofs for example that are not able to spark and set fires or spread fires to buildings um there's 3.3 billion for wildfire risk reduction so we don't have these fires in the first place um and then there's two million dollars to improve forest management on both public lands and private lands and that's things like burned area rehabilitation hazardous fuels management making sure we don't have these wildfires in the first place so if you thought the only thing in buildback better was child care and universal pre-k you've been missing out on one of the really really important things it's not just roads and bridges and childcare it's also wildfires now we also not want to fight the fight uh prevent the wildfires we want to take care of the people who step up and protect us when fires happen so our next building block in the buildback better act is f and this stands for firefighters and here what we're focused on in particular is wildland firefighters um the federal workforce that helps us prevent protect ourselves and fight these fires it has money to help us hire and retain wildland firefighters making sure that they get paid they're going to increase a permanent increase in salary you may remember president biden talking about we have firefighters out there risking their lives who are not even being paid 15 an hour so this would make sure that we're able to recruit and retain those firefighters and for those that do get injured on the job who are exposed to hazardous materials that we're taking care of them afterwards this is going to help us have the high quality year-round firefighting workforce that we need to be responsive to the level of fire risk that we're seeing so supporting our first responders here by stepping up and making sure that our federal firefighting workforce has what its needs especially important in states like california where we have great operation with cal fire but we have a lot of public uh public land and when the fire breaks out on that public land it's gonna be our federal wildland firefighters and so we're going to do right by them by giving them the pay that they deserve and being able to recruit and train them to continue to manage the wildfire risk that will that wildfires that will occur despite our efforts to reduce those risks um with those investments all right next up we have you this is one of my favorites and the u here stands for universal i'm gonna have to use the bottom universal pre-k so um this is one of president biden's top priorities and what this would do is every child every three and four-year-old in basically the two years before a child will be eligible for kindergarten they're going to be able to attend a for free universal pre-k now somebody asked me the other day why should this be universal why should we why shouldn't people who can pay pay well think about why we have public schools and why we don't charge for them it's because education is an investment that we all benefit from by having a trained and talented workforce and that early investment what you do to help kids be ready with literacy and numeracy when they're three and four is hugely important every one of our competitor nations knows this countries like korea and china and others make these investments in universal pre-k this is about catching up to what they're doing this is also by the way a major way that we can address and reduce educational inequality by making sure that kids are all every child regardless of their parents income is able to get that high quality pre-k we're making sure that everybody's going to be able to achieve whatever they're capable of performing better in middle school and elementary school increasing the rate of going to college and being able to pursue skilled high-paying jobs going forward so that's a long-term investment it's going to be transformative it's also going to be a major savings for families who are going to be able to get that free universal pre-k rather than having to pay for preschool while they work all right next letter up this is another great one we've got a g coming up and the g is for grants and in this case specifically pell grants pell grants are a form of government assistance it's not a loan it is straight up government assistance and being able to pay for higher education and pell grants go to the lowest income americans the ones for whom there's no ability for them them or their families to save or pay for college this is again a major way that we're expanding educational opportunity and a major way that we're addressing the high costs of college there are some other related things with regard to higher education access here one of them is expanding federal financial aid so that our dreamers um our hard-working dreamers we have so many of them here in the 45th congressional district are able to get financial aid and they're able to pursue their educations there's also money in here to address the need to recruit and retain teachers teachers have had a really tough time with the pandemic we have an aging workforce so we want to make sure that we're recruiting those teachers and there's money in there to help fund education programs for teachers so that we're training that next generation of folks that we're going to need the last part of this which is i think particularly great here at at um 45th congressional district uc irvine right in our backyard is both a hispanic surveying institution and an api serving institution and there's some dedicated funding in here targeted to help historically black colleges and universities hispanic serving institutions minority serving institutions making sure that they can continue to expand education to every single american all right this next one's a quick one but it's a good one and it's near and dear to my heart because it's about stopping corporate abuse of american workers so we're going to draw a building block here and this one is for l and one of the things this is in the infrastructure law which has already taken effect is labor violations right now when big companies abuse their workers and they violate the unfair labor practices law there is not the ability to punish them and so what this would do is make sure that when an employer violates the unfair labor practice law they would be subject to a penalty of up to 50 000 for each violation i think a lot of you watching this know how much i care about oversight i don't think the government should pass laws put them on the books tell them at press conferences run around asking for your vote based on those laws and then not enforce them in your lives we have unfair labor practices to protect the workers because the workers are the ones who are actually truly themselves the building blocks of our economy so if a big corporation is abusing their workers they should be held to account and it needs to be a stiff enough penalty to make sure that they won't keep doing it they won't do it again so this is again a labor violation enforcement in the infrastructure law that president biden has already signed into existence now this one i've talked about so much that i actually am just going to say it all again because i've said it all before but this is one of my very very favorites and this is a c and the c stands for child care so let's go over what is in the buildback better act with regard to child care the core piece of it here is making is helping families afford child care in other words bringing down the cost one of the biggest costs that families face and one of the fastest growing costs child care has grown very very fast in terms of expenses over the last few years my daughter went to preschool at the university of california irvine and when betsy went to preschool there her preschool tuition her child care at the university of california irvine cost more than it would have been for her to have been an undergraduate more than her tuition and that's not just a california thing child care costs more than college tuition in about half of all states so what we would do here is the federal government would work to increase both the supply of child care how many child care openings there are particularly hard if you've ever had a kid or known someone who has a kid people put their names on the wait list years in advance right away when they get pregnant because it can take a long time to get an opening so increase the supply of child care make it more affordable for families and increase the pay for workers making sure that child care workers are getting a living wage and so with regard to child care for families what this is gonna mean is that um families will pay most families will pay no more than seven percent of their income for child care and here we're primarily talking about after school care for older kids those three-year-olds and below are going to be in this universe three three and four-year-olds are going to be in universal preschool so a lot of this is about infant care or after-school care or summer care for kids so the lowest income americans won't pay anything um they'll have child care they'll be able to go into the workforce and be able to um you're shaking the camera you're shaking the camera don't shake the camera i don't want everyone to think there's an earthquake here in california um they're writing down your questions so i can take them um so that no family would pay more than families wouldn't pay more than seven percent of their income now this is targeted to the most needy families so once you get above about 250 of state median income this program phases out personally i think we have to just have it be for everybody because people who earn more pay more with the seven percent um and then i mentioned already making sure that child care workers are being paid a living wage once we make child care profitable um and we make it profitable for workers to do this work we let them do work and get money to put food on their tables we'll see more child care centers and more child care spots okay here comes the magic arm with a question um this says will early child care fail if all states don't um take and take advantage of it don't adopt it and this was of course a problem with obamacare with the medicare medicaid excuse me expansion um so here's good news we we in congress are actually learning from our mistakes not always but sometimes and i think we've learned from our mistake here so what we've done here is we've said states to participate in this child care program you have to let us know within the first six months or so if you want to participate first year if you don't if a state texas florida wyoming utah who knows declines to participate in this child care program then what happens is other organizations like cities and counties can step up and do so um and even in some cases non-profits church or faith organizations um school districts could step up and do so and so the goal here is to make sure that if a state for some reason doesn't want to address one of family's biggest costs doesn't want to have more workers be able to stay in the workforce um there's an opportunity they have to make a decision to get involved or decline and when they decline it's not those states those people in those states are not left behind instead we'll see cities and counties and school districts and faith groups and others step up and become participants in the program and so i think this is really really important i think we've learned that some states will not take advantage of these kinds of programs even though it would help their economy um and so we've planned for that in this case that we have a backup um plan here and we'll see some of those local organizations step up here if the states don't great question please keep sending in your questions i'll stop as i go along all right up next the building blocks of a strong stable globally competitive economy the parts of the infrastructure bill um i mean i think i'll put this up here the infrastructure bill and let me see if i can spell infrastructure i should say the infrastructure law and the build back better bill all right we're going through what are the building blocks of this the next one we have up is h and h stands for boy these are really little building blocks okay let me try again okay i barely fit that in there the h stands for home care um and this has been a really really important part of the build back better act um right now we have seniors people with disabilities who want to age that place in home but they need some care to do so they need some assistance with some daily living tasks and it's much cheaper for them to be able to age in place and it also lets them age with dignity lets them age with their family or if a person with disabilities lets them get the care that they need in their home so what this would be is a expansion of 150 billion dollars going to expand medicaid home and community community-based care and what this would do is help get people off that years and years years long wait list and be able to get more people the care that they need when they need it and make sure that we're improving the pay the training the qualification and the opportunity for those care workers who take care of seniors who take care of people with disabilities so you're going to see a theme here which is taking care of workers we talked about that already with our firefighters we talked about making sure that we're training doing teacher training making sure that workers aren't getting abused in the workplace raising the pay of child care workers here we're talking about raising the pay of home care workers so the buildback better act really is about work it's about our economy um it is every bit as much of an investment in our economy um as the infrastructure act is so we're going to talk soon about some of the things in the infrastructure act but these things really work together to create like i said a firm foundation for our economy all right next up um the next building block is it's an n and it is for our national parks and our public lands i serve on the house natural resources committee absolutely love it i get to serve on the public land and national park subcommittee with my colleague joe nagoos who's the subcommittee chair and one of the things that we have seen is that america loves national parks and especially during the pandemic but even before that more and more americans are going to the parks are staying there are enjoying them we've added a lot of new public lands so we need to invest in making sure that those parks have the infrastructure they need to meet those increased visitors i would design on this uh like this a year ago yeah no couple months ago i went to zion about six months ago i went camping i met with the superintendent there and one of the things he told me is that more and more and more people are coming to the park and he needs assistance he needs resources he needs tools to help make sure that everybody can enjoy the national parks while protecting those lands while making sure people have a peaceful experience so there's about 900 million in there for what we call deferred maintenance um which is just stuff we should have done yesterday and making sure that we're hiring additional rangers to help educate people about public lands and make sure they have a terrific experience there there's also money in there to make sure that our public lands are going to be resilient to climate change which is coming um and also restore them so restoration of national lands coastal resilience and some of our coastal national parks places like acadia and others so a big investment here in our national parks um and this is a great example of one of the things that i think virtually every american agrees about and shares an affection for i think this would have been a great reason for every republican to have supported the buildback better act in the house that unfortunately didn't happen but i would love to see republicans and democrats in the senate um step up and make sure that they're funding um that they're funding our national parks okay next we have a p and the p here stands for [Music] paid leave so this was definitely a part of the bill that it was in that it was out that it was in that it was definitely out absolutely not happening oh never mind it's back in it's in so the house version the house filled back better bill which has now been sent over to the senate would provide for every working american to have four weeks of paid leave that could be used for the birth of a adoption of a child it could be used for a worker who was sick or a worker who had to take time off work to care for a loved one a spouse a grandparent or a child again when we look at our competitor nations around the world they're making these investments they have paid leave because they know and we just saw with the pandemic how expensive it is for our economy to have workers be forced out of work because they don't have paid leave and they have to stay home and take care of a sick kid or take care of it to get to get sick themselves how much labor market disruption that causes so we want to make sure people who are in jobs and getting promoted or trained for those jobs when they get sick or a loved one gets sick or they start a family that they're not forced out of the workplace and put in that excruciatingly hard choice of choosing between taking care of their health or a loved one and being able to stay in their job so four weeks of paid leave this is really again about making sure that workers are able to continue to contribute to the economy and that's something whether you ever take paid leave or don't we all benefit from making sure that workers continue to work at the jobs and stay connected to their employers that they don't have to go on unemployment or search for a new job so that is a big benefit to all of us to have that all right i've got a v coming up and the v is for the va the v here is for veterans funding and specifically we have a number of veterans hospitals a lot of these were built in the wake of world war ii they were designed to address and care for all those world war ii veterans coming home and a lot of those hospitals and facilities are getting old the typical va hospital that is in use today is about 50 years old and even though we've been adding on to adding on to them and modernizing them the reality is that we need to do more we need to build new hospitals in some places where there wasn't a lot of population back when these were built and we need to make sure that we're modernizing these facilities so this would also make sure that we're providing money to update the clinics the medical facilities so we can give our veterans the state of the art care that they deserve so this is a part of what's going to when we talk about what is and what is not infrastructure um people often they think about the the transportation sector but this building and modernizing um veterans facilities and hospitals is going to create a lot of jobs for construction workers um and good high paying jobs um as we modernize our va facility and of course do right by our veterans all right this is a little known one most everybody that i've ever talked to we'll see if anybody out here does people do not know this is in the infrastructure bill but it is and it's really really important now i'm going to cheat a little bit because i'm running out of letters i know it doesn't seem like i'm running out of letters but there's not a lot of stuff in the buildback better act that starts with q or z so i'm going to fudge a little bit because i've already used my c for child care so i'm going to draw a y here and what i'm going to talk about now is cyber security did you know that was part of the infrastructure bill most people didn't but this is a hugely important area of investment when i've received briefings in congress from our military leaders they talk about defending the united states on air on land at sea in space and by cyber in cyber world and they always say that is the area where the most vulnerable or the most vulnerable to attack by our enemies and that is something that is part of that role is what our military does with regard to cyber but it's also making sure that our state and local and county and federal governments are able to defend against these attacks so let me give you some examples um there is money to make sure that our local government have that capacity that they're making those investments in cyber security there's money specifically for cloud security uh more and more and more things are up in the cloud if we were to have a major disruption of the cloud it can interrupt travel banking so many fundamental sectors this is by the way also a huge job creator here in california and across the country cyber security professionals make a good living these are going to be jobs of the future and so there's money in here to make sure that we're training that workforce and that we're opening up these jobs to people um who need them so some of this money is going through the department department of homeland security some of it's going through other agencies including for example the department of energy to secure our electrical grid against cyber attacks so very significant investment here in cyber security and when we say that this infrastructure bill was long overdue when we say that it's historic this is part of what we're talking about computers and technology have been with us for decades now yet we haven't really made the right size investment in cyber security that we need to all right our next one up here is the letter a and a here stands for affordable housing i already use the h for that home care so affordable housing and this is in a couple of pieces now to remind everybody the last time the federal government really made a meaningful investment in affordable housing was in the wake of world war ii with the gi bill to some degree a little bit in the 60s and 70s with public housing but it has been decade after decade after decade that housing costs have eaten up more and more of people's budgets and so we need to do something to increase the supply of housing because that's the best way to bring down housing costs so what are we talking about the buildback better bill on the buildback better act contains 150 billion dollars to expand affordable and accessible housing accessible meaning that it's available to people with disabilities people who are or older and might need some kind of accommodation there's money in there for rental assistance to help the lowest income americans afford their rent and there's money to update and retrofit to modernize um affordable housing units that are already in existence because updating them and modernizing them is much cheaper than starting from scratch we don't want any more people to experience homelessness um during this time so we want to make sure we're doing that there's also some money in there to purchase homes in low income areas and to rehab them um so they'll be in better shape for the they can be then used again instead of being torn down they can be fixed up again all about expanding the supply of housing and therefore making housing more affordable the last part of this some of this is market-based there's money to our community development financial institutions called cdfis these exist in every community every part of the united states urban and rural and suburban we have right here in orange county and what they do is there this is money for them that can be loaned at a low interest rate to low-income housing builders so again trying to encourage more supply of housing that will help bring down the costs of renting and ultimately make it more affordable for families to save money and be able to if they want to purchase a home okay here comes another question um all right the question here is about the p it's about paid leave and the question is is there a limit on paid leave is it a requirement for small businesses with few employees so all workers would be covered by paid leave the way this is funded unlike some of our employment programs which are funded by what you put in the paid leave that's in the buildback better bill is funded by making sure that corporations the largest most profitable corporations pay their fair share and this way it makes sure that we can cover workers at small businesses without asking small businesses to take on a huge cost and so i think this is the right way to think about this it's how we think about some of our other programs that we think about them as investments again every worker that goes on paid leave and comes back to work four weeks later is a worker who's then contributing to the economy who's able to put food on their table who's paying their taxes and so we're going to pay for this with taxes on the wealthiest corporations but yes it will apply to every worker but we're not asking small businesses especially our smallest businesses to flip the bill here we're asking the largest corporations in the country to pay their fair share of taxes to do this all right the b that we have um coming up is for [Music] this is the one everyone always remembers the b is for bridges um for bridges and for roads and this is the most traditional kind of infrastructure when we talk about infrastructure i think a lot of us remember um in the wake of the financial crisis in 2009 and 10 um there was a sort of shovel ready the american recovery and rescue act those projects that you saw widening highways doing things like that that's what this is focused on a big chunk of it the reason i chose b um and not are um is that a lot of this is focused on bridges um and a lot of those bridges were built in the 1930s in the 1940s with the expansion of the eisenhower interstate system in the 1950s and so they badly need updating and so this is going to help keep families safe as they travel it's going to help goods move across our country um and goods move that we make here for export um and so there's a 110 billion dollars in there for roads and bridges and major projects like this now there's a bunch of other stuff in the broad kind of transportation bucket so i don't want my building blocks to to go too tall and i don't want to be here all night so let me just give you a few others there's money for airports there is money for ports to make sure that we're investing in those ports to make sure that ships cargo ships that are bringing goods and taking goods are able to get there and get unloaded there's money for transportation safety there's money for public transit encouraging americans and making it possible for more americans to take public transit if they prefer to there's this is one of my favorites there's money for clean school buses those school buses often idle in front of schools sometimes half an hour an hour those kids are standing around on our playgrounds making sure that we're moving to electrify and have a green school bus fleet and then there's money for electric vehicle charging we're seeing more and more americans purchase electric vehicles that's helping us reduce emissions but if we really want to make sure that electric vehicles are widespread we have to make sure we have that charging network everywhere around the country you can't just have a charging network here in california or in the bay area or in new york we need those charging networks on on our interstates on our highway systems and in rural america so there's money in there to really build that network that connects every part of america with electric vehicles so even though it's a b for bridges there's bridges there's roads there's dams there's airports there's public transit there's electric vehicle there's school buses there's a lot of stuff in there um in that bee okay we have another question um all right the question says with the teacher shortage how will we address um that issue when universal pre-k kicks in um this is a terrific question and one of the things that we're doing in universal pre-k which i think is so important is we're recognizing that the people who teach preschool are teachers and they need to be trained and compensated like teachers so there is additional money i put it under the g but money to train and recruit teachers and so that's really really important to do it the pell grant teacher training program all of this stuff will work together we know that we're going to need to both give additional training to existing preschool teachers who have years of experience as we move them into being part of this universal pre-k program and train that next generation of teachers um and so this is not this is not everything that we need to do on education there's more that we need to do with regard to supporting our teachers but this takes a really really important first step um and so there we have given a lot of thought in passing this universal pre-k to what is the pathway to making sure that we have the trained and talented workforce um to deliver that universal pre-k and how do we make sure that we pay them and respect them um in the workforce and that means making sure that we're building up the next generation of preschool teachers as well all right we're going to get to the s now and the s here is going to stand for salt salt stands for state and local taxes so president trump passed a tax law that was intentionally punitive to people who lived in certain states and a lot of those were states the president was very clear about this it was states that didn't vote for him states where there are state and local taxes states like new york new jersey california maryland illinois and so what they did to fund what trump did and the republicans did to fund their tax giveaway to the richest americans and to biggest corporations was make it so that families could only deduct 10 000 of state and local income tax now this includes might sound like a lot but state and local income tax includes not just your tax on your income but it also includes your property tax on your home and so what this did is say if even if you have say you have 10 000 deducted from your paycheck by your state estate tax and say you own your home and you pay about five thousand dollars in property tax that means you owe fifteen thousand dollars in state and local taxes you don't have a choice whether to pay that that money you have to pay it it's a tax you don't have that money it's taken out of your income and what trump said is for as long as our country has had an income tax you have been able to deduct that state and local income tax in this case the 15 000 from your income and you pay your federal income tax on what's left over after you've paid your state and local taxes what the trump tax law did is is saying you can only deduct 10 000 in state and local taxes so even if you're paying thousand dollars in state and local taxes you essentially get taxed again on that additional five thousand dollars so how do we deal with this what the bill does is raise the amount that you can deduct from ten thousand dollars to eighty thousand dollars and it fixes that amount going forward into the future because when this ten thousand dollar cap went into effect it was a big shock some people were deducting twelve thousand or fifteen thousand or you know eighteen thousand dollars in state and local taxes and all of a sudden they can only deduct ten um and it had a big effect on people's ability to afford a home as well so what this does is raise the state and local tax deduction and fix it for the next 10 years um at 80 000 this will achieve a couple of things one of them is tax certainty like trump came in and upset a a principle of federal income taxation that we've had for 80 90 years by changing this rule this restores the old rule that you can deduct your state and local income taxes in this case up to 80 000 so it deals with tax certainty it also deals with tax fairness no american should have to pay more federal tax just because of the state that they live in so if you're earning the same income you know the same circumstances as a and you're a worker in california or in new jersey or in illinois as a worker who is in texas or in florida your federal income tax shouldn't be different it should be the same so if you are losing and you're paying if you're you shouldn't lose out just because of the state that you live in so if you are doing right and paying your state and local income tax then you shouldn't be punished by the federal tax system for that and by the way we want states to collect state taxes because they also have a role in doing their part in creating the building blocks of our economy they also have infrastructure and education and other investments to make so this change to the salt deduction does not add even one penny to the cost of the bill um and so by fixing the amount over that period by creating that tax certainty this doesn't add any dollars so when we're thinking about how many dollars can we put toward pell grants how many dollars can we put toward wildfire we here we are not taking any dollars away from those things um next up i want to say is drug prices and that is going to be the letter d and the drug price part of this this has been a top priority of mine it's one of the reasons i ran for congress i have done a lot of oversight work um with executives pharmaceutical executives asking them about you know why they continue to raise drug prices triple quadruple digit percentages every year even when they're not making the drug any better when they're not inventing new drugs so what this would do is empower medicare to negotiate drug prices frankly it's outrageous that congress ever prohibited medicare from negotiating drug prices of course we should be able to negotiate them otherwise the drug companies can just charge whatever they want and that's exactly what they've been doing this doesn't just hurt seniors it hurts all of us because it reduces it increases the costs of medicare and that's something that affects all of us as we go forward and we age and we we plan to be on medicare ourselves so this bill would allow medicare to begin negotiating drug prices um the secretary of health and human services would start with the most expensive drugs and begin negotiating drug prices and that's really really important a big tax savings for every single american here reducing what medicare pays for health care and it would also create an out-of-pocket spending cap right now we have seniors who fall into the so-called donut hole which is a way that we deal with prescription drugs with medicare um as you're covered then you're not covered that's the donut hole then you're covered again um and so what this would do is impose an annual cap an annual maximum of two thousand dollars for out of pocket spending by our seniors on prescription drugs um and importantly included in this and applicable to everyone would be a 35 price limit of out-of-pocket costs for insulin insulin is one of the drugs that we have seen the fastest increases in um and i i've had round tables here in my office talking with people and doctors providers who treat people who are living with diabetes and that insulin prices sometimes we're seeing insulin be as high as 600 700 800 of vial so this would create a price 35 out of pocket copay for insulin and then the last part of this is an inflation rebate um what this would say to drug companies is if you engage in price gouging if you raise the price of that drug year after year long after it was invented faster than the price of inflation and you charge the government more than you should then you have to give that money back you have to give it back in the form of a rebate um and so this would again help us recover money make our health care system for our seniors more affordable and help again with help people make ends meet by reducing the cost of prescription drugs okay we have another question um this question says how will buildback better affect um tax rates for the middle class um even if there are fewer corporate loopholes great question president biden has been clear and consistent on this point and you'll love to see a leader who is clear and consistent president biden has made very very clear no american making less than 400 000 will see their taxes go up so the tax increases that we've talked about in a couple instances to fund some of these programs like paid leave are tax increases on huge corporations so to give you one example there is a modest tax i think it's one percent on companies that engage in stock buybacks to line the pockets of their own executives rather than investing back in the company and so americans middle class americans if you're making less than 400 000 there's no tax increase and in fact for many americans there will be a tax cut um both through salt um and through some of these other programs they'll be actually reduction in taxes um by through this program for most americans okay let me go to the last one the last one i have here is this is your great timing with your question this is a tea and the particular part of taxes i want to focus on here is tax enforcement so what do i mean by this i don't know about you but i do my very best to pay every dollar i owe i want i want to contribute my share to to making sure that we have what we need to have a strong economy but in fact there are tax cheats out there and by and large who cheats on their taxes it's the ultra wealthy these are people who can hire an army of lawyers um to to an accountants to help rig the system in their favor and they often lobby um even to get special tax provisions to help them now what the irs has told us is if we simply gave them enough staff to deal with pursuing the tax cheats that they know are out there that they could collect billions and billions of extra dollars in revenue every year so this is money to help modernize the irs to help them hire agents to do the enforcement we talk about this as the tax gap the amount between what is owed in taxes and what is actually paid this isn't about any new new tax rules it's not about any additional dollars being owed it's just saying even if we take our tax system today a lot of what we're owed isn't coming in and it should and so this is about closing the tax gap um now there's a bunch of stuff as i've gone through these building blocks of the buildback better act and the infrastructure bill and i'm saying these are the building blocks of having that strong stable globally competitive economy it's about investing in workers it's about creating new jobs it's about making sure we have infrastructure it's about investing in clean energy it's cyber security jobs of the future it's about addressing climate change with things like wildfires national park resilience um as i go through by investing in help reducing costs for families with help help with health care help with college costs help with child care costs as i go through all these things there is probably stuff that i've forgotten so if you have questions i have a very very large binder here um of things and i'm happy to try to look up the answer to your question um but there these are some of really what i think about as the big building blocks some of them like i said child care are well known some of them have not gotten a lot of attention stuff like the cyber security stuff like the money for national parks stuff like the labor violations so that is a bunch of what's in there but it's by no means all of it for example one of the things in the bill that i think is really important is the expansion of medicare we don't even have an m but i don't want i don't want my my wall to come down maybe i can squeeze a really narrow little m in here um the expansion of medicare to cover hearing and right now medicare does not cover hearing meaning if seniors have hearing loss they're not getting that they're not able to pay for hearing aids and that for many seniors increases isolation makes it harder for them to take care of themselves and so expanding medicare to cover hearing that's another example of something that i didn't even fit in these building blocks okay here's another question all right this is a question um from jane from garden grove um and she says how quickly will the buildback better act help with child care costs what timeline can we expect love this question because this is something that i am still fighting for um as the buildback better act passed the house and went over to the senate there's been a lot of concern and i have some of these too about what might get taken out right senator manchin has said he's not sure he supports or he doesn't support paid leave maybe he's going to take it out but there's also an opportunity in the senate to make the bill back better bill better that's another better make the buildback better build better and one of the ways we can do that is by making the child care assistance start sooner so right now there's a ramp in period of about three years before for example providers start seeing that additional pay those providers need that additional pay today why because once we're providing additional pay for child care workers we'll see more people come into that field we'll see more people choosing to work in child care and that will help us help those child care providers whether they're small providers or bigger ones hire more workers expand the slots so i talk about this as a problem of urgency we need to make sure that child care is universal and urgent um and so we need to make sure that that it comes in faster so right now the way it's set up is it would start by helping the lower income families first those are at or below one hunt their state median income and so for california the state median income for a family of four is about 105 000 so if you're below that you get help starting in year one then for those below i think it's 125 of state median income then below 150 percent of state median income then finally in year three below 250 of state median income there's no reason not to start addressing the cost of child care now especially not when we know that women's workforce participation is at a 30-year low and we saw even before the pandemic when californians were surveyed and asked what is their biggest expense they said child care ahead of even things like housing and college um and and health care child care and so we need to begin to help all of the families who are going to get benefits from this program immediately and help make sure the workers are getting the additional pay so the answer is under the version that the house passed three years until the full benefit phases in for for everyone who's going to be eligible i think we should begin doing that now and i think we should make the program also universal everybody is going to pay up people are going to pay 7 no more than seven percent of their income meaning people who earn more will pay more so you don't need to cut it off at a certain percentage of median income and by the way if anybody out there knows today what percentage of state median income you're earning i would be shocked i have no idea that is not a figure or a number that people know so it's just going to create a lot of expensive and needless bureaucracy trying to figure out who should or should not be part of getting help with child care costs the better thing to do is to let everyone be part of the program and families that make more um families that are sort of above toward the higher end of the income spectrum they have to spend up to seven percent of their income before the government begins to bring down those costs all right more questions i think i mean a little sip of dr pepper i've done a lot of talking um all right great question will this cover dental for the elderly so right now we talked about how medicare currently doesn't cover hearing and that's in the bill to address that medicare also though doesn't currently cover vision or dental and right now as the bill passed the house we don't have that expansion to cover dental or vision and we should we should so one of the things that some of the senators are working on is trying to find ways to pay for that and be able to do it hearings in vision i hope we can get in it doesn't cost that much dental costs a little more but there are still a lot of ways to pay for that vision and pay for that dental so that our seniors can really get comprehensive health care from medicare and so not yet but i hope that it happens and so i encourage you call your senators call your representatives let them know that you want to see medicare expanded to cover dental and in fact there have been some discussions about different ways that we could adjust the salt cap to target the salt health to middle class americans not to the ultra wealthy and that could actually addressing salt could actually generate revenue that we could put toward paying for the expansion of dental or the expansion of medicare to cover vision and that's certainly something that i would support all right more questions they are just rolling in okay this is a question from carolyn from anaheim she is a full-time er nurse thank you for your work carolyn um and she's also a part-time caregiver for her father and carolyn says are there provisions relating to home care workers particularly those taking care of seniors um and so the answer is yes we talked a little bit about the home care expan the home care money 150 billion dollars to expand the number of openings for medicare home and community-based care that's going to be for seniors and people with disabilities through the medicaid program um there's also 20 billion dollars in the build back better act for training to help workers who do caregiving to help make sure that they earn a wage a living wage to make sure that we address the shortage of home care workers and to make sure that we are making sure the people who need to hire home care um are able to get it so what we see right now is people like you carolyn very busy working very hard to care for us when we're in the er you people who have a full-time job and if they could hire a little bit of help um with uh with a elderly family member who needs home care or or for a relative or friend with a person with a disability they would but they simply can't find a care worker or they can't afford that care so yes there is help in buildback better act for that um so thank you everyone for tuning in um there are a lot of a lot of letters up here and it's really not you know it's not even the beginning of what all the important investments are and going to be in the bill again this is the building blocks that we need to have a strong stable globally competitive economy many of our competitor nations have long been making investments in green energy in in cyber security um in universal pre-k um in in reducing the price of drugs and making sure um that they have tax fairness this is about modernizing our economy so that will be strong and stable for years to come and that is something that benefits every single american so as you look at this this these building blocks you look at this sort of pyramid of blocks that i've drawn on the whiteboard you might say well i don't have any kids so i'm not going to benefit from universal preschool or i already went to college and i paid off my loan so i'm not going to benefit from a pell grant let me be clear every single american young old white brown black urban rural suburban democrat republican independent every one of us benefits from a strong and stable economy and that is what every single one of these building blocks is about from roads and bridges to cyber security to making sure that we're making sure that we're cutting curbing corporate abuse to making sure that we're addressing climate challenges that's what this is about it's about preparing america to be the global leader to have the strong economy and the high-paying jobs to make sure families who work hard can can pay for what they need can take care of themselves at the end of the day and we can see our economy continue to grow so the infrastructure law already in effect really proud and voted for it voted for the buildback better bill and the house it's over in the senate um and what i would like for christmas in case you were wondering is not no offense i have a lot of whiteboard markers um what i really want for christmas is i would like the buildback better bill to pass the senate i would like to see the president sign it and i would like to make sure that my children and yours um and your loved ones are going to have that strong stable globally competitive economy for the future thanks so much everyone for tuning in i really appreciate all the great questions take care

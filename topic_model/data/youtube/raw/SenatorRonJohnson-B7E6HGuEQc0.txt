all right for instant reaction on what should happen next in the wake of these whistleblower claims Senator Ron Johnson chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee joins us senator great to have you with us Shannon or you heard Katherine's reporting there she also makes note that now acting da checks DHS Secretary of McLennan was in a position of authority with CBP when these things were not done so what's the next step bring him to the hill have him answer questions I mean how does this program get moving well we will conduct oversight and this is news to me that they they weren't doing what they should have been doing the DNA test and I'm aware of is really checking for fraudulent families and you know if they were supposed to be doing this as an excuse but it certainly is understandable when macca leaning and CBP and Isis are dealing with this overwhelming problem of primarily people coming as family units in May alone is about 4,600 people per day coming through the border before it would start about 3,500 that's a caravana day that we're having to process and basically were dispersing them all across the country and were highly concerned that a pretty high percentage of those family units are fraudulent families where you have an adult we had the under testimony HSI witness said that a child was sold for 84 dollars when I was down the border there was reports of a three-year-old boy just abandoned in the field I guess when his fraudulent parent didn't need him anymore I mean that is a dimension of this illegal immigration crisis that's not really being talked about is the human trafficking element the abuse to these migrants during the journey and quite honestly once again in America we have reports of them being put in stash houses they're being beaten those beatings are being videotaped the videotapes are sent back to Central America demanding ransom you know people being forced into involuntary servitude it's it's not just the conditions on the border which no nobody likes but it is the the men and women the Border Patrol that I think I really performing heroically trying to quote or cope with this unbelievable and overwhelming situation so I hear from both sides of the aisle the pointing the finger at these horrible circumstances that these young children are being forced into everybody's pointing the finger to different portions of it whether it's the trafficking what's happening at the border in detention those kinds of things but where is the appetite to actually do something to resolve it well I got three Democrats to join me in a letter supporting pilot program I'm calling operation safe return it is meant to rapidly and more accurately determine those individuals that clearly don't have even a credible fear claim and safely return them home to safe zones within Central America they exist and so we need to supply a consequence that has we have to start removing people to communicate first in human traffickers that bipartisan basis were not going to allow you to exploit our broken system and also the people of Central America don't in debt yourself these human traffickers don't mortgage your home don't pay them years with salary don't subject yourself keep children to a very dangerous journey and maybe some pretty bad conditions even in America if you're putting in one of these stash houses or fortunate voluntary involuntary servitude one of the critics of this operation safe return writes this they're being given to the people coming here being given talking points about their status that including saying they're being persecuted because of their beliefs this is easy to say and difficult to prove they don't think it's gonna solve the problem long-term well I'm not looking at as a total solution I'm looking at as a very first step to get that data we don't really have the solid data in terms of how many people really fail even the credible claim here my guess was very few that would be informative right there we're gonna actually have Gao and DHS IG personnel monitoring this and give us the metrics right away so we can adjust the program but know this is strictly a pilot program and the goal again would be to show Central Americans that on a bipartisan basis we're gonna say no we're going to stop this we're not gonna let you exploit our laws it's gonna take some time I'm not saying this is a panacea but it's a first step we're almost out of time I have to ask you very quickly if you want to comment on the budget deal that's coming together a number of fiscal conservatives saying they're very upset about it that it doesn't you know deliver any of the discipline that the White House seemed to say would be part of any deal well it's my concern is well I've been here nine years now we just see the deja vu over and over again these deals being done doesn't include really Congress is just a few you know leaders that come up with these deals but you just either increase the debt ceiling or suspend it without putting forward any structural reforms in my own committee we passed the preventing government shutdown Act if you don't pass appropriation bills you just fund government choose levels you completely and government shutdowns I'm calling on both chambers to take that bill up pass it and we could put a lot of this to rest all right well watch is this budget deal comes together and comes to a vote where you have to make a decision we'll see in the coming weeks thank you all right what are

thank you Mr chairman and thank you to the witnesses for being here today 710 days 710 days that's the number of days that we have we have been sworn in the 117th Congress and we have had five subcommittee hearings in full three full committee hearings on trade that's it we are a global partner in a global economy and we have been sitting idly by why the rest of the world advances eight days out of 710 has been our level of Engagement as a committee in the trade world that is anemic that is something that is that is unacceptable and quite candidly it's just political malpractice each of you have made a comment about how important it is that we are engaged in a global economy to grow jobs and and protect the environment something that we can all agree on something that we should be doing and trade enforcement is important but we have to be growing our presence around the world and we have to be opening up new markets for many of our products and thinking about where we are with GSP and MTB the fact that we have not addressed that well while there is wild I mean wide bipartisan support again is malpractice it's something that this committee should have been that should have already done and the administration should have taken up already the topic that we're talking about today is important it's important to me as a Georgian because I look at the forest landowners and the timber producers in my great state of Georgia and when there are illegal products that are dumped onto the market it hurts us and so we should be working on the enforcement econ mechanisms for multiple reasons but we should also be expanding markets and look at the looking at the things that we have done here in the U.S to make our forests better more sustainable and to make our wood products better better able to be exported around the world we've mentioned conversations about dealing with energy in the in the European union we need to be talking about trade um and with Timber Products into the EU we don't we need to be knocking down barriers so that American Producers can export around the world I believe that our strong economy is focused and should be focused on three major things number one having the right tax environment number two having the right regulatory environment and having the right education environment doing all of those things to make America the most competitive place in the world to do business and making us the most competitive exporter globally we should do this at a very very high level unfortunately we have been moving in the wrong direction looking at doing things that actually make us less competitive around the world we need to be focused on doing things that make American workers the most productive in the world by by allowing investment in creativity and research and development then when this great nation produces a product we need to protect that intellectual property at all costs it's the one thing we do in America better than anywhere else in the world which is to invent and innovate and solve The World's problems and yet this Administration continues continues with the World Trade Organization to dabble and give in the trips waiver to give away the intellectual property for our covet vaccines that is absolutely wrong and it's misguided and it sets a dangerous precedent and a very slippery slope to begin to give away our intellectual property we should protect it at all costs we invented it we've made the investment in it our companies are doing well in it we need to sell that around the world so I hope and Mr chairman you know again a very important topic both in terms of protecting our markets and in terms of protecting the environment something that we can all agree on but let's not sit idly by rather why the rest of the world passes Us by eight days of committee hearings not a single markup in 710 days and the rest of the world is moving past us we cannot sit back this committee has a responsibility and is charged with being engaged in Trade Practices I believe fully when we when we are in the majority that you will see a much different stance from this committee engaging on trade and it's not at the expense of just the you know of enforcement we should do everything we should be expanding agreements we should be expanding Market access we should be making this country more competitive we should be protecting our intellectual property we should be doing all of those things while we do enforcement it's not one of the other it's all of the above and so with that Mr chairman thank you for your commitment to make sure that our markets and our our environment is protected but let's make sure that we're doing everything that we can to grow the American economy in a sustainable way let's make sure that we are engaged early and often in trade agreements and let's not have the anemic approach that we've seen over the last two years it is important that we are leading the world in this regard and for no other reason make an industry in your District pick an industry in your state that's important like Timber is in mind and let's find a way to make America not only the greatest country to do business but the best export opportunity for for our workers and our businesses around the country that is Mr chairman I will yield back

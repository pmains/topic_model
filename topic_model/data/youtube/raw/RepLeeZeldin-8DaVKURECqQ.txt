and Thank You mr. chairman I rise today in favor of your resolution demonstrating our support for the Iranian people's cry for democracy on December 28th 2017 tens of thousands of Iranians courageously poured into the streets to protest the brutality of President rouhani's regime instead of caring for its own people the Iranian regime focuses all of its energy on suffocating their crime murdering protesters while choking off communication via the internet and social media apps we've been down this road before this is our second chance the Iranian people smothered by their own government look to us and instead of the chill of silence this time they're rightfully met with the full immediate and resounding support of the United States we stand in solidarity with the millions of Iranians desperate for support to help them turn the tide in Tehran and all throughout Iran

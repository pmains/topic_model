as as brie and maddie and stephanie are well aware of uh telling the truth in today's cancer culture is not necessarily easy you can pay a pretty heavy price for it so i really appreciate everybody participating in this but the fact is we have close to 750 000 americans who it's now reported died with or from covid 750 thousands in in the us we rank 23rd out of more than 200 nations and that's a bad ranking in terms of number of deaths per hundred thousand we are at 220 people per hundred thousand died from covid now our government officials talked about them not being particularly honest not being particularly transparent we invited them all here none of them showed up president biden for his part in terms of honesty july 21st just a couple of months ago said if you're vaccinated you're not going to be hospitalized you're not going to be in an ic unit you're not going to die you're not going to get coveted if you have these vaccinations he said this is a pandemic on the unvaccinated how i wish he was right when he said these vaccines were going to be that effective if you're not willing to acknowledge the root cause of a of a condition of an injury of a malady of an illness how can you hope to cure that illness how can you help these individuals who participate in some of the trials to benefit humanity how how can you help them fully recover if you're not willing to admit that vaccine injuries are real we are citizens who've done our civic duty but when we experience serious adverse effects were left high and dry by fda cdc the nih and medical professionals we are scientists alarmed by the toxic environment and academia and scientific publishing we are military leaders concerned about vaccine safety in the armed services we are clinicians who want to treat patients harmed by vaccines but whose practices are limited by their employers and professional boards and we are lawyers and patient advocates seeking help for our injured clients and their families we are the people you haven't heard from and we have nothing absolutely nothing to personally gain from being here indeed we have everything to lose including our jobs our titles our livelihoods but we don't intend to go away until we see some real change please i saw five patients in clinic two of which presented with chest pain days to weeks after vaccination and were subsequently diagnosed with pericarditis and worked up to rule out myocarditis the third pilot had been vaccinated and felt like he was drunk chronically fatigued within 24 hours after vaccination the pilot told me he didn't know what to do so he drank a lot of coffee to try and quote wake himself up and continue to fly until he realized it wasn't going away after i reported to my command my concerns that in one morning i had to ground three out of three pilots due to vaccine injuries the next day my patient patients were canceled my charts were pulled for review and i was told that i would not be seeing acute patients anymore just healthy pilots there for their flight physical there's a concept of the tenth man the loyal dissenter that's the person that you select to be the dissenting opinion to prevent group think patients are entitled to a second opinion on their medical care what happens when bureaucrats mandate that there is no dissenting opinion my family and i messed up stayed indoors and dodged covent for over a year we did what was asked of us by being part of the solution that solution has taken everything from me and my family we have been ignored and silenced it is not right and it needs to stop now it is time for the federal government to do its part by acknowledging us and helping us does anyone really think it's fair to make the vaccine injured wait years for help i think we can all agree that refusing and or delaying the help we need is unconscionable we urgently need this help i was the father of a 16 year old son a single parent i raised my boy since he was a baby he meant the world to me i got the vaccine to protect my son and after in march april they're announcing this out it was safe for teenagers me and my sons have never been apart we're always together he was my best friend he always told me it was beautiful against the world we got the prize vaccine because i thought it was to protect him i thought it was the right thing to do it was like playing russian roulette my government lied to me they said it was safe now i go home to an empty house where i used to get wake him up i'd give him a hug and a kiss time i'm going to school don't miss school i'd get home from work he'd come running out he knew when i get home he'd come run out give me a hug i give him a kiss a hug what do you want to go eat today like i said he was my baby boy everybody knew we're always together like i said next week is his birthday you know what i'm going to celebrate his birthday at while everybody once we leave here they're going to forget about what we're doing or what they talk about what we said here they're going to be enjoying time with their family and kids thanksgiving i'm going to spend at the cemetery christmas at that cemetery because in december 17th 2020 they did a study and they knew they caused heart conditions to teenagers why wasn't this information released until october 1st this year if we would have known this my son would be here with me so i figured like i said they murdered my son and the other people that are suffering these kids with all these side effects that's child abuse right there i mean why isn't something being done i mean this should be pushed that we don't let anybody hurt our children i just want to say thank you to dr fauci to the fda heads cdc nih everyone for not showing up to this meeting and not listening to us i really appreciate it i'm glad that you have our interest at heart this message is kind of for you it's a message on how what's happening has broke my heart literally and figuratively with our country my name is kyle warner i'm a 29 year old professional mountain bike racer and three-time national champion for most of my life i have focused on being as healthy and positive as possible and inspiring other people to do the same this spring when the current administration was urging young healthy americans to get vaccinated to help end this war on the pandemic i stepped up i wanted to serve the greater good i wanted to help fight this war not because i was afraid of covid but because my country asked me to you told me this vaccine is safe and effective period in june i joined the rapidly growing number of young men who developed pericarditis post mrna vaccine that is the inflammation of the liner surrounding the heart that condition along with pots and reactive arthritis have completely brought an end to life as i knew it i have been bedridden unable to work and unable to exercise for months i fear that my career has officially been ended we were told we were fighting a war against the pandemic and the question in the air is will you leave your troops behind yet again i'm not asking you to end the vaccine program by any means all i'm asking is for some transparency and acknowledgement of what is happening so that we as a country can have an honest discussion of the risks i believe where there is risk there must be choice and without acknowledging that people are being seriously injured and dying we are doing a great disservice to the american people i very willingly followed the recommendation of the cdc and received my second pfizer shot at that point my whole life changed i'm currently on disability but i work in corporate social responsibility i was previously an active long-distance biker and triathlete i had no known underlying health conditions and i live a very very healthy lifestyle i was used to high energy highly motivated lifestyle i love keeping my body and my mind strong and disciplined since i became injured i have very little motivation or energy and i'm in a constant state of extreme fatigue i struggled to retrieve words i was valedictorian in my high school and to remember things i can't concentrate or focus and my brain is in constant fog and i'm aimlessly wandering through my brain in its torture this is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated this is a pandemic of trauma we're unnecessarily traumatized due to our cases being overlooked misdiagnosed and hidden we aren't being believed in our faith in media and the government is faltering we are now being mandated to do something to our bodies that we know can cause problems we think at a minimum the public has the right to know this is a possibility before they make their choice to be vaccinated mandates will not stop covid it will just continue the divide and cause feelings of anxiety people will naturally fight flight or freeze when they feel threatened i wasn't afraid of the shot when i received it i was excited to do my part for my country but where is my country for me now now that i'm injured i would on june 29 2021 my happy predictable daily life came to a screeching halt i lost my ability to speak naturally i have become unable to walk without a walker and never know if or when the tremors will come or go i can no longer cook clean or even pick up and hold my baby for too long before my body begins to shake uncontrollably or is thrown into excruciating amounts of pain it has become the loneliest and most isolating experience i've had in my 35 years of life i have been made to feel that i do not matter to those in western medicine that i have nothing more than an annoyance and waste of time i deserve to be heard and treated with compassion but instead i have been called a liar and a fake and i have even been told by the er doctors that this is all in my head and that there is nothing medically wrong with me to the point where they called a social worker to have me evaluated and tried to have me committed to western state mental health hospital my life has been turned upside down but i will continue to push forward and fight for the same medical rights and treatment as those who are not in my current position it's time to stop allowing doctors and nurses to treat us with such disgust and demand they be held accountable for their incompassion and treatment of covet vaccine injured people in demand they stop ignoring and dismissing what's happening to thousands of us around the world let's talk about deaths the ultimate signal as of october 25th fears logged over 9 000 us-based reports of deaths after vaccination globally it exceeds 17 thousand reported into the veer system how can any thinking person not look at these data and ask just what on earth is going on critics rightly note that virus doesn't allow causality between exposure and outcome indeed fears only provides signals important signals a need to further investigate regarding veer's reported deaths cdc's webpage states a review of available clinical information including death certificates autopsy and medical record records has not established a causal link to covet 19 vaccines i want to know where are these medical charts and autopsy report reviews we are making critical decisions about mass vaccination in vulnerable populations based on little to no data in last week's verb pack meeting on pfizer's eua request for children 5-11 committee member and new england journal of medicine editor-in-chief eric rubin acknowledge the dearth of pediatric safety data by stating we're not going to get the data until we start using this vaccine our children are our data we need to ask what is the purpose of vares and other pharmacovigilance data systems if we have mandates why even do any post marketing surveillance the reason cannot be to gather more information to make an informed personal choice because with mandates the vaccination decision has already been made for us by governments by schools by employers where the myocarditis myocarditis occurs in one in 500 young people or 1 in 10 000 is mood because mandates coerce individuals to take the vaccine or lose their educational employment opportunities and otherwise be shunned by society this is the first trial any of my kids have ever been in i never had considered ever putting them in a trial before but this seemed like you know when they asked if they could be in it it seemed like a win-win you know so it's been over nine months since she got her second dose she can't walk she's in a wheelchair she is an ng tube for all of her nutrition she has constant pain in her stomach back and neck she was over there laying on chairs because she can't make it through this she can't feel her legs and that's just the tip of the iceberg if they minimalize maddie's reaction to the vaccine like this i wonder what really happened to those in the clinical trials who had a reaction to the sec the first dose they never got to have the second dose that means they're out of the trial they're disqualified i wonder what else was hidden in either the pfizer trial or any of the other ones because i know there was things there were things they did neither pfizer the fda or the cdc has ever talked to us or attempted to we have never heard anything from them ever and i just file it in theirs also still didn't hear anything so that is outrageous i mean not only totally cast aside but i think what you described in your testimony would i would determine as a cover-up the heads of the nih fda and cdc have known first hand about my case and thousands of others these direct reports began as early as last december i along with several injured physicians continued to reach out to the fda through emails phone calls we did video conferences with peter marks and janet woodcock constant emails with janet woodcock and myself directly we have literally asked and we have begged repeatedly for them to acknowledge these reactions they declined they know about their lack they know that their lack of acknowledgement has recreated created insurmountable barrier to our ability to receive medical care from doctors who rely on these agencies for information they know about the issues with the clinical trials they know about the deaths they know about the lack of follow-up on bears they know about the injuries to children they know about maddie i have discussed maddie with them they know about the mandates imposed on the injured they know about the suicides as the results of months-long suffering they know about the aggressive censorship they know about the media censorship they know about the scientific censorship they know all of it and they have for months cdc fda nih we do exist your system is broken and you know it you are constantly and persistently telling the public that your review of the data is thorough and your safety signaling systems are robust when in reality there is huge gaps in your system every single step of the way you are not taking care of those who suffer severe adverse reactions stop telling the public that you are your refusal to take action means there will be more like us take responsibility for your role in the suffering of good americans who did their part by taking the vaccine and had no idea this could happen to them here's your proper informed consent if you get coveted you will get medical help but i'm fret i'm afraid to tell you if you have this reaction that reaction that reaction mattie's reaction doug's reaction you are on your own the government won't help you the drug companies won't help you your medical teams will have no idea what to do with you financially you will be on your own i would like to finish with a letter from a friend that i received a couple of months ago free i cannot take this any longer this has taken everything away from me my career my family my life my body will not stop attacking itself and this is beyond the worst amount of torture they have further erased my very existence please accept my apologies i must bid farewell to this world please tell our stories please make sure the world knows the cruelty that has been imposed upon us goodbye my dear friend i will see you on the flip side rachelle wolinski janet woodcock peter marks anthony fauci you erased her and the many others like her their blood is on your hands you cannot bring my friends back but you can save others from their fate if you finally just tell the truth if the government won't help us if the drug companies won't help us who will help us describe what facebook did to your support groups they found us and quickly pulled us apart they eliminated every single person in those groups and we lost contact with a lot of people that were in crisis so you mentioned your testimony that nih knows about this cdc knows about this fda knows about this i appreciate what media came here but not only did we invite these agency heads we invited mainstream media or more mainstream media and of course they didn't show up in our milwaukee event in june we actually had you know probably a couple dozen cameras we had media show up but unfortunately not to tell these stories they showed up and this isn't about me but basically so they could then attack me as an anti-vaxxer rather than in the papers across wisconsin above the fold stories of bree and matty ken rucker's wife they didn't tell the stories instead they just had a picture of me with the headlines so fundamentally dangerous that's what we're up against that's what these people are up against this is why they're pleading and begging for help that since data is fundamental to scientif the scientific process surely it must be available but it wasn't then for tamiflu and it isn't today for coveted vaccines in fact if you're interested in analyzing the data for safe pfizer's trial you'll have to wait until may 2025 before you can even request it from the company for moderna they recently said that the data quote may be available with publication of the final study results in 2022 end quote and since the trial is not officially to end until october 2022 we're probably talking late 2022. so yes the trial has still not ended and yes doctors and researchers who want to see the clinical trial data will have to wait another year from now before getting access for j j try next july if you weren't aware that the data were inaccessible i suspect this is because so few healthcare practitioners and researchers are accustomed to conducting an independent review of the raw data so there's little outcry when those data are inaccessible so while we're told to keep following the science what we are following is not a scientific process based on open data we're following a process in which the data are treated as secret and in my view there's something very unscientific about that the point i'm trying to make is fairly simple the data for coveted vaccine trials isn't available and it won't be available for years yet we are not just asking but mandating millions of people take these products whatever word you wanted to want to use to describe this situation without data it's not science i'm just not safe to work as an orthopedic surgeon after my diagnosis i brought up the question of whether my condition could be related to the modernicovid vaccine that i received i asked my employer to report her to theirs i was aware that the uk astrazeneca covid vaccine trial was delayed twice because of three cases of transverse myelitis assuming the fda and the cdc would be alarmed at my diagnosis i expected to be contacted soon after my ver's submission no phone call no contact in fact weeks passed i then contacted the cdc myself they acknowledged my various submission but stated my reaction was categorized as not serious as i had not been hospitalized and i hadn't died i have never heard from the cdc again no contact with nah no contact from the fda i notified modernity directly numerous times and asked that i'd be contacted no one from moderna ever contacted me one word describes how i felt in the first few months after my diagnosis abandoned by august i literally exploded in generalized body neuropathies imagine waking up in the middle of the night stinging in my hands and feet burning in the soles of my feet prickling all over like i fell in a bush of nettles crazy thing is social media you're there you're looking for support you find support they suddenly tag you misinformation you're not real you're an anti-vaxxer you devolve into more despair to date not a single doctor i saw and i saw many many the list is long i know all their names i saved all their emails of what they said to me and what they couldn't say and didn't say or didn't do not a single one of them logged me in theirs not one all my reports are my own if we mandate vaccines it's clear we need to mandate manufacturers and government institutions to step up and investigate us it's not right it's immoral reactions are real they're a part of science i got unlucky but it's unethical to hide them even if it's for some greater motive a real example of our own government being egregious in their behavior to hide it i direct you to osha's website it's right there they are not enforcing recording requirements of worker side effects mandate mandated to get the covet 19 vaccine go to their website it's there clear as day they don't enforce reporting that's my own government i dedicated my life to medicine and helping people heartbreakingly i ended up in the realm of the injured but the real tragedy is not only the lack of adequate medical support but the active and coordinated denial of our situations even by my own colleagues finally i want you to know that i was never the activist type i never pictured myself being here but fear and despair have changed me this experience has shattered my life like all of you i know where you are the 24 7 tinnitus has robbed me of every moment of silence and peace the impact on my medical career which i love and work so hard for is immeasurable i will continue to fight i will continue to research i will find an answer for people again i want to thank everybody for participating you know particularly those of you who have suffered the injuries from the vaccine i know this is arduous i know this is tough for you to travel but i appreciate it i do want to point out for anybody watching this via video even here in in the hall even though these individuals look pretty normal these injuries are severe the inner vibrations that some of these people are experiencing are so severe i just quick to ask bree she personally knows seven people who have committed suicide because the inner vibrations their symptoms were so severe they just simply could not go on with life she knows another 15 people who have committed suicide from other members of their group so again the injuries don't necessarily be visible to be real to be severe to be life-altering it is again unfortunate way way more than unfortunate it's actually outrageous that our health care agencies the president united states members of his administration are completely ignoring these people and their plight the courage it takes to come forward you know i can testify too the repercussions are quite grave the vilification the suppression of what you're trying to say the censorship people have been on this journey with me have been fired from their institutions they've been sued their careers and their lives have they known it have been ended so that's why you have that's why you have so very few people that are willing to come forward their medical license are threatened the the profession that they train for decades to get good at could be taken away from them so you understand why they're remaining silent but i will say one of the biggest impediments to further progress on this is just the basic human tendency to never admit you're wrong president biden won't admit he's wrong when he says that this is a pandemic of the envax that if you get the vaccine all's going to be well the heads of these agencies will never admit they were going to be they were wrong my colleagues who voted for the vaccines who have done videos encouraging everybody to get vaccinated which by the way that might be the right advice for certain people they don't want to admit they're wrong doctors physicians who've recommended to patients to get the vaccine don't want to admit that their recommendation might have caused a severe harm it's understandable i understand that human tendency but that doesn't overcome the basic humanity of acknowledging reality and doing everything we can as as a society those of us that voted for operation war speed those of us that encourage vaccination we have to admit there's a side effect here and has changed people's lives forever so again i'm begging anybody watching this today or via video first of all share the video share with every contact you have let these stories be seen let these stories be heard let them be believed so that as society we can do the right thing we can acknowledge it we can put even just a fraction of the time and effort resources as we've put into the shutdowns and the mass mandates and the vaccine mandates and the vaccine development and the administration of it if we just take a fraction of that and apply it to research and treatment and by the way a vaccine injury fund that actually compensates those who did what everybody asked them to do for them themselves for the good for the good of their neighbors for the good of society the least we can do with the trillions of dollars we've already allocated and spent the least we can do is acknowledge their pain help them recover and compensate them for their injuries

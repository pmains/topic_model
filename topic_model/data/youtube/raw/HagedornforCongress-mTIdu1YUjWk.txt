good afternoon here on k ay t we have a very special guest in studio mr. Jim Hagedorn he's the endorsed Republican candidate running for the 1st congressional district and mr. hagedorn good afternoon to you well thank you it's a pleasure to be with your poll now let's talk a little bit about who you are people might not be familiar with you the person may be the familiar with you the candidate as you did run in 2014 so for those listening who aren't familiar maybe a little bit of your background if you would sure I'm a product of southern Minnesota i was born in blue earth was raised on a grain and livestock farm just a few miles outside of truman a small town over there in martin county my father Tom Hagedorn was congressman here many years ago in the 70s and 80s and I worked for congressman out in Washington named stanlon we did good things like work for welfare Second Amendment rights we supported farming in pro-life positions and then I had a gig or two in Washington assay executive in the Treasury Department where i downsized my own federal agency probably the only person ever to run for Congress that actually made the Washington DC smaller and more accountable to the taxpayer so we've been running here for I was on the ballot in 2014 we had a 5446 percent result against the incumbent Tim Walz we didn't spend much money in that race so we're back in this time working harder working longer trying to get in front of the people again it's a big district 21 counties the first District so sometimes a big district like this you have to build it up and we're taking our message every corner it's just a it's just a pleasure to be with you today now let's let's talk a little bit about that background southern Minnesota guy small town mentality is that the type of view if elected you'd bring to Washington absolutely I'm growing up in a small rural community growing up on a farm there's something about that it instills in you some deep appreciation for agriculture a deep appreciation for how family farming sustains our rural areas and creates economic opportunities one of the things that's really concerning me now is that we see the AG economy tightening commodity prices or continue lo the input costs are high we have a glut of product and then the median income for farmers unfortunately at a 20-year low and we all understand the ups and downs of farming I mean my father grandfather and great-grandfather were all southern Minnesota farmer so I get it but what we don't understand is when our congressman out in Washington Tim Walz is voting for liberal policies that are driving up farmers and agricultural costs these EPA regulations coming out of Washington that he's supported are just egregious driving up costs Obamacare you know there are people in this district now farmers and others spending ten to twenty five thousand dollars a year on premiums with deductible so high that the underlying insurance is worthless that's that's crushing them and on these high energy costs we need us energy independence not these global warming extremist policies that will also support it with Obama that's driving up everyone's costs so I think those are the types of things I do for the farmers and for agribusiness which in turn would support our small rural communities now I know recently you've got you've got woz d that was passed through Congress is that something that you'd look at trying to fix when it comes to how the EPA and all those people come together and it seems any drop of water a puddle on a farm could be looked at it one of those bodies of water you're talking about the waters of the United States regulation coming out of Obama's EPA and it honestly it would be like weaponizing the federal government against our farmers we cannot allow that to happen the current congressman Tim Walz voted for that regulation twice before he finally voted against it but I think we need somebody is going to be for the farmers a hundred percent one of the ways that we can fix these things this Congress should take back its regulatory authority it's we shouldn't allow EPA and other agencies to put these regulations out there effectively laws without Congress having to approve them and so there's a bill out there called the reins Act the Republicans have brought this up continuously and it says that Congress must be required to vote YES on all these major regulations like waters of the United States I support that wholeheartedly that's a way to defeat the EPA congressman Walz has voted against that bill repeatedly now you talk a little bit about energy independence how would you go about bringing that energy independence especially here in southern Minnesota well you know when you talk energy independence we have to understand one thing the only energy source that the United States is dependent upon foreign sources for is crude oil we are a hundred percent self-sufficient and every energy source except crude oil so i support an all-of-the-above approach to get us to achieve us energy independence and then I also support very strongly the infrastructure needed in order to efficiently use our energy resources pipelines distribution points refineries we need to be building those so we can efficiently use those sources and keep downward pressure on cost the united states became a great economic power in large measure because we had reliable abundant low cost us energy and that is a policy we have to get back to these global warming policies that artificially stop us from using coal oil gas and other sources are disgrace the congressman has repeatedly voted for these things these epa regulations of obama's driving up people's electricity costs driving up your fuel costs making us less competitive around the world frankly he's so extreme on the issue that i always say he worships at the altar of mother earth and as high priest is Al Gore we need somebody in Washington that's going to support our US economy and try to keep some money in consumers pockets rather than having them spent it for higher energy costs talking with Republican candidate jim i adorn he's running for the 1st congressional district here today on Kate we talked a little bit about those rural values that you have one of those has to be fiscal responsibilities that's something that you are firm wholeheartedly believing in I'll tell you what you know what what's going on in Washington our economy unfortunately is anemic and where were in trouble and we can lose our American Way of life is with the 19 trillion-dollar national debt the debt when you know the congressman said when he went to Washington ten years ago he promised to do something about the national debt I thought that meant make it smaller but since he's been there it's gone from eight and a half trillion dollars up to past 19 trillion dollars and we're financing that at one percent interest when interest rates ratchet up the interest on the debt is going to consume our economy so the problem you're a couple problems here one is the national debt of 19 trillion is larger than our entire economy and it's growing faster than our entire economy so what we need to do to deal with that obviously we need to reform government be fiscally conscientious but we also have to grow our economy if we don't have massive economic growth we are going to be suffocated by this debt and I think the best way to have massive economic growth and help people create high wage jobs and have better lives is to weed out excessive government in our economy we talked about regulatory reform we need tax reform so people are in charge of how to spend their money not the politicians and the interest groups we we need welfare reform so folks are out there working for their welfare if they're able bodied and being self-sufficient and not dependent on government and then getting rid of programs like Obamacare and replacing them with free market reforms that's that's critical and US energy independence we hear in the news all the time now you hear about Isis you hear about ISIL terrorism things of that nature we're in the heartland is that something that we should be concerned with in your opinion well we have to be concerned with it because it's a global problem and you see the destabilization in the Middle East you know the Obama administration inherited a relatively stable Middle East with a lot of actors that were pro-american they went and undermine that they withdrew troops out of Iraq that has created a vacuum Isis has filled it the top of the government in Egypt that was a problem Libya look at that war that Clinton had against Qadhafi that walls supported my goodness that is completely to stabilize to everything and given us this refugee crisis so in the United States we have to make sure that we protect the people from radical Islam we should not be allowing hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people to come to the United States from countries that hate us at this point I think I've called for a refugee program time out because we don't know what's going on we need to figure that out and the reason it's it's a concern obviously people are dying in it and it's a problem in that respect but when events like 911 happened it is takes an enormous toll on the United States economy it hurts people physically it hurts us psychologically and we just can't allow that to happen radical Islam is a true enemy and we must eradicate it the talking with Jim Hagedorn today now the apparent Republican nominee for president is Donald Trump I think a lot of people either are really four door they're still kind of shrugging the shoulders if they follow the republican party at all what's your view of having Donald Trump as the presidential candidate for the Republican Party well I've said all along whoever Republicans nominate in our Cleveland convention I will support that candidate it looks like it's going to be Donald Trump and I'll be pleased to run with him in the fall you know what's going on right now with between the two political parties is you have a big clear contrast you have Hillary Clinton over here with Tim Walz and what do they offer they offer Obama's third term they offer a Supreme Court that is going to take away our Second Amendment rights take away our religious liberties and you know on the other side we have Republicans that want to have serious reform of Washington solutions that are going to take power from Washington give it back to the states and the American people and we want to protect our god-given rights the right to life the right to keep and bear arms and the right to religious freedom so it's going to be a clear contrast offer stark choices for the people and I'm excited about the race in November we're excited for you you can find out more information Jim Hagedorn orj candidate Hagedorn I want to thank you for stopping by and sharing some time with us today thank you Paul is a pleasure

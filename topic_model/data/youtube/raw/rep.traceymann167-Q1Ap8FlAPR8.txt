mr speaker i rise today in defense of kansas farmers and ranchers who have the right to manage their own resources without overreaching regulation from the federal government the byte administration is hurting farmers ranchers and ag business owners recently they withdrew from the navigable waters protection rule which sought to undo the harm caused by waters of the united states or wotus rule from 2015 through which the federal government aimed to exact regulatory control over nearly all bodies of water regardless of size or connection to larger waterways because of this legislative mess farmers and ranchers have had to conduct their businesses under three different regulatory definitions of water in just the past six years on a farm water's the lifeblood of the operation and farmers in kansas don't need the federal government to tell them how to take care of it our farmers and ranchers are the original conservationists who continually update their practices to reduce water use and inputs to produce safe affordable food while maintaining their water supply for generations to come instead of worrying about what farmers in kansas are doing with their puddles the administration should instead focus on curbing inflation getting americans back to work fixing the supply chain and securing our borders

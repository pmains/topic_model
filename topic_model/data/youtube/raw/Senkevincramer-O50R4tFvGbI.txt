thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr Goffman for being here um and for your willingness to continue to serve um and actually this this most recent unams consent request raises a really important Point um I was a utility regulator through a lot of the Sox knocks Mercury particulate matter reductions and guess what we did in those days we had cooperative federalism where the federal agencies and the state agencies and the stakeholders were all in it together they spent millions and billions of dollars to make these upgrades for the benefit of the people we serve and we didn't have what we see today which brings me to my first point and question that I wanted to raise with you because as a strong advocate of cooperative federalism um I I just I just think we are we are we're missing the opportunity and I'm going to go back to something you and I have talked about before and that was your proposed clean power plan rule back in the day um that that would have required North Dakota to reduce its emissions 11 no we weren't crazy about that and our stakeholders weren't crazy about it but we knew it was doable and we were willing to to do our part and then when the final rule came out it was 400 percent greater than the 11 the bait and switch that I've talked about before and it to 45 which was absolutely well it wasn't it was federalism the way it's not supposed to be done um and the last time you were here which was May of last year so nine months ago I asked you a question about working with my state Regulators the three Public Service Commissioners um our DEQ director and you you said something to the fact that I'm glad you'd asked that because I was going to ask you for their contact information so we could reach out so I reached out to them last week and in the last nine months they've not heard from you or anybody in your shop to talk about the replacement rule were are they wrong did they just forget or did you forget or what could you clear cleared this up for me uh thank you for for pointing that out uh Senator and I'm I have to say I'm disappointed in myself and uh in not having ensured that we made uh made those contacts um uh but I hope uh you and your and your colleagues in in North Dakota are willing to go with better late than never um we uh are going to be moving forward with uh as I mentioned Senator Cardin a proposal to address uh Mercury emissions from the power sector and we expect to be moving forward later this spring with a proposal to address CO2 emissions and what uh I anticipate will do and now that you've brought this up I'll make sure we'll do is as those proposals are public being publicly shared for common well before we finalize them we will uh engage directly um with uh with with your colleagues in in North Dakota um up until this point um a number of senior people in the office of Aaron radiation have engaged in lots of discussions across the country I think I may have mentioned to you last time that we've engaged with the utility Commissioners through uh through neighborhood and I believe uh when Senator capito and I were talking about reliability I mentioned that we also spent a lot of time talking to to grid operations yeah well I had hoped in that casting of very wide net we had captured well you didn't but we but cooperative federalism needs to be more deliberate than reaching out to New York which I was a member of neighbor for half of my term I was always a member I just came to the realization they tend to gravitate to the lowest common denominator then and then have nice meetings but I think you need to reach out you can't just talk to people you agree with and that that's my sense is it you're not down to people that actually do this every single day but all of that said quickly I do want to address another problem or potential problem uh and that is the um the methane rule the proposed methane rule um you know North Dakota has a stricter requirements than any federal rule but it does require doubling you know the paperwork in fact in North Dakota on our methane of course being a byproduct of oil production and so the flaring which is one of these uh flaring is one of the the buyable not the ideal of course method of dealing with venting but um 95 of our is captured on State and and private land 59 on Federal and tribal land in other words North Dakota's Excellence doesn't really want to yield to federal government mediocrity and I just say you know wrap up and then we can get deeper into it in the next round but again federalism cooperative federalism would go a long way if if you didn't impose new restrictions on the excellent States but rather work with them to maybe maybe Empower them a little more at the local level and you might get a better outcome the problem is you Senator Capital raised the issue of Permitting well permitting is the problem on federal lands the permitting of that takeaway capacity for what is now being flared wasted um and uh anyway I think in the next round maybe we can drill down a little more on that one Mr chairman thank you good you want to respond to you very very briefly to that very briefly nothing uh just to say that I remember uh Senator Kramer citing the performance of uh operators in in North Dakota both on private land and public land in terms of the efficiency in avoiding methane Escape methane leaps one of the things we're trying to do with the federal rule is raise the floor for everybody else and in many ways our proposals are based on successful practices that are already in place in States like North Dakota yeah thank you for bringing your uh your expertise and knowledge from a previous part of your life to to this to this

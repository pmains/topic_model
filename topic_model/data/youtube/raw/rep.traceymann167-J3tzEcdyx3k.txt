last night i voted against the unconstitutional bill h.r 7910 today i will vote against red flag laws legislation as a father for young children my heart hurts when i hear about school shootings or any type of violence against children these violent acts however do not give congress permission to take away the constitutional rights of americans who have done nothing wrong house democrats have talked this week about ending the filibuster packing the courts and doing whatever it takes to strip americans of the ability to protect themselves and their families with the firearm president biden has even talked about taking away the nine millimeter which is the most popular handgun in the country leaving law abiding citizens defenseless against lawless rage field people will only lead to more senseless loss of life i've always said that the second amendment to the constitution is a load-bearing wall of the constitution the bulk of my career before i was in congress was in real estate and i've assessed the structure of many buildings over the years to determine their strength and durability i can tell you if you weaken or diminish a load-bearing wall you damage the entire structure and the entire building can come crashing down that's exactly what i fear will happen to the structural foundation of our rights in this country if we let house democrats chip away at the second amendment if these laws are passed the second amendment rights of the american people can be stripped away without due process leaders who were elected to protect the american people's right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness need to be asking the hard questions like why are individuals committing these horrible acts what are the real root causes elected leaders should not be stripping the right to self-defense away from innocent law-abiding people i'm committed to protecting our children helping our neighbors who are hurting and equipping americans with the knowledge and the ability to defend themselves that's why i'm voting against these unamerican bills we should instead be supporting and encouraging not defunding our law enforcement and our police i've co-sponsored legislation to that effect we should be securing our schools i've also co-sponsored good legislation to that effect we should be getting to the root causes of these shootings like mental health alcohol and drug abuse anti-social behavior and alienation broken homes and bullying we should be prosecuting and punishing those who break the law we should be supporting but not diminishing the rights of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves let's address the real issues as your member congress and as an american you'll see me standing against any effort to diminish our constitutional rights

THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLELADY IS RECOGNIZED FOR TWO MINUTES. MS. BONAMICI: I THANK YOU FOR  YOUR LEADERSHIP AND CHAIRMAN  SCOTT AS WELL FOR MAKING THIS  ISSUE AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY IN  THE COMMITTEE. PEDIATRIC EXPERTS DECLARED A  NATIONAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IN  CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. OUR NATION'S STUDENTS CONTINUE  TO FACE SIGNIFICANT AND SERIOUS  CHALLENGES WITH SOCIAL,  EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH. WE MUST MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE-BASED  TREATMENT AND SUPPORT SO THEY  CAN LEARN AND THRIVE. THIS TIMELY LEGISLATION PROVIDES NEEDED RESOURCES AND WILL  GREATLY IMPROVE THE BEHAVIORAL  HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND SCHOOL  STAFF BY BUILDING A PIPELINE OF  SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH  SERVICE PROVIDERS. I JUST WANT TO MENTION THE  BOMBER INSTITUTE, WHICH IS GOING TO BE OPENING SOON IN OREGON FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE. BECAUSE STRESS CAN AFFECT THE  DEVELOPING BRAIN, THIS BILL  INVESTS IN HEAD START TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF YOUNG CHILDREN AND TO SUPPORT STAFF WELLNESS. IMPORTANTLY, THE BILL WILL ALSO  SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH  DISABILITIES BEYOND THEIR HIGH  SCHOOL EDUCATION BY INCLUDING MY BIPARTISAN BILL, THE RESPOND,  INNOVATE, SUCCEED, AND EMPOWER,  OUR RISE ACT. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES FACE  MANY BARRIERS TO EARNING A  DEGREE OR CREDENTIAL AFTER HIGH  SCHOOL. WITHOUT PROPER ACCOMMODATIONS,  STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  COMPLETE COLLEGE AT A LOWER RATE THAN THEIR PEERS WITHOUT  DISABILITIES. LESS THAN 5% OF STUDENTS WITH  DISABILITIES DISCLOSE THEIR  SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY TO  THEIR COLLEGE BECAUSE OF STIGMA. CURRENTLY, STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN EXPENSIVE AND  EXPANSIVE NEW EVALUATIONS BEFORE THEY CAN ACCESS SPECIAL  EDUCATION SERVICES IN COLLEGE. THIS ONEROUS PROCESS POSES  ADDITIONAL UNNECESSARY BARRIERS  TO SUCCESS FOR STUDENTS WITH  DISABILITIES. THE RISE ACT IS BIPARTISAN  LEGISLATION THAT AIMS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WITH  AFFIRMATION, COMFORT, AND PEACE  OF MIND DURING THEIR TRANSITION  FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE BY  ALLOWING COLLEGE STUDENTS TO USE EXISTING DOCUMENTATION OF A  DISABILITY, WHETHER IT'S AN  I.E.P., 504 PLAN OR ANOTHER  DOCUMENTATION. MY BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL RISE  ACT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR  STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES TO  ACCESS THE SUPPORT SERVICES THEY NEED BY EASING THE BURDENSOME  EXPENSIVE AND REDUNDANT  REQUIREMENTS STUDENTS QUEBEC  FREQUENTLY FACE WHEN ENTERING  COLLEGE. THIS ACTION ALONE CAN SAVE  FAMILIES HUNDREDS OR EVEN  THOUSANDS. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES  BUCSHON, SCHRIER, FOR SUPPORTING THE RISE ACT, MR. SCOTT FOR  PUTTING THIS IN THE BILL. AND FOR SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI AND LEADER HOYER BY BRINGING THIS TO THE FLOOR. BY CONSIDERING THIS LEGISLATION, WE'RE SHOWING OUR NATION'S MOST  VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND MAKE OUR SCHOOLS SAFER AND A WELCOMING  PLACE TO LEARN. I A

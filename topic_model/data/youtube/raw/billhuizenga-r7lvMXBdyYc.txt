hi this is congressman bill heisenga in the statuary hall right shortly after the president's speech well we heard tonight a speech that was long on rhetoric very short on details there were some things in there that i agree at least in principle with the president on but again uh it's gonna it's gonna find out the proof is in the pudding what are those details president said somewhere around 19 or 20 times passed this bill well unfortunately there is no bill to pass we'll find uh we'll find out hopefully in the coming weeks what the president is specifically proposing i'm willing to listen and look at that but we need to make sure that we are creating confidence we are creating a way that is going to allow the private sector to grow our way out of this economic morass and that is something i can agree with the president on washington isn't going to solve this problem the private sector is i'm just concerned that his administration has done the exact opposite in its actions uh it's been 180 degrees from from the direction that we need to go whether it be the national labor relations board or the epa or a number of other administration administrative agencies that have put up barriers time and time and time again

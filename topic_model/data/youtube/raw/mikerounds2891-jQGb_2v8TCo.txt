I go to Senator Mike rounds kind enough to join us in South Dakota Republican and armed services committee and foreign relations among others Senator we do know now it looks like a pretty likely this thing was going over South Dakota Skies as it had Montana we don't know where it is now um how do you feel about that what have you learned about that have residents in your state pointed to it or gotten an eye on it advised yesterday that there was a possibility of sightings that was a classified discussion but I can tell you that they apparently knew about it earlier the real question the first question why would they ever let it get into our airspace in the first place it should never have been allowed into the airspace we have the technical capabilities we could have taken it out before it ever came in I want to know why second of all what happened to the chain of command here was there not someone along the line who had the authorization to make that decision did it have to go all the way through to the president of the United States under this Administration in order to protect uh you know the the Airways that we've got now recognizing that this was only a supposedly an observation balloon the real question then after that is is how soon do they find out that it was only an observation balloon and along with that who made the political decision that it should be allowed to enter simply because they felt that it was harmless and what does that do on the political basis to the United States in terms of how the rest of the world looks at us can you simply just walk all over us or for that matter simply invade our airspace and and move on those are the questions but it starts with why was it ever allowed into our airspace in the first place we have the capabilities never should have happened you know I don't want to compare apples and oranges the senator but it does ring a lot like the early readings we're getting on the classified documents within the administration and how they were explaining that and in this case uh if they were aware as they seem to be indicating of this presence for some days why all of a sudden is it today that they decided to cancel Anthony blinken's trip to China I can't tell you for sure we're going to ask that question but I think along with it and it's close to the same question is uh would we have ever been advised that this had occurred in the first place if the incursion would have happened and then it would have slipped back out again like they have suggested it has happened in the past I don't mean to be rude sir but Anthony Lincoln is addressing this very subject I want to listen in that undermine the very purpose of the trip including ongoing efforts as I said to build a floor under the relationship as well as to address a very broad range of issues that are important uh to Americans uh to Chinese to the entire world so that is why I conveyed to uh to Wang Yi the senior foreign policy official in China this morning that I was postponing the travel and that we will look to see about doing the trip when conditions allow I'm not going to put a date or or time on that because what we're focused right now is on making sure that this ongoing issue is actually resolved the first step as I said is getting the surveillance asset out of our airspace with regard to your question about North Korea's illicit cyber activities as you may know after the U.N security all right we're still monitoring that uh Anthony blinken did temporarily or briefly address this subject of why he declined a meeting uh to go to China to meet with his counterpart there and again the senator gets back to what you and I were discussing I'm sorry for rudely interrupting you that uh it didn't make sense because if you're from the administration you're saying you knew about this or aware of this for days uh and presumably just as outrage over that period as you were today to cancel a meeting with your Chinese counterpart I'm talking about the Secretary of State why didn't you do so a few days ago your thoughts yeah look I I would suspect that it's being canceled and once again we'll have to ask them that question but I would suspect that it's being canceled because we found out about it I think if the incursion would have occurred and they would have turned it around or maneuvered it out of our airspace again we probably wouldn't have found out about it and I would suspect that the meeting might very well have continued on but once again it comes right back down to they knew it was in our airspace they allowed it to happen they made the decision not to take it out and I just heard it and I heard part of his discussion but suggesting that they wanted it out of our airspace he did not indicate from what I could hear whether we were going to take it out or if we were going to let it simply flow down its merry way I most certainly would expect that we would never allow them to have that uh that that observation balloon back one way or another it'd be nice to be able to get our hands on it to recover it and to actually find out what the Technologies were that were involved if it was designed to actually collect data or if it was designed to test our response capabilities we'll watch it closely the senator rounds it it is amazing a lot of unanswered questions a lot of things that don't click thank you very very much

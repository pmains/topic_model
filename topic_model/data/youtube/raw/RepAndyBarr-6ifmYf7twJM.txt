to thank all my colleagues for all of the thoughtful comments and opinions offered today and especially want to thank my colleagues who have either served the country before their service in congress in uniform or in other capacities my my colleague representative spanberger and her capacity and and um uh certainly representative jacobs and and her service to the country all my colleagues i really enjoy listening to the thoughtful comments and and the arguments that are being offered but i i have to rise today in opposition to h.r 256 and in support of mr perry's amendment and i'll offer a couple of thoughts for consideration to my colleagues about why um certainly i can't speak from the same position of authority on this as general perry or or representative master green having served in uniform in iraq and i also understand that the aomf of both 2001 and 2002 are certainly arguably outdated probably are outdated and they need to be updated perhaps we need a consolidated single replacement for both i also well aware that the american people including my constituents are weary of a protracted war and that we may need aumf reform in general uh i agree with uh representative connolly that we we we need to re-assert our article one powers and uh mr chairman you made a point at the outset that that these were entirely different wars the the wars related to the one amf and the war the iraq war the o2 amf they are different in some respects in that they're they're different types of enemies perhaps but in j but there is there's a connection and the connection is that it's all the global war on terror so my view is that we need to be very clear about what we're doing today without by repealing the o2 aumf admittedly outdated without a replacement at the same time what we are doing is we are repealing uh or we are withdrawing uh the authority that we as congress has given to the to the commander-in-chief to protect americans against threats in and emanating from iraq we are voting to cut off the president's power to protect americans who are in harm's way without a replacement i see this as a vote to disregard the terrorist threats that remain in iraq such as the shia threat the shia militia groups that we see active right now the the iranian proxies the remnants of sunni radicals in iraq including isis jihadist groups uh that are connected to isis um and so um you know i i understand that this is a protracted war as representative jacobs pointed out but these are protracted threats the threats remain and we still have service members in harm's way i do agree with ranking member mccall when he says this sends a very bad signal we we have to remember what what happened when president obama totally disregarded the threat of the rise of isis i think this is an analogous wrong message that we send um i agree with my colleagues who support this bill that we need to repeal the 2002 amf we just can't do it without doing anything replacing it right now immediately because of the remaining threats and maybe the commander-in-chief has inherent executive power i've heard several my colleagues uh to act in if we do face uh a problem here i've heard several of my colleagues talk about how this bill would not interrupt or disrupt any ongoing operations no ongoing operations would be impacted um that it wouldn't in any way compromise the ability of the commander-in-chief to act but i have to say i mean if that's the case then why have an aumf to begin with it implies that the commander-in-chief can act without authorization and i thought the whole point of this and the point of our hearing and the testimony of the professors the other day was that congress needs to reassert itself in authorization of use of military force we shouldn't allow the commander-in-chief to act unilaterally and in effect we're inviting the commander-in-chief to do so when our our troops will be inevitably threatened without this aumf in place so look i agree with many of my colleagues and and what they're saying here on both sides of this debate but i would urge that we that we take this repeal up with a replacement at the same time and do our job under article one let's do our job let's reassert our article one authority in this context but let's not invite um uh the these threats without giving the commander chief the ability to act in defense of our brave men and women in harmony and i and i yield back

uh you know my question is is is pretty easy i guess and i have to follow it up with um uh with maybe some follow-up questions but uh many people you know in this committee would like to see all that you know all the fossil fuels done away with as of yesterday but can someone help explain how natural gas is is a necessity or is necessary as a bridge fuel for the transition and i kind of leave that open for forever wants to grab that question i'll jump in first and just note that this great decarbonization we've seen of the power sector has been driven by two factors which is renewables and by cheap natural gas and then the fracking revolution or whatever you want to call it the technological advances there have contributed enormously to moving us away from coal we were 40 of our power generation from coal just 10 years ago and now we're down to about 20 percent and gas has played an enormous role uh indeed in decarbonizing the power sector that's where we are today the question is where do we go in the future and whether or not you could continue to have that much gas on the system and try and get to some kind of decarbonization goal or you actually address the climate crisis you know what it was 10 years ago where we were seeing natural gas as the clean energy and when you start seeing what's happening in germany and as they're transitioning uh you know to to renewables you're seeing they also have an increase on their dependency on natural gas to offset it because the last time that i checked we're really having a hard time figuring out how to store renewables and be able to meet high pitched and demands when we are facing peak hours for instance in california reason why they have rolling blackouts is during peak hours you see that sometimes solar comes offline especially in the valley solar will come offline around seven eight o'clock in the summer when it's still 116 degrees and people are at home and there's no way to meet that demand if you don't have on the demand energy for instance natural gas or nuclear so my question goes back how do we make that transition without natural gas or nuclear still being part of the portfolio so maybe i could address this you know when you look at california the so-called duck curve we do not have anything else when we use these intermittent fuel sources or these intermittent technologies when we when the sun goes down and sometimes it's combined not just with losing the sun but the wind you need dense massive power to bring up the power system as the as as we get into night time and there is no alternative other than natural gas or some other alternative fossil fuel and until we have right at scale these alternatives this is what we're going to have to do i want to jump in because i also feel like there's been a kind of repeated mischaracterization of what's going on in germany um the reality is in germany is that they uh they very quickly decided to close all their nuclear power plants and that is what has created in my view the biggest squeeze on the market there and the greater reliance on natural grass and the higher power prices it has certainly been they've pushed for renewables for years when you start looking at what's happening we're wanting to do away with nuclear too so if we're gonna if we're trying to end nuclear then you're going to have to have natural gas to fill that gap right so we're running down the exact same path that that germany has and we're down at thinking that we're going to have a different result and i don't see that happening i see this being the definition of insanity sir with respect um i i agree with you that uh with 20 of our power is from nuclear energy uh and that's zero carbon and shutting that down would be madness if you want to address climate change um but if you look at the infrastructure just let me finish please the infrastructure bill includes six billion dollars we should keep those nuclear reactors open hold on a second reclaiming my time here i just want to get back to you so and we're so let's let's find some common ground here you you agree with me on nuclear so do you think we should increase or decrease our nuclear facilities in rather than shutting them down like like um uh a lot of people on this committee is wanting to do i i think like i said a moment ago closing the existing nuclear reactors in the united states if you want to achieve decarbonization does not make any sense do you think we should open more i think it's a technology that should be invested in and again if you look at the infrastructure bill there are billions of dollars to support advanced nuclear reactors i appreciate it i yield back my time thank you

in the news a lot about potential vulnerabilities uh mail-in ballots uh 58 percent of the ballots cast for the spring election uh in south dakota came in uh absentee many of those mail in headlines yesterday indicated 97 000 absentee ballots already requested for the upcoming november election nationally estimates are a third of the population voting population will use absentee ballots the president has been outspoken about funding for the postal service what's your confidence level in people putting that ballot in the mailbox and it not being tampered with and getting delivered in time i i am very confident here in south dakota about the integrity of our election process the secretary of state sent out absentee ballot requests not the ballots when he sent out the requests those are received and an individual voter registered voter could then with proof of identity send it back in and they would get the ballot the formal ballot out that's a safe way of doing it send them back in by mail that's fine do it a few days before the election though just to make sure yeah don't push it and let's get them back in let's count them on election day i i am very confident that that will work two parts number one the post office has all of their capabilities they do over 400 million pieces of mail a day their their first class male is actually down by 17 percent because of coven 19. even if all the mail in the united states was always all the ballots that were out there were all done in one day it's only six percent they still won't reach their capacity for delivering it we're okay on that they've got 15 billion dollars in the bank they've got another 10 billion available for them now it's not going to be a problem it's a phony problem it's not for real now every state has a different mail in ballot approach i like ours i wish it was being used by every other state where the absentee requests go out but the individual voter sends theirs back some of the other states have said well we're just going to send the ballots out well that's when you start to have problems because who gets it what if they've moved who's going to fill the ballot in and send it back in what and those are the things people want integrity in their elections what we do and the way we do it in south dakota provides for that integrity i just ask people don't try to send it in on the day before the election please get it in get it in early i mean you can start you can start mail-in ballots on the 19th of september so get your ballot and the other part of this is you can still request it even if you haven't requested a ballot you can still request the absentee ballots now right you can make your request i hope some people call the county auditor heck yeah i mean just give them a call they'll send the request form out fill it in send it back in it's easy it works it's not hard to do i voted absentee last time around so did gene um so let's talk about the post office from a business perspective because uh there was news to me that that they have 15 billion dollars 15 billion cash on hand as of today and and then another 10 billion in grants you said they have another 10 billion that's that's available to them right now and alone but in our proposal we would make that a grant south dakotans rely on the postal service it's one of it is the highest rated federal agency 91 approval rating um do you have concerns about the conversations that the postmaster general is having about reducing the number of boxes uh getting rid of sorting equipment what what is his motive here what is he working on actually and this is part of the the conspiracy theory that's been out there did you know that this guy he had contributed to president trump's campaign so everybody says oh he must be a president trump he was never nominated by president trump he wasn't brought in by president trump he was actually a unanimous selection by the board of governors for the post office to be recommended to the president now who is that board of governors it's a group of people republican and democrat bipartisan in nature that are all approved by the senate to begin with so he's kind of taken it on the chin on this but a number of changes were made not by him to begin with but they were made several years ago in terms of changes within the post office's operations none none of the standards of operation in other words none of the standards about mail delivery absolutely none of them have been changed so are they down a little bit in first class yeah but that's coven 19. do they have the ability to take more first class in yes do they have money on hand yes long term have they been losing money yes they have should we make some reforms in the post office yeah but part of it is because we've expected them that they were going to be making payments back on their on on their um uh pensions that are their way they don't have enough money to pay all their own pensions okay but they were supposed to be making payments in that pension every single year of payback on it they haven't made a payment on their pensions since 2011. and so that's not even that's not even adding to the issue right now we're just sharing with people look do the mail-in it works it's fine you can go you can vote on election day but you can also very safely vote absentee in south dakota this year and in fact i strongly recommend it

all right guests senator Ted Cruz how are you sir mark my friend I'm doing terrific how're you doing I'm doing very very well so tell me you wrote a letter to Yale what's going on at Yale well Yale a couple of months ago announced a new financial aid policy and it is a policy that is openly discriminatory it discriminates against Christians that discriminates against those who believe in traditional marriage and traditional sexual values and and and the origin of this begins with the group the Alliance defending freedom which you know is a public interest law firm that defends religious liberty they argued this is a Colorado Baker case is a Christian Baker in Colorado and did not want to be forced to celebrate a same-sex wedding and and he was persecuted he was punished for those views and he took the case to the Supreme Court he won he won a victories in the print Court defending his religious liberty rights well a lawyer from ATF was speaking on Yale's campus and then talking about the Supreme Court victory that that that ATF had just won and the LGBT group on Yale's campus group called outlaws which is actually a pretty clever name they they did what college leftist do they protest they protested and they demanded Yale change their policy and what Yale announced is that so Yale pays summer stipends to Yale law students who work at a public interest law firm and it has a loan repayment program for Yale graduates that work at a public interest law firm and they announced that apply to absolutely everybody except for they at those Yale students that go and work at a Christian organization like ATF that believe in traditional marriage or tort reduce traditional sexual values and and it is blatantly discriminatory and so I am the chairman of the Constitution subcommittee the Senate Judiciary Committee and so I launched an investigation of Yale's discrimination against people of faith and and just this week sent Yale a demand for documents to get every one of the emails of the memos of all the background correspondence and adopting this policy because what I expected to reveal is that this was driven out of an animus specifically for life defending freedom that they wanted to blacklist ATF and they wanted to punish any Yale law students with the temerity to go and work for that organization shared that among other things Gayle receives vast amounts of federal funds and and federal civil rights laws prohibits discrimination against religious faith and then so we are going to investigate and shine a light and hopefully stop this discriminatory policy I'm glad you're doing this this is very very important but you know there's a lot of repression and suppression going on on our college campuses isn't it I mean whether it's Christians or Jews whether it's conservatives whatever it is more and more these are like they don't like a monopolistic ideology that they teach that they that they enforce absolute intolerance what do you make of this well you've got a bunch of disgruntled sixties radicals who have taken over colleges and universities and there's so many of them are socialists and and far leftist and actually this really is a sign of fear and weakness on their part they're afraid they can't defend their idea and so instead it is it's a sign of fear and weakness that they want to silence anyone who disagrees with them you know you and I both went to law schools where we had a lot of professors who were lessons I I had a number of professors who were open communists and a spouse communism would readily admit they were Marxists not look as you know my family has suffered directly under communism my family's been in prison and tortured by Fidel Castro's goons my Thea Sonya was imprisoned and tortured by Castro's goons I take communism deadly seriously and yet I was perfectly happy to take classes from communist professors because it's valuable to know what the other side thinks the left doesn't doesn't think that way they're afraid to defend their views and and so they're trying to use power instead Islands their students and the whole point of universities especially law schools is to learn to think to learn to reason to learn to defend your views to defend them in what John Stuart Mill calls the called the marketplace of ideas and so I think it's incumbent on all of us to defend free speech and to stop this censorship and intolerance that we're seeing at colleges in the universe one more quick question you and I've been around a while I mean I was chief of staff to an attorney general you were a litigator for some period of time I represented the Attorney General the iran-contra matter after he left office I've dealt with these independent counsel I see what Congress has - what do you make of all these subpoenas for private information from the President and all the claims that he's obstructing when he goes to court in order to defend the office of the presidency what do you have you ever seen anything like this and what do you make of this you know I think the the anger and rage we see among congressional Democrats is unprecedented and and they are consumed with hatred for President Trump he can do nothing right their minds there is nothing good in this country so we've got as a result of cutting taxes as a result of repealing job-killing regulations we got the lowest unemployment in 50 years the lowest african-american and Hispanic unemployment ever recorded and yet congressional Democrats are listening to their left-wing base that just hates Donald Trump and so I think the next two years the Pelosi house is going to be nonstop investigations non-stop subpoenas and I think we're going to see them go after impeachment because it is a politics of hatred and vitriol and division and sadly the Democratic Party is moving further and further than left motivated by that hatred of the press and there's no chance in hell the Senate's gonna vote to remove the president the United States 0.0% but but the facts don't matter look you know you watch the testimony a couple weeks ago when bar came and fended by in the Senate Judiciary Committee that the position of the Democrats was utterly ludicrous and and they were screaming they were impugning bars integrity they were demanding that he resigned and and their argument boiled down to this when the Muller report was submitted to bar he wrote a four-page summary of its conclusions and sent it to Congress Bob Miller at the time asked him to also spend his 20 some-odd page summary I've got 30 seconds I apologize go ahead he didn't send it then but he sent it three weeks later along with the entire damn report so the Democrats complaint is you'd suppress this summary which I have in my hands and every one if he was trying to suppress that he's really loud the other week all right Ted Cruz keep it up brother god bless you you too thank you we'll be right back

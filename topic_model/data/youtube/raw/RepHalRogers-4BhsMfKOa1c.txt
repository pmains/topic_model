well meantime concerns about mexico's drug cartels raised at a hearing on capitol hill kentucky congressman hal rogers saying we need to pay more attention to a growing problem on our southern border listen i think we're conveniently hiding our head in the sands of cancun beach and we're not seeing what the real problem is and it's a real problem for the united states of america congressman hal rogers is the ranking republican on the homeland security committee for appropriations he joins us now congressman thank you you know we talk about this problem as a as a mexico problem the united states is not helping we're buying all the drugs and we're sending them all the weapons well that's true uh we're we're buying roughly 25 to 50 billion dollars worth of drugs uh every year from the cartels the four cartels in mexico and uh they are smuggling across the border lots and lots of weapons with which they terrorize each other the government of mexico and local officials and our border patrol you know congressman we talk about the war on drugs the war on drugs is now pushing 40 years old clearly it has not worked we're talking about you said right there 25 to 50 billion dollars the number we've gotten is 39 billion dollars in drugs that we buy from mexico we we as americans buy 32 million dollars a year in pizza we're buying more drugs than we buy pizza how do we stop this well you you've got the magic question we've not been able to stop the the desire for drugs in the u.s all these years uh i don't have the answer to that what i am worried about though is the power and viciousness and maliciousness of the four drug cartels battling each other for territory in mexico and for access to the u.s market and corrupting the government the local and state along the way i want to congratulate though the president calderon and the administration they are going above and beyond the call of duty to try to stop this uh this sinister problem uh in their country and spilling over into the u.s now you know i i'm concerned that the u.s is not doing two things one we're not taking seriously the so-called spillover violence effect from the drug cartels in mexico because we've got we we've just arrested 750 two weeks ago 750 drug cartel related agents in american cities all over the country so it is spilling over and secondly i don't think that our government is taking seriously the threat to the legitimacy of the mexican government they just sent one-fourth of all their army troops to the u.s border the u.s the mexican army troops so it is a serious problem for us and for them congressman hal rogers congressman thank you thank you

chair recognizes the gentleman from there mr. Gosar Thank You mr. chairman and and thank you director Ashe and Solicitor Tompkins for talking about the rule of law and how it applies so I'm gonna deviate just like my colleague on the other side did so mr. Ashe how many species has a Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to list as endangered during the tenure of President Barack Obama I don't have that information at the strake since we're limited on time 107 different species particularly 23 in Arizona so let's go to the second question how many species does the Fish and Wildlife Service propose to list is endangered by 2016 again I don't have a let me answer the question for you again you have the mega settlement of seven hundred and seventy nine species designated in critical habitat in 50 states in Puerto Rico most of those will be I probably not all but that's not a proposal that is not a proposal it's a mega settlement so but it's not a proposal no the thing about it is is we've seen the tendency so pretty much most of those will go through does the Fish and Wildlife Service always perform an economic impact analysis before designating critical habitat and a listing of endangered species yes really Wow so then then why did you tell chairman Hastings and subcommittee chairman bishop in a meeting two and a half months ago that the Fish and Wildlife Service does our listings decisions based on science not economic impact our listing decision is based on science and we cannot consider economic or other effects critical habitat which was your question we do consider economic and other factors associated with that decision well I'm just gonna fast forward them because this gets fun so what is the total economic impact and how many jobs will be killed as a result of 107 different species that have been proposed by listening since 2011 as we again when we make the listing determinations we do not we do not and cannot under the law look at economic effects but you also have to look at it is in the designation do you not you're required by let me repeat in Section per Section 4b to the Endangered Species Act you're required to yeah yar so I mean again guess you're not an attorney but she is and that's probably the law I'm not an attorney either and he doesn't really fascinated by this aspect I'm getting to a point here yeah it's very specific to my area so why did the service fail to hold a public comment period consult with States and other local state quarters or do an economic impact statement prior to releasing the strategic hatchery and Workforce Planning report last November the strategic hatchery workforce planning process was in November was an internal process to consider how we would react but you know what it fundamentally changed the National Fish Hatchery system did it or not um it did not because we have not had it didn't okay so let's go back to that you said it didn't so last October the Fish and Wildlife Service ceased production of rainbow trout at the willow Beach National Fish Hatchery sighting water line failures at the time the agency stated they didn't have the one point five to two point or to the eight point five million dollars to repair the broken water supply line recent engineering reports indicate that these estimates were a gross exaggeration and the broken water line could be fixed for as little as a hundred thousand dollars 1,700 jobs and a 75 million dollar economic output associated with the Lowell Beach are at stake in Mohave County Arizona does the agency plan to appropriate money to fix the water supply line our people have been meeting with the state and yes or no and it's an easy question yes or no it's not an easy question it is a very easy good as it is not an easy question and explain to me that the agency consider the jobs and associated impact before terminating this program we did not turn in yes you did Carson we had a catastrophic failure in the water supply for the hatchery we terminus trophic it's a hundred thousand dollars and these are the engineers that have sat down and then showed your engineers exactly what goes on in there that's what one thousand dollar estimate is completely false there it cannot I want to remind you you know think about what you're saying here yeah yeah it has nothing to do with $100,000 it has everything to do with the hundred thousand dollars you estimated estimate was pathetic and the engineers will looked at this over and over again said that you're that you're looking at this in a whole different life if your laboratory let me get this bat dungeon killer but we're working with the community to see how we can address the operations at that fish hatchery and if we can do it and if we can make the engineering work and if we have the resources then we will open the facility but it's also the possibility that we may not be able to and we're also working with the state and the community to find out how we can produce those fish because it's the full year when I ask you then cut in because my time is limited so we'll go back to a rearing a rainbow trout in that fish hatchery we are doing everything we can do yes all right try to get to that place yes or no rainbow trout in the we are trying to get to that place yeah thank you

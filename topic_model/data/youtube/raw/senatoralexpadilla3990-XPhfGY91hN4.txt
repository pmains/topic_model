thank you mr chair uh i appreciate uh the focus of today's hearing um over the years we've seen a growing reliance on uh the internet right the digital world uh not ex not uh exclusively but especially on social media to spread racist conspiracy theories and to radicalize and recruit domestic terrorists during a hearing on a very similar topic and senate judiciary committee earlier this week i had a chance to ask questions of mr german about this issue but today i want to address similar questions to ms yates ms yates in your written testimony you highlight that white supremacists tend to tone down their rhetoric on social media as a strategic move to try to control their public image while gaining as many followers as they can even note that a specific group the gripers i believe has worked to build relationships with individuals serving in public office can you spend a minute just expanding on this because it seems to me common sense that if elected leaders embrace these groups their ideologies or their conspiracy theories that it serves to foster the hate and division that causes tragedies like the recent shooting in buffalo so what specific recommendations recommendations you have for this committee or the senate as a body as we work to ensure that we try to disrupt violent white uh supremacy and domestic extremist networks yes uh thank you senator for that very important question um that that there are a lot of elements to that but i think anyone who's been in this space for any amount of time will tell you that you can go on any social media platform and very quickly find extremist content especially white supremacist violence content so certainly we need to be very forthright in demanding that social media companies enforce their own terms of service in order to diminish uh the availability of this content um secondly we certainly call on uh politicians and candidates and people in this uh people with a reach in society to condemn this bigotry and to avoid using the sort of mainstreamed what i think maybe we'll call toned-down version of this rhetoric we see this especially in the deployment of elements of this kind of rhetoric that ex strip down the most violent the most racist the most vile frankly sort of tones of this and ideologies of this rhetoric of the great replacement conspiracy theory but at the same time continue to portray immigrants and refugees especially as a threat and this is a language especially that's dehumanizing that portrays them as invaders or that especially in this case somehow claims that these individuals rather than refugees coming to this country to exercise their legal right to seek asylum are somehow pawns in some nefarious conspiracy theory so all of that rhetoric i think certainly builds to a sense of threat that the violent white supremacists we're here today to talk about have acted on trust me i know even uh not as a son of refugees but as a son of immigrants like so many others from around the world over the course of generations that have con come to united states in pursuit of the american dream a topic a question on a related dynamic here so last year the number of known anti-semitic incidents rose to an all-time high and unsurprisingly many of the terrorist ideologies that we're talking about here thrive on anti-semitic beliefs and have resulted in far too many tragedies not just last year over the over the course of time what is your perceived role of anti-semitism in modern domestic terrorism and what do recent trends in anti-semitic violence suggest for this year's numbers and i guess going forward yeah absolutely thank you again for that question so anti-semitism is a pervasive form of discrimination and bigotry that permeates ideologies across the political spectrum and across issues of course but it does play a foundational role in white supremacism and that is because it uh it serves as a way for white supremacists to try to reconcile these contradictory ideas they have that one white people of course in their view are the superior beings and therefore have a right to control and to dominate society but at the same time they simultaneously insist that white people are facing an existential threat so by identifying jewish people as somehow sort of quasi-white or even maybe fake white they are able to claim that this population is to blame for the fact that they should be the dominant people but somehow aren't so it plays this very conspiratorial role and that has been an element as i mentioned before of conspiracy theories for generations but i think what is is an especially concerning element here is that what we see is that anti-semitism can be a central driver in the radicalization process of these extremists because it's so conspiratorial that they tend to see it as an existential threat and is it getting any better this year um i have not seen uh i mean as everyone has said here we have do not have perfect data on this threat that for a number of reasons um but i i don't think that this is improving uh at any time this moment no thank you uh and my time remaining i want to ask a question of ambassador sales in the past few weeks have listened as many of my colleagues have advocated for a broader more generalized approach to addressing violence in our country however i believe that this approach minimizes the specific threats posed by domestic violent extremism carried out by white supremacists uh we're gonna we have to be able to walk and chew gum right as we address violence in america regardless of your political leanings i believe we should heed the calls of law enforcement officials as well as national security officials to address the largest domestic threat to americans and that's been told to us specifically and repeatedly white supremacy ambassador in your written testimony you state that addressing white supremacy is complex but one of the early steps should be improved coordination and information sharing could you speak to the benefits of coordinating with foreign partners who are facing similar threats abroad thanks for the question senator um this is very much a global phenomenon uh what happens in the united states influences what happens overseas and what happens overseas influences attacks in the united states these extremist networks are talking to one another they're trying to influence one another um they're in a sense trying to compete with one another to see who can carry out the most horrific attacks and that is why you see things like the buffalo shooter claiming inspiration from the christchurch shooter and why you see an attempted terrorist attack in oslo norway praising the el paso gunman for for trying to so-called i think as he put it take back his country um so in order to get a handle on this here at home there has to be an intense focus on the international aspects of this problem part of that is policy coordination between the united states and our european allies and our five eyes allies all of whom are facing the same sort of threat that we are from rising white supremacist terrorist attacks um and and uh activity more generally so coordinating policies among the transatlantic community is one step and another more operational step is sharing information that can be used to support a variety of law enforcement and other government finishes to support prosecutions to support designations to support watch listing to keep terrorists from crossing borders and so on these are the same sorts of tools that we've used for 20 years against islamist threats like al qaeda and isis in various groups inspired by those organizations and many of them are easily adaptable for the international aspects of white supremacist terrorism too thank you very much i don't mean to ignore you mr german but i had plenty of opportunity to ask questions of you and judiciary committee thank you mr chairman

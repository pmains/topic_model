[Music] never ever doubt that the vast majority of the american people agree with me on this we love you we love you we thank you and we stand with you just a few months ago i went down to the southern border to see what border agents are dealing with and what congress can do to stop this surge of illegal migrants what i saw was almost unbelievable i saw thousands of people including unsupervised children many women and children walking across the border and then i learned later that many if not all of them that i saw were actually being smuggled across the rio grande river by the mexican cartels and i saw customs and border patrol agents completely overwhelmed guys these are some of the most compassionate men and women in law enforcement i've ever seen they're underfunded they're understaffed and they have no help with the bike administration they've been berated by the administration just for doing their jobs and by the way doing them well [Music] just last month over 62 000 immigrants illegally crossed our southern border and remember these are only those that get caught it doesn't account for the what they call the godaways president joe biden is planning to lift title 42 next month title 42 uses cover 19 to stop crossing at the southern border and the administration is putting these mass mandates on our children and vaccine mandates on businesses and they've closed the northern border with canada can you imagine our friendliest neighbor and covet is no longer a big issue at the southern border but it is at the northern border it's hypocrisy at its worst the white administration acts like the border crisis can go away on its own if they just ignore it while they publicly express wishes that at least two million illegal immigrants can come into the country every year homeland security predicts over one million migrants will illegally cross the border in the next six weeks after title 42 is officially lifted now this is more than the entire population of north dakota and they're going to do this on purpose the administration is doing this on purpose this is not just hypocritical and it is definitely that it's downright dangerous and really really dumb because along with a couple of million or more illegal immigrants comes human trafficking a drug smuggling fentanyl that's killing our young people in record numbers throughout the entirety of our country we've got to do something different it's time for a change step up president biden do the right thing keep title 42 in place

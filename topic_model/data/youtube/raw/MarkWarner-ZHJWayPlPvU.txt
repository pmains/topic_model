it was great to get back to one of my favorite parts of Virginia this past weekend down south side you were in Danville Martinsville Rocky Mount Bedford and Lynchburg it's a part of the state that that's had some challenging times of the last 15-20 years part of the state where longtime reliance on in industries like textiles and tobacco and furniture have made economic times tough but across south side we saw this the kind of spirit that gives me hope that Virginia's and south side Virginia's best days are in front of it remember starting off our trip averett university the group of business and educational leaders talked about challenges of the debt challenges in Washington later we went off to Martin's here was a textile company that was using 21st century technology in the middle of a global supply chain being able to create stretchable color fabrics that can be used for Olympic uniform swimsuits sporting team flags using equipment that had been used by twenty years before combined with brand new 21st century computer generating technology went to the Mustangs baseball game threw out the first pitch and managed not to dribble it into home plate spend a Friday night join a bit of America's pastime the following day we visited rocky mount and bedford folks raised a lot of concerns in any of them about what's happening or not happening in Washington but I had a chance to explain I views on how we can attract more jobs to the region how we're going to grapple with our debt and deficit and and the enormous need for us to find common ground a great two days great two days to be out of Washington a great day remind me of what we're fighting for day in and day out and also the chance to see the kind of energy in a region that just refuses to quit

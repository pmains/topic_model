I want to bring in Tony Gonzalez for every time you see the Border down there and you see Eagle Pass this is Tony Gonzalez's District he's brought I don't know how many republican members down there the president's been elected 40 some years never been there the vice president's supposed to be in charge she goes far away but he knows on the first hand what's happening down there and we continue to fight but I will promise you this we get the majority we will secure this border thank you leader and thank you sheriff for keeping us safe all our law enforcement I I will tell you House Republicans we are committed to working alongside with our law enforcement to every American every American deserves a nation that is safe whether you're in Texas whether you're in Pennsylvania Florida it doesn't matter I mean these are fundamental rights I represent 42 percent of the Southern border a lot of my a lot of my districts pretty rural most people would never heard of the towns that I represent until a year ago now everybody knows where Del Rio is when they saw these thousands of Haitians under a bridge now everybody knows where Eagle Pass is where they see thousands of people coming over coming over uh the water every day I also represent Uvalde and I'll talk about a little bit about that as well I will tell you you know at the very beginning of this everyone thought the Democrats didn't have a plan right how could they let this happen clearly they have no plan other than whatever Trump did we're going to do the opposite that's what it everyone thought originally oh they do have a plan and we are seeing exactly what that plan looks like and it is it is tearing America apart it is killing our kids doesn't matter the color of your skin doesn't matter if you're from a big city or a small town none of that matters it is killing our kids it starts in China makes its way through the Mexican cartels and then it comes to our towns our cities so we know they have a plan we know what the what the Democrats plan looks like what does our plan look like House Republicans are committed to ending catch and release this is critical when someone comes over and there is no law enforcement all it does is encourage more people to come over we have to end Catch and Release another big part of this is technology about two months ago there were 53 migrants that were found cooked in the back of a trailer that's in my district that could have been prevented if there was technology at the border to identify these trucks we're going to do those things the other thing is this people forget the house has the power of the purse and it is time for the house to lead again it is time for us to go wait a second here you will stop killing our kids we are all committed to doing that I want to bring Uvalde up before I turn it over I had a horrific incident that occurred in Uvalde a couple months ago I wish this upon no one our community has been turned upside down it's been a few months we've started to heal together someone mentioned Friday Night Football that was a big part of our healing a couple of weeks ago just the community coming together but imagine this this is what is happening right now to this day we still have high speed chases coming through our town what does that mean that means our schools go into lockdown so imagine you just went through this horrific incident you were either a student you were a parent you're someone in the community and you get a text message on your phone that says hey our school was in lockdown this is happening on our border every single day that's why we have to secure the board enough is enough let's secure the southern border

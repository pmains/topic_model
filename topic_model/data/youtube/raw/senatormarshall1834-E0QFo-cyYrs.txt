yeah maria well good morning we have two opportunities on the senate floor this week one is to stop president biden's declaration of emergency the kova declaration of emergency and number two is to stop dr fauci's medicare vaccine mandate it is time for us to take the power and control of our everyday lives out of the hands of joe biden and dr fauci americans are ready to turn the page and and live their own lives lives and i say this in the background that ninety-five percent of americans have some level of immunity now to covet uh the the new case race about ten percent of what it was a couple weeks ago it is time to move on and give the power control back to americans think about this medicare vaccine mandate just for a second so this week it'll go into effect and it's going to impact every hospital every doctor's office every nursing home in america we already have a huge nursing shortage and i think of those nurses i stood beside in march april and may of 2020 that were working in an icu that now have natural immunity but joe biden wants to fire them so we have to stop that mandate there's not a person in america that won't be impacted by this whether you're waiting to have an elective surgery done or you have a loved one you're trying to get into some type of a nursing facility so we're trying to stop both of those and take the power away from them well why why isn't the white house on board about this i know that president trump back in 2020 declared this emergency because of covid and it needs to be renewed every six months that deadline to be renewed is march 1st why won't biden just end it rather than renewing it on as per what you're talking about is this about power maria that you took the words right out of my my my mouth it is about power it's about control this federal government really thinks that they know what's best for you and your children they think they know whether this vaccine is right for your two-year-old your four-year-old they want to come in and prescribe to you what what your education should look like for your children as well but it is absolutely all about power and control and congress can seize it back we need to stand up and do our job and seize back that power we have the ability to do it

joining me right now two Democratic members of Congress congressman Philemon Vail he is the border town of Brownsville outside a converted Walmart that now houses nearly 1500 immigrant children he's about to tour that facility and with me here in New York as congressman Jerry Nadler he toured an ice detention facility in New Jersey just this weekend Conklin bailiff first you some of your colleagues down there they've met with some resistance getting into some facilities do you know what you're gonna be able to see today well behind me is Southwest Keys which is this is a contractor with the Health and Human Services what they are behind us here are about 1,500 unaccompanied minors about 10 percent of those kids are the children who have been separated from the families they operate other shelters down here and so these 2,000 children who have been separated from their parents are in shelters just like this this is your district former first lady Laura Bush speaking out this morning says she's a Texas native she understands the push and pull of illegal immigration but it's still immoral in her view cars availa what do her words mean to you well what we are seen in America right now is the American Dream turned into an American nightmare for these 2000 Kids and Counting because this is not over yet the solution here is very simple the president is to initiate a zero-tolerance policy for the stroke of a pen he can do away with it if there was ever a time to put politics aside this is the time to do it the idea that in the United States of America in 2018 the United States government is taking away small children from their parents it's just inhumane it's immoral that's not who we are about Natalie you made a surprise visit along with other members to an ice detention facility in Elizabeth New Jersey this weekend you met with men who've been separated say they've been separated from their families what do you learn well first of all we learned that we were kept waiting for almost two hours this is a privately run facility and they couldn't make any decisions have been anything until someone from ice arrived and that doesn't betoken anything good about anything surprise it happens inside someone gets sick or whatever but what we learned was we met with a number of the detainees and we had had prior legal authorization from their attorneys to do so and we heard their stories we were not able to tour the facility we thought we were in a tiny to take a interrogation room and these people wanted them one of them presented himself at the border at a port of entry with his child perfectly legally and he was then arrested and had his child taken away from anyway so that contradicts directly what the Homeland Security Secretary just said go to a port of entry well first of all we know the people that they're long waiting waiting times of days at the port of entry second well several ports of entry are just telling people coming in some other time don't don't come here now now people are fleeing violence these people have been crossing deserts they've been fleeing violence they're desperate you can't just tell them come again and have them camp on the border so they then course at a different point but but he but this fellow had his twelve-year-old taken away from him at a point of entry another person arrived in the know he has no idea where where that where his whether son or daughter where his child is or when or if he'll ever see them see them again the another person arrived at the border and the border patrolmen immediately said well this is not your kid he says well I've got my birth I've got the birth certificate take a test blood test whatever they said he wasn't the board and let them go and they went to sleep and three in the morning they came and seized the child away from in the middle of the night and he doesn't know where the child and then he was shipped then from Texas eventually to Elizabeth and he has no idea where this child is or when or if he'll ever see the child again I've heard a couple things I've heard multiple things coming out of the White House right you've heard from the President on Twitter and interviews that he hates the idea of separating families and let him stop it Lindsey Graham said the same thing he could do it with a phone call but the president and the administration in the White House continues to say Democrats stop pulling these political stunts of showing up at ice detention facilities showing up at the border come to the table and let's make a deal I just want to play for you what one White House folks I'm hoping Gidley today listen to this version everyone needs to put down their stories with swords and stop political grandstanding all the Democratic in the Democratic Party getting ready for midterms and instead focus on actually fixing the problem instead of going back to their districts right instead right instead of going back to their districts and basically saying this is a bad problem look at these horrible pictures they could go back to their districts and say we stood up for you guys and we fix the problem but they won't do that because they want to play that that takes nerve they set up the problem this problem is entirely an unofficial problem started in mid-april when Jeff Sessions the Attorney General sent the memo for zero-tolerance policy and they call it a zero tolerance policy and he said that we're doing this in order to present to - to - to have a deterrent effect in other words we're gonna terrorize people were gonna take their kids away so that other people who are fleeing violence will think twice about coming here now then it's the Democrats fault because not that we started this policy the President did this policy but it's a Democrats fault because the president then comes and says okay if you want me to stop torturing these people if you want me to stop separating families and taking kids away then you've got to agree to these other things these other terrible proposals on immigration you've got to agree that people who've been on waiting legally on line to join their brothers or sisters literally the United States with for 20 years get wiped out you've got to agree to these other 225 million dollars for the welcome to Washington I mean never let never let a good crisis go to waste no create a crisis torture people and then say we're gonna blackmail you to stop that's not proper you know they're holding these kids hostage that's not a proper way of negotiating what are you going are you introducing the companion legislation Feinstein's bill we will be doing that tomorrow and what is it what does it say it says you can't separate these kids it has a number of other provisions but basically it says you can't separate these kids if you get that bill to the floor and there's an amendment for border wolf wondering do you back it I might back the border wolf but there but there but by the way not in the way that they're that they wanted in the bill because the border wall that they say in the bill is if any future Congress takes a penny away from the border wall everybody who's been waiting all these dreamers these docker kids who've been waiting it'll take him 23 years to get together path to citizenship and they can be wiped out depending on the action of the future Congress that we can have you talked to any Republicans about you they won't talk to us oh come on I'm not come on they have been negotiating this the the dreamer bill we have been talking a good lot about this I've talked a good Lenny won't talk about it he's got his position now now remember what they've been doing the Republicans saying we want to pass a bill without any Democratic votes that's why they've been negotiating a bill only within the confines of the Republican Conference we have a bill that could easily pass the house we get all the Democrats and probably a third of the Republicans they won't let that to the floor okay I mean let us see if this shakes it up with these images continuing to come out congressman Bayla just a final question to you congressman will heard Republican congressman he's opposed to this policy as as we're looking at it right now he suggested this morning I don't I'm to play it but essentially an alternative to the detention facilities is keep families together keep them on house arrest until their claims can be dealt with and because policy questions are going on do you would you support that well I don't think we need house arrest under the Obama administration back in June 2017 they began a program that would essentially allow these families to live together and they they would report back to the asylum courts when the Trump administration took over they got rid of that problem and we never got to see the OIG report I want to add one thing you know it's we don't need legislation to change what is going on right now all we need is for the president to rescind the zero-tolerance policy and these kids can be back with their parents that's exactly right and talk of legislation is whether it's a border wall or anything else is is is it's just to track distract attention you think it's a total diversion and you can talk about the border wall you can talk about even worse provisions that they're trying to put in to stop they really want to just just to reduce immigration by fifty percent to have people who've been policy difference that's a policy difference policy difference is legitimate no no I'm not saying don't do that what I'm saying is don't play hostage don't hold these kids hostage don't hold the dock of dreamers hostage that's what I'm saying with all of the heat that is coming at this administration from forget he come from Democrats from Republicans on this issue Carson Adler when the images are coming out and it doesn't look like it's going to subside do you think that the White House can maintain this position for another day another day yes for a while I don't know for a while I don't know I I certainly hope not that will depend to a large extent on Republicans Democrats can scream all we want but if the Republicans are we we do the question is how many if enough Republicans come out against it then they will not be able to sustain this congressman Nadler thank you so much congressman bela thing

republican from south carolina sits on the senate judiciary committee your response to senator schumer if you got confidence in him fine i mean i just want to know what happened with james rosen he needs to reconcile the statement he made to the house that he'd had no knowledge of a potential prosecution he's not involved in that kind of stuff and to be wrong reconciled that statement with the fact that he signed the affidavit to get the subpoena let me take this out of should he stay or should he go do you believe because you have a legal background as well do you believe the american public is at risk with this man eric holder the top legal officer in our country i i can't say he's at risk i mean we're at risk i really do believe the attorney general's credibility is at risk i think the public is skeptical of the way he's run his shop the statement he made and his actions are not reconcilable so i think that'd be a good place to start come back to the congress attorney general holder explain to us your actions versus what you said regarding the fox news investigation senator schumer mentioned fast and furious and that answer and there's an insinuation in that that here we go again another another witch hunt by republicans and david actually said something more directly about this in response as well to the irs scandal let's take a listen to this my suspicion is the republicans in congress will stay too obsessed kind of surfing scandals trying to repeal obamacare for the 40th time and less on the economy and doing the job they were saying what do you think about that what's the right way to go about this because republicans have had a lot of hearings and multitude of different issues yeah but what have we learned what should you do what's the right way to go about it to get to the truth is the best thing for the country i don't believe this was a localized problem in cincinnati i think the conservative tea party groups were intentionally targeted as critics of the administration and the people used the power the irs gave them over these groups to silence one group and let the other group flourish and that's bad for for democracy but i don't know if it goes back to the white house but i do know this that if a bush administration official in charge of regulating 501 c 4 groups was accused of silencing liberal groups and she took the fifth amendment we would not be asking are the democrats going too far by trying to ask more questions so how do you use the democrats playbook for your own benefit if you want the truth all i want is the truth i want her to come back in some fashion i think she waived her fifth amendment rights but after what do we know about benghazi nine months after the attack have you heard from one survivor that i've destroyed a small force trying to get survivors made available to the congress this administration is getting away with a lot they're shielding the congress from the survivors of benghazi the lady in charge of running the program that was used politically to target conservative groups took the fifth amendment attorney general said he knew nothing about a potential prosecution of a journalist he signed the affidavit and people are worried about us so here's the claims right here's the claims by david platt and the democrats and we're going to hear more of this why it's important to talk about it which is that here we go again more hearings more hearings and more hearings yet there's big issues immigration the the economy of course and this is a distraction from it and we're not getting well that means that we must if they want us to stop that means or do they care that the attorney general denied having any knowledge of a potential criminal investigation of a journalist when he in fact signed an affidavit do they want to hear from the survivors why were they left abandoned for seven and a half hours when it comes to all of these scandals the irs do they not care that the government's power was used in a political fashion just just shut them out and pursue the truth and wherever it takes you it takes you is there anything you think you could do better yeah i would call eric holder back and say now tell us again what you did with james rosen i would subpoena every survivor in benghazi and challenge the administration to make them available to congress for oversight purposes and i would call the lady back it took the fifth amendment and try to find out what the hell she did we know nothing about these three scandals and democrats are trying to make us to be the bad guys i've done nothing wrong daryl eliza's done nothing wrong he didn't go before the congress and say he was uninvolved when he was so at the end of the day we need to push forward to find out what happened with the irs what happened with james rosen and fox news and what happened in benghazi and i'm not going to stop till we find out what happened some big questions as you return from a recess uh starting tomorrow senator graham my nice debut in studio thank you as always look forward to more conversations we'll be right back with more happening now

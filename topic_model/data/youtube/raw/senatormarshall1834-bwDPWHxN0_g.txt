i want to put a name names and faces on this story i mentioned yesterday that i sat down with the navy seal and listened to his story and just how one size doesn't fit all there's no way the cdc can have a policy to to take care of every situation like this and nor can the can the dod as an army doctor once upon a time myself this is how i would view one of mike's clients coming in a navy seal who's 19 years of age young and healthy i would talk to him one-on-one about the vaccine and the potential benefits and the risk that navy seal officer i'm talking about has a 50 out of a million chance of getting heart inflammation a swollen heart from this vaccine that's going to put him out of action for six months that same otherwise healthy navy seal maybe five out of a million chance of getting hospitalized probably even less than that as good a shape as they're in so i'm the army doctor and i'm trying to keep my my platoon ready to go ready for action which is worse which which is better and that's why you can't apply one size fits all to everything on the other hand if there was a 55 year old person in the military with type 2 diabetes i would be begging him to get the vaccination in the booster i support the vaccine i don't support mandates i don't support one size fits all and then i want to take it to the religious freedom side of this again like mike said you listen to 40 navy seals why they want a religious exemption everyone is different i think our chaplains do an amazing job in the military why aren't they involved in this process of listening to this soldier's story and saying i get it you have a deep seated faith here you've made a decision based upon prayer you visited with your pastor your family uh all these people i think that god speaks through the friends and and you're my my god usually talks to me through my wife very often so i think that there that there is an element of individuality here with this nation has always stood to fight for um and just close once again senator schumer please bring the nda to the floor so we can vote on this amendment and make sure that our soldiers don't get a dishonorable discharge

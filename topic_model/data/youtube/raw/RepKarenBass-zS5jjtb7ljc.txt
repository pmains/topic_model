this morning the question for Democrats after Robert Muller's testimony is what now joining us now is Democratic congresswoman Karen bass she serves on the Judiciary Committee and she questioned robert muller yesterday congressman great to have you here in the studio where thank you they play the moment that you got to question robert muller a shorter day for everyone who may have missed it but your investigation actually found substantial evidence that McGann was ordered by the President to fire you correct yes did the president's personal lawyer do something the following day in response to that news report I'd refer you to the coverage of this in the report so the president told McGann directly to deny that the president told him to have you fired can you tell me exactly what happened I can't be on what's in the report were those satisfying answers to you well I would have loved to have heard him provide more context but you know we were prepared that he was gonna stick to the report but even sticking to the report we felt was powerful for him to confirm things that were in the report I mean what you were trying to get out was the obstruction of justice piece right John McGann piece that people say is central to the obstruction of justice if you're telling your White House Counsel to lie if you're changing documents if you're providing a cover story all those things that is the definition of obstruction exactly to lie and then to cover it up and so to have him confirm that that's what was in the report because remember when the AG came out when Barr came out and said the report completely exonerates the president there's no collusion no collusion he really tainted public opinion in that respect and there are a lot of people I've run into people who didn't understand why they would even bother reading the report and so to us to be able to have him verify things that were in the report was significant in and of itself well I mean you've heard some of the reviews of what happened with Robert Mallory yesterday he was circumspect to the point some people felt of being ineffective you know he heard it he said he kept saying I refer you to the report instead saying yes he could have just answered you with a yes or no right so do you think that yesterday changed anything well I do think that it changed and we'll see in the coming days I mean I think that it was illustrated for the American public he said he was not exonerated he said that he could not say that he didn't obstruct justice we know that he's limited by the OIC report we know that and he said that now when representative Lewis questioning him he pretty much said that because of that that was why he didn't say there was obstruction of justice now we know couple hours later he pulled that back but why did he pull that back I think he told a representative truth representative Lew what was actually and why did he feel attacked well I you know maybe he pulled it back because he's trying to stick to what what came out of the White House but I think he was pretty clear the first time look as we know the house the Democrats in the house have been debating now for years whether or not to move forward with impeachment no actually not for years well I mean it feels like there has been impeachment talk almost since the president January 2017 and so but I mean did yesterday change anything in terms of that talk or the momentum well we'll see but reality is is that yes there was talk the moment of the inauguration but what is true is Democrats have only been in power for seven months and two of those months were really dead there was the shutdown the first month the Republicans were very late in making committee assignments so we really didn't even hit our stride until March so you're only talking about a few months okay so where are you with the pitchmen well I mean I think we have a lot further to go we are gonna go to court to enforce the subpoena over McCann I think there's several other witnesses there's all of the committees that are involved in various aspects of oversight and investigation we went two years with no oversight no investigation of this administration so I think we have a ways to go so you're staying the course you're going to go to court and then you'll all decide what you're gonna do yeah I'm staying the course you know there's many of my colleagues especially on the Judiciary Committee that feel we need to begin the inquiry now but I think that we need to take it a few steps further I want to talk to you what's happening in the on the Judiciary Committee today there's other work we do yeah the work that you do that is I mean equally important absolutely with what's happening with family separations at the border so today you're trying to get answers because the administration says that family separations have stopped they have not stopped so what the administration is saying is is that they have stopped because they have stopped in most cases taking kids away from their parents but when is a grandparent an aunt and uncle or a sibling not a family so there are cases of grandparents who have come to the border with shot with infants with toddlers they separate those children and then call them unaccompanied minors tell me how a one year Oh a two year old could be an unaccompanied minor so they have just redefined family the other thing is is that they have determined that some parents are not eligible to stay with their children least under what well somebody with a criminal conviction but you know if you think about that we have a child welfare system in this country they make a determination whether or not a parent is an abuser or an art is neglectful of their child that social workers are involved a court is involved since when is a Border Patrol agent responsible for that so we have a humanitarian crisis at the border that is being dealt with like a law enforcement problem and to your point some of the people who are being called criminals they have perhaps a DWI well in their past since when in this country do you separate a child from that never you never do that and then also there are the children that were separated in the beginning we don't even know how many children they are that are still so Congress does not know at this moment how many children are still separated from no and and I mean frankly I don't believe what comes out of the administration because we know they didn't track those children to begin with but let me just ask you this the children that they do know that are separated where are they now what is going to happen to them next year will they be put in our foster care system that's already inundated because of the opioid crisis it is a completely inappropriate way to deal with the situation and I frankly believe it's state-sponsored child abuse the idea that you would have babies who are supervised by an eight year old and nine year old if a parent did what is going on at the border they would be arrested for abuse and neglect well we hope you get answers today obviously we'll be falling we're not gonna stop Congress on Karen bass thanks so much for coming in with your insight into all of this thanks for having me on John all right

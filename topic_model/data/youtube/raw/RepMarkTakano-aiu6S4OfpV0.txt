mr. speaker 70 years ago my parents and grandparents were stripped of their possessions and placed in Japanese American internment camps they were not guilty of espionage they did not commit treason they simply look like our enemy and that cost my family their freedom yesterday the mayor of Roanoke Virginia suggested that this country's treatment of japanese-americans during the 1940s as a model for how we should address today's global refugee crisis it does not take courage to condemn such disgraceful comments nor does it take wisdom to say our world war two policies were product of fear and hysteria what takes wisdom is recognizing that history is now repeating itself and what takes courage is sending a message to the world that America will protect innocent people regardless of their nationality or religion that is what my mother and father deserves seventy years ago and that is what these refugees deserve today thank you and I yield back my purpose is gentleman from

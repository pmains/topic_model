King he is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee will talk to you about the Russia investigation but let me take get your take on a couple other headlines one the president going directly to Democrats getting a deal in the debt ceiling and Harvey relief good move well I think you got to put it a little bit of context this wasn't going directly to Democrats the Democrats were in the room but so were the Republicans it was a discussion and a negotiation I can't read the mind of the president but I think he wanted to clear the decks he said let's take care of these three things in the next four or five days and then we can move on to some of the other important issues like daca like tax reform and I think that was what his thinking was and you know there's I think perhaps were overthinking this a little bit and the president's a pragmatist and I think in this case he just said let's make something happen here that we can clear three things and then move on well then senator what do you make of the Republican leadership telling you know reporters in abundance that they didn't like this well I you know whenever there's a deal one side of the other isn't gonna like it I think that's that's the that's that's the situation but it enables us now to try to get these three items off the table literally if not today in the next two or three days and then we can start talking about some of the other issues there are also some bipartisan talks going on on health care so there's plenty to do and clearing the table on these on these three issues at least at this moment because of the deadlines looming we've got four or five deadlines in September the FAA reauthorization the Children's Health Program shut the the funding of the government I mean September 30th is a big day and I think what the president has done is enabled us to work in a more orderly way through September and then into the fall all right you bought three months on the debt ceiling he's given you six months on daca what do you think of that move giving it to Congress and saying you got six months to save the dreamers well you know I think the fact that he tweeted what he did yesterday indicates that he was actually having an awfully hard time with this decision I don't like the decision that he made on the other hand he has said to us here's the time you have time to work on this he's clearly indicated that he wants to work on this you know Chris there's an interesting opportunity here for him this could be Nixon goes to chyna if anyone could make a deal on comprehensive immigration reform and make it work nationally it would be this president and I think he's setting us up to try to get something done now the question is what do we have to add to the daca bill to the dreamer bill that's already pending that Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin have in order to make it work on a bipartisan basis and sell it to the president I suspect it's gonna have something to do with border security I suspect it's not gonna have something to do with a wall well that's but that's not what we're hearing right we're hearing that it may involve the wall and that's certainly what the president would want senator Markey said yesterday any bill that has daca and the wall on it is a non-starter how do you feel about that well I think that's probably the case I mean the truth is that the wall device and it doesn't make sense it is also important to the left you know that it's just a non-starter no matter what else is in the offing I don't consider it important to the left or the right and for me it's not an ideological issue it's a practical issue it doesn't make sense there are ways to secure the border in some places the wall mate may make sense we already have a wall I've seen it down at McAllen Texas there are places where you have fences they're places where you have sensors they're places where you have guards just building a 2,000 mile wall is not practical it's expensive and there are a lot of there are a lot better ways to achieve the same goal which is to provide border security so why don't you like the decision that the president made with daca in the initial instance due to cancel the program if that's the way to get Congress act well the unfortunate part is is thrown hundreds of thousands of people's lives into absolute chaos fear uncertainty these are people that have been here literally all their lives or since they were six years old they were brought here they had no choice in the matter they think of themselves as Americans they're working they're paying taxes and has created this enormous uncertainty I think you know he there are other ways that he could have handled it but I'm not I think Congress ought to step up and deal with this I think the pattern of the last I don't know you can say 3040 years has been for Congress to abdicate its responsibilities to the executive and so I don't think it's a bad thing that we have to deal with it but the uncertainty that's been created in those people's lives is really is really unfortunate and an unnecessary but I think the good news is I sense that there's a real opportunity here and some bipartisan interest in in solving this problem I'll tell you what it will be political kryptonite to anybody who is on the wrong side in terms of getting this done in six months because if these people fall into Isis hands you know we all know how that process goes I know everybody's saying they're not an enforcement priority now but if you're a law and order person you're gonna be in a tough position six months from now if you don't create law to protect the dream and that's exactly why the decision was so so hard because it's going to put people in that in that shadow situation which is which is just not right and Senator give us an update on the status of essential items within the Russia investigation you got Don junior before Senate staffers today obviously being questioned again about the meeting where he went to this open solicitation to get bad news about Hillary Clinton you have news about Facebook saying that it I guess inadvertently sold ads two sites that wound up forwarding Russian propaganda attempts against the United States what do you make of these two headlines well they're they're both very significant I think and they're both representative of what there may be more to be learned first on that meeting we know from that meeting that that Donald Trump jr. was anxious to have that meeting was anxious to try to get dirt on Hillary he knew where it was coming from that's that in itself is disturbing the real question is were there other meetings where there follow-up meetings and it was that part of the beginning of a relationship and we're not yet ready to determine that but that's got to be examined on the Facebook thing that's also a big deal because that verifies what had been told by the intelligence community as far back as October of 2016 and that is that the Russians were actively trying to intervene in our election by disinformation by fake news by planting stories by trying to undermine people's confidence in the election and in the candidates this is here it is I mean we know they did it my suspicion is that there is going to be a lot more to that story there are two pieces number one were there more of this kind of ad buying by these by the by the Russians and number two and this is the question obviously that our committee is going to be digging into was there some relationship between the Trump campaign and the Russians in terms of where they planted those ads where they put them who they were targeting did the Russians have their own political consultants saying you know do this in a certain County in Wisconsin or did they get that information from somewhere else that's an important question we've got to dig into the president says it's a witch hunt and there are people who's saying we haven't heard anything about the Russian investigation they haven't come to any conclusions it proves that there's nothing there what do you say to critics well number one it's not a wish witch hunt we know that we know that from the unanimous opinion of the intelligence community in October we know it from their opinion again in January we know it from voluminous data that the Russians were involved in our elections that they were trying to defeat Hillary Clinton helped Donald Trump but it went all the way up to Putin I mean that's that is well-established they what isn't a well-established is whether there were indeed contacts and cooperation between the Trump campaign and the Russians the other thing we know Chris is that the Russians were trying to get into state election systems and registration rolls it appears they were unsuccessful but they're going to come back and I think that's the point that people are missing about all this by focusing so much on Trump and the Russians we're missing the fact that the Russians were doing this they've done it in the past and they're going to keep doing it and we've got to be prepared for it that's what I consider our major mission in this investigation is to prepare the American people and things like our voting systems for what will inevitably come in 2018 and 2020 and beyond regardless of the involvement with the Trump campaign these issues matter and they're going to matter in the upcoming elections senator angus King as always a pleasure thank you for being on the show thanks Chris awesome okay Chris back to Erma the

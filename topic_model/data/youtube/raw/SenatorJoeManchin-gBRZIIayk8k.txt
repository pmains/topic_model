I wish I would have known more about the Army
and about the military before I came here. I thought I knew a little bit,
but I really didn't know anything about the Army or really, really how
the Army was - how the Army worked, or how it was structured
or in any of that regard. So definitely wish I knew a little
bit more about the Army.

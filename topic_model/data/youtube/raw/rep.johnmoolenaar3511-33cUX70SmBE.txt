for your testimony my guest for the State of the Union was gentleman from Claire Michigan mr. Gregg Granderson and I believe you have the chance to meet him before the speech that night it's a former police officer who along with eight of his former colleagues on the force saved the local bakery and donut shop from closing and now nearly a decade later they've worked hard grown their business and it's really an American success story they're excited about tax reform they say it's going to help their business they recently announced plans to open a new store in our state and another company in my district a printing company with two locations announced bonuses are being paid to their employees retirement accounts and so all of this as you would agree as good news higher wages bonuses better benefits helping the hard-working people in my state keep more of their hard-earned money and that's always a good thing I want to compliment you because Treasury turned around very quickly the implementation of the withholding rate that passed as part of tax reform and your budget asks for 397 million to help implement this new law and I'm wondering how much of it will go towards improving better service for those who need help from the IRS for example hiring employees to answer phone calls of concerned constituents and I'm sure you're already getting calls already but how much of it will go towards improved service in that way sure thank you so first of all that request is a two-year request but that is money we need ASAP to implement this a lot of it will go to service some of it directly where we'll hire more people to answer the phones particularly during the peak of tax filing system a lot of it will go to technology that will help interact and everything else it was commented earlier we have antiquated telephone systems we want to modernize the technology so we can provide better customer service we need to update all the forms to reflect the simpler ability to file so there there is a lot of this money helped directly and indirectly that's a major focus of ours right thank you and if I could shift gears a minute and talk about the question of sanctions that we've been discussing your Department is asking for increased funding for the implementation of sanctions on hostile nations including Russia North Korea and Iran and I'm pleased to hear that you are implementing those sanctions and want to encourage you to move swiftly and decisively because I agree with you I do think those sanctions in the case of North Korea as you mentioned are bringing them to the table and have been effective your department's monitoring financial transactions all over the world and has the incredible task of identifying and dis mailing threats to our country's financial system including cyberattacks I'm wondering which countries and organizations are launching the most attacks on our financial system and and what's the cost of these attacks to Americans um so again let me just first comment on the sanctions we just released two weeks ago the largest package of sanctions that we've ever had on North Korea so as you know North Korea has been our number one priority we're now reallocating a bunch of these resources for russia sanctions which are going to come out very shortly on on on cyber and on the banks again we're constantly taking in lots of information from the banks big data dumps to look at illicit activity in regards to cyber I'm not comfortable mentioning which countries specifically but I'm pretty sure you know the highlighted ones and we're very focused on the scene do you need increased funding to prevent these attacks is that something we're going to see more of in the future it is okay and then another question I had is how can we improve information sharing with Department of State and other agencies to make sure sanctions are imposed effectively it seems that there are a number of departments agencies involved in this process and what can we do to improve the communication there I actually think that I think that works very well I'd say first of all through the NSC we meet on a regular basis multi times a week we're in communication any of our sanctions do you go through even whether we're doing them or not they do go through what we call an interagency clearing process of both getting the Intel Declassified and then seeking consent of State and others so I think this process is working very well both through through the NSC coordinated process as well as direct conversations between myself secretary Tillerson and our staff and I also have regular meetings with director of Pompeo and other members of the National Security Intel areas because we couldn't do our work without what they do thank you very much

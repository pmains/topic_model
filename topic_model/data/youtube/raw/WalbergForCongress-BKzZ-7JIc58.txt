well more pipeline politics now in michigan democrat governor gretchen whitmer ordered the shutdown of the inbridge's line five oil pipeline now it supplies 65 percent of the propane used to heat homes in that region our next guest says the shutdown will have devastating consequences on the transportation hubs kill thousands of jobs and billions in economic output joining us now to discuss is republican congressman from michigan tim wahlberg thank you very much for joining us good to be with you so why would she do this i don't know i have no idea that's that's the concern we had the energy secretary former governor of michigan governor granholm secretary grant home in front of our energy and commerce committee yesterday and i asked her those that those same questions especially since uh last week she had made a statement about the colonial pipeline which was a meltdown of huge proportions and she said pipes are the best and safest means of transporting fuel so i asked her as well as a couple of my colleagues why uh she wouldn't say the same thing about line five and would she lobby our governor to come back to her senses as it were and say listen we've had almost 70 years of a contract with line 5 and enbridge and we've had no damage no spills no accidents so why would we do something that would be less than positive and really shut down refineries opportunities for for fuel and 50 percent of all of the propane for michigan which includes my agricultural community has there been an effect yet and if not what effect do you think there will be down the road well there's no effect yet because the line is still open but it's in a court case and that our governor is brought against enbridge and against line five to get it shut down i hope they lose um but the president and i asked this of the energy secretary yesterday since the president does have veto power even over a court case based upon national interest and security especially when you think of the necessity for fuels for everything from our tractors to our our planes we would expect him to step in and and stop that from taking place especially since there's been no problem and we just came off of colonial and saw what took place in shutting down the eastern seaboard she would not give an answer to that um i'm hoping that as the time goes on the pressure will build in light of the fact of what we saw with colonial and now with a pipeline that transports fuel both petroleum and natural gas uh propane etc has done it safely and bridge wants to on there with their own money build a tunnel far down underneath the lake bed and put all of the pipes in that tunnel so it's safe forever this is something we ought to be working on otherwise all of our energy is at at risk

i want to address something that's top of mind right now because it's been in the news the last 36 hours and that's the the whole issue of censorship and actions by twitter and facebook that have me questioning whether they're platforms or publishers and and then how they should be regulated and censorship over political differences whether done by the government or a tech company is unamerican all of us need to be upholding freedom of speech and i know we're focusing on ai today it's emerging technology that people need to be able to trust and so far facebook and twitter and especially how they're suppressing speech they're failing to build that trust and worse like they did with the us uh the new york post they're pushing their own political agendas and i brought this up a couple of weeks ago at an energy and commerce subcommittee hearing and and i and i just pointed out that these top platforms must be held accountable for the their content bias and how they're influencing the election the senate commerce committee is holding a bipartisan hearing next week to hold these companies accountable and i'm calling on chairman palone to do the same thing in the house to begin these bipartisan discussions on the future of section 230 and big tech regulation

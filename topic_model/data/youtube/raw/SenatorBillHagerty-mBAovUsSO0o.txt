so what was it like in the house chamber tonight with all the face masks kabuki theater from the democrats my next guest is here to tell us tennessee senator bill hagerty joins us now senator um different the different mood in the room for biden's speech there was no tearing up of the speech as nancy did last time around when trump spoke what was it like it was one of the most dull speeches that i've ever seen and that dullness was enhanced by the fact that they had everybody spaced socially distanced massed up you know everybody in that hall was vaccinated and laura everybody was vaccinated for one reason because of operation warp speed that president trump put in place well you have been hitting the issue of china so powerfully both in op-eds and and various addresses that you've given senator joe biden seemed to try to convey that he's going to be tough on china he's going to hold them accountable on trade and on subsidies and so forth but do you really hold out hope that that's what's going to happen especially when climate change negotiations are being led by john kerry well laura you've been a leader on this for years uh i'd say this president biden hasn't started out so great he comes in and the first thing he does is kill the keystone xl pipeline where do you think that oil is going to go it's going to go from canada straight to china now he's increased our input cost but he certainly lowered it for china they're laughing all the way to the bank on that one he's killed fossil fuel in this this arena in terms of of killing any type of leasing on federal lands again trying to take away our energy independence at a time where we've finally accomplished it then what is he doing he's signing us up for the paris climate accord again putting a great advantage to china while burdening our economy at a time that we're trying to recover from this pandemic so i think that getting tough on china has so far been nothing but a matter of words we've seen deeds that are absolutely contrary to that now biden's been a little guilty of some plagiarizing in the past and senator he was back at it again tonight there is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can't be built in pittsburgh instead of beijing there's no reason why american american workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries all the investments in the american job plan will be guided by one principle by american senator that's just a total rip-off a total rip-off from trump but again back to the china deal i mean when china says jump kerry's going to say how high ah you're absolutely right i think john kerry is the last person we should be sending to our most strategic adversary to negotiate this is not a good sign for america all right senator great to see you tonight thanks so much and up

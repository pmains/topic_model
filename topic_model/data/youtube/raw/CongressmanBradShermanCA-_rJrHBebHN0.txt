cryptocurrencies are a crock what social benefit do they provide well they allow a few dozen men in my district to sit in their pajamas on the couch all day until their wives are going to be millionaires they help terrorists and criminals move money around the world they help tax evaders they help start-up companies commit fraud take the money and 1% of the time they actually create a useful business but that again I dare say that some tiny percent of all larceny and crime helps finance something that turns out to be useful it hurts the US government in two ways our country to have the dollar be the chief means of International Finance is what has underpinned our ability to impose sanctions and and stop tax cheating and furthermore when we have people take risk we don't encourage gambling we encourage investment in the real economy but when you buy a Bitcoin are you financing a new factory no your Tate you're gambling on its value for no social benefit now I know that this bit the that these crypto currencies are popular they're popular with guys who want to send their pajamas until their wives are going to be millionaires and they're popular with those who have read Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead and believe that these are the new canons the new divinely inspired documents of our age but they are harmful and they're harmful in one other way and that is I'm gonna mispronounce the word sinner edge is the benefit that the US government gets by issuing currency it is the float it is the fact that we do not pay interest on newly created dollars we lose that as well and the Fed was able to return well over fifty billion dollars to our Treasury and many of the recent years we undercut that and then finally we've got the initial coin offerings deliberately naming themselves to lie to the public and convey the image that it's like an initial public offering they stole the intellectual property and Trademark of legitimate investing and applied it to a fixed fraudulent gambling scheme of no social benefit aside from that I think it's a good idea I real then thank you the currency is both a store of value when you hope appreciates and a medium of exchange so let's focus on the medium of exchange is there any reason why I would need a cryptocurrency to pay for my groceries or anything else why would I that wouldn't be adequately served by using dollars yes mr. Vinh yes Thank You congressman I know not not yourself I believe sir because you and I are you're assuming I'm not a terrorist or criminal and I thank you for though I'm assuming you're an American citizen which i think is a pretty safe save assumption that that one's safe the other two are question go ahead we you and I have the benefit of a well-functioning and extremely important financial infrastructure that's around us every day of credit cards of bank accounts and and most Americans do find it not too difficult to become banked we have an unbanked problem in this country but it's not nearly as profound as other parts of the world in other words there any part of the world where the unbanked could just as easily have access to transactions in real currencies rather than crypto currencies so there are parts of the world where real currencies in those countries are being basically debased by their governments are hyper-inflated or there just don't have actual purchasing power because right so you can use dollars euros Swiss francs why are those not the adequate substitute if you can find access to cash in your region of the world US dollars that might be a very good means of exchange but those will trade at extreme premiums my only point is that crypto currencies are accessible they're accessible financial tools only on the basic precondition that someone has a smartphone and an internet connection and I think there are regions of the world where people will sooner have smartphones and Internet connections then they'll have access to a valuable and secure financial services from companies I wonder if someone else can comment on that I don't think the tallest mountain of Tibet there's somebody with $100 bill that they're holding on to and if and every cellphone there's a way to use dollars or Euros does someone else have a comment mr. Sherman thank you for the questions I want to divide your question into two different parts one or one is part one part relates to things like Bitcoin and other currencies which is really what you're discussing second part is going to relate to tokens and similar types of things that have instruments that have specific purposes on specific platforms that people can earn and generate in ways that you could not do with cash what does just foci of limited time focus on what what can't you do with cash well in a in a platform for example where we are where we have buyers a buyer of property sellers and then we have third parties who are performing important services to the platform to help the platform run to help validate services to help do other functions that are and what why could these platforms use dollars because there's no place nobody who's going to pay them what happens on these platforms is that the platform itself I have a bank I pay them one way or another no no you you you have to find a source you have to find somebody who would have who would have who would be in the business of paying them and that costs money so what you see in these platforms we've seen is Sir I've lived my whole life as old as almost anybody in the room I kind of eat a say but and and various intermediaries have handled my financial transactions my entire life and none of them have gone hungry we're talking about a very different business model right than that that's what that's one of the things that's so important about this and what about this we know that this is a good method for terror criminals and tax evaders so the question is is there some great social purpose that cannot be met in any other way and I want to hear from a different witness and I don't see one volunteering honestly I think it's an important question because you're getting ultimately to the this question as to whether or not many of these cryptocurrencies and I think the vast majority of the cryptocurrencies tied to icos are really just means by which you're you're raising capital as opposed to currency I will say well raising capital but unregulated doing an IPO but calling it an ICO well what are the one of the one of the key responses I was trying to make for mr. Rosenblum when discussing the adequate disclosures or the kinds of disclosures that one would like to see in a white paper is precisely in order to beef up those white papers so that they become more compliant with the expectations of our securities law which i think is an expectation that all securities lawyers would enjoy but I am I am I am very sympathetic to that but if I go buy an IC o---- and the company sells great pizza and eventually makes billions I don't get any of that right I'm not a stockholder but neither but sir the important thing on those tokens is the company that creates the platform may not have any financial success on the platform and the fact that the platform becomes very successful may not renowned to the benefit of the point of the entity that created the platform fee well perhaps we'll have another hearing after some major terrorist event financed by cryptocurrencies and I yield back

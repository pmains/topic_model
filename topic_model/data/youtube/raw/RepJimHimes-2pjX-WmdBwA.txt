uh thank you mr chairman uh and i i rise to join happily in the amendment offered by my neighbor and close friend ms deloro and by ranking member waters one of the crucial achievements of the dodd-frank bill of course was to drag a massive and in some cases very dangerous derivative markets into the light of day by giving cftc authority to look at the instruments which brought down aig which were involved in the london whale which when used incorrectly can create a systemic risk to the system and this is a market that has been growing very very rapidly in 2010 the total derivatives market was about 124 trillion dollars that's trillion with a t that's that's a multiple of the size of the u s economy today it's almost double that 223 trillion dollars now these are securities that can cause all sorts of havoc if not adequately regulated this amendment as ms deloro pointed out in no way expands bureaucracy we're not saying spend more money though there is a very powerful argument for spending more money on an agency that has been tasked to take on a massive new market it is simply providing flexibility the question before this house on this amendment comes down to a very simple question we are either going to provide discretion to the cftc to run to where they think the danger is and if they think that their i.t is insufficient they can spend this money on the i.t they're either going to run to where the danger is or we as a house are going to decide that we are such crack i t professionals that we should tell the cftc that they must spend this money on their system folks that doesn't make any sense therefore i urge uh in favor of providing the cftc the flexibility that they need and in well regulating this market the support of this

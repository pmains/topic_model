I consider myself blessed to stand before you at this particular moment in our history as Florida's 46th governor I observe during my inaugural address that the words of Alexander Hamilton Energy and the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government I believe it and I've work to exemplify it less than 60 days my administration has taken bold action the dress issues that Floridians care about reorienting our environmental policy around the goal of cleaning up our water announcing far-reaching education reforms designed to make Florida number one and skills based education by the year 2030 securing hundreds of millions of dollars for store ravaged parts of Northwest Florida bringing accountability two entities ranging from the Broward Sheriff's Office to the South Florida Water Management District and appointing three spectacular justices to our state Supreme Court we together the political branches must work together so that we can build off the foundation that has been laid and set the stage for the future success of our state how can we accomplish this past I answer simply be bold be bold and championing economic opportunity be bold and protecting Florida's environment be bold and improving education be bold and defending the safety of our communities be bold because while perfection is not attainable if we aim high we can achieve excellence let's fight the good fight let's finish the race let's keep the faith so that when Floridians look back on the fruits of this session they will see it as one of our state's finest hours [Music]

California is welcoming recognized for five minutes thank you it's great thing is critical that we get capital to small business outside of this the scope of this hearing most businesses borrow most of their capital and what I'm seeing is that if you're borrowing money at prime plus 3 you can get the money if you want to borrow money at thirty-three percent annual well there's an advertisement every few minutes about how you get your money the next day but the prime plus six prime plus eight loan la prime prime plus five loan that I was used to seeing when visit when when banks and other lenders took some limited risk seems to be gone but here we're focused on on capital rather than bar and day and shareholders equity rather than loans uh mr. cursillo beyond the JOBS Act what proposals can you come up with that will help both small and medium-sized business get access to equity capital and and and perhaps others would have element as well well and I initially thought as I read through these these bills I initially thought the Halos Act was was good and so this gives me an opportunity to talk about about that act and as these panelists have talked about it they focused on angel investor groups I actually think those are quite good and and quite helpful and I think would be bipartisan what threw me when I read that act though is the expansion of that act into venues such as not-for-profits and universities and governmental entities and for someone who's worked in a university for over 25 years I can tell you most people who work there are not accredited investors most people who work there are not sophisticated investors I think that that poses tremendous you mean my professors were not as smart as they told me they going not about financial matters most Americans as you probably know mr. Sherman being a CPA quite knowledgeable about financial matters does anyone else have a comment if not I'll move on to the next question mr. quad man I'm a co-sponsor of the SEC small business advocate see Act which would create an office of advocate for small business capital formation do you think this new office would help energize the capital markets for small and medium-sized and initial public offering companies yes I think it would allow for that voice for capital formation to be heard within the halls of the SEC where it has been before and as I said before I think it would also would force the SEC to modernize rules that would prevent Congress from having to go through a Jobs Act exercise again mr. dr. Carillo do we should we be providing additional exemptions from section 404 believe its 404 be dealing with reporting on a company's internal controls I know this is a cost for some companies and it seems like an unwarranted cost except when it discloses a problem right yeah I don't think we should I think if if the Congress decides to move forward as I suggested to the committee I would at least give the investors the owners of the company the right to elect so at the end of five years put it to a vote put it to a shareholder vote and if it's as good an idea as all of the people to my left and right think it is then these shareholders will overwhelmingly approve it I do think that 404 has produced tremendous benefits there is a lot of research not just in the Academy the financial executives Research Foundation recently released a study where financial executives approximately half of them have said the benefits of the internal control attestation far exceed the costs again it was put in place because of problems with financial reporting restatements fraud and when that happens confidence in the capital markets evaporates and capital dries up so we're concerned about capital formation don't lose sight of that other side if you would give me the ability I want to make a very small comment if I would if you could about the small business advocate act I think it's a no I I do want to bet just a few more seconds and it wouldn't be a committee hearing it

my name is ethan weiss and i'm a senior at occidental college in los angeles in january and february of this year as part of assemblies in boston washington dc los angeles chicago and minneapolis 355 students came together to tell our stories of israel to hear those of other students and to share those stories with elected officials and community leaders we strategized together and we planned together we grew and we strengthened our connections to each other and in turn we grew and strengthened the foundations of the movement itself these j street youth student assemblies were for me a defining moment this year rarely do students today have so great a say over the form of the conversation around israel so much of the discourse is dominated by outdated and counterproductive talking points we can neither call our own nor consider particularly useful yet with these assemblies and with j street u students actually shaped the program and told their stories as they wanted to and as a result the community leaders we hosted shared a few uncensored responses of their own rather than sticking merely to the script we are the future of pro-israel because we are learning the strength of each of our stories in struggling to tell a common narrative and in taking action together and i'm debbie schlossberg mother of two social worker and a local leader of j street in central new jersey what you may not know about j street leaders is that we have opinions we have lots of them and they get listened to and that's actually how the future of pro-israel campaign came about through many many conference calls and conversations with leaders across the country talking about the upcoming challenges both political and in the communities that we live in and how we can turn those challenges into opportunities for education and action in the past three months since launching the future of pro-israel campaign all 44 locals have been collecting the stories of hundreds of long-time and new j street supporters we the many hundreds of lay leaders at j street have done this in over 120 house meetings and programs in 31 cities across the country we are the future of pro-israel because being part of the future isn't just for our very amazing young people it's for all of us we are the future of pro-israel because we can all imagine the world as it should be and can all be a part of a movement that helps get us closer to making that vision a reality my name is bruce tempkin and i'm the future of pro-israel i'm the future of pro-israel i and we are the future of pro-israel i'm the future pro-israel i'm the future of pro-israel my name is and i am the future of pro-israel i am the future of pro-israel because israel's future depends on it being a free democratic jewish state living in peace with its neighbors my name is keenan and i'm the future of pro-israel because i'm deeply concerned about the future prosperity and security of the jewish people in their homeland i'm the future of pro-israel because i've been a strong advocate of a two-state solution i'm the future of pro-israel because the jewish values that i was brought up with forced me to struggle with what it means to be democratic struggle with what it means to be jewish and i'm the future of pro-israel because i was born there and i grew up there and all of my family lives there because i believe that a negotiated two-state solution that establishes a secure and democratic israel side by side with a secure and democratic palestine is the key i'm the future of pro-israel because i want the jewish people to be on the right side of history i'm the future of pro-israel because i've never felt closer to my jewish identity in the jewish people than i do right now at this very moment i'm the future of pro-israel because if i'm not many other voices will fill the void pro-israel has come to mean helping israel achieve peace not helping israel retain land feel such a deep passion for justice and for there to be a vibrant democracy in israel and that is the future of israel i want more than anything to be part of building in israel that i can share with my children with pride and to me that means a democratic israel that makes peace with its neighbors i think about all the challenges that israel faces to its security to its lasting hopes for peace to its jewish and democratic nature and i think of all the reasons every day why it would be so much easier to close up shop go home and not worry about it that's when i think about all the young people and the old people jewish americans jewish israelis and people who have a lot of resources people who have nothing we're doing so much to try to advance pro-israel agenda to be truly pro-israel in my view is to create support within this country within the jewish community particularly within congress support for the policies that president obama has advocated i come from a long history of zionists and i guess for the future of my grandparents 100 years ago sitting around a table praying and dreaming of the jewish state and for my grandchildren for them to have a future of a state of israel in existence i think it's very important for the definition of pro-israel to involve a dialogue as opposed to one narrow view discussion amongst everyone young adults those old generation young people i see a future of secure israel based upon two lands for two peoples supporting israel also means supporting human rights and supporting two states i'm the future of pro-israel because i'm not afraid to take action and to work for an israel that i'm proud of we cannot delay any longer to change the course of history i'm the future of pro-israel because when these essential values are threatened i'm willing to stand up and fight for them out loud from synagogue to synagogue congressional district the congressional district house to house person to person we're going to make our voices heard i care about my israeli friends too much to shut up or to give up and that's why i organized with j street and that's why in this election year i'm going to make sure that my elected representatives understand the future for israel i am the future of pro-israel because i care that israel will have a future hello everyone can you hear me all right this is the part where we're gonna get like loud and noisy and rowdy ready all right my name is karine luck and i'm the vice president at j street for campaigns i am here representing a team of 14 amazing field and new media staff and hundreds and hundreds of volunteer leaders and activists representing 37 states and over 55 cities across this country it is a privilege and an honor to do so now as it is every day in my work all right before we start we're gonna we're gonna get warmed up um can i ask you to raise your hand or make some noise if this is your first j street conference wow that is that is amazing um okay how about um how many of us here are involved in a j street local or a j street u chapter back at home hand yes yeah so many of us okay uh one more um what about the future of pro-israel campaign how many of you either made a video or wrote a testimonial for the future of pro-israel website anyone right i have to tell you it was so hard making the film you just saw we had hundreds of videos and submissions that we received over the course of the past eight weeks so that that really is just a slice of those and if you haven't had a chance go to future pro israel.com i'll be saying that a lot this session when you have a chance and check it out because this whole rest of the session this campaign it's about all of you and what we're going to do together this summer all right well so some of us are brand new to j street or this is the first conference um as we've seen we come from many different backgrounds and experiences but we're in the same room because we've all decided to take action for the sake of israel's future and we know as elise also pointed out it hasn't always been easy to do so right we have to be honest about that many of us have believed in a two-state solution for a long time but we've often found it hard to speak up sometimes we don't believe in our own power to affect change sometimes we faced such hostile pushback that it seems wiser to back down right there are those in this country who devote resources to maintaining the status quo when it comes to israel and the israeli-palestinian conflict there are those who believe that the direction of our national policy and the content of our national conversation should be set by the very few and the very loud by the same people and organizations who have always shaped the direction and set the parameters for acceptable conversation on this issue they like some observers and some politicians are banking on it always being this way but this campaign the future of pro-israel is our rebuttal just look around you all of us we represent a rising tide of american jewish opinion a tide that is growing with strength and conviction reflecting what has long been the opinion of our community's quiet majority there are those in this election year who have chosen to make israel their polit their favored wedge issue a political football tossed around as a weapon to damage candidates campaigns without the least regard as to the impact on israel itself for any concern for the actual values and opinions of the majority of american jews well this the future of pro-israel campaign says to those who pander and peddle in the politics of fear and intimidation you're wrong jewish and american public support for a two-state solution and the u.s role in achieving it is strong and long-standing the future of pro-israel campaign however is about no longer just yelling at our tv screens until we're ready in the face it's about taking the facts and our values to a wide an audience as possible to politicians and to voters to synagogues and town halls to family and friends and out into the streets there are those that say that we at j street represent a few people or we don't care enough to stand up and be counted will the future of pro-israel campaign gives a voice to the many many thousands of people who have already come to j street because they care deeply about securing israel's future and understand that the creation of a palestinian state is integral to that the future of pro-israel campaign is our way of welcoming the many more who are coming to j street today because they feel the danger of an action or because they no longer can accept the rhetoric in their communities and the way their values are being misrepresented to the world the future of pro-israel campaign is our way of welcoming all who understand the consequences of failing to establish a durable two-state solution in the very near future it is our way of creating avenues of action so that together we can write a new history for israel and its neighbors we come together tonight from all over the country and and the world with our varied experiences to share a vision of what it means to be the future of pro-israel and over the past eight weeks we've gathered the stories and the testimonials you posted on the future pro-israel website we have watched every single video and read every single story and when we launched this campaign with our local leaders we made a commitment to you that by today we would compile these individual contributions and combine them so we have one community vision one statement that represents the breadth and depth of this movement and i've seen all our stuff people have been handing them out we did so this is a this is a collective vision made of all the things that you have said to us that you want to be in here and i'm just going to read it out for you now we are the future of pro-israel we come together as proud supporters of a two-state solution we are americans who believe in democracy and equality we are jews who believe that to seek peace is to pursue justice and ensure lasting security we believe to our very core in israel's right to exist as a jewish homeland and a democracy that guarantees equality to all its citizens we fight for an israel whose people live in security with recognized borders in israel living in peace and prosperity alongside a palestinian homeland where citizens can thrive and build their own country we share in the vision of israel as a homeland for the jewish people and palestine as a homeland for the palestinian people living side by side and peace and security we are the future of pro-israel we believe in an israel that is guided by its principles its ethics and its values as enshrined in its founding documents we believe that is a part of building a jewish homeland not apart from it we understand that this conflict ends with two winners or two losers this cannot be a zero-sum game we know that we cannot delay any longer there will never be a better time or the right time there is only less time there is only now that is why we call on the us government to invest all possible resources to help israelis and palestinians create a peaceful and secure future for them both and we call out those opportunistic politicians who would jeopardize israel's future for their own political ends we are the future of pro-israel we have chosen to stand up for what is right and what is necessary we care too much to be silent or to indulge in despair we believe we serve israel best when we create the space for an open conversation about its future in our community amongst and across generations and denominations and we will be tireless in our efforts we will go from synagogue to synagogue congressional district to congressional district house to house person to person and we'll make our voices heard we will take action and we will fight for our values in the name of our grandparents and for the sake of our grandchildren we are the future of pro-israel we came here tonight to share this vision your vision these are literally your words we came here tonight to share this vision of what it means to be the future of pro-israel but that's actually just one part of it right because we know that vision without action cannot change the course of history we can't simply wait for politicians and policy makers to lead the way we have to lead ourselves and we all know this right they're asking us to lead so are you ready to learn about how we're going to do that together this election year all right all right well it turns out we're going to make history again by raising hands or making some noise uh raise your hands again if you're part of a j street local or a j street u chapter raise your hands keep em up because if your hand isn't up if you're not part of a local or you have no idea what i'm talking about when i say that it's not the union side it's us look and see whose hand is up find one of those people talk to them afterwards because j street locals and j street u chapters are your election home this year for future pro-israel activities so the first thing oh you can put them down you're good you're following instructions um the first thing we'll be doing when we get back to our home cities is actually presenting this vision it's a community vision we've created and we're going to present it back to our own communities at home during the week of may 6th we're going to be holding future pro-israel meetings and inviting our supporters as well as institutional communal and political leaders to share our stories and vision for the future of pro-israel and we're going to organize our organize ourselves into action teams so we can be ready for the rest of the year all right so week of may 6th everyone now is going to need their like little google calendar on their on their phones all right then wait for it just a few days later in new york city on may 15th jeremy benami is going to be debating bill crystal it's going to be doing that at nature shrine synagogue on the upper west side of manhattan some of you may have heard of it those of you who aren't in new york don't despair will be will be filming the event and putting out videos so you can use them at house meetings and move them uh and invite people so they can see these videos too but if you're in the tri-state area and that's new york new jersey connecticut i live in new york so it's a bit myopic come out to this event this event literally defines the choice that americans and the american jewish community face this year when it comes to how we want to conduct our israel politics right so week of may 6 may 15th and that is just the beginning because you're seeing it here i keep hearing it from people right for the first time in this organization's four years we have this amazing grassroots base and student base that can engage with the election at both the presidential and congressional level so we're we're taking it to a whole new a whole new realm this year this spring and summer we'll be training and organizing leaders and activists in a range of issue education and voter engagement tactics including phone banking rapid response we're going to go to town hall meetings we're gonna go and we're gonna host candidate forums we're hosting debate and convention watch parties we're canvassing and we're getting out the vote we're gonna do all of these things together and we're going to turn this vision statement it's not just going to be a vision statement it's going to be an educational tool so that each of you and the thousands and thousands of folks who couldn't be here today but are watching all around the country so they can actually have the israel conversation with members of of their community with our community in a way that's rooted in shared values and goals that's what this is about right not the heated rhetoric of the election campaign season we want more people to join us we want more people to take action and we want more people to be more informed about what is at stake this year at the voting booth and in our communities this is our way of doing that so that's that's a lot of stuff right you excited oh right well here's one thing you can do we're going to also go a little technology focused now if you

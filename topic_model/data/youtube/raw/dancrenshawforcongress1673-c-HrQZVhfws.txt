[Music] I'm grooving and welcome to this clash of ideas and leadership put forth by the top contenders in congressional district - Texas - encompasses humble Kingwood slices through spring taking in portions of sy fair spring branch and River Oaks lying to succeed the retiring ted poe democrat and native Houstonian todd Litton educated at duke rice and UT Litton left a career in the investment sector to lead nonprofits serving our community he and his wife Jennifer are proudly parenting two daughters and a son representing the Republican Party Lieutenant Commander Dan Crenshaw a retired Navy SEAL wounded in combat during the third of five deployments driven to continue his service Crenshaw earned a master's in public administration from Harvard and with his wife Tara returned to his native Texas with that let's begin at the core of president Trump's border security initiative like two components a massive 2,000 mile border wall and a zero tolerance enforcement policy for those who seek to enter this country without permission and crucial you have said when it comes to controlling entry barriers matter so is the wall worth the investment Gregg s it is I mean look we're looking at a situation right now but that is completely unsustainable you know the highest at the highest rate of illegal crossings river-like 1.6 million Democrats like to point out that that's the lowest rate ever since last year but that's still over 400,000 that's a really unsustainable it's unsustainable for a law enforcement our Border Patrol our court system our education our school system it's in sustainable for our health care system in our emergency rooms so we have to do some and it did create a real crisis on the border which we saw earlier this year no one wants to see families ripped apart in fact Republicans put forth legislation to stop that practice Democrats opposed it and it's unclear why I think but what we see a lot of the Democrats side is this sort of moral superiority or the help everyone okay but in the end they don't actually help anyone and you know because what it actually happens is it encourages human trafficking it encourages drug trafficking as as bad for illegal immigrants for paying tens of thousands of dollars to for coyotes to actually get them across the border it's not good for anybody it's especially not good for legal immigrants either all right now my stepmother is a legal immigrant she cherishes her citizenship I am Pro legal immigration my priority will be they don't let's look for ways together to actually fix our legal immigration system make it better Republicans want to have that conversation we want to have that conversation about what do we do with the dreamer population all right but we have to secure the border first and that's a wall where that makes sense that's electronic surveillance where that makes sense it's more patrols where that makes sense especially on there along the rivers so we need to give our Border Patrol agents the resources they need you have to stop people from crossing from point A to point B and make our system sustainable again Texans are on the front line on this issue and they have to be able to trust their government that that to protect our own sovereignty I think that's a very reasonable thing to do so let's get something that's sustainable and an assistant that we can trust Todd letting you oppose both the wall and the current zero tolerance policy what would you support in place of that well first and foremost Greg I believe we've got a secure our border we can't have open borders nobody's for open borders but immigration is an area where we have this real strong partisan divide and it's a rule really symbolic I think of how and why Washington is broken you got one side and Dan was among these people hashtag build the wall build the wall in all caps on his Twitter feed this was something he ran on very strongly I I don't support the wall at all it'll be clear if we're gonna build a wall let's build a wall to stop hurricanes down and protect the port that's a great national security issue to take on but I think we've got to look at a way to move forward again when Dan got in this race I mean he's been with the freedom caucus he's been you know with a tea party on his far-right issue and I think it's something that really is again indicative of how Washington is broken people wants to move forward here in Houston among all places this is a place where people come to build a better life for themselves and their families let's start with the dreamers over 70% of Texans support that finding way forward for the dreamers over 70% of Americans is the same way that's where we've got to start and start to move forward on my kids had their sixth grade math teacher was a dreamer an amazing person who came here was three years old was brought here by his mom was three years old he's incredible part of the school we've got to move forward on that but we can't move forward in a hyper partisan way and that's what I hear too much of coming from Washington DC right now and I think frankly Dan's been a part of that I mean when he got involved to Danny when we talked about this in the past - you've said $100,000 to DC pack you've benefited from you know close to a million dollars a super PAC money supporting your efforts down here so looking at that how are we gonna move forward it's not in a hyper partisan way it's not with a freedom caucus it's not with a tea party it's working together that's what our community is about all down here in Houston that's what we got to do when it comes to immigration people come here to build a better lives for themselves and their families you know when you really look at it - about 40 percent or more of the people who you know we're here quote-unquote illegally have overstayed their visas these are people who you know came across from the wall this is not something we need to be stoking that fear button on our country let's move forward in a constructive way I believe Hughes can help lead the way on that Dan Crenshaw 30-second rebuttal well it talks about not being partisan but he just made up some facts right there I haven't set my campaign money anywhere I promise to raise money for fellow Republicans I haven't sent it anywhere listen what I also heard a lot of was was it was value signaling without any solutions actually offered if you want border security then help fund the president's proposals when the president talks about the wall he actually is talking about yes a physical wall again where that makes sense and also it's it's in the line items when he actually does this let's fund abortion Kirti because it sounds like all Texans want that you have to start there you have to tackle the source of the problem and actually help stop the illegal immigration next topic the current opening on the Supreme Court has been described as the swing vote dictating the continuance of or reversal of critical standards including the Roe versus Wade Todd Litton if you had the opportunity would you vote for judge Brett Kavanaugh you know I've been thinking a lot about this in particular Gregg just the last week and seeing dr. Ford what I thought very compelling very courageous testimony that she gave last week gives me great pause on me before the judge Kavanagh and I would not vote to support just Cavanaugh to be clear his his response and there are other allegations - I understand he's upset and defensive about what's going on but again I found her testimony be highly compelling and I believe at this point we need a full FBI investigation not some partial investigation this is a lifetime appointment to United States Supreme Court this shouldn't have a high bar to be put on that court they should have the highest bar to be put on that court and what we saw the judge Cavanaugh's testimony and how he frankly I think it best dodged some answers maybe stretch the truth or was inconsistent drink that the glide on some answers about what was going on in his past life maybe some small things initially but could lead to bigger things again the highest bar for a lifetime appointment that's what we're for there's no rush we had eight justices on the Supreme Court for months about two years ago and Justice Scalia passed away we do not need to rush this and it's unfortunate how partisan the Supreme Court has become and I look back to you know Merrick garland never got a hearing that doesn't mean we should be trying to delay and have tactics that maybe aren't respecting people's privacy or things of that nature as well but I have real concerns about judge Cavanaugh's judicial temperament as well as some being frankly somewhat loose with the truth and some smaller matters that could also signal some losses on the truth or some larger matters you know we have to think back to a year goes when Harvey Weinstein in the meeting that really took off and I think back to Justice Thomas and Anita Hill we've got a long way to go to have equality for women and men in this country dan Crenshaw same question to you would you vote for judge now well we're gonna see that vote play out today I honestly can't believe we're using the same old tired talking points and to to compare Merrick Garland's which was which was stopped via the process versus what's happening to judge Cavanaugh right now and they absolutely ruining of his life to compare those two morale in the same moral footing I think is is crazy there's there's two victims in this all right there's dr. Ford and there's there's Brett Kavanaugh now the investigation is wrapping up all right we're seeing no corroboration for any of these claims now I think it's pretty obvious from the beginning this has been a complete political sham this has been this has been you know we may be expected this to happen but we didn't really think it would it would it would go that far there's a third there's a third victim in all of this actually and it's just our justice system is this idea that do we value due process or not do we value the presumption of innocence are we going to let partisan politics overcome the presumption of innocence maybe that's a real that's a much deeper question you know just because there's questions raised you're saying basically that now we have to stop everything well Democrats are the one raising the questions and they and they absolutely manipulated the process in order to do so these actually the other questions like why would they do this why is this so important to Democrats and I think I think they have a fundamentally

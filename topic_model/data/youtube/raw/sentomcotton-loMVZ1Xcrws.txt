welcome back America I'm Hugh Hewitt a good Tuesday morning to you Senator Tom Cotton joins me this morning no doubt he missed the Ohio State Michigan game so we don't have to talk about that Senator cotton I do want to talk with you about Apple and Twitter uh Elon Musk has said today that apple is considering moving Twitter from removing Twitter from the App Store how does that strike you how would you respond to that Hugh I think that would be a very ill-advised decision by Tim Cook and apple I understand that he may not care for Elon Musk maybe he's a little envious of elon's must must massive success as a businessman um but uh remove a widely used social media app from Apple's App Store simply because he has political disagreements with Elon Musk or the direction he's taking Twitter would simply be inviting aggressive legislative and Regulatory action in Washington now Senator I note that you are a fairly frequent user of Twitter as is your team over at the Senator's office have you noticed any difference since Elon Musk took over I have not I haven't noticed a single thing different no you the only difference I've noticed is a bunch of liberals predicting that Twitter is about to collapse into frozen dysfunction any moment now uh and I think that that was maybe two weeks ago when it was predicted to happen a few days later so the predictions are increasingly wrong maybe they're proven wrong but you know I probably put my money on the guy that sends Rockets to the Moon all right I put the guy in who can land the Rockets back on the pad actually that's a thing that impresses me better even better so Senator cotton in terms of what's going it's a moral Panic among the left that they've lost control over a website that actually matters to the distribution of the news that's all it is but I do think I I just am unaware of anything that has happened when I see that hate speech Etc is up on on Twitter I don't know if it is or not but it doesn't matter to users unless they go looking for that stuff and he this gets back to your point about the experience that most users have has not changed much um I mean I guess if you're a liberal reporter trying to find uh obscure uh accounts that you can then highlight and hold up as representative of your political adversaries you might find it but for most people who use social media to follow news in their Community or their favorite sports teams or what's their favorite reporters are publishing uh on a day-to-day basis again I don't think the experience has changed at all right I want to switch over to Georgia I just talked to Rhonda McDaniel uh they've got 400 RNC staffers down there everybody is going to help out Herschel but people need to know they got to vote early this week until Friday at six or next Tuesday how important is a 50 50 Senate as opposed to a Democrat majority of 5149 Tom Cotton vitally important too uh there's a lot of things that we can do in a 50 50 Senate to slow down in some cases stop uh the most extreme element to the Biden agenda along with the House Majority stop the most extreme nominees you know we've done that in a few cases here where one Democratic senator boss either publicly or privately there's much harder to stop those radical left Wingers if it takes two Democratic senators bucking their own president but even more important to you than control of the United States Senate is who will represent the people of Georgia for the next six years this is about being George's voice and Herschel Walker will be a voice for sanity for stable prices and a strong growing economy for tough on crime policies for a secure border and a crowd strong America in the world we know what Raphael Warnock will do he has been a radical radical left-wing ideologue and a rubber stamp for Joe Biden's agenda so for the people of Georgia this could not be a more pressing decision have you pieced together why Republicans are disappointed yet Senator obviously I was thinking we're going to pick up 25 seats in the house and we only got nine that's on top of 14 in the previous cycle so it's a majority and it's a good majority it's what the Nancy Pelosi had and I'm not part of the Beltway media bad-mouthing House Majority we came up short in the Senate but 50 50 is better than 51.49 by a lot and the map is a lot better for us what do you think happened what's your uh prognosis of the disappointment well here at a high level it's fairly clear what happened we lost races that we we maybe should have won or we hope to win is that we did not do a good enough job of winning over independent and moderate or swing voters that's very clear in those races where we won big elections like Ron DeSantis and Marco Rubio in Florida or Mike dewine in Ohio um even in cases where we lost races but we had candidates running far ahead of the top ticket like limit oz of Pennsylvania over Tiffany Smiley in Washington they did a very good job of appealing to those independent and moderate voters um I think it's probably still a little too early to tell uh you still want to reconcile Expo returns with what happened in each state and there's probably some variation in each state each state is its own uh campaign but we need to do a better job of appealing to independent and swing voters this is not a reflection that we lost because our voters didn't turn out an election we lost because the Democrats had some kind of Surge and turnout it was election we lost on the margins in certain places because of a failure to persuade those independent swing voters to impact the Republican candidate now Senator you've got it you are not yourself running for president in 2024 so I can ask you this do you have a fellow Arkansas who is Elisa Hutchinson are you going to get involved in the uh 2024 race are you going to wait and tell us later he you're behind or you're just going to sit it out and support the nominee well Hugh I I have elected not to be a candidate myself so I don't plan to be a pundit or a strategist on anyone else's behalf I have no plans uh to be involved for any candidate at the moment and I don't expect to be involved uh anytime soon it's always possible that as the race develops I might I did not in 2016 United States neutral in the primaries I was willing to help or advise anyone who sought my helper advice but I want to have a strong Republican nominee and then of course I backed the former president uh once he secured the nomination but right now I have no plans or expectation I wish all the candidates very well we have a lot of problems to solve and I know that we're gonna have a lot of strong candidates in the race uh trying to solve those problems for our voters now JB Vance after he won put out a very interesting op-ed that the Republicans have a small donor disadvantaged do you agree with that and how do we remedy that if that's the case yeah there's no doubt about that question and uh JD Vance's essay was very uh it's very worthwhile read for anyone who wants to know what it's like to have been a candidate and struggled against this massive money machine there are a lot of reasons for that view uh one thing is the Democrats have just been at it for very long you know absolute is the remnants of Howard deems 2004 presidential campaign um there's some technical reasons for it uh I think there's some behavioral reasons about you know what our candidates and campaigns have done in recent years but it's something that we really need to address we have a lot of great voters a lot of great supporters people who will pitch in five or ten dollars if you ask them um but we've got to give them a compelling reason to do so we need to give them the infrastructure the technical infrastructure that makes it very easy and trustworthy to do so as well you can raise all the money you want for super Pacs but at the end of the day candidates own money is much more valuable than any outside organization because they can control the way it's spent and the message that are communicated and they get the lowest advertising rates and no other organization does that was the genuine reveal for me in JD's essay I did not realize that super Pacs did not get the rate card that the candidates get and in the radio business we're very aware you have to offer your lowest rate to every candidate but you don't have to offer your lower rate to the Super PAC business but I didn't know that uh sweeping generalization time Senator I have this morning because it's giving Tuesday we've given I have given the fetching Mrs Hewitt and I have given to Angel Tree the banner of which is over at the top of Hugh hewitt.com Semper Fi Fund Fisher house and the Gary Sinise Foundation that's because I lost the Ohio State Michigan bet to Larry though I contribute to all three of those organizations as well so we are in in the giving mode on giving Tuesday but we also have a couple of churches to support one on each Coast do you think that maybe Democrats lead in small donors because a lot of the Republican small donors are tithing first um I think that's a real possibility to you I mean a regular churchgoers certainly tend to vote Republican um and they understandably put their own church as uh first for political giving uh as I think is appropriate it's also possible for you that uh just inflation bites our voters a little bit more oh yeah Democratic voters is that uh you know our voters who are kind of normal working class two parent families um you know struggle when inflation is at eight percent year over year in a way that wealthy Democratic donors not not just you know Hollywood tycoons or Wall Street tycoons but you know what to couple income and the Washington DC area where one's a diversity consultant and one's a green energy lobbyist um you know they just don't have the same kind of pinch of inflation that a lot of our Republican supporters across the country have now Senator I want to close by talking to you about employee donations to midterm candidates by party Netflix 99.9 six percent Democrat Twitter ninety eight point seven percent Democrat Airbnb 97.8 percent Democrat Apple 97.5 percent Democrat it goes on down finally we get to Oracle at the bottom of the list it's only 66 percent Democrat 33 percent Republican to what do you attribute big techs overwhelmingly Democratic bias well he was Mark Zuckerberg once testified in front of a senate committee Silicon Valley is an extremely left-wing place I think those uh numbers just uh bear that out I think there's something of a selection bias of people who want to go and work in that kind of environment I mean you can see it there in Oracle as well uh still predominantly Democratic but nowhere near what these social media companies are people who want to kind of control access to information and influence their society versus the kind of people that go to a company like Oracle and want to build something um I just think there's kind of a self-reinforcing cycle when it gets back to your first point about Apple threatening to remove Twitter from the App Store um they are hysterical that's one of the main uh avenues for accessing information in our country may be in the hands of a political rifle or just someone who actually believes in free speech or who believes in transparency and wants to reveal what happened with the hunter Biden laptop story and so I I just I don't that is so it's not 70 30. it's not 80 20. it's 99.5 at most of these places and I begin to wonder whether or not that shows up in ways large and small in the code and in the the algorithm do you think it does oh yeah I don't think there's much question that it does Hugh and uh it also just kind of it perpetuates their worldview you know the old joke about the Harvard Professor who couldn't believe that Richard Nixon won re-election because everyone she knew voted for uh George McGovern um I'm kind of surprised that there's one half of one percent of the employees at Netflix that would even dare contribute to a republican for risk of uh being exposed and canceled and driven out of their job well they might uh they might do it below a hundred dollars if you're below a hundred dollars it doesn't get published we'll see about that Senator cotton thank you for joining me we'll talk to you next week by the way do you expect there to be a CR for the entire year for one month um well I hope there's not uh we need the Democrats to actually take seriously defense funding um even if there's not a full year funding bill for the entire government I think we should do that for the Department of Defense obviously our common defense has to come uh as the first priority of the national government now from your lips to the Democratic Years thank you Senator Tom Cotton

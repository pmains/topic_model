so thank you mr chair and i want to thank you for holding this important hearing today uh the companies testifying today offer users an unprecedented ability to access consume and distribute information so mr chair you're right to focus on our attention focus our attention on how corporate product design and investment choices influence the content that is produced and distributed uh my first question for a couple of you is relative to content moderation and we've been talking about that throughout the hearing here last year francis hogan disclosed that at facebook 87 percent of all spending combating misinformation on facebook was spent on english language content despite the fact that only nine percent of facebook's users are english speakers she also disclosed that trust and safety investments for users in countries other than the united states were abysmal and an audit of twitter's disinformation and misinformation work disclosed by peter zacco who testified just yesterday and sent a judiciary committee found that twitter's integrity team lacked language expertise in the countries it was serving even though 80 percent of twitter users are outside the united states your companies make commitments to all of your users who are not just uh linguistically diverse but culturally diverse as well question first for mr cox in your testimony you state that you have four over 40 000 people working on trust and safety issues how many of those people focus on non-english language content and how many of them focus on non-us users sure senator happy to take your question our safety and security teams are deployed to help our users all around the world specifically on the question of misinformation which you mentioned we have 80 fact checkers operating in 60 countries around the world those fact checkers are certified by independent fact-checking organizations in the united states we have 11 fact-checkers six of whom support spanish language content we also have partnerships with univision and telemundo to connect people with spanish language authentic information around elections we also offer a election voting center in spanish language to americans uh to help folks get authoritative information about where to vote uh that's tailored to their specific zip code yeah look i appreciate the information you're sharing uh some that's been in your testimony welcome more more is better do you have any idea of the breakdown of the forty thousand people i reference first of all is that number roughly accurate if it's significantly higher let me know if it's significantly lower let us know what i'm looking at is the ratio of english versus non-english do you have that data senator i'd be happy to follow up on the specifics of how those forty thousand folks thank you thank you i would greatly appreciate that uh mr sullivan how many members of your trust and safety team have non-english language expertise and focus on issues outside the u.s yeah thank you for the question senator as a global company this is important to us we have about 2200 people working on content motivation globally i don't have the exact breakdown but we can take that back to our our team please ms pappas how large is your trust and safety team and how much does a tick tock invest in your non-english users and i guess non-western users i don't have those numbers at hand but i'm happy to get back to you on those as well okay mr mohan senator we have um over 20 000 people that that work on content moderation all over the world we're a global platform as you know uh supporting a couple billion users uh all over the world and we endeavor to enforce our policies as well as make sure that our recommendation algorithms work uh equally well for all speakers all over the world we support over we support dozens of languages on our platform in all the countries that we operate and to give you a couple of more concrete examples here in the u.s our support across all those four r's that i described in my initial testimony are not just about english but other languages as well so for example in spanish our policies are enforced our we serve up information panels not just in english but in spanish those relate to topics like elections how to vote where to vote etc covid related information uh because families are looking for that content uh not just in english in this country but we recognize in a number of different languages including spanish thank you i'd appreciate more more detail and the data from all of you speaking of data as some of you may or may not know my background is in engineering so uh am a big believer in data informed and data-driven policy-making in reviewing your testimony uh and appreciate the data some of the data that you did provide especially around dangerous content found on your platforms i have whether it's incomplete or desire for additional data let me just jump into a couple more questions mr cox in your testimony you say that meta found and removed 95 of hate speech content before it was ever reported of the remaining five percent how many users were recommend were recommended the content in their news feed do you have data along those lines senator i can offer data on prevalence which would be the uh the amount of content that appears across the averages of the content on our platform so for hate speech the prevalence in our last report is 0.02 or 2 out of every 10 000 pieces of content but you see where i'm going right 95 is a good number the 5 that you didn't catch before it was reported you know if it was recommended you know one two three five times that's one thing if it's recommended tens of thousands of times or more that's a different dynamic that's what we're trying to get at and if you don't have the data at your fingertips uh follow up and be welcome senator we'd be happy to follow up on that great miss pappas in your testimony you say that 88.4 percent of removals under tick tock's violent extremism policy occurred within 24 hours of being posted again a good number but it's not a hundred for the other 11.6 percent do we have a gauge of how long it took to find and resolve those items no i'd have to get back to you on that but similarly we look at you know the prevalence of content that would be violative and for violent extremism is point zero one percent okay thank you uh mr chair my time is up uh similar to center cinema i'll have some additional questions i'll submit uh for the record very good thank you senator padilla senator hall

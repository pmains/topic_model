and thank you so much for having me back to the committee and ranking member barasa thank you and the members of the committee I really appreciate the chance to speak about my bill with Senator Hickenlooper he had to go chair a subcommittee so he said I'm carrying the weight for both of us I'm happy to happy to do that on the Dolores River National Conservation Area and special Management Area act I want to spend a minute on why this bill matters to Colorado and why it deserves this committee's bipartisan support the Dolores river is vital to Southwest Colorado the canyon carved by the Dolores is renowned not just in our state but across the country for its Majestic red rock walls that Tower over the Ponderosa Pines I hope all of you have the chance to visit one day the Dolores river is not only a critical source of water for Southwest Colorado it is Central to the Region's farming ranching outdoor recreation and way of life but as with any River over the years different groups have had different priorities for its long-term management while some wanted stronger Federal Protection action to protect the river and its native fish others worry these steps would go too far and restrict local water uses in another place these disagreements often result in Perpetual conflict and stalemate but in Colorado all sides came together to find a middle ground to secure the future of the Dolores River they understood they continued uncertainty over the river's long-term management was unacceptable so they spent nearly two decades debating how best to manage the river for the Next Generation over literally hundreds of meetings and the result is a thoughtful compromise Bill written on the ground in Colorado by coloradans it enjoys the support of Republican and Democratic officials in Three Counties in Southwest Colorado Dolores Montezuma and San Miguel counties along with the youth Mountain Youth tribe local Agricultural and ranching interests and conservation groups the bill would protect over 68 Thousand Acres of public lands in Colorado and designated National Conservation Area and a special management area for a portion of the Dolores river that runs through the Three Counties the bill includes a range of designations that reflect the range of interests in the Dolores River to conserve native fish honor water rights and protect existing uses for Farmers ranchers communities and outdoor recreation this bill represents a balanced sensible way forward to resolve many any of the long-standing disagreements protect the river for all parties and provide long-term certainty for Generations it's why the bill enjoys bipartisan support not only in Colorado but in Congress earlier this year every Republican in the Colorado delegation introduced an identical version of this bill and this morning I've come with letters and testimony from counties tribal leaders conservation groups Sportsmen water districts and Community leaders across Southwest Colorado all supporting this bill Mr chairman I ask unanimous consent that these letters be entered into the hearing record without objection let me just end by saying how grateful I am to this committee for considering this bill Mr chairman and honor in Colorado's Decades of hard work I hope that once you've had the opportunity to look at it more closely it will it will earn a strong bipartisan vote in the committee thank you Mr chair thank you sir

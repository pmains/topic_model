Hi – this is Congressman Brad Schneider. I’m reminding you today that Open Enrollment
season just started. That means if you purchase your own health
insurance you can buy or change your plan for 2018. Open Enrollment begins TODAY, November 1 and
ends on December 15. This is a shorter period than previous years,
so make sure to act now to get covered. Visit GetCovered.Illinois.gov to compare plans,
check your eligibility, and purchase coverage. This is your chance to pick or make changes
to the health insurance that works best for you and your family. You can find plans with no-cost preventative
care – like flu shots and mammograms. You may also be eligible for help – last
year 8 in 10 people qualified for financial help to make their monthly premiums more affordable. The December 15 deadline will be here before
you know it, so make sure to visit GetCovered.Illinois.Gov today to sign-up. If you have any questions – our office is
here to help. Call us at (847) 383-4870. Thank you and make sure to get covered!

hi everyone i'm segmenting john biegelman and i'm a missions advisor with the air force rotc i'm here today to talk about our program what we have to offer and why this should be something you should be considering for your future i'm really glad to be here with you today despite the challenging times that we're currently experiencing but i really hope that this presentation helps out clarify any questions you may have as well as help out in any future decisions you might be looking at we're going to start by sharing my screen so you can have a visual representation of what we're going to be covering today and with that we're going to jump right into our first slide which is commissioning sources this is just to give you a broader perspective of what we are and as you can see here air force rotc is one out of three commissioning sources that the united states air force and newly commissioned space ward has to offer so we can be directly compared with the air force academy as they are on university all by themselves also on the other side of the house we have officer training school which is for people that have already completed their college degree and they're looking to become a second lieutenant and in our side of the house it's for people that are actively pursuing a college degree in a university or college that offers the air force rtc program at the end of the day the outcome if you attend any of these is the same which is to become a second lieutenant to expand a little bit more on this this is our mission this is us it's to develop quality leaders of character for tomorrow's air force and space work as i like to best describe our program the air force rtc is a three to four year leadership program that really likes to test and evaluate and develop your leadership as well as your professional skills our program is for is actually tailored towards the student to prepare them to be officers while still earning a college degree are one of the things that really best describes us is that we are hosted in over 1100 campuses nationwide that is including colleges and universities what does this mean this actually means that you can still decide and choose that university or college that you want to attend to it doesn't limit you to attending one university like for example the air force academy which is already one choice all by itself in our case as long as we offer the air force rotc program in that university or college that you're looking at you can still achieve this goal by attending night school to expand a little bit on that point this is tailored to the dallas fort worth area as you can see here this is where i'm out of right now i'm stationed out of texas christian university which is that golden star that you can see near fort worth in the middle of the map and that is what is known as host university what what this means is that that is the university that actually hosts the air force rtc program however that doesn't mean that you need to attend that college your university if you don't wish to we have crosstown campuses which is where you can see in the pinpoint locations which are basically other universities that have a partnership with that host university and you can attend any of those campuses and take your majoring courses there and then you will transition over to the host campus just to take your military focus courses and this is only the dallas fort worth area however this translates to any other location nationwide as well as you can i really encourage you to look at our afrtc.com website which you can see at the top of the screen and there you can actually find ivory campus that we are offer at continuing on this is just a air force rotc timeline of what your journey in the air force rtc actually is looking like so as i like to picture this there's two big faces within the program one is your freshman and sophomore which is this is going to be your learning phase here you're going to be actively learning how to follow how to become a leader and then also you're going to be learning all your military basics like customs courtesies drill public speaking all that at that midpoint there's a gap that you can see there uh highlighted in blue that is what we like to call our field training evaluation here's where we actually will send you to a boot camp type if you would we don't really like to call it bootcamp because it's not it is only a two week long training in which we seek to evaluate everything that you have learned in those first two years that is the sole purpose that translates later on to your junior and senior year in which you will actually be practicing that officership and leadership roles by leading the air force rotc training for those underclassmen and then after you complete those two portions as you can see here and we talked earlier you will commission as a second lieutenant united united states air force or space force also just to add on this slide and that junior and senior year is when you will be looking at choosing your careers we previously talked about space force and that is also something new that we have been incorporating if you would like to branch out into the space force that is when you would make that decision moreover this is just to give you a perspective of all the things that we have to offer this is only a glance of all the programs that we do offer but you can see here we have internships we also have language immersion programs as well as culture immersion programs and also one of the things that distinguishes us is that we have a really good partnership with the air force academy so despite if you would want to join the air force academy or not you can still attend some of the programs while being in the air force rotc so for example you can jump out of the plane with them you can actually fly with them if you would like to and as you can see here there's many other options for you things to do while you're in the program moving into the air force hard to see cadet life so this is one of the things that we really like to emphasize because while you're in college you really are looking to have that traditional college life right so that's something that can happen with the air force rtc as the air force rtc only takes about five to nine hours every week and you can still participate in greek life you can still participate in division one sports you can still participate in um stem clubs etc you name it you can do it um and that is something that really distinguishes us compared to the service academies well people you know it really differs some people don't really like to be in that environment or it's military all day long so that is something that we have to offer that kind of diversity there so scholarship programs this is a big one for us as obviously we do have to pay for our education as we attend traditional colleges and universities across the nation right so we do have ways to pay for for our education which is through our two main uh program high school scholarship program and the in college scholarship program let's talk about the first one we have three different types of scholarships two of them uh being the left to you the type one and two in which they can cover up to a hundred percent of your uh tuition either if it's in a private or public school the only difference that the type two caps out at about eighteen thousand dollars per year and then the type seven which pays for a hundred percent of your in-state tuition and fees but this time has to be at a public college um it is really good to mention that all these scholarships come out with a monthly living stipend that varies from 300 to 500 dollars per month and also we have a books and supply stipend which translate to 450 uh per semester or 900 a year as with every scholarship there are some requirements and as you can see here on the left those are our main requirements as you can see uh the one that we really emphasize on are the academic standards which are highlighted here in yellow on the left side we have our minimums which are the gpa a high school gpa of 3.0 we also have a minimum sat of 1240 and an act of 26 however on the right side of the screen you can see this is uh our last year's averages which uh vary at about 3.7 gpa uh 1367 sat and 31 ict this is just to give you a broader perspective and next slide i'm just going to be talking about how you apply for any of these if you're really interested on so as previously mentioned as you have seen in every other slide here we have our afrotc.com website which you can visit and then apart from giving you additional uh information of the program you can if you can click on that apply now yellow square at the top right uh corner that is that's where you actually start your application process that will guide you through all the process that you have to do however i really do like to foot some on this which is our deadline it's 14 january of 2021 so that's next year however the application process itself as you saw in the requirements it has different steps and faces so as soon as you started the better and i'm gonna transition here to our other program which is the other side of the house which is the in college college program this is for people that ha are already within the air force rtc program so for if for any reason either you're late um you are already in college you're not coming out of high school to join the program like i did in my case and which i joined and uh at the efforts rtc in my sophomore year i still had the opportunity to get a scholarship through this program that we have here so this means um that you can still have the opportunity to get either a type 1 or type 2 as you can see here the type 7 doesn't come to play in this program however you can still also get those monthly living stipends as well as book supplies uh um book and supply stipends as well which is a really great opportunity for this one there's not really a way for you to apply for them as long as you are in the program in the air force rotc program you will automatically be eligible for any of these and they're very likely and common as well as as long as you have all the minimum requirements and you exceed in the program so right with every contract um there's a commitment with every scholarship there's also a commitment so here as you can see there are different long service commitments for every other career field in the air force or space force traditionally what we call line officers which are basically i'm going to talk about careers in the air force in the next slide however line officers are your traditional officer this includes finance anything from administration intel etc on the other side of the half you have what we know as rated which are basically some of the flying jobs but as you can notice there there's a difference in between what is a pilot an actual pilot and then some of the other uh rated jobs which are some of them are still flying jobs so those middle point uh rated are six years and then if you actually want to be a pilot then that's a minimum of 10 years and something that we really like to add is that there is a free pass of up to two years in the air force rotc program so this means that you can actually join the program and if you don't decide that it's something for you or you don't like it and between that's first and second year you can still uh you know drop out of the program without any any hard feelings one year is for scholarship uh cadets people that actually get a high school scholarship you have only have one year and then if you don't if you just traditionally join the program without any high school scholarship you have up to you you're the end of your sophomore year to drop out of the program is that something you would want to do following up as i mentioned before we're going to be talking about careers as you can see here we basically offer anything that you would have to offer in the civilian sector on the civilian side we offer in the air force this is just a glance of some of the careers that we have but you have everything that varies from flight from operations even medical law enforcement engineering and mission labels which are the most the more tech portion of it then you have special warfare if you want boots on the ground uh we have it if you if you want to do something it is really likely that the air force or the space force is going to have which actually transitions to my next slide which is a space force this is the new kid on the blog as as i previously mentioned it's a newly commissioned uh branch of the department of defense and all these um career fields that you see on the left that is what is currently being offered in the officer's side of the space force so if you really want to join the space force either those three commissioning sources that we mentioned office training school the air force academy or us the air force rotc program that is the way to go and this is only what we have at the moment but this is something that we are really looking forward to expanding in the next few months and years to come so we're getting close to wrapping it up here so why should you join right so there's really a lot of benefits that come that are associated with not only the air force otc program but also the military life afterwards um as you can see here you you can get additional opportunities just by being in the military just by uh having that tuition assist and we really have which really helps you get that graduate uh degree level you also have um air force institute of technology which is basically another school that you can attend to get that master's degree for free with the air force's money you have full medical and dental coverage which is awesome it's something that a lot of people wish to have you have competitive retirement plans which is something that it's more down the road but it's something that a lot of people take for granted while they're starting their new jobs and also the last one that you can see here um it's one that's really competitive in the fuel out there as we have 30 days of paid vacation every year then that's something you don't find in every other company out there so this is me um i really encourage you to look us up we have that qr code and that page which is one of those that you sort of scan with your phone you can

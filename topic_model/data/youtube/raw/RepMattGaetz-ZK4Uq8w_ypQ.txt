and joining us tonight Congressman Matt Gaetz a member of the House Judiciary & Armed Services committee's and stalwart threw out defending the president and calling for justice from the Department of Justice and the FBI through the Obama era and beyond thank you very much for being with us congressman good to see you your reaction first to the to the motion to dismiss charges against general Flynn it's great to see honor restored to General Flynn's good name the media didn't have any honor to begin with and the only way to bring it back to the Department of Justice is to see these prosecutions through to ensure that the people who engaged in this activity are never able to frame someone like they framed general Flynn ever again the boomerang has really come back on a lot of these House Democrats Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi had egg on their face you and I have been telling people Lou for three years that this wasn't a crime it was a cover-up for the fact that Democrats were actually colluding with Russians through Christopher steel his sub sources and the fact that his sub sources were the targets of Russian intelligence everything we've said has been true proven true an Adam Schiff is now a man who was caught in a lie and then used an impeachment over Ukraine to cover up that lie and still lying saying today is a response to the motion to dismiss that general Flynn still was lying as a result of the investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department I which is patently untrue he the lying was James Comey and all of those at the top of the Obama era Department of the Justice and the FBI agency itself your thoughts about Adam Schiff you you know I'm very well look you know history will not be kind to what these folks did to our country to our president and if you really think about it it's demonstrates how the house of cards has come falling down we would always show the bias the evidence of mistreatment and then the Democrats would say yeah well Flynn pled guilty now you see that was all based on this phony setup done by the FBI but here's the I think a bigger issue look if you zoom out from Michael Flynn you see a common trend folks were trying to set up the people who might be close to the president whether that was Michael Flynn George papadopolis Roger stone Donald Trump jr. you know Corey Lewandowski any of these folks that got wrapped into having to respond to the Muller investigation were largely there to try to create leverage against the president the only reason we know that to be the case for certain with Flynn is because someone actually wrote it down but it's not as if Comey and that whole cabal tried to frame Flynn and then didn't try it against anyone else it's precisely why they tried it in these other cases the only person that they really got the leverage against was Michael Cohen because he had some dirty business with the taxicab medallions that he couldn't really answer for but for the most part everyone else told the truth they didn't fall for the traps and now we're really starting to see who the real criminals are and I think these prosecutions that are upcoming will further illuminate that well as I said earlier in the broadcast it is nice to see a US Attorney Jantzen who made the decision to move the motion to dismiss against the general it this is the beginning of what appears to be william bars reform of the US Justice Department it is great to see your reaction I am very heartened by the determination that the Attorney General has shown but I still think that at the end of the day Lou this can't all end with a series of reports that say well people broke the law but they're not really going to jail does not do it that is not a sufficient antidote to the virus that was down on the Department of Justice you know during the beginning of the Trump presidency and during the Trump transition and so I think that to fully eradicate that we're actually going to need to see criminal process brought against the people who were directing these illegal acts and James Comey he's essentially admitted to it he said that he took advantage of the fact that it was a new government in transition and got away with something he never would have gotten away with otherwise and that was the framing of Michael Flynn but Flynn wasn't the only one they tried it over and over again and I don't think a single person should spend a day in jail as a consequence of the Muller investigation because it was built on a rotten foundation Muller really should have been investigating those sub sources of the steel dossier and figuring out their collusion with the Democrats in the DNC and Glenn Simpson and the perkins law firm more to come congressman Matt Gaetz thanks so much good to see you

four or five minutes thank you and director a thank you for your time your patience here and answering all of our questions and your service to our country it is all very very much appreciated you started today you gave us testimony this morning a summary 15 pages describing the programs and priorities of the FBI and the bureau you don't mention in this at all some of the work you've talked about later which is protecting our elections and I think I don't want put exact words but you talked about protecting the integrity of our elections and it's critical to the foundations of our democracy in fact election security is national security however two months ago attorney General Sessions testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee said that the Department of Justice had not yet taken any actions towards protecting our elections from foreign interference would be a gross understatement to say that I was deeply concerned about his remarks when he came a few weeks later to this committee I asked him what had been done and I was astounded and his answer to say we hadn't done anything but I was grateful that he said he would take action and work with us I understand that the FBI is making this a priority that you have created a task force within the FBI what was it the prompted the development of the task force what void does that fill what's his mission and and who are its members well well first off I think if I might I think the fact that the Attorney General didn't mention the efforts that we have underway is simply a reflection of the fact that there's lots and lots and lots of things that happen in a gigantic Justice Department and some of them you know may not have been briefed to him as promptly as we should have the Attorney General I know is cares deeply about and in my view is a great man and a great public servant I will say that on the Khan to context of foreign influence in our elections that was prompted in part by our concerns growing out of all of the dust-up with the ICA that we knew from that combined with what we saw from talking with some of our foreign partners that efforts to interfere not suit our elections but other country's elections is a real thing we know that that was true not just in the last election but that that's something the Russians have tried to do in Prior elections even before the last elections ever before we have to expect they will do it again I think we all expect that and so our foreign influence task force is a blend of people from the counterintelligence division the cyber division the criminal division and other parts of the department a lot of it is work that we were already doing but I think putting them together in a single task force provides a it's a time-honored way to increase the focus the discipline the prioritization the coordination and it allows us to pursue those concerns with greater vigor and focus if I may you talk about doing that within the within the Bureau you you've mentioned coordinating with DHS but this is a complex issue it cuts cuts across many agencies how the task force working with the other departments the other agencies to make sure that we are prepared to protect our the integrity of our elections next year we have a the task force has a variety of contacts with not just DHS I mentioned them because they're so critical to the election infrastructure in the country but I didn't mean to leave out in particular other members the intelligence community there's regular contact there and and I want to make sure I don't overlook our contact with our foreign counterparts where we're comparing notes there as well the state election bodies which of course are important part of it as well that that happens really more indirectly through DHS and our coordination we DHS and then of course as congresswoman Handel knows well from her prior life there are private companies that are important part of the election infrastructure and we have some interaction with the private sector as part of this as well what gives you the confidence that we're 11 months away from our next national election primaries are starting in a couple months ahead what gives you the confidence that we'll be able to protect our elections next year well what I can tell you is I'm confident that we're working very hard on the issue we're going to continue working very hard on the issue we're gonna be continually looking at how we can get even better at working on the issue but i long ago gave up the idea of making predictions about whether or not we're going to bat a thousand but that's our goal so let me close with the question I asked the Attorney General when he was here are you willing to work with the members of this committee will you commit to briefing us whether in public or in classified briefings and can you give us a point of contact with who we should be communicating with in your department I'd be happy to follow up with your staff on that thank you very much I yield back the chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida mr. Rutherford for five minutes

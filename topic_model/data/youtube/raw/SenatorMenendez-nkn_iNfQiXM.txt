this committee will come to order as We Gather today the war in Ukraine is at an inflection point in the face of Ukraine's impressive counter-offensive to reclaim its rightful territory Putin is desperate forcing unwilling men across Russia to join an illegal and increasingly unpopular War buying Rockets from North Korea drones from Iran staging sham referendums having people vote but Force at the point of a gun so phony that even governments friendly to Moscow have said they won't recognize them make no mistake Ukraine continues to face a daily nightmare of shelling of pulling neighbors and countrymen out of mass Graves of families torn apart and children going to school and basements of fighting for their very existence but seven months into this war Putin is not where he wanted to be and that's thanks to The Bravery of the Ukrainian people to more than 15 billion dollars in weapons from the United States and a strong International Coalition but it is also due to the enormous effort to isolate Russia from International Commerce and the International Financial system to strip Russia of revenues reserves and access to global markets so Ambassador O'Brien assistant secretary Rosenberg I want to take a moment to commend the Herculean effort that the Biden Administration has led to impose unprecedented sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion since February 24th of 2022 the U.S has deployed a sanctions regime that would have been unimaginable a year ago and of course that includes not just you but the hundreds of dedicated Personnel at State and treasury who worked around the clock to prepare sanctions even before The Invasion began nearly 40 countries have imposed economic costs in Russia for this war the Democratic will has effectively decoupled from Russia and massive economic and logistical achievement in the age of global Commerce and thanks to our Relentless diplomacy the UK the EU Australia Japan and South Korea joined the United States in sanctioning Russian financial institutions including removing seven of Russia's largest banks from the Swift payment system a move that I championed today more than a thousand Russians have their assets Frozen abroad more than a thousand companies have ended operations or withdrawn from Russia but this is not just about seizing glitzy Yachts or forcing oligarchs to unload their Swiss chalets and their British soccer teams it's about silencing The Guns of Putin's military it's about ending the destruction of homes in hospitals farms and schools it's about halting the mass killing of ukrainians fighting for their Homeland it's about ensuring that the dream of an independent free thriving Ukraine remains alive so just as we must keep up our support of arms and weapons so too must we keep up the pressure of economic sanctions today I'd like to focus on what comes next and also highlight five areas that I think we need to focus on in order to keep the pressure up first are our sanctions having the desired effect we impose sanctions not to punish but to constrain and ultimately change Behavior have the sanctions change Putin's calculus at all if not now perhaps in the coming months I'd like to hear a clear assessment on how current and planned measures will further strain the Russian system in the coming months and how that might change Kremlin Behavior then energy the recently announced price cap on Russian oil is a welcoming creative proposal to deprive Russia of Revenue but how will China and India respond will they purchase below the cap or continue to keep Russia's exports afloat and thirdly we need to look at the gaps in our sanctions and we're tied to alignment would make existing sanctions more effective fourth what can we do to improve enforcement and this is not only for Putin but for those enabling him evading sanctions and feeding his War Machine and finally I want to hear about our diplomatic efforts which will be critical in the coming months our rigorous diplomacy has made the difference in ensuring that we have not just a United Coalition but one that is willing to act as we head into winter Putin is hoping to test our Coalition how do we keep Europe together as energy needs become more pressing and fatigue sets in we will not only have to maintain our Unity but our willingness to keep meeting the multiple urgent needs facing Ukraine this is a battle that cannot be won with weapons alone or diplomacy alone or sanctions alone each of these tools must be used to maximum effort and in coordination I look forward to hearing from you today how we continue to make this war as costly for Russia that we are seeking to achieve in the coming months and how we continue to keep the pressure on Putin so that we can give the ukrainians the best chance to fight for their lives their livelihood and their country with that let me turn to the ranking member for his comments well thank

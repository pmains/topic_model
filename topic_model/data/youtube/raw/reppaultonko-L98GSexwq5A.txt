Thank You mr. Speaker I rise to give a voice to millions of Americans who are at risk of being overlooked in our nation's response to the opioid epidemic America's youth our nation's opioid crisis knows no boundaries of geography or demographics and age age is no exception one of four individuals under the age of 20 has been prescribed opioids at some point in life and 2.2 million young people between the ages of 20 and 24 abused opioids in the last year opioid abuse early in life often leads to poorer academic performance more negative health outcomes and higher rates of future drug use in order to prevent the next generation of drug abuse we have to ramp up our investment in critical programs like drug free communities grants and substance abuse prevention and treatment block grants we can also help young people build resilience by supporting our school-based health centers where students are able to get health care in a convenient setting when students are empowered to meet with health care providers ask questions and receive needed care they can become powerful advocates in turning the tide of this epidemic around I yield back the balance of my time mr. speaker

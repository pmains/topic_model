thank you mr chairman and thank you to all the bsos and the leadership and the veterans that are out there for your tremendous steadfast uh work your perseverance and your strong leadership look uh this is a very important title uh that we need to discuss this is the crux the soul uh of the bill uh it is based on a bill that you all work together uh to produce uh it's the presumptive benefits for war fighters exposed to burn pits and other toxins act it is a bipartisan and bicameral bill that originated from our veteran communities uh and we're moving it forward as now title four of this important bill it is the soul of honoring our compact it is the vital organ that keeps this patient alive in order to ensure that we give the care and the benefits that the veterans need and their widowed spouses who are relying on this it is the part that addresses the family as well but before i continue to go there i just want to review some of the excuses that i've been hearing over and over and over first is this wait a minute we need to do more research on this because it goes back to the original excuse that there's not enough evidence look guys i've said over and over clarifying this misinformation there is enough evidence to suggest that toxic burn pit smoke can produce illnesses in the lungs and cancers and autoimmune diseases carcinogens cause cancer burn pit toxic smoke contains cancer they've identified carcinogens in the soil burnt exposed veterans are developing cancer where the how do you think they got it from okay it's very it's very straightforward there's enough evidence from extrapolating from firefighters who are exposed to 911 and jet fuel that was that was burnt there is enough evidence in our own u.s environmental research that has already banned burn pits from being conducted in our backyards or as industries in the united states so there is enough evidence with a high enough suspicion that burn pits are causing this illnesses and we don't have to go beyond the scientific papers we can just listen to our veterans and our veterans widows who are crying out over and over again who say that they have no other risk factors that they're absolutely healthy and now they're dying or they're dead from all these different illnesses the other the other excuse has been that oh this will be too much of a strain for the institution these are unfunded mandates and we don't know how the institution are going to handle it it is our responsibility to fund what our veterans need and we must do that for our veterans that strain in the institution argument is from individuals who put the institution first and i'm telling you we must put our veterans first we must give our veterans and be veteran-centric veterans focused and take care of our veterans like we take care of our patients in the emergency department that i know of quite well the other excuse is that we cost too much it costs too much money now listen that's a value statement and i don't know about you all but my value is to put people first is to make sure that our veterans are taking care of my value instead of giving tax breaks in the tunes of millions and billions to one percent rich individual families in our nation is to give the veterans the care that they need because they need it right now before they're dying the other excuse is that the pace is too fast the pace is too fast this is ridiculous ask the widows of our veterans if it was if we're moving too fast as folks like leroy and others who are suffering from constrictive bronchiolitis who are 100 percent oxygen dependent and therefore unable to care for their family work or others if we're moving too fast when i hear and veterans hear that the pace is too fast what they're hearing is that they want to delay until dead just like what happened with agent orange and our vietnam veterans and so look since i've heard about this i've been getting real-time feedback from the veterans in my district and i want to tell you about alejandro camacho of palm desert who's a veteran who answered the call to duty while serving in south sinjar iraq alejandro breathed in toxic fumes particular matter and carcinogens from the batteries medical waste jet fuel and other military items that were disposed of in large burn pits on his base when he returned home he noticed that that his breathing in the fumes had caused a toll on his body he was later diagnosed with aggressive form of testicular cancer despite his doctor's belief that his diagnosis will link to his exposure to burn pits the va denied his claim because they said quote there wasn't enough evidence unquote i have a palm desert councilwoman here carina quintanilla who tells me that her head her ex-husband is still having constant coughing chronic coughing illnesses after being deployed in the middle east miss burns have you heard from members of your organization that have been diagnosed with cancer that their doctors believe is linked to burn pit exposure and were and their claims were denied by the va yes uh we've heard from numerous members and through our survey that reaches thousands and thousands of veterans across the country that there are plenty of veterans right now that are getting denied benefits that have cancer rare cancer and and you look at these veterans and they're young like me i'm 34 i look healthy right i'm not i've got all kinds of medical issues and they push you to the side and say oh well you can't have cancer you know you're young you're healthy and then later you know they find out later oh well you did have cancer we don't know how you got it but now it's stage four and well well good luck yeah uh sadly this is a common theme throughout our veterans story what we need is to end the excuses to take care of our veterans to pass the honoring our pac tax and making sure that that the uh presumptive benefits for war fighters section in this title iv is maintained for those of you who think that this is the way we're going to save cause or nickel and dime our veterans by eliminating some of the cancers or pulmonary illnesses that are listed in this list i have news for you you will not go and attempt this without resistance or without a fight because this is what's going to save lives this is what's going to bring justice to the widows who are currently suffering trying to raise their families and we will fight two canals to make sure that this section is maintained thank you mr brown i got to give the last word to on this section on this section

Hello! I'm Congressman Andr√© Carson Encouraging everyone in our community to aim for a complete count in the 2020 Census. The Census is so important, not only because it shows a clearer picture of where we are as Americans and where we live. It also helps determine federal funding levels for programs like Medicaid, SNAP, school lunches, transportation and so much more. And it provides the basis for the redrawing of legislative districts, which ensures American voices are heard at every level of government -- local, state and even federal. That's why it's important for every Hoosier and every American to fill out and turn in their Census form. This year you can fill yours out online, making this civic duty more convenient than ever. So please, join us in taking part in this very important effort. It's an easy way to make a big investment in our communities, our families and our future.

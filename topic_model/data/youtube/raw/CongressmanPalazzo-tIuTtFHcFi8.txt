and thank you chairman cartwright and ranking member aderholt for having this meeting senator nelson thank you for being here um i look forward to um these hearings especially the nasa hearing uh each year stennis space center is nasa's premier facility for propulsion test operations in a practical sense stennis space center's main budget line is rocket propulsion test the president's budget request for rocket propulsion test shows a negligible change for fiscal year 23 and no expected changes on the horizon leading one to believe level funding will ensure this facility is meeting both nasa and industry demand for testing for the foreseeable future i would like to read a line directly from nasa's fiscal year 23 budget requests nasa's rocket propulsion test program maintains and manages a wide range of facilities capable of ground testing rocket engines and components under controlled conditions this test infrastructure includes facilities located across the united states and the program provides a single entry point for any user of nasa rocket test stands rpt retains a skilled workforce capable of performing tests on all modern day rockets and supporting complex rocket engine development rpt evaluates customer test requirements and desired outcomes while minimizing test time and costs now instead of space center is a national treasure as you were quoted saying on your december visit to stennis industry continues to look at utilizing stennis space center for the expertise of its personnel 125 000 acre buffer zone the a and b and particularly the e-test complex and because of the abundance of propellant stored on-site at stennis however i have questions about whether stennis will remain as a national treasure given the ever-evolving nature of space exploration so senator nelson do you believe that level funding for the rocket propulsion test budget into the foreseeable future will both keep pace with inflation and meet industry demand for commercial space company needs defense based company needs and nasa's own testing needs for the time being congressman yes but you have a beautiful opportunity to have the stennis space center evolve into a propulsion test complex that will be government and commercial multi-users uh not unlike what has happened to the kennedy space center that was primarily a government launch center and now it is a multi-user spaceport and with that 125 000 acres that you have there you've got so many other opportunities uh you for example have there the us navy that's involved uh there are unlimited opportunities but just in the area of rocket propulsion testing it can become the place for commercial and government rocket engine testing well thank you sir nelson i agree with you that's why the enhanced use lease agreement extensions are so important and also helping the the the center uh look at economic development and and sites so you know in attracting a new industry to uh the region as a win-win for for everyone um my next question congressman on that may i say if you all can help us on the enhanced use lease it's this herky jerky one year at a time authorization uh if y'all can give us that authorization for a number of years in the future so we don't have to run around uh at the last minute getting some moving vehicle to attach enhanced useless and the congressman from mississippi has just pointed out a good example well sir i agree and i think the house has been the leader on renew an enhanced use lease agreement we had a 10-year bill that did pass and when it came back uh from the other body it was uh shortened tremendously um so i agree with you the industry needs certainty industry needs stability and we're hoping maybe this is the year we will give it to them and real quick last question sir can you tell us what you perceive nasa's role is and should be in helping the department of defense and the defense community to develop hypersonic capabilities and does that extend to utilizing nasa's testing infrastructure i believe that some of it is classified congressman but just suffice it to say that nasa's involved and a lot of our expertise in space and aeronautics is considered valuable in research and development by across the broad spectrum of government and uh the bottom line i agree with you congressman that we need to be very serious about developing hypersonic vehicles sir thank you for your time chairman i yield back

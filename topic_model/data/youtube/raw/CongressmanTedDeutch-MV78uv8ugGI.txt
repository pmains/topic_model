I rise to oppose this bill today for a number of reasons but building a road through a congressionally Desiree is without precedent there are lots of other reasons but I would note that at least today's debate shifts the focus of this congress in the right direction because when we look to Alaska it is just it requires a gaze just a little bit further into Russia and I only wish that what we were debating today was the sanctions bill that passed to set it by a vote of 98 - and the reason that we should be debating that bill today is readily apparent to anyone who's been paying attention to recent events just this morning we read of the president's interview with the New York Times and we think about the president who took action to fire the acting Attorney General to urge the FBI director to go easy on the unflinching the I director because of the Russia investigation and who just now in this interview yesterday threatened the acting FBI director the Attorney General of the United States and the person carrying out the investigation of Russia and the potential ties between his administration and Russia all of this gets to the larger point which is we're getting ready to go home at the end of next week for August and we have failed if we go home without passing the sanctions bill and getting tough on Russia we will have failed to the American people on a vital national security issue we will be showing weakness at a time when the American people expect us to see strength expect us to stand up to Russian attempts to interfere with our election to stand up when we learn about an eight-person for now eight-person meeting that was put together with the sole purpose according to the emails of providing information to help president Trump then candidate Ron get a lot with the assistance of the Russian government we don't know where this will lead I acknowledge that but it's because what we do know about Russia that we have to act not against the administration mischaracterization to suggest that this bill passed 98 - - in the Senate this is a bill that will now enable us to move forward in a bipartisan way which the American people desperately want to stand up to Russia and it is for that reason that I ask unanimous consent that the house bring up HR 3200 3 which is the Russia sanctions bill that passed the Senate 98 to 298 to 2 when has this body seen that kind of bipartisanship I ask that that bill be brought up so that we can vote on it and not disappoint the American people before we leave here at August that's what we ought to be doing I hope we'll have a chance to do it now and I assume it's consent that we bring up the Russia sanctions bill to debate and to pass that bill today gentlemen

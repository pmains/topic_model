so this country fires every day there are doctors there are nurses there medical support staff there are health care workers there caretakers and others who are getting up every day leaving their own families and going to work on behalf of members of other families and too often these men and women are doing so at great personal risk to their own health and as it turns out to the health of the ones that they love but despite the grave risks to themselves these heroes and heroines are undeterred they in a day out weekend and week out they continue to serve others and continue to demonstrate by their own courage what the leadership by example is all about and for that we are deeply deeply grateful something that most Americans may not know is that one in six health care and social service workers as one in six health care and social service workers in this country are emigrants our emigrants and when you add them all up that's 3.1 million people who have chosen to make the United States their home and are giving back to their country this country now in profound ways they are not a number they are not a statistic they are caring courageous members of our own communities out of their own communities over the last three and a half years and even before that on the campaign trail we heard Donald Trump in Sonoma none of the people around him demonized immigrants he is used fear-mongering to claim that immigrants and dreamers the dreamers are the those young people brought here when they were kids maybe younger than kids the president spent four amount of time did fear-mongering to claim with those immigrants and dreamers are going to take all of our jobs away and that just isn't true I know a bunch of those dreamers a lot of my students at the Delaware State University are their students young people that any parent would be claimed got a GLAAD proud to call him as their own there's some of the finest young people I've never met here anyplace around the world but while Merritt and many Americans are rightly following stay-at-home orders these men and women are often putting their own health and safety at risk to do some of the most critical jobs every day I believe it's important that we recognize these immigrant health care heroes who are playing a truly critical role in the fight to protect their fellow Americans I mentioned a minute ago that there 3.1 million health care and social service workers in our country today I want to highlight the story of one of them her name is Serena Serena romero's she's standing right here over my left shoulder she's a nurse she's a nurse at one of Delaware's federally qualified community health centers it's called West Side family health care they operated and we only have three counties in Delaware there in northern Delaware New Castle County where two-thirds of our residents live and also in Kent County which is where Dover is the capital of our our state and Dover Air Force Base the finest meeting the finest air force base in the world but Westside Family care like the nearly 1,400 federally qualified community health centers across the country helped to deliver quality primary care services and underserved areas every day every day without a lot of fanfare without a lot of acclaim they do what my mother used to call the Lord's work that's what she used to call it the Lord's work so Serena and her colleagues in Wilmington have been serving our community throughout the call this Kovach 19 pandemic I just want to take the next several minutes to share with my colleagues and the American people a part of her story why she became a healthcare worker why she continues this work now and serve in doing so in serving largely but not entirely spanish-speaking population even during the hardest of times like the times we're living in today why don't I gonna do in the next several minutes is really to share with you that Serena's story not in my words in her words and this is what she looks like she works right in Wilmington Delaware not all that far where my wife and I lived and I probably met her at time didn't recognize her because she had her mask on here today but the Delawares a little stakes you meet just about everybody but here's her story in her words my name is Serena Ramirez I was born in the Dominican Republic my family came to the United States when I was 7 years old and I am the oldest of three siblings my father was a doctor in the Dominican Republic and my mother was a teacher as my dad got older and started our family he couldn't help but notice all the corruption and crime that existed in the Dominican Republic he wanted the American Dream for his children as did his wife and so he decided they decided to leave everything behind and move to this land of opportunity the United States of America my dad became a taxi driver he was working overnight while going to school in the morning after three years of hard work he graduated with an associate's degree in radiology both of my parents are deceased now she writes but their courage and work ethic live on in each of their children my siblings and I could not be more grateful for their unselfish decision they made for us that's Rena goes on to say I've been working for 10 years at Westside family health care or I am a team medical nurse I educate patients about medical conditions to help them identify lifestyle changes that can benefit their overall health and goals the one thing that I love most about my job the one thing I like the most about my job is that I'm able to make a difference in someone else's life and I would just say set Serena me to go as we say in Delaware mae tambien as the years passed I quickly learned about the command for Spanish interpretation among our patient population as a Hispanic and with the Spanish being my first language I realized that sometimes it is easier for a patient to speak in their native language when it comes from medical concerns I like that it did I can be she likes that she can be the voice of the patient and their number one advocate says Serena goes on to say I have observed instances of patients receiving care from a provider who has the same cultural background and speaks the same language resulting in positive health care outcomes in these cases the patient's appear relaxed are willing to ask necessary questions to obtain knowledge and there's a mutual understanding of goals and plans to improve patient care taking care accessories of taking care of patients is a privilege think about that taking care of patients as opposed I think it's a privilege to serve the people of Delaware and our country she feels that way about her patients now looking at the difference in the amount of help that could be provided to the community has truly been an inspiration to work hard and try to be the best nurse I could be and that is the the end if you will of what she is said and that I wanted to share with all of you today let me just say I don't know if Serena will see these proceedings or hear my words or hear her words through me but I just want to say thank you for that

Americans are under attack hard-working families right here in South Carolina are getting hit where it hurts the most in their wallets prices for everything from beer to bread are just out of control and seemingly Out Of Reach I'm Russell Frye and I grew up in a cinder block house just down the road in Surfside Beach I know what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to make ends meet but I grew up in a family where we were taught the value of hard work how to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and how to love our country that's why I'm running for congress because in two short years Democrats have turned this country upside down I'm asking for your help because we need strong leaders willing to stand up and fight against Joe Biden and the radical liberal elites on November 8th we must elect Republicans all across this country who will put America First secure the Border tackle this skyrocketing inflation and begin to take our country back and at the end of the day retire Nancy Pelosi I'm Russell Frye and I approve this message and I am asking for your vote [Music]

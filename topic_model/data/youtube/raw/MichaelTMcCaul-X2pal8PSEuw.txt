from the canon house office building this is representative michael mccall he's a republican from texas the homeland security subcommittee on oversight investigations and management serves as their chairman representative mccall several bills this week specifically dealing with cyber security what's the message well i think it's a historic week we haven't had uh cyber security legislation like this on the floor in the history of the congress i think the message though uh is uh that america is under attack uh that we've been hacked into uh both in the private sector and in the federal government uh about a trillion dollars uh of intellectual property have been stolen from the united states from countries primarily like china and then when you look at the espionage piece uh it's even more frightening they have stolen the blueprints for the f-35 joint strike fighter plane for instance just one example of many military secrets that they have stolen uh they're very interested in satellite rocket technology uh and then finally when you look at the cyber warfare piece that's the one that really keeps me up at night this is the ability to go in and hit critical infrastructures through the click of a mouse and bring down power grids electrical grids nuclear plants financial institutions faa you name it anything connected to the internet is vulnerable and so what we're attempting to do uh really two two things one is to harden the federal networks so that they can't uh steal this information from the federal government and number two to have a sharing of information between uh the federal government and the private sector in terms of signature threat information so that the private sector which controls about ninety percent of the critical infrastructures can better protect itself if i just say every federal agency has been hacked into including the pentagon and imagine if agents of a foreign power stole paper files out of the pentagon classified or non-classified and they got caught that would be all over the front page of the washington post now yet in the virtual world that is happening every day so that's that's a threat i think the legislation we have this week is is good legislation to remedy that problem so before we uh go further we have about 20 minutes with our guests so if you want to ask them questions about cyber security the numbers on your screen 20273 for uh republicans 202-737-001 for democrats 2026-280-205 for independence how does your legislation the cyber security enhancement act differ from the others uh you know mine frankly passed unanimously out of committee uh bipartisan support in a very partisan charged congress that we're in it's refreshing to see that kind of uh solidarity behind the bill but essentially it it hardens the federal networks uh it it allows this the national institute for standards and technology to apply uh standards to the federal networks to harden them to protect them from the threat of a cyber attack first and foremost secondly it has a research and development component that also involves the universities bringing the universities in which i think can be a great asset to our ability to protect the country it also has an education and awareness piece when you talk to like for instance the nsa they'll tell you the computer hygiene is so important if we could educate and make people aware of how these people get into your computers how they attack you and have better computer hygiene that would cure probably 80 to 90 percent of our problems and so and then finally the procurement practices uh we we need to have more certification standards in the industry in terms of how we procure hardware and software which we think will have a ripple effect in the private sector and i think that's going to do a lot of good what we tried to avoid at all costs was was mandates to the private sector we try to incentivize rather than be punitive port charlotte florida arlene arlene first call uh democrats lying hi hello you're on i was talking about the circuit boards that we have built over in china and all the other countries if we built them here in the united states our computers would be more secure i used to build motherboards and you can manipulate components that go into these motherboards and they go into our computers and that's what's kind of messing up everything in our in our world really if we built our own we'd be much more secure why thank you i think the caller makes a good point and um yeah like china is is so advanced at this uh game uh they they have stolen uh so much uh it really rivals the size of library congress the amount of data that they have stolen uh and anytime you travel to say china yeah i wouldn't advise taking your blackberry they're so sophisticated getting into your electronic devices yeah and so anyway it's a big threat i think the caller knows the threat obviously what we're trying what i've tried to do i was on the speaker cyber task force chair of the cyber security caucus and i've been for eight years been trying to raise awareness uh not only to the american people but members of congress uh as to the high level and seriousness of this threat our military knows a threat because they have the offensive capability they know day in and day out what we can do offensively that kind of capability in the wrong hands would be a huge threat finally and i know you want to get to some callers but when i asked the director of nsa can we expect a cyber pearl harbor his response was the question is not uh if but when uh albany new york good morning tim independent line go ahead yes sir um no doubt that cyber terrorism is probably one of the scariest new frontiers we have however it seems like every sopa or cispa is too far-reaching and can be used against the american citizens themselves uh just over what could be a ridiculous reason i was curious to hear your thoughts on that i'll take my call off there and representative he used the acronym cis bar if you can expand all that and let our viewers know what it is too did you say stuxnet cesta sista yeah look we have a lot of offensive capabilities that can't be turned against us uh i can't speak as to the origin of these or sex night without getting into the classified realm having said that anything we can use can be turned against us uh it's it's almost like when we create the nuclear bomb nuclear weapons uh the genie's out of the bottle in this stuff uh and it's an ever-evolving industry just like when they they call them computer viruses because these viruses are ever evolving uh and and the idea that they can be turned against us is very real uh a very real threat the stuxnet one if i can speak to that it is a highly sophisticated uh reprogramming uh virus that was sent into the nuclear facility in iran blew up their centrifuges and they didn't even know it was occurring because on on their video screen they couldn't even see what's happening uh now that that turned against us uh is obviously a very scary idea so we we have to always stay ahead of the curve again we're very good at the offensive capability but it's the defensive side of things that were i think that's where we're vulnerable as a nation that's where we're weak and that's what we're attempting to uh correct and remedy with the legislation uh cyber security legislation that we have on the floor this week other cyber security bills released the cyber intelligence sharing and protection act also known as cispa this was released by representatives rogers and rupertsberger and the federal information security amendment act released by representative darryl isa houston texas good morning this is david republican line go ahead please good morning thank you for taking my call um i have a brief question for you congressman in regards to how you plan on the bill that you sponsored to implement the advantages that private companies and non-profit companies have and giving you information to establish the roadmaps that you need in regards to completing the tasks of getting one and everyone intertwined and safely involved in regards to protecting their systems do you plan on endorsing competitive bidding processes for these companies in regards to the supervision of obtaining that information or working on those projects similar to other processes that have been endorsed by you well any of the information sharing and networks and i i the prior caller i didn't hear is a question that in terms of the intelligence bill so i do want to speak to that uh any of these information sharing concepts we have let me say first and foremost are completely voluntary uh this is a any private company again 90 of the critical infrastructures are controlled by the private sector so we're trying to do is encourage and incentivize them to work with us with the federal government uh so we can share the signature threat information uh these would be you know various viruses that we can share with them how to put a patch on to protect themselves uh and so the voluntary system with respect to the intelligence bill that's out there there was a pilot program called the defense industrial base program that worked very well with the federal government uh sharing this information with the private sector and we want to do in the protected environment where these companies are protected uh from vulnerabilities if we can't work together with the private sector and sharing threat information and that's that's all this bill does is share information with the private sector private sector can share information with the federal government in terms of threat specific signature threat information if we can't do that we can't solve this problem because that goes to the core of where we are and i can tell you this pilot program was highly successful in protecting not only the private sector from these threats but also educating the federal government as to how to better protect the federal networks are there concerns from the private sector or by exposing how they operate by sharing this information uh i know there was some concern um voice with the bill that's still being worked on the homeland security uh committee i think above all what we want to avoid when you get into the internet and cyber security is a burdensome regulatory framework mandates and being punitive uh those three we i think when you start crossing that bridge i think you get into trouble as a legislature so we're trying to avoid those what we're again trying to do is make this a voluntary system and incentivize the private sector rather than start mandating things and telling the private sector what they have to do what they what they can and cannot do the whole newspaper reports that representative dan lundgren had a piece of legislation called the precise act and one of the reasons they didn't make the floor is because it wouldn't it would create new regulations well i i you know i think the the industry had some issues with the bill as it came out of subcommittee i believe those issues were cured at the full committee markup when i talked to secretary napolitano and the director of nsa what they said was essential was that the existing legal authorities uh through presidential directives and executive orders be codified and that there be an information sharing system program put in place which we were able to do in that bill and i think that alleviate a lot of the concerns that the private sector had unfortunately the uh on the other side of the aisle the democrats objected to the bill and uh it is not a bipartisan bill unlike the other four that are going to the house floor unfortunately the homeland security bill has been very partisanly divided every democrat voted against it so i think leadership made the correct decision to hold off on that bill until we can get more bipartisan support for that bill one of the lines from the hill piece said that house leaders made it clear they wouldn't support any bill that creates new regulations for cyber security is that the case i i again i i think are you know i was on the the speakers cyber security task force and our recommendations were uh to incentivize not mandate to to make it voluntary not regulate uh and again when you get into the internet and we saw what happened with sopa for instance i mean you got to be very careful about what you're doing as as a legislator uh when you're dealing with the internet and cyber security i've i'm always certainly our philosophy is one uh more to to incentivize and and not have punitive measures on the private sector when it comes to uh cyber security moline illinois dan democrats line good morning good morning to you too i just got a couple simple comments to make first off don't you do any background checks on the people that you hire and the second one is why would you put these major facilities online so anybody can get onto them well uh of course uh uh most federal employees if not all go through background checks i used to work in the justice department and i went through uh numerous background checks in my career prior to to congress but the fact is uh you know in this age of the internet and computers uh we're all tied to it we can't simply just unplug ourselves from it now having said that it's a very classified level we do have very restrictive measures to basically unplug it from from the internet so there isn't that uh that connection there are some ways that they they have still tried to get into steel uh classified information but i i'm very i feel very confident that our classified information is very well protected there's the dot gov and there's a dot mil the dot mil is very well protected the dot gov which is more the civilian side of the uh uh of the federal government probably a little more vulnerable and open to an attack because it's very uh tied to the internet we're you know like i said we're ever evolving the einstein program that the department of homeland security developed is a great program to harden our federal networks and i think we just moved the bill out of homeland security where i introduced a measure to enhance the einstein program which i think will protect our federal networks spokane washington on our republican line mary yeah um i'm calling uh number one to say that you know i really don't think we need these regulations if anything internet should be different from town to town or state to state by the civil laws that already exist in that state so if you're not allowed to have a polling shop within five walks of the school you shouldn't be allowed to watch one five blocks within its group online but when it comes to this homeland security i think it's a farce through the fact that we're not calling it what it is which is a continuous government act that was written up in 1983 which is to constantly keep the state and the federal powers at control at all times because of um social strife amongst the commoners within our united states you know basic people like you and me and i don't think that we need to have more regulations by our government that we need more deregulation even though i tend to be more on the um democratic side of things i we need to drag and i don't feel that it's going to do any justice for america as long as we continue to pay officials 80 an hour to make these decisions when they're just turning around and giving people that work for 30 years of their life only three dollars and 80 cents to live on on social security hello thanks yeah i i agree with the caller i think that's that's why i emphasize to the speaker being on the task force that we do not want to go down the road of regulating and putting mandates on on the private sector and secondly we need to always be mindful of the civil liberties and privacy protections that we have put in these bills in this legislation uh because uh you know my philosophy is that you know we we don't want an overreaching federal government and particularly when it comes to the internet if i can just add another plug if i can i introduced a bill there's the united nations has been at the direction of china and russia has been looking at censoring the internet and regulating the internet and so i have a resolution that i introduced to call upon our ambassador to the union to oppose this resolution in the united nations the last thing we want is for the united nations to be getting into the business of censoring and regulating the internet next up spring valley illinois jason democrats line yeah i just got two questions uh one what are the consequences of the actions of cyber attacks and how do you plan on catching the cyber attacker when he can do it anywhere in the world well i i think i've outlined the threat well in terms of you know they have the the ability not only uh the intellectual property theft to the tune of a trillion dollars espionage in terms of stealing our military secrets cyber warfare to bring down our power grids financial institutions faa you name it we have very sophisticated techniques to determine whether an intrusion has taken place for instance the cia probably has a hundred thousand attempted hacks per week uh the house of representatives i think we have close to a million uh attempted intrusions but we know about those and and the members are notified uh and and very few are successful that's the good news uh they can sometimes intrude and get in uh but when they have to beacon to get out of the system there's a wall that stops the beacon from escaping and getting back to the perpetrator attribution is very important here anytime we've had a cyber attack being able to attribute that back to the source and to the computer and then find out who was behind that act and who was behind the computer very very important in these in these investigations i will say the fbi was extremely successful in bringing down some of these these uh activists the anonymous groups lolsack uh bringing down you know multiple bad actors who've been responsible for the crashing websites the stealing of social security numbers uh you know credit card theft like in stratfor my hometown of austin texas these groups are out there very mischievous but they're also stealing a lot of uh economic information that's very damaging that's the point i haven't made yet but we're very concerned about these groups as well representative in usa today they have comments made by rear admiral samuel cox who's the director of intelligence at u.s cyber command he told a group in washington that the united states would use cyber weapons against an adversary's computer networks only after officials at the highest levels of government approved the plan and that's according to him what do you think of that as a strategy well that's i think that's appropriate it's um you know a lot of people don't realize when you can blow up a power generator through the click of a mouse they don't realize you can even do that but you can and so it's an act of warfare that we have to define in the cyber world what is really an act of warfare here and i think we have to be very careful when we use that capability uh to do so uh with approvals you know at the highest levels because it it is in my judgment in active warfare the the challenge is determining what is an act of warfare from a rogue nation or state can we attribute the the act of warfare to bring things down which is essentially what they wanted to shut things down how do we attribute that back to the computer and then do we have good intelligence to determine it was that a state-sanctioned act or was it just some rogue operator that wanted to to blow things up so this is going to be the future of warfare uh maybe when you talk to the military knowing what our offensive capability is our defensive is not as good as our offensive but they will tell you this is what they're most concerned with in terms of defending the nation because they know what we can do offensively and it will be in addition to kinetic response it will be the future warfare and he also added the story says he played down the prospect of an enemy of the uh of the enemy of the us could disable the nation's electric power grid or shut down the internet because those systems are designed to withstand severe cyber attacks we have hardened those networks the aurora project was which has been declassified was an idaho national lab program where through the click of a mouse they literally blew up a power generator i think cnn broadcasted this you could you could see the generator actually starting to destroy itself through a reprogramming virus like the stuxnet virus by doing things like that just like when we look at viruses and develop vaccines to protect you know humans from viruses same thing in the computer world we have developed better vaccines if you will to protect our critical infrastructures representative michael mccall chairman of the homeland security subcommittee on oversight investigations and management thank you for your time thank you so much

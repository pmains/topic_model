joining me now Pennsylvania representative Madeline Dean a Democratic member of the House Judiciary Committee welcome good to see you as always I know you're in sunny LA where it's a beautiful day there but I want to play for you ma'am what Attorney General Bill Barr had to say in his interview this after the president tweeted about Roger stone Sentencing Guidelines from DOJ prosecutors so here's that I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody and I said if I'm whether it's Congress newspaper editorial boards or the president I'm going to do what I think is right and you know the I think the the I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that that undercuts me do you think this gives bill Barr any cover for the DOJ decision to go against the recommendations of its prosecutors in this case good morning or good afternoon from Los Angeles I'm glad to be with you on this Presidents Day weekend and I want to start with the premise that what we have witnessed over the course of the last three years with this president is someone who has an utter disregard for the Constitution for the rule of law for the Independence of the Department of Justice mr. Barth comments I think are thin cover for the work that he has done on behalf of the President it was just hours after the president complained of Roger stones sentencing recommendation that this attorney general who is supposed to be independent of the president went to the prosecutors and said reduce that sentencing recommendation and what we saw were four career prosecutors quit in protest that's a dramatic statement about the lack of Independence of mr. Barr mr. Bars credibility is in tatters those for quitting the case one even actually quitting the DOJ and leaving altogether did you ever question the initial recommendation of seven to nine years for Roger stone no for the very reason that I don't think the president should be questioning it it's none of my business it is not my job we do need an independent judiciary we need an independent Department of Justice people who really took a look at the case and the judge who knows that this gentleman is convicted it'll be up to the judge I have no recommendation on sentencing so as the president faces accusations of interfering in this Roger stone case I know that your colleague on judiciary Eric's law well had this to say let's listen might you impeach him over this over Roger stone in the sentencing you know we're not going to take our options off the table but we're not going to let him just you know torch this democracy because he thinks that he's been let off once and we're not going to do something about our all options including impeachment is still on the table I have no interest in speculating on a future impeachment we do know that mr. Barr is coming before our committee the Judiciary Committee on March the 31st when we can ask important oversight questions about his independence and about the Independence of the Department of Justice what I want to talk about is the fact that this president has used the levers of power for his own personal political gain we're just seeing more of that and yet what we did in the house is we have this president forever impeached you know what I really want to talk about is some of the things that we've done we have been legislating all the while I'm very proud to tell you that we took a vote yesterday to get er a the Equal Rights Amendment one step closer to being enshrined in our Constitution I'm out here visiting my not quite four month old granddaughter and when I came in the door last night I made sure I told her her grandmother was a part of the vote to make sure that women are equal to men under our Constitution we're also looking at infrastructure we're look we have passed HR three prescription drug cost containment and cost controls we passed HR 1 to protect our elections take a look at this president and this Senate who is doing nothing with the important legislation that this house has been passing all session long well I applaud you on that er a infrastructure of prescription drugs all excellent things to be getting you know moving forward moving those balls forward but a question to you would be on the do Jays role how this has unfolded in the politically charged cases this week do you think it is a reflection of Donald Trump feeling he's unbridled he has unbridled power after the impeachment acquittal I think that's a part of it that's maybe part of the ingredients of what is going on but the president has acted like this all along he acted like this in business he has acted like this in his campaign he believes in moving the levers of power whatever they happen to be now it just happens to be the levers of the United States government for his own political and personal gain and you see he has surrounded himself with people who are on domestic political errands for him whether it is Attorney General bar ambassador Sandlin Rudy Giuliani and many many others but he is emboldened he believes because of the Senate's failure to even have a fair trial and then to whitewash and acquit him covering up his wrongdoing that he is not to be held accountable I'll tell you what my constituents think they're tired of the chaos they're tired of the corruption they're tired of waking up every day saying how did the president abuse his office for his own personal gain so we'll keep pointing out for the people what is going on we'll keep legislating and then it will be up to the people in November and I believe they will turn mr. Trump away okay Pennsylvania representative Madeleine Deane thank you so much it's good to see you and enjoy the trip seeing your granddaughter it's pretty special for having thanks

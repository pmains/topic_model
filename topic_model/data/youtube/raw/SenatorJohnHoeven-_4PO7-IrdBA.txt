there maybe we'll get one from the North Dakota Senator John Hoeven who's joining us now live this morning good to have you senator you sit on the Senate Energy Committee right what do you make of this new proposal for an oil tax I think senator Rubio headed about right it's a bad idea and it's certainly not going to go anywhere in Congress so it's not so any point in talking about it I mean we're talking about a proposal for a new oil tax while we're looking at oil at thirty dollars a barrel historically low are we looking at the administration trying to take advantage of that low oil price environment by proposing this tax right now well I think both Marco and your analysts had it right at me makes no sense to put a ten dollar tax on a per barrel on oil at a time when our companies are fighting in a global competition to just stay in business and so I mean you're talking not only loss of jobs not only hurting economic growth you're talking about impact to consumers at the pump they're going to pay more and what happens of course is of our companies are put out of business then we go back to relying on OPEC and Russia and Venezuela I mean again from a national security standpoint that makes no sense so you know it's a bad idea would hurt consumers hurt job creation Congress knows that you know it'll be interesting to see if the Democrat candidates certainly Secretary Clinton if she embraces this in the campaign because I think it's very problematic well senator by the looks of it she's not embracing it considering she nor Bernie Sanders even brought it up once last night and that democratic debate on the day that this was proposed by the Democratic president senator I also want to ask you generally speaking as we were just flashing oil prices this morning still hovering right around thirty dollars a barrel what is the situation in your state right now as we do continue to see the economy getting hit by this low energy price environment well it's challenging no question about it look our companies whether it's in North Dakota or throughout the United States are fighting to stay in business they're locked in a global competition against OPEC against Russia and the other energy suppliers and Americans want energy provided here at home we don't want to go back to dependency on OPEC so in states like mine it's tough now we've built strong reserves and we've built a very good business climate so we can compete as long as the federal government doesn't keep adding taxes and more regulation hurting our ability to produce energy here at home and in essence with agreements like the president's Iran agreement helping our adversaries compete overseas well they obviously very critical of the president right now looking at the GOP side you are a Republican senator from North Dakota sitting on the energy side of the equation what who have you by the way decided who you're endorsing for president you know I haven't endorsed anyone at this point I will support our nominee I think we have good candidates you mentioned one this morning there are others I'm excited about our chances to win and get back to the kind of magic are you talking about Marco Rubio yeah marco and others who are doing a great job but we've got to get back to growing this economy and empowering investment not more regulation in higher taxes that are hurting and already soft economy yeah I mean it's senator is great to get your reaction to this a ten dollar a barrel oil tax proposed by the president yesterday no mention in the democratic debate last night it's going to be interesting all happening in an election year any forecasts by the way as far as the price of oil or that were elections will take that senator what's going to happen with the price of oil do you think Department of Energy says you know would be back in that 40 plus range end a year 50s next year again we can compete at those level levels and on the election side I think we're going to get behind our nominee and and i believe the republicans will win this election because it's time for a change in direction get our economy going and growing empower that investment that will create jobs and grow the economy good stuff senator great to have you this morning thank you thanks Sandra all right

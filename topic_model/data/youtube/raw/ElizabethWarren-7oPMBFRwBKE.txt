hi it's senator Elizabeth Warren again and I'm here with Bailey same whole thing so you know and with my sweetie Bruce say hi and Bailey and I are going to answer some more questions from kids about the corona virus come on Bailey [Music] how do you feel about this virus it doesn't hurt it hurts people yeah I live in a swarm and what would it want you to be you and talk it's a good question Finn and Bailey liked it too if I were in charge the first thing I do is make sure that everybody is safe and that means that doctors and nurses have all of the masks and gallons they need so they won't catch the virus and they'll be able to stay well and help other people get with it also means that people who are out doing work right now people who are stacking the shelves in the grocery store so there's food there people who are driving the trucks people who are driving buses so people can still get along the people who are cleaning buildings that have to still be open and cleaning our hospitals that all of those people also have plenty of masks and protective gear so that they don't get sick it's also important that they get paid fairly you know they're out there taking a lot of risk and they should be paid extra for doing that the other thing I would do is I make sure that people who have lost their jobs during this or whose small businesses have had to close down also have enough money to make sure that they can feed themselves and their kids and pay their rent or their mortgage because this is a hard time for people who get sick but it's even a hard time for people who don't because some of them are running out of money you know this is the kind of thing we can do together and that's that's how we're supposed to work that when times get hard when there's a crisis that we reach out and help each other because that's the kind of people we want to be and that's the kind of country and my question is what do you do for exercise in the pen don't ask me what a great way to use Elizabeth Warren signs very creative now I thought maybe Bailey could talk about what it is we try to do for exercise sometimes he'll chase the ball only sometimes and sometimes you do a little tug O'War you want to do it this morning not now and we take long walks together and sometimes we just run around and run around and run around in the yard but I do think it's important if you can to get outside and if you can run and run and run when you're outside it just makes you feel better and if there are people nearby remember always wear your mask I'll bet you have lots of fun things that you do too why don't you send me a video show me what you do great questions today and if there's more you want to ask just let me know and we'll do our best to answer they stay away I guess talking about exercise just war email [Music]

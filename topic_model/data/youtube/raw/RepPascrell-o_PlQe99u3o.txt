didn't mr. speaker good to see the bill before us today did not go through a committee like a bill this large should we could have offered amendments to address some of the most pressing issues with this tax bill I would have started with how this bill cherry-picks winners and losers with many of the losers being in states like the state I live in the state of New Jersey this is again let me repeat weekend at bernie's they prop up the dead tax bill make them look alive make it look alive and then they bring in something that makes it even look more dead that didn't work this will not work you didn't run on it you will not run on this our state got slammed by the new cap on the state and local tax deduction better than assault state and local taxes the oldest deduction in the books the GOP tax scam took money from homeowners communities in my state and others to fund their massive giveaway to big corporations that data is there it is clear it is succinctly it is definitive Republicans even bragged about using their tax scam to hurt New Jersey and the region imagine an imagine Brian about deliberately hurting millions of people my amendment would have restored this critical deduction but it was blocked this bill before us today provides targeted relief to victims of disasters but only a select few there were 13 disasters since we last held a committee meeting on a tax bill and I don't see them listed here not to mention a tax relief that victims of Hurricane sandy never received in the first place there is a bill that would provide disaster tax relief to all federally declared disaster areas automatically which it should be so we don't have to play these partisan games of picking and choosing if we want to help people let's vote on it there are provisions in this bill that I would have supported but our Chairman made no such attempt to reach us in fact we didn't have any witnesses but we had no hearings how about that for democracy instead this is nearly a hundred billion dollars it's unpaid for you're very good at that it's undebatable so much for reaching out and most important it totally ignores the needs of workers in this country mr. speaker here that General Motors just announced fourteen thousand seven hundred workers are losing their jobs does this bill do anything to address that no in fact the underlying tax bill you're trying to fix today number Bernie did nothing to help those workers either GM whose American jobs to China and Mexico they'll be paying a lower tax rate for the pleasure from 21 percent to a minimum of just 10.5% how do you justify that deal the gentleman is this in a 1-minute how do you justify that thank you and we continue to let them deduct the cost get this they we allow them to deduct the cost of moving their operations overseas how unamerican do you get we need to stop that there is a bill by the way to do that if you'll notice if you can believe it General Motors saved more than 150 million so far this year thanks to your scam and they appear to have benefited by as much as 6.5 billion by the tax holiday offshore for offshore cash hitting in this GOP bill the date is clear mr. chairman read it yet here they are shipping jobs overseas just in time for the holidays you might think after that they were reputed at the ballot box which shall similarly extend the hand to work with us reach out no laws you could do is smile and say Berni it shows my worry about it Thank You mr. chairman I'll yield back

define a and we start first try with mr. Dillingham you mentioned as i did my opening statement tsa identified a potential terrorist threat through the use of these UAV systems you know the FARC in Colombia and they talk about Hezbollah then of course their concerns really came to fruition last September when it was reported by The Associated Press man to blow up Pentagon and US Capitol is arrested and this was a drone he was going to use to do that yes sir the United States Capitol in the Pentagon the very targets of 911 and yet the department and as you recommend it through the GAO the department has a role in this to provide a security assessment in a national policy the department apparently disagrees with you and frankly disagrees with me is the chairman and has refused to provide testimony before this committee here today and I find that reprehensible I believe the department should come before this committee to answer why they believe they should not have a role in this when we get a direct threat to the capital the United States and the Pentagon and yet they don't see it as a role of the Department of Homeland Security to come up with a policy and a security assessment to monitor the threat that these domestic drones can pose to the American people can you do you have any idea what their rationale is mr. chairman we we specifically followed up in preparation for this hearing but before that the GAO has a policy of once we issue a recommendation that we do periodic follow-ups because those agencies are not only responsible for reporting to the GAO but they also report to the Congress so we followed up most recently and asked the TSA again about their position had their position change and they indicated that their position had not changed but they added they're added comments were that they were doing they were taking actions that they thought were sufficient to address the issue and as you know one of the central tenets of TSA security are risk analysis or risk assessment so that they know where they would best deploy their resources so we asked for some evidence of risk assessment that was done with regard to UAVs or UAS we were not able to obtain that from from DHS so that we still think that our recommendation is valid and needed to be addressed for balance though let me say that DHS is participating with the joint planning and development office as part of the cross government-wide development for plans but in terms of exactly what the nature and scope of that participation is beyond being members of that particular group we were not able to ascertain at this point but we continue to to to work that issue for our full report why can't ascertain it either you know if they won't come first committee to describe what they do and how can we possibly know what they're doing and you said they've taken certain precautions yet they will not come before us community tell us what precautions are taking yes sir and they have defied not only you but I think the world is committing the will of the American people and I'm not pleased about that obviously when we go to mr. chief of Daniel you actually receive Homeland Security grants to purchase these drones that correct that is correct sir but yet they have no role no sir now I hope you're saying that facetiously you said that you believe that there needs to be federal oversight by the Department of Homeland Security is that correct yes sir there is a difference between the aviation aspect of it that certainly the FAA is entitled to as experts in that environment but they do not have the understanding the expertise that I believe an agency such as the DHS would have in understanding the operational roles missions that in our case law enforcement would have in the needs that we would have in I tend to agree with you I think FA provides the safety of the routes but not security tell me just very briefly the legitimate law enforcement purposes I I do believe there's a legitimate law enforcement purpose for the use of these domestically can you expand on that well we have periodic needs for our SWAT team to call be called out and respond to critical incidents involving barricaded suspects high-risk warrants and this is an asset that provides that incident commander with the situational awareness to see everything that's going on within that incident so that he can better manage that incident and bring it to a safe conclusion I agree i think it should be limited to a specific incident or mission within a legitimate law enforcement purpose i think what most American people do not want to see or thousands of these drones being eyes of the skies for spying on the American people i think that takes me to you missed upon a when it comes to the privacy issues which i think you're a legitimate concern i think if these are you know people can accept if this is being used for a manhunt as as we use you know law enforcement helicopters are used in in the sky to for various legitimate law enforcement purposes what they don't want to see is is sort of spying without any mission involved in the plan and so there is no policy the Department of Homeland Security has an office of privacy don't you believe that they should be involved in working with people like yourself and people like the sheriff and people like Gao to develop a privacy policy epic doesn't believe that in fact we believe that a great first step DHS has the most robust privacy office in the federal government and they have not even done a privacy impact assessment on their own drone program which is also one of the most robust and one of the most definitely the most well-publicized program in the federal government so they have not even gone in to determine what impact these drones will have on the American public as they use them and we think that would be a great first step and then after that has been completed to really go in and to monitor these and determine what they can be used for and what they cannot be used for let me just get clear by saying that while y'all may not all agree on all the issues one thing you do agree on is that DHS does have a role here to play whether it's providing a security analysis working with state and locals and with privacy and i hope this hearing gets their attention hope your testimony gets their attention to step forward step up to the plate and do something about this with that

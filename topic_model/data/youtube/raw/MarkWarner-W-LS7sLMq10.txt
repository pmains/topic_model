I served for 37 years in the military during my time as the deputy commanding general for the tuna Military Police Command I had the opportunity to help to deploy units and soldiers overseas for Afghanistan and Iraq but I was not able to give my award during that time then after I moved on to further assignments the ward was lost paperwork was lost so I reached out to Senator Warner his staff Katy was fantastic she helped guide me through the process and the process worked out extremely well [Music] [Music] what I would tell my fellow veterans and servicemembers out there is that we have served our country faithfully and honorably and we deserve these benefits that we receive be it an award or some benefits that we're supposed to have take the time reach out to your congressional representatives and pursue it we've earned that okay we have committed our lives and our families to support our nation so this is time that we can have the opportunity to get something back in return

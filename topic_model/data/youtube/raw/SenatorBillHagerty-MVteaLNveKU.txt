thank you chairwoman klobuchar i'd like to call up hagerty amendment number 19. amendment bill that we're debating uh requires the counting of ballots for up to a week after election day this opens the door for perpetual disputes on any election that's close it also invites even more fraud if you think about the example of ballot harvesters going out once they find an election is close so long as that ballot is harvested and dated on election day that ballot is going to be counted up to a week beyond the beyond the election i think this creates all the wrong incentives it eviscerates confidence in our electoral system and i encourage you to support my vote to do away with this practice any comments on this sarah merkley uh thank you i'm just trying to examine what it is that's actually being struck on page 201 and 197 so i have to well it would require that postmarked ballots be counted when mailed on or before election day and received within 10 days following the election day it would strike strike that this this provision came about in part because the post office was changing so many systems in a fashion that made people lack confidence that the ballots would be delivered on a timely basis the provisions that were in the management amendment uh changed the timeline made it shorter which i'd be happy if there was bipartisan support for that to put that amendment forward again and it also shortened the timeline for curing ballots curing refers to when an election official looks at the signature on the mail-in ballot and says i'm not sure that's a match so they notify the voter and the voter has a chance to go down and say no no that is my signature it's a difference it's changed my signature's changed over 20 years and so shortening those timelines might make sense but we but the certainly the purpose the fundamental purpose is uh look we are not going to let efforts to slow down mail service prevent people's vote from being legitimately counted and i would also point out that um in 2016 21 of people voted by mail and in the middle of the pandemic really astoundingly so many people voted but 46 percent of voters think about that more than double from 2016. 46 percent of voters cast their ballots by mail i don't think a lot of them are going to want to go back i think they found they could do it and the problem is they will vote by mail more easily but not if we make it harder for them to do it and this simply acknowledges the fact that we're going to see more and more vote by mail which we of course have seen big time in oregon and that this makes sure that these ballots will be counted there was a lot of confusion i think everyone knows this i know this happened in my state a last minute court decision because we hadn't done a lot of vote by mail which we literally had to everyone democrats and republicans had to with four days to go explain that people the postmark data changed and things had changed due to one court decision which was unexpected in the last week and i just think this makes it clear for everyone when these will be counted our bill senator madam chair the the extended timeline is often in place for counting military ballots so it's not as if there isn't a already a precedent in many states for accommodating failure to deliver a ballot on time right very good are we ready to vote oh senator i read the provision in the bill it simply ensures that someone who voted and did everything right got it in before the date postmarked their vote counts and that's correct through no fault of their own if the ballot doesn't get delivered as long as it's postmarked right yes okay no it's not a postmark it's a date on the ballot okay i think it says both doesn't it requiring that postmarked ballots be counted when mailed on or before election day senator king could be either so again a harvest people go out there but they can bail them to get a ballot with a written date drop it in an unmanned drop and there you'd be that's why the incentive is wrong it has to be mailed on that day it just has to be shown up by the postal service to show that it was that day or before well i guess my point would be the same if it goes into a drop box prior to the election it doesn't get collected for some reason that's not the fault of the voter shouldn't their voter count their vote count if it's actually dropped in the drop box by that date it can be verified certainly it should be okay all right i suspect the drop boxes won't be left sitting around okay after the day of the election why do we have a vote on this if we were okay we discussed it clerk will call the roll senator feinstein no by proxy senator schumer no by proxy senator warner no by proxy senator leahy no by proxy senator king senator merkley senator padilla no by proxy senator oshoff senator blunt senator mcconnell senator shelby senator cruz senator capito senator wicker senator

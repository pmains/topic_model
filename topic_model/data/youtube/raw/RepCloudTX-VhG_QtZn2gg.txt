this debate over securing our border has become a debate over the morality of our efforts and I welcome that debate but if we're to debate this issue of border security on the basis morality it's fair for us not only to ask how this issue affects our own nation but to look across our border and see how our national policy affects those beyond our borders for those of us who live near our southern border we understand all too well the effects of the criminal cartels who profit from abusing our nation's generous immigration laws when I visited the Rio Grande Valley just recently a rancher with land on the border described the situation saying that he finds dead migrants on his land all the time in my hometown of Victoria Texas 19 migrants died of suffocation and overheating trapped in the back of a trailer abandoned by a smuggler with a callous disregard for human life but beyond our borders these cartels carrying an outsized influence in Mexico and in developing nations in Central America we know that cartels profit from smuggling drugs and humans across the border they siphon oil from pipelines they extort families and businesses and kidnap for profit the barbarianism of these criminal cartels has led to a hundred fifty thousand homicides in Mexico alone since 2006 they've worked there corrupting influence into the halls of government and law enforcement hindering the people of these nations from developing and realizing the blessings of liberty for themselves our federal government's unwillingness to control our border allows cartels to amass profits of tens of billions of dollars each year smuggling drugs and humans into our country with a devastating toll on the most vulnerable in our nation our lack of border security allows these criminal cartels to wield their corrupting influence in a way that makes positive change so difficult in these countries unfortunately like too many issues these days border security has become a divisive and a partisan issue when historically this has had broad support but there should be nothing partisan about ending a humanitarian and criminal crisis that is driven by cartels and enabled by our federal government's failure to act Congress has a responsibility to protect the citizens of our country into in the humanitarian crisis on our southern border and it's past time to reform our broken Asylum system and secure the border

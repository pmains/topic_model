I thank the chair protecting consumers is one of my most important missions but the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau often deprives consumers of necessary choices and complicates access to financial products director Cordray's CFPB abused its power it has issued regulations that make it more difficult for consumers to qualify for a mortgage obtain auto loans access forms of credit it is imperative that this committee exercises oversight over the CFPB to rein in abuses and with that said I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to your leadership director granular director chroniker thank you for your testimony and again your leadership at the CFPB you took the helm in December December and have since taken what I believe to be a thoughtful approach to the duties of an agency that many of my colleagues myself included believed to be unconstitutionally structured you've conducted a three-month listening tour to hear from state regulators consumer advocates and talked with your own employees to see what's working well and what isn't what have you discovered through these discussions in terms of how to ensure the bureau is actually helping consumers and not abusing his powers thank you for that question congresswoman it is a really central one to what I am trying to do and hearing from all perspectives on this matter I think again protecting consumers is our mission and I have been truly impressed by the staff that are there and truly dedicated had a lot of discussions with our examination staff understanding even the most mundane pain points that they're experiencing from you know how they have to manage their travel that's time away from the mission and that is my focus on how we best utilize our resources it's again how do we make sure that every dollar is actually going to protect consumer and not towards administrative activities and bureaucratic things that are standing in people's ways so certainly they have raised those issues I have I've talked to educators about the most effective ways to get the American people in the public to understand better the products and services that they are interacting with how to make good you know the best financial decisions for themselves in their own lives and give them the information that they need to do that and and carrying out all the missions of the bureau which are there are there many when when your predecessor appeared before this committee last April he was very blunt and he described a scope of whose individual authority and power is director explaining at the outset that he could if he chose decline to answer any questions from committee members or refused even to appear at all because the plain reading of this failed statute does not require it he went on to describe the directors sole authority and complete discretion to define entire classes of financial institutions and products to target regulations and enforcement actions as he alone suffit in your read of the law to use director have unfettered power and authority Congress vested tremendous power and authority and responsibilities in the director yes just something that we here in Congress need to fix how will you approach the directorship to best serve Americans and what tools does a bureau need from Congress to be successful in following through with your mission to end the era of regulation by enforcement I appreciate that question congresswoman we have certainly a very important responsibility to establish clear rules of the road as I noted I have I have heard that from industry in some respects I've heard that from the examiner staff as well making sure that they can hold institutions accountable and and to clear rules and ensure culture of compliance and the way that they're operating so that is something that I am looking very carefully at I don't have a specific active comment ask of Congress to that point there is a lot of flexibility and and how we do things but the law is certainly our touchstone in terms of what we undertake for supervision I thank you for your answers I thank you again for your leadership we look forward to you moving forward you do not deserve to be berated or badgered you are a fine public servant and I appreciate all of the work that you're doing it is Congress's job to change the statutory authority and rein in the CFPB I thank you and I yield back

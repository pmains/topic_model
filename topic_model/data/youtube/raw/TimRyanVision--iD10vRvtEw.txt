Thank You mr. chairman watching this here really is an opportunity to really see the differences between the two parties i think and i think it highlights really why the Republican philosophy over the last 20 years or so has really failed to get the economy going in any way shape or form and I think in most recent history we can see that if we compare the Clinton budget the clinton plan was a balanced plan a little bit of revenue being asked from the wealthiest some programmatic cuts investments into early childhood and to research into infrastructure into the things that help grow the economy a more balanced approach as opposed and we saw 21 million private sector jobs that were created we saw huge budget surpluses that we had 10 or 12 years ago 13 years ago and we saw increases in income in almost in every economic category all boats were rising and if we compare that to the conservative approach that President Bush took direct immediately after that we only saw two percent growth we saw the loss of four hundred and sixty thousand jobs and we saw an explosion in the deck now the wise approach would have been to take the surplus money pay down the debt the lockbox that was made fun of so much when Al Gore was campaigning to make sure that we strengthen Social Security strengthen Medicare was not adopted and that's what this amendment is about and that's what the last few amendments have been about this balanced approach to help grow the economy investments in research earned income tax credit to make work pay infrastructure investments and this particular amendment is about the Pell Grant 90 billion dollars being cut out of the Pell Grant when we know that having a college education pays more and we know that eighty-seven percent of college graduates in 2012 had a job as opposed to sixty-four percent of high school students this is a wise investment we're going to get a great return and I hear all the time from my friends on the other side of the aisle I run a business I run a business I've run this business I run that business and it's an honorable thing it's great it's that you're the artists of democracy and of capitalism in many ways this is a good business decision we're going to get money back this is going to pay off for us is an economy and now we see that we have twenty nine thousand dollars is the average debt that a college student carries and that's a burden that prevents that student from buying a house buying a car maybe starting their own business limiting their ability to create more wealth in our economy so this is a pretty simple amendment that restores the cuts and helps us try to shrink the gap between the wealthiest among us you have the top 1% income growth going two hundred and seventy-seven percent increase in the average person in Youngstown Ohio in the middle class has only sought thirty-seven percent increase since 1979 this is unsustainable in these investments that we've talked about making in a balanced way or how you grow the economy Bill Clinton proved it in 1993 with that budget and it's the way we need to move forward and these deep cuts are not only going to hurt the people directly they're going to hurt our economy all too

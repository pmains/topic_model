chairman madam secretary our country is suffering from a mass shooting epidemic this year alone there have been more mass shootings than days in the year 22 schools have come under gunfire already this year including robb elementary school in oval de texas where 19 children were killed in cold blood in their classroom along with two teachers by an assault rifle according to the washington post more than 311 000 children at 331 schools have experienced gun violence at school since the 1999 columbine shooting after decades of republican obstruction to democratic efforts to address this epidemic of school shootings we are now learning the long-term cost of this trauma researchers at northwestern university found that students who are survivors of gun violence at school are less likely to graduate high school and they are less likely to attend and or graduate from college these survivors are also less likely to be employed as adults than their peers and if they are employed they are likely to earn less over the course of their lives so secretary yellen what is the economic costs of allowing the trauma of unabated gun violence in our communities and schools to continue unaddressed well secretary senator menendez let me first say i am also horrified by gun violence um what we have seen in recent weeks over and over many years and i do hope that congress will take long overdue action and put in place common sense measures to reduce gun violence i am not an expert at all on the psychological impact of gun violence on student learning or human capital accumulation but and i'm not i'm not knowledgeable of the study that you mentioned but i do know that there is a large literature in economics that documents that events that take place in early life in childhood can have a lifelong impact on life outcomes on labor market outcomes on psychological well-being and so it only stands to reason that the threat of violence at schools um it keeps our kids so let me just ask you from an economic i know you're not a a psychologist but if northwestern universities study that found that students who are survivors of gun violence are less likely to graduate high school less likely to graduate from college and more likely to earn less over the course of their lives doesn't that have an economic impact of course it has a negative impact on on these individuals and um and on our economy and um i don't i don't know how what the aggregate size of that is but it certainly has a negative let me ask you on a different topic the washington post reported two weeks ago that the administration was considering canceling 10 000 of federal student loan debt per bar for individuals with incomes under 150 000. the same article stated that quote it was unclear whether the administration will simultaneously require interest and payments to resume at the end of august when the current pause is scheduled to lapse the consumer financial protection bureau issued a report in april of this year finding that 15 million borrowers or 60 percent of all borrowers that have had their loans on pause since march 2020 may have difficulty resuming their student loan payments when a pause is over are you concerned about the economic impact on borrowers if we turn student loan payments on prematurely well look this is something that the administration is weighing what the right policies are here and we're in the middle of deliberations on it is a very important topic student debt has people if people are called upon to pay and cannot and default that has a real consequence as well as in their lives it has a real consequence to our overall economy that's why we've been urging the president to serious consider uh uh loan forgiveness finally a study published by the washington center for equitable growth found that over 118 million homes across the united states black and hispanic homeowners face an average 10 to 13 percent higher property tax burden when compared to similarly situated white homeowners do you would you agree that our federal salt deduction is an important tool to reduce the effects of regressive tax policy through property tax relief i'm not aware of that study i'll have a look at it but um i i know that's something i need but on a broader proposition if i give people property tax relief and i have a disproportionate number of the universe of property tax owners who ultimately uh face a greater consequence of higher burdens then i would assume that helping them with that burden gives the type of relief that in yours to the benefit not only of those families but to communities as a whole that certainly seems logical time

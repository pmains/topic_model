here with reaction south carolina senator lindsey graham if the numbers are now as high as they are in march what are those numbers going to be like in may and you just got back from the border well you know i was on your show what three or four weeks ago saying that there's a disaster in the making well the worst is yet to come i mean why are so many unaccompanied minors coming to the our country now when trump was president the miners would be sent back to either mexico or their home country they're all staying in america and when i say the worst is yet to come by the spring late spring early summer you're going to have families coming in caravans because the word is out in central america they're changing the policy that trump put in place that if you get to the border you turn yourself in you're going to stay in america not mexico until they reverse that policy until they go back to the remaining mexico policy the worst is yet to come i'm just a little old talk show host what do i know lindsay i'm not that smart but i would think that with 17 million americans out of work with a pandemic and now all these high-paying energy jobs people being laid off and border wall construction jobs all the pink slips there and then what 15 million people are going to get amnesty i don't know where i went to school i was taught supply and demand crisscross and dictate in this case wages what is this going to do to wages for american workers well number one it's going to suppress wages when illegal immigrants come to the country they work for cash under the table they don't pay taxes they're often exploited it's a terrible deal why are so many people coming she said that the trump policies were ineffective so let me ask her this she's not going to answer do you consider your policies effective how do you account for the surge in illegal crossings on your watch let me tell you what's happened word is out that the trump policies are being replaced by the biden administration that if you get one foot in america you're never going to leave and people are coming by the thousands they'll be coming by the hundreds of thousands by the summer it's a humanitarian crisis it's going to be an economic crisis for our cities along the border and eventually it's going to be a national security crisis cost their children today but they could easily be terrorists tomorrow this is the 20th anniversary of 9 11. al qaeda and isis would do not would love nothing more than to hit us again on the 20th anniversary to show that they're still alive and well and this border insecurity is a great way for terrorists to come into our country just to blend in with this group let me tell you that is a chilling scenario senator that what you just described i do believe if you're right and these new numbers are now astronomical these are numbers we've never seen before and i still want to get inside the cargo shipping containers remember biden obama built the kids in cages cages they built them i want we're putting kids in in cargo containers and we're told we can't videotape it and we're told that there are butterflies on the walls so don't worry about it you buy that well that's coming well that's what well that's right it'd be all over the front page of new york times every day horrible conditions concentration camp like conditions whereas aoc by the way you remember kamala harris protested outside a homestead facility that when when trump used it in homestead florida to put children in it well that place is now open in full where is she all i can say is that there's a lot of danger coming from this wave of illegal immigration and the numbers are going to double uh by the summer if we don't go back to trump policies as embarrassing and as painfully as painful it would be for buying an administration they need to understand that what trump did on the border worked how do you like this because i know you said it last week herschel walker for senate from georgia how do you like that how does that i like the ring of that what do you think i i think it's a touchdown no football analogies all right thanks senator appreciate it okay

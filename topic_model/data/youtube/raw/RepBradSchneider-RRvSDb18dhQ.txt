Mr. Speaker, communities throughout our country
are suffering from an epidemic of gun violence. In far too many cases, stolen guns represent
a growing source of the weapons used in these crimes. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives, last year alone more than 18,000 firearms were reported stolen
or lost just from Federal Firearm Licensees, or FFLs --that is federally-licensed dealers,
manufacturers, and importers. Today I introduced the SECURE Firearm Storage
Act to help address this stolen gun problem by requiring all FFLs to securely store their
inventory when not open for business. Additionally, this bill would require the
Attorney General to review and put forth further commonsense security measures to reduce the
risk of theft, and require new applicants to detail their security plans before a new
license can be approved There are simply too many innocent lives destroyed
by these stolen guns. I invite my colleagues to join me on this
bill to make commonsense improvements for gun safety.

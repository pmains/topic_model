i want to focus specifically on what senator paul said there to emerald and the double standard we are seeing from the justice department and federal prosecutors when it comes to the way those who were at the capitol on january 6 were treated versus some of the other violent actors like the ones that attacked the police officer and senator rand paul and his wife and look at all the attacks across the country started by antifa and anarchists and black lives matter those individuals are not being held accountable it doesn't matter if you're black or white or brown republican or democrat if you break the law everyone should be treated in the same way and to hold individuals in jail who are not violent like this i don't care what the event is or what transpired everyone should be treated equally under the law and i think you know 99 of this country feels that way i don't think the you know powers that be in washington dc or a lot of the corporate press feel that way especially when you look at the way uh this treatment the the way this was covered in the news i want to focus specifically too there's more to talk about with this on capitol hill police officer harry dunny testified on tuesday of course a lot of folks heard his testimony but he apparently has an online history of criticizing former president trump and conservative figures he's also defended last summer's summer of love the black lives matter protests articles in the jewish voice and the federalist yesterday outlined several of his past tweets calling his you know testimony into question here we also talked to alan dershowitz that said this could have consequences on these criminal prosecutions the folks that need to be held accountable for what happened on january 6. i mean what was your take on all this watching it right i want to make sure to that number one republicans support our police and our law enforcement and the capitol hill police officers that were there that day were there to protect us and i don't want to discount their testimony but when you have activists that might have other political leanings um that are called into question that is something that is up for debate at this juncture the one thing that i want to point out today is that there have been more resources spent and invested in investigating january 6 than 9 11. and there are already four federal agencies that are investigating january 6. you have homeland security the secret service the fbi and the department of justice the attorney general there have been over 500 arrests there are also 10 committees in the united states senate and in the house of representatives who are also who have broad subpoena power that are also investigating january 6 and this is just a sideshow to the disastrous first six months of the biden administration and to the failures and leadership of chuck schumer and nancy pelosi look just this morning nancy pelosi wants to have you arrested on capitol hill if you're not wearing a mask i'll talk to you about that in a second what's going on there were a lot of accusations made about specific things that were said to officer dunn as well you know and they sound like very serious horrible things you know we're not condoning that type of behavior at all and we want to get to the bottom of this certain body cam footage has been released and shown to the public but the specific accusations that were made by officer done yesterday that could be substantiated with the release of the body camera footage and also a lot of the surveillance footage from the capitol that has not been released to the public yet are we ever going to get to see that stuff all of it should be released if you want to get to the bottom of january 6 just release all of it all of it is right there on the camera footage i think every american republican or democrat would agree with that we ought to get to the bottom of it and we already are through four federal agencies and ten congressional committees it's already being investigated and instead of the select committee that is not bipartisan um is instead trying to you know have these hearings and in fact earlier this week i was told that some committee and subcommittee hearings were delayed this week so that nancy pelosi could have hearings and have immediate broad media coverage media circus on the january 6 commission that's just wrong that's not american we've got work to do up here yeah it's like a hurry up and start kind of thing it was so early that this happened and so important and so emotional and now you know what's next we don't know pelosi just wants the press she just wants the press it's not about the people it's about pelosi and i think a lot of people feel like she's trying to drag this out as close to 2022 as possible to gain to leverage the maximum amount of political leverage out of the situation real quick let's talk about the new mass mandate up there on capitol hill here's your colleague chip roy in passion and his impassioned plea on the house floor yesterday and the american people are fed up they want to go back to life they want to go back to business they want to go back to school without their children being forced to wear masks to be put in the corner to have mental health issues and we're running around here and the speaker comes down here at 10 o'clock in the morning saying we got to wear masks into people's house while we've got thousands of people pouring across our border and democrats don't do a darn thing about it i want to talk specifically about the insanity and what we know about the efficacy of mass for kids what he talked about there enforcing mass mandates on kids but not on illegal immigrants right thousands of people coming across the border illegally not being tested for covid we know that they have coveted not wearing masks not being vaccinated in fact if you travel to mexico as a citizen of the united states for vacation like many americans do right now when you come back to the united states you have to test negative in order just to come back into your own country but but across the border from mexico no vaccinations no testing it doesn't matter i mean that's a super spreader event down on the border yeah nothing to see here as so many democrats would like you to believe congresswoman nancy mays thanks so much great to see you thank you as always

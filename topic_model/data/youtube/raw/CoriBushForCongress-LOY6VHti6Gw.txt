I live in I live in Glasgow village the
first congressional district and I feel as though Congressman Clay has failed to deliver the things we need in the first
congressional district I have never been able to go to a town hall that he's had where I could talk directly to him and then I've been living over there for 20
years. And I am thoroughly disappointed with "Lazy" Clay because he has proved
himself to be a lazy representative he has not been there for us in 20 years
and we definitely need new representation

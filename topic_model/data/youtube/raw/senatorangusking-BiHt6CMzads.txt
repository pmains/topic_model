Thank You mr. chairman Admiral Ted since we've been talking here this morning for people in this country have died of overdoses just in the last hour as many people have died in the last month as were killed on September 11th including one a day in my state of Maine I can't believe we're having the same conversation today that I remember having with General Kelly two or three years ago and getting this figure of eight percent of is our resources and 25 percent of known drug shipments interdicted seventy-five percent get through I think you've admitted identified the problem if we give you a mission you will deal with it the problem is nobody has this mission and I hope you will go back and talk to this interagency group and talk to the White House it is inexcusable to be sitting here three or four years later and still only being able to interdict 25 percent of the drug shipments that we know about and we would know about more if we had adequate ISR this is simply a question of allocation of resources and this is the most serious public health problem this country faces four people have died in the last hour and we're still talking about and you're giving me the same figures that Admiral that general Kelly gave three or four years ago can you commit to me that you will move this to the highest level of priority and kick some behinds and take some names in this in this interagency cooperation please don't come back here again next year with the same testimony senator I can commit to you that not only will I but I have continued to communicate the challenge that we face I will observe the services the biggest challenge they have to be able to provide additional resources which they recognize very clearly are required are challenged by the inability to have budget predictability to be able to produce more forces to make them available it's this is a team sport this is a team effort we have to work together as constructively and collaboratively as possible well my commitment to you is that I will do everything within my power to do my part hopefully we've just passed a two-year budget authorization we hopefully again will have the final numbers within the next two or three weeks and then we will be able to move forward but please make this the highest priority and I'm not I'm not attacking you I'm attacking that the failure of our structure to to adequately get it a problem when we have it right in front of us it would be one thing if we didn't know but when we have it right in front of us general Robinson let's move north first question we all know that there's a Russian buildup along the northern border along the Arctic Ocean what are they what's their purpose what can you discern what is their strategic reason for doing this is a defensive offensive are they looking to get closer to be able to attack us or are they simply protecting their Shore so sir I would say I think what you just said at the last is is great protecting their shore you know as you and I chatted about the other day the opportunity they took for them to move their infrastructure around to their different bases is incredibly important just like I do you know I move capability from Anchorage to Eielson from Eielson to Inuvik from Inuvik to tule and so we move things around but it's to make sure that they can put things into places they want to at the time and place of their choosing and I think you made an important point earlier that there are two elements of national strategy one is capability the other is intent yes sir and the problem is right now they may have a benign intent or a lack of malicious intent I put it that way yes sir but they're building up the capability which requires that we have to be alert are there assets you need in the north that you don't have for example an icebreaker so sir you know I'll defer to my colleagues in the coast guard but what I will tell you for the icebreakers but what I will tell you is that I very much get is our capability in Global Hawk and other things that I share with you calm and Paycom to understand what's happening in the region just and soon but I will I will tell you that I'm very good at advocating for needing other capabilities such as as an example if you want icebreakers I talk with my Coast Guard brothers often about this because I think about it in the summer when crystal serenity you know goes through and we're gonna see more of that yes sir final short question if you had to choose if you could only have one priority in or in order to improve our missile defense system what would it be so I want to thank the Congress for the capacity that we just got but we have got to keep our eye on discriminating radars that's what I thought you would answer and I think that's got to be a very high prayer thank you thank you both

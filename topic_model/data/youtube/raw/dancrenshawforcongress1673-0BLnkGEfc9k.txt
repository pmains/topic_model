[Applause] [Applause] oh here's a baby David this I've got that one online - just saying yeah material we did a shot [Applause] always connected I think the short answer spirits in Congress the fight for our values to be a champion for the conservative movement I really believe in that I believe the past primary nine of us running but we need somebody who understands those in a lot over the years you have to have the back for the people give you the gift of allowing you that role of leadership we need to get you know given his those given given to you by those who are willing to follow you people lose sight of that I think they don't realize I learned hardship early on and I learned it over and over and over again I became the seal my third deployment I got hurt I have flood insurance there they need to rebuild the can [Applause] didn't drop some attention to the area though there's still [Applause] [Music] [Applause] mr. and so you exactly writers he whispered the driveway and she came home and I just walk them I met her I mean this was different that's great destination for that fundraiser I think it's got the Pennsylvania over here and we're just kind of like at the mercy whatever they're give sort of like volunteer yeah everybody's on tiptoes Innisfil it is people get excited about coming out and helping it was also really impressive one thing I did I saw a lot was [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] our house but they have this literally and the group the Mennonites it came back a couple weeks ago they were like we want to do this exactly maybe wanted it and they did even though it's known as termite damage maybe from another time I'm sorry okay I will [Applause] [Applause] we capo my hair is very happy being a capo so my hair is very happy [Laughter] and I got here right yeah and then I got there right into the stuff to the Balkans office yeah that should buy you a couple of clean spots yeah that should buy you a couple of TV spots in there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] like I've ever smiled Garman yeah yeah that's a great idea it'll give us more time to actually really plan it out make sure we hit it the rent stops and raise the right awareness so we're excited about that it was a great really cool oh yeah and it was Marcus stroke couldn't can do it the next week either so at the end of it we'll have him come out guest speaker and it should be a phenomenal event totally fun like an actual rally so I guess just for for this purpose we'll do I guess being you will just kind of discuss like the vision that we had talked about before right so we're talking for a hair policy and I really liked a lot of things you had to say you know but gonna your easy wins you know oh that's easy wheeling sorter will go ahead yeah easy wins are malpractice it texted like Mellie Alexis or excesses got the model right and we can just if we can just extrapolate that to the rest of the country you might see health care costs start to decrease right on a national scale right even including here in Texas right right because it's all related oh so you know that was a big one and really just changing the way we look at insurance markets to you know getting those premiums down low and that if that means we have to push push high-risk individuals outside of their own kind of insurance pool right you know what deductibles be high but if they're gonna be high you know and you don't have the income to pay for that you know can we put more money in your health savings account to pay that alright and then you know when people buy it since their premiums are so hot and already how do we make sure that premium goes toward their chair right yeah that's gonna work alone I gather that what that sort gets really common but that's one where it gets tough like who manages your air who managed to care and how do you how do you get that money that people spend around their premium loved better health care yes it's right right is it is it getting the outcomes you need right are you treating them in a way that actually affects the outcomes are you giving them too much treatment too little treatment are you giving runners expensive treatment it's unnecessary because I with Medicare said they pay for right now flex right yeah and again easy wins malpractice reforms because reduces the practice that's the best they're just ordered attest to cover right make sure that you haven't missed something there's what happens whereas if you know just steep the guidelines a lot of times good or better outcomes yeah you know sometimes less is more you know and it is it is very non locations you know the East Coast they will do as many open-heart surgeries if I work angiogram say they do more so there is no way that is the right finding what works in certain areas the country and scaling that to this you know I know so many people are working on this but we just got to get the data in the right places and have the leadership actually talk about it right in a smart way right right side you know to come you know is it about repealing the ACA yes it is it's also about doing what's right for people and their health care I mean I know where the most help how much you know I'm here you know I had the best in the world I've got to say that again I have patients I just had a patient who was in in Turkey and when he he had hit blood loss Payton had to be just just haven't taken the hospital had to get a blood transfusion right wasn't sure if the deals were clean enough no you're scared now I have to scream for HIV and hepatitis that didn't happen to us right so we do have the best care there is a price for that and it's worth it right because winters emergency yeah so it's something that gets there so we want to keep that quality no matter what one thing I like that we talked about before was you know that movement towards what would they call it concierge medicine but boomer that primary care you know it's direct the ring erect patient care where you're you pay a small fee to a doctor like a gym membership exactly you know like that looks like a gym membership and so the patients in charge of how they spend their healthcare dollar in it it's almost like a retainer for you for the physician yeah looks like a gym membership so and that would decrease the price it's not quite concierge it's less expensive the concierge you still get that ya care that you need you know just first much if you need more they can order those tests but you're like you're talking low prices per month right you're talking a cake icon again you could do it 60 to 80 bucks a month yeah easily right Werner's of that doctor all the time you just maybe over Skype or just the right you don't necessarily need to waste time and money going in the office all the time and they've done they have done pilot programs of it and patient satisfaction was right really good it's just the economics you have to find a you know an area where they're willing and able to have it done it can happen it yeah reasons 60 $80 right it'd be cheaper per year than a pair of braces were what do you think prevents us scaling that out more right now getting that to take whole I tell you that the one thing that I see the reason it doesn't take whole this people were spending so much on their premiums already they don't want to do they don't they're already spending four hundred to a thousand dollars a month out of premium they don't want to spend you know it's economical another fifty to eighty dollars right right for that dress I'm Artie painting this where as opposed to dental insurance only paying like five to ten bucks a month and then swing a six thousand dollar braces bill comes and people think well you know I haven't spent yeah six thousand this year already yeah yeah that's where I see that calm that's why I see that rescue is gotta get those premiums down the premiums down or transferred to different places so yeah that's that's worse okay and that's we go on forever oh yes I think I think we got enough good for good just you know speaking health care policy for a little bit I like it great good stuff well you will you quickly just look in the barrel the camera tell me were allowed to use your your footage point you are allowed to use my footage saving her economy working on trade issues [Applause] [Music] there's nothing wrong with that we're tired because they're having a hard time finding the right hands for that because they're not getting trained right and we have it we have a huge amount especially males will order than me we're out of the job market completely it's unclear why that is some sin the freedom and [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Lucy never is talking about willory get that work experience applying the come on it's the right choice for a lot of kids for a couple years get a skill set that works being on a mechanic but you can realize that the college is right for you and there's so many people in the military who enlisted right out of high school all right they mature I think a lot of skill sets out of that and the kit for your degree from the GI Bill afraid and they're ready you know we have to be we have to just be talking about it country we have to have our leaders talking about [Applause] but it teaches you that he would say like oh I respect you because I know you're working when nobody's looking that's sometimes a lesson that gets reinforced these the Texans know and so what kind of Pat full or you see for helping those kids your education is here their allegiances and the last we're helping them at angle wall the right funding for our quarter all Athens bring your room together we're not like Europe I'm proud of that you know again yes we're a nation of immigrants were also nation of borders we have a single culture and you know we haven't been able to have the conversation for a long reasonable way I think we can I mean there's you know there's

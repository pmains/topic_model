we're told the White House has 18 suspects in the Benghazi terror attack they know who they are but the president won't give the green light to seize those 18 suspects and also top White House adviser insisting Republicans Oh Ambassador Susan Rice an apology well any chance of that happening similar Lindsey Graham joins us said a nice to see you and we ready how you doing very well we really see this the with it a white house representative on the five sunday shows this weekend as well call asking Republicans I suppose they mean you for an apology to Susan Rice are you going to apologize not only does she not deserve an apology from me or anybody else for the way she misled the American people she deserves to be subpoenaed by the Congress and have to give answers to hard questions something she's never had to do before she should apologize to Greg Hicks the number two in Tripoli the number two guy second behind Chris Stevens who said I quote when I heard her testimony my jaw dropped my heart stopped and I've never been more embarrassed so what do you make it the White House suddenly raising that again maybe they didn't race well this guy that went out sunday is just on a different planet I guess he thinks they're buying the country stupid was she an empty vessel that they could board misinformation through she was chosen because she was the most politically compliant person she just didn't say this was no evidence of an al Qaeda attack this was caused by a video spontaneous event she said well we obviously did have a strong security presence she said there was a significant security presence defending our consulate and our facility in Benghazi and that did not prove sufficient to the moment did anybody in any talking point suggest the embassy was consulate was strongly significantly and substantially secured she was blowing political smoke she was selling for the president she said let me remind you al Qaeda's been decimated bidhan lied instead she was trying to create a narrative seven weeks before the election this in the counselor was strongly secured and the president was a strong leader on the war on terror well she went behind closed doors with the US Senate Republicans right about now baby me and were you convinced then oh I was convinced that she was just is completely miss representing the facts if she looked at the classified information behind the talking point she could not have suggested to anybody on the planet this was caused by video and spontaneous and nature all the information coming from Libya there's a hundred pounds of information suggesting a coordinated al-qaeda sponsored terrorist attack and one ounce suggesting a protest and they picked the house don't lose sight of the fact that the stories she told on behalf of President Obama administration was the best story they could tell seven weeks before Election totally disconnected from the facts and she should be apologizing to Greg Hicks to all the families involved and she should be subpoenaed and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the President himself has to account for what he did that night where was he at months before when the consulate had been previously attacked and why did he say for two weeks after the attack well we think this was a protest caused by a hateful video the President himself needs to account for what he told the American people I'm switch gears a little bit through the fact that there jennifer griffin reported yesterday that there were eight there are 18 p.m. the White House is aware of that there in Libya and they have not yet green-lighted to go in and season with the military action of any sort I me or any action on I don't know what what they should do I've heard that there are people that we know were involved we know where they're at I've heard that the leader of this al Qaeda affiliate we know where that person's at and one of the arguments is well we don't have enough evidence convicting and civilian court but we could hold them under military law the idea that we're not in there today asking Libya to go in and help us pick these guys up and put them in prison to interrogate them about what happened in Benghazi about any future attacks may be coming our way just just blows my mind is there's court Olivia to talk to me as elusive absolutely alright so women was so why aren't we asking Libya mean these people killed our four Americans are 18 we've identified them on tape that's how they've been identified on tape by the apparel and by the CIA what's what's the back off I don't think this president is very interested in finding out the truth about Benghazi the truth is that this was a coordinated pre-planned terrorist attack long time in the making the store elections over if your theory that isn't a this will affect his legacy the American people deserve to applaud President Obama when he went after bin Laden we got photos a minute-by-minute scenario of what he did is our commander-in-chief to go after the number one terrorist in the world when it comes to explaining his actions that night before and after the attack when four Americans were murdered by Al Qaeda affiliates we don't know anything he did we don't know where he was that night we don't know when he went to bed we don't know what he did months before when the consulate had been previously attacked and I want to hear from him he doesn't have to tell me but he needs to tell somebody why did he say two weeks after the attack we thought it was a protest caused by video when there's really no evidence at all to suggest that two weeks later we have 20 seconds left is there anything this whole idea of all these pages that we still haven't been released about all the survivors I'm not stopping to the people in Benghazi get a chance to come to the Congress and tell us what happened I'm not stopping to the president has to answer for his actions as commander-in-chief and as to Susan Rice she's not going to get apology for me she's going to get a subpoena senator thank you sir always nice to see you sir thank you coming up

welcome to the show ranking member of house natural resources along with transportation committees congressman bruce westerman congressman it's great to have you on thank you so much for joining us have you seen what's going on with the messaging on the president's trip to saudi arabia because it seems like there's chaos even on this i mean biden's energy secretary granholm says the president will meet with the crown prince of saudi arabia next month the president says he's not explicitly meeting with him it's part of a broader international meeting so how can they not even get this one straight as they're not talking to u.s oil well good good to be with you liz and i i think it's metaphorical of their whole energy plan they the left doesn't know what their right hand is doing they seem to have an itinerary but they have no plan to get there and they don't know what they're going to do when they get theirs so i'm not surprised it's what we've come to expect with this administration and i think it just illustrates how haphazard they go along the way and how a little of a real plan that they have you know they've got an agenda they say they want zero carbon and neutrality and all of this stuff but they have no real reasonable or rational plan on how to get there and i think what the american public needs is a is a plan to show how we can produce a reliable affordable and the cleanest energy on the planet and do it in a way that doesn't drive prices through the roof and doesn't affect people's everyday lives and continue to pile on in inflation let's watch the president's uh climate sars uh but by the way let me back up what we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna talk about this instead we're gonna watch biden economic adviser jared bernstein he is claiming the president is the best best president of history on basically rocketing gas prices you're going to see the treasury secretary admit to a drop in oil production and refinery capacity and then you're going to see representative c scalise and hbo's bill moore weighing in watch this the president is doing more than any president i've ever worked for and what's happened is the production has gone down refinery capacity is declined in the united states in oil production has declined the natural resources committee had a hearing on big cats that's right amidst this gas crisis that's crushing american families taking money out of their pockets every single week in 2020 biden said no more drilling on federal lands no more no keystone pipeline when people get off fossil fuels before they have a replacement they wind up going back to even worse fossil fuels we said saudi arabia got yourself you killed a journalist and now biden is going over their hat in hand begging them for oil you know and biden has been undercutting u.s energy congressman at least seven executive orders multiple initiatives undercutting cracking down on u.s energy so your committee has been the democrats are talking about cats yeah that seemed to be the most important subject i could come up with is how we regulate big cats you know stemming back from the uh the next quick show that people are watching during the pandemic uh so we want to talk about how do we produce more energy how do we lower cost how do we create more american jobs how do we use energy as a national security weapon and how do we help our friends across the world all of those important issues that should be coming before a committee and as the whip mentioned the topic the headliner bill was big cats you can't make it up uh i hate to wish my life away but i can't wait to see the american voters speak in november hopefully we can get some common sense back we've got house democrats on your own committee cracking down on disinformation and anything negative about green energy like the climate service gina mccarthy and john kerry are doing are they going to crack down on the president for saying this watch this i grew up in a family not a joke where if the price of a gallon of gasoline went up it was a conversation at our kitchen table it mattered it mattered with my mom and dad it made a difference we felt it and no he didn't he didn't feel it because gas was flat when he was growing up it didn't go it was going nowhere it was not going up and there was no food shortages there was no pricey gasoline when buying was growing up in the 40s the price of gasoline had plateaued so you know how come how come the president and his team is allowed to get away with whoppers like this all the time and the american people are supposed to believe everything they say it's almost like they're coming from some fantasy world and they make it up and they just want to say what they think the american people want to hear but i think people are smarter than that they see through it they feel the price at the pump they feel the price at the grocery store and it's affecting american families every day and they're not going to have the wound pulled over their eyes congressman westerman it's great to have you on come back soon it's good to see you

like congressman jim Himes from connecticut he sits on the permanent Committee on Intelligence joins me now Connor has been good to have you here and let's talk about the Senate debate about the amendments to the original House bill many in the house they don't want to see these amendments go through so are you thinking that the house majority would acceptable of what's taking place in the Senate well you know as you know it's been years that we worked on this bill the USA freedom bill which passed the house was strong bipartisan support a couple of weeks ago and so it's been disheartening to watch first the miscalculation by leader McConnell which delayed them taking up the the Freedom Act until this past weekend and then of course all of the political grandstanding we saw in the weekend this is very serious stuff we're talking about here in terms of you know surveillance authorities important reforms to the Patriot Act so you know these amendments are not amendments that I think are going to be well received over here on the house they they dial back the reform a little bit it'll obviously be up to individual members to decide whether it dials back reform in such a way as to cause them to go from a yes to a no so frankly my hope is that the amendments are defeated and that we can just take the bill as we passed it out of the house me Mulligan there are these four different amendments that are being debated and discussed so talk about the missing Sunday's deadline really affect national security I mean we've never gotten that close to the deadline concerning the Patriot Act certainly we've never missed it before but just talk about the apathy in Washington to get this done well again it was a disheartening thing to see because we're talking about very serious issues here you know that when you if nothing else and you know our intelligence community and law enforcement have a way of you know keeping us safe regardless of the shenanigans on Capitol Hill but the reality is that there was a period of time there where there was a great deal of uncertainty about who had the authority to do what and the sad thing about that was that it was all because a relatively small number of people and mind you it was the leader Mitch McConnell of the Senate and of course Rand Paul who is running for president you know the reality is that if they just brought us a freedom to the floor of the Senate I do suspect it would pass as it did here so it's the kind of thing that doesn't send a terribly good signal to the rest of the world about how serious we are about matters which at the end of the day our life and death tenneco congressman jim Himes thank you sir for taking time for me I appreciate it thank you coming up

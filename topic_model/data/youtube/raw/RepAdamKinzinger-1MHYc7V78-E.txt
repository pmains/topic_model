but we begin this hour with congressman adam kinziger and the january 6th committee's work so i want to play start by playing for our viewers an excerpt from a new video released by your colleague elaine moria this morning featuring testimony related to president trump's january seventh speech that your committee showed excerpts of during last week's hearing vince wash do you recognize what this is it looks like a copy of a draft of the remarks for that day okay and as you can see throughout the document there are lines crossed out there are some there's some words uh added in do you recognize the handwriting it looks like my father's handwriting in my view he needed to express very clearly that the people who committed violent acts went into the capital did what they did should be prosecuted and should be arrested it looks like here that he crossed out uh that he was directing the department of justice to ensure all lawbreakers are prosecuted to the full extent of the law we must send a clear message not with mercy but with justice legal consequences must be swift and firm do you know why he wanted that crossed out i don't know and that needed to be stated that they did not represent him or or his political views in any form or fashion he also is crossed out i want to be very clear you do not represent me you do not represent our movement do you remember do you know why he crossed that language out of the states i don't know congressman this seems to be more evidence that president trump was pushing back against any condemnation of the rioters the day after the riot what is your interpretation of what what has just been released i mean it's just it's more evidence to the fact that he you know first off sat for three hours not doing nothing but proactively resisting pressure to do something because i believe he wanted to see where this would go it's kind of like well let's let's see how this develops over you know the next what would be three hours and then of course very tepidly only when compelled and when he realized that the the battle for the capital had basically shifted in favor of law enforcement did he come out with very weak statements he still said you know this is what you get when you steal an election at the end of the day on a tweet and then the next day again it's a matter of i don't want to disavow these folks they're fighting for me and by the way to anybody that still believes these conspiracies that it was antifa or fbi directed then obviously president trump loves antifa if that's the case because he's continuing to say these are my people so look this is just more evidence we could have had a five hour hearing actually on thursday but we had to obviously keep that to two two and a half hours and so more evidence will come out and let's talk about jenny thomas because your colleague liz cheney said that you are contemplating subpoenaing her if she does not appear voluntarily how long are you going to wait to try to see whether these talks with her attorney bear fruit yeah i mean that's an attorney to attorney conversation our folks on the committee are very good at knowing when they're being played versus when it's kind of a legitimate negotiation and they will come forward and say if that could we get to that point hey it's time to subpoena you know jenny thomas started out as kind of an interest you know we had a few pieces of evidence that we had seen and then it just grew particularly with some of the eastman memos those conversation reaching out to state electors we want to have a voluntary conversation you know just come on and she said i think somewhere in the media that she was eager to talk to the committee that's it come in let's talk if we need a subpoena we will but we prefer obviously to just find out what she knows but if she is if she said a while ago now that she was eager to talk why is it taking so long to secure her up her cooperation and her appearance that's a question for her and uh for her and the lawyer look it's the same thing you know we heard through anonymous sources that secret service was eager to come in and testify on some of the limo incidents and they haven't come in and you know it's it's it's one thing to to put stuff through anonymous sources or to say something in the media it's another when you have your lawyer saying hey we need to be we need to do this a little differently and so if we have to subpoena we will we're going to get to the bottom of as much as we possibly can and hopefully the department of justice not related to our investigation is looking at whether or not there are potential crimes here and to the secret service and the point that the head of the secret service again reiterated this weekend that they are fully cooperating but they still have not come in they say they can't recover those text messages from january 5th and 6th are you going to try to subpoena their personal phones which apparently have not yet been checked by the ig the homeland security inspector general certainly an issue we're talking about again there's a lot of behind-the-scenes conversations going on we'd much prefer to to get stuff voluntarily it's an interesting question obviously with all these missing texts could it be just simply not keeping records and that management possibly could it be a cover-up possibly we don't know the answer to that you know we we do know that there are some questions out there we do know that when you roll over technology you're required to keep records so we want to get that answer as best we can that's why we've decided we're not going to wrap up the investigation we're going to continue the investigation over the summer even as we begin to write some of the interim report is that the key piece that you want to nail down the secret service cooperation and what happened to those texts you know it's a part i mean there's a lot of again we still have people coming in you know around the edges maybe not as explosive as cassidy hutchinson's testimony for instance but maybe they know a certain piece here we're going to follow up with some witnesses that maybe you know gave us answers that now don't really make a lot of sense with more information that we've gotten so we have a great investigative team that has done a lot of work over the winter leading into these hearings and they're going to continue it over the summer i'm very proud of the team it's been put together and by the way this this moment in congress this committee in congress is something quite historic and unfortunately probably will never happen again in terms of pulling to the direction of justice you've talked a lot you've created a lot of information about what was happening during those 187 minutes nearly just about three hours have you nailed down anything more about the president's communications with rudy giuliani during that period you know what we've presented is is a significant amount of we know the conversation obviously one thing we can't do in subpoena is get what was said over the telephone it's usually what's called call detail records which is who called who how long that lasted obviously if people turn over their text messages we have that so there's probably going to be some information that you know without certain people coming in and telling us the truth will have to be left to a little bit of mystery but what we've presented is i think compelling enough to say the president absolutely knew what was going on and he proactively chose not to defend the article one branch of the constitution and that was a decision that was a decision utterly at odds with the oath he swore to the constitution in terms of any further communications between the president and mark meadows are you any closer to understanding those conversations yeah i mean we we have some understanding uh there's some stuff again that we haven't presented you may see more in the report you may see more in future hearings but i've got to tell you actually first off mark meadows has been one of our star witnesses even though he's not cooperating his initial tranche of texts that he's turned over really led to a lot of what we've learned in the investigation and then as you know he refused to cooperate with the committee after that and we have voted to hold him in contempt and the doj so far has not taken action so i hope they do i hope he decides to come in and voluntarily cooperate but if he doesn't he doesn't and we'll find the information as best we can and you said to reporters after thursday's hearing thursday night's hearing that clearly the president has criminal exposure can you fill in the context of what you think his criminal exposure is and how disappointed you will be if doj doesn't follow up well look as a not lawyer as a not prosecutor i'm going to leave to the doj what reaches that threshold i'll tell you if i looking at what we've presented to the american people if there is not criminality in that understanding that an attempt to overthrow the government was occurring doing nothing behind the scene communications you know some of the stuff we're seeing out of georgia then i don't know what is breaking the law and i'll tell you yes it's very dangerous to prosecute last administrations we don't want to get into that as a habit but if you try a failed coup in this country and you are not prosecuted if there is evidence if the doj can reach that threshold i think that sends for the long-term viability of this republic a very bad message and it sends a road map to future people that want to come along and take advantage of their position as president to try to stay in power nobody's above the law in this country nobody i just want to circle back to the secret service for a moment and with full understanding of all that they do and i've covered the secret service for years with multiple presidents but does it just does it survive the laugh test that they would do this upgrade at that critical moment in history then not follow multiple advisories to save everything which is a standard anyway under the federal records act and then that they would just be missing those two days so is that incompetence in management or is it something worse okay so speaking as a committee member we'll go where the facts lead us on that speaking with my opinion it doesn't pass a laugh test i mean you know looks at was that a department decision was it individual members decision i don't know but it is either gross mismanagement gross incompetence on that case or there's something else there we'll follow the facts on that but i think if you just look at it on its surface it really doesn't make a ton of sense particularly with how you know the federal government is very serious about preserving records and especially on a day if you're the secret service like january 6th it was probably their biggest day frankly since 9 11. congressman adam kinziger thank you very much

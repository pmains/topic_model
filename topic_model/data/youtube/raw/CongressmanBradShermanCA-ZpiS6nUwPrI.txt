month at the fmoc now some in politics on Monday will say that our economy is in such terrible shape that those who make economic policies are obviously incompetent then they'll come back on Wednesday and say it's urgent that we raise interest rates because our economy is may overheat and economic growth could get out of hand only in this room can you juxtapose those two positions we need to allow small business loans I've been told by many bankers if there's a two or three percent risk that a business will go under they can't make the loan Jamie Dimon was sitting where you are now and said well he couldn't find qualified small business borrowers under that standard so he sent his money to London where I was eaten by a whale um it would do a lot for the security of our financial system not and also help our the economy of this country if banks were able to make prime plus three ply and press for loans to businesses that had a little risk and of course provide a reasonable reserve instead I'm told if you don't qualify for prime plus two you leave the office i joined the chair in saying that it's a good idea to tailor your regulations and i would say that the more cities you designate the less significantly you will regulate sophie's and it's the it's the hugest institutions that are really systemic risks but madam sure I want to address the elephant in the room or maybe I should say the stagecoach I remind you that the F sock has the authority to break up the biggest banks and for that for I've said that before in this room people said you must have animus to the true global cities no study microbiology the protozoa reaches a certain size then it divides that's healthy that's normal if a protozoa can divide in a healthy manner you'd think the smallest the smartest mine's on Wall Street could as well too big to fail too big to exist let's look at the elements of that too big to fail is too big not to bail that's why we bailed him out in 2008 too big to fail is too big to jail that's why Eric Holder said he can't indict certain executives and institutions because if he did it would have too big an effect on the economy too big to fail it too big is too big to compete with that's why some studies say they get 80 basis points off their cost of capital it might be less because of the expectation of those providing the capital that if they get in trouble will bail them out but Wells Fargo has identified two additional reasons to break these institutions up because you they created a system where they hired good Americans and turn 5,300 of them into felons two million felonies they failed to monitor the system when they saw that there was a that some individuals had created phony accounts they fired a thousand of us and didn't change the system and didn't fire the executives that created the system that created the first thousand felons still had 5300 phones now from a democratic sighs I say too big to fail is too big to manage from a Republican side I've heard too big to fail is too big to regulate but whether the fault is the regulators who can't regulate it or the managers who can't manage it too big to fail is too big to exist so my question for you is will you seriously consider using your authority as I think you're required to review and consider using your authority will you at least seriously consider breaking up Wells Fargo well we will hold the largest organizations to exceptionally high standards of risk management internal controls consumer protection we expected but you broke Wells Fargo up then instead of trying to hold them up to those really high standards people could choose you know which financial asst to should go with they couldn't they wouldn't pose a systemic risk by saying you're going to hold the giant institutions up to standard something you have not been able to do fit 2 million times 2 million phony accounts so you're saying you're just going to do you're going to continue to do a great job of regulating the too big to fail because you're not going to break them up well we believe it is possible even though it's extremely challenging for organizations to comply you alien phony accounts not detected by the regulators break them up time of the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes the

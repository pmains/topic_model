thanks thanks mr. chairman secretary Darcy nice to see you everyone who's neighborhood whose businesses have not been flooded by the little mill creek other Delaware this year last year we they send their best in there thanks general Bostick very nice to see you how many years of service 38 sir 38 that's pretty remarkable record on behalf of every everyone in this country who you have served for those years continue to serve I just want to thank you for an extraordinary life of service I am I want to start off your very nice to spend some time on the phone with me earlier earlier this this week and if i could i just want to go back to this commission ray these Basin Commission's around the around the country you know butters and me Delaware Delaware Basin Commission is one another is the interstate commission of the Potomac River Basin a third is a Susquehanna River Basin Commission and despite a reiteration in a clarification of congressional intent in wardha i think in 2014 the the Army Corps of Engineers did not provide funding and as you know in either twenty fifteen or twenty sixteen in fact the debate River Basin Commission in our part of the world has not received funding I think 419 to last 20 years I Delaware's the only stated fully funds its share in to the Commission pennsylvania i think in new york and new jersey fun some but but not all just thinking back on our conversation could you just again tell me the status of what we think are fairly clear congressional district is for the army corps to budget and to allocate funds to the three River Basin commissions and why it has not happened and what we might be able to do about it senator within our budget we have a a program that's called planning assistance to States and within that program it is envisioned that the activities of the river Commission's would qualify for that funding however activities of the commission would need to be cost-shared from fifty percent of the the federal input as well as fifty percent from the river commission so if we can identify activity specific to the operation of the commission we would be able to use that funding source if again we could find if the cost share fifty percent from the Commission itself okay about how much money would we be talking about you know I don't know um claiming assistance the states how much is okay the entire line item for planning assistance the states is 2.3 million dollars okay thank you I as you know were worded 2014 version of word on further requires that if the secretary is not it does not allocate funds for a given fiscal year the secretary shall submit a notice explaining describing why funds were not allocated and to my knowledge no report has been provided and I would just ask if he could tell us why that report was not provided to Congress but the report wasn't provided because i think it's viewed that within this planning assistance to states fundings dream that there would be the ability to fund some of the river commissions sorry thank you we talked a bit about the the most recent storm that's come up the atlantic coast i described we always compared to a storm that occurred in 1962 I was not in Delaware at the times and a kid I think somewhere but the whenever people talk about damages to the the beaches Maryland Delaware North talk about the storm in 1962 we had a bad storm a couple of weeks ago we had about a month or two ago and a lot of snow in many places including here but we had huge wins we had winds sustained winds 50 knots as up to as much as 60 70 knots which is I was nor'easter dead did a whole lot of damage the good news is it did not damage did I describe each communities from Fenwick Island up to louis with beach was it was saved dewey Bethenny because of the work up by the Army Corps of Engineers I should just stop here right here and say we valued very deeply our relationship with the Army Corps of Engineers region 3 Philadelphia and also in Baltimore at wonderful people their civilian and military we love working with them and there are so responsive and thoughtful and really very creative very creative sorry we're grateful for that but I want to we're in a situation where we need to restore the dunes that are protected and saved these beach communities including one that you've spent some time in as I've ally in our lives the Predators won't ask it you think it might be possible to direct a portion of the remaining emergency funds from superstorm sandy disaster appropriations legislation toward the corrs flood control and coastal emergency account perhaps through an amendment to word up later this spring senator that um we're currently evaluating the damages from that storm and looking to RF FCC any account for what might be available they are to be able to repair that damage the the appropriations bill for Sandy money is pretty specific that the damages have to have been caused by superstorm sandy so I'm not optimistic that we'd be able to use those funds without some kind of legislative direction good just one last quick question in terms of the remaining funds from superstorm sandy that have not been obligated or used would you just refresh my memories of how much that is I'm thinking 5.4 billion half of which has been used half not has not been obligated but I mean it may be mistaken general Bostick do you know we fused about a billion out of the five billion most of the larger projects are yet to come are there the authorized but not constructed projects okay well let's let's continue to have this conversation but thank you very much thanks for joining us today thank you both for your service good to see you thank you

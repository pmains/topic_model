we are coming up on three years to the start of the pandemic really if you look about where covet you know first made it to the United States we're almost we're almost there we know a lot like the vaccine doesn't actually keep you from getting covered or spreading covid but that doesn't stop Joe Biden so this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated the unvaccinated not the vaccinated the unvaccinated that's the problem and so everybody talks about freedom and not to have a to have a shot or have a test well guess what and so how about patriotism how about making sure that you're vaccinated so you do not spread the disease to anybody else what about that what's the big deal the big deal is it doesn't work it doesn't work and he keeps saying it virtually every covert death in America is preventable virtually everyone almost everyone who will die from covert this year will not be up to date on their shots or they will not have taken Pax lovid when they got sick so we know it doesn't stop you from getting or spreading it but the president is still trying to scare you my first guest this is my first guest represents Georgia's 9th Congressional District representative Andrew Clyde thanks for joining us uh Andrew thank you for having me it's great to be with you okay Biden keeps saying that Democrats are bringing down the price of prescription drugs because they're sticking it to the pharmaceutical companies well here we are three years later and they're still saying go get vaccinated let's funnel billions more to the pharmaceutical companies uh I tell you you know the president doesn't know how to tell the truth here I mean you know your Clips just showed that uh that the President says that if you get vaccinated you won't get covered and you won't spread covet in and you need to be patriotic excuse me that's not being patriotic uh you know Patriot patriotism is defending Liberty and Liberty doesn't mean medical tyranny uh you know the president just again doesn't know how to tell the truth here yeah he's fear-mongering I guess the Democrats think that this is a good for them prior to uh November the 8th but um what they need to understand is that the American people that's not what they care about they care about inflation they care about security they care about um uh you know reducing crime they care about economic issues that impact them individually you know the president needs to figure out what message he's actually delivering is the pandemic over like he said a few weeks ago or is it the greatest National Emergency you know the world has ever seen which is about what he said last night yeah and that and it doesn't we know we know it doesn't stop you from getting go to spreading it and what's even more what happened to my body my choice you know pushing back on government trying to make decisions about our bodies the Democrats forgot all about that it doesn't fit their narrative Andrew I mean you know their narrative when it comes to abortion is my body my choice but when it comes to vaccination it's you will do what the government demands that you do you will yield you know you will be submissive uh and that's just not what America's all about we fight for liberty we fight for individualism we fight for our right to make our decisions uh and um and preserve life protect life and that's not what big government socialism is all about but that's what they're about I would just like somebody to ask Joe Biden why do you keep telling us to take something that clearly doesn't work and I'm sorry eyes they haven't named it the Trump vaccine yet because you know little you know little uh history here first the Democrats said led by Biden Harris Joe Biden said he wouldn't take it kamalara said she wouldn't take it they wouldn't take it because of Donald Trump as soon as they declared Victory they changed their minds now everybody has to take it but we found out that it wasn't as effective as we all thought it was but still there's scaremongering get in line for your ninth booster oh oh absolutely but you know uh it doesn't seem to to impact them when something doesn't work I mean what Joe Biden has been doing to the economy doesn't work but yet they're going down the same path over and over and over again the fact that it doesn't work doesn't seem to affect the Democrats whatsoever I mean let's talk about the Border real quick because that's another thing we're back and forth on title 42 during the lockdown we were told we couldn't go out if we did we had to wear a mask we had a socially distance our kids weren't allowed to go to school we're going to get into that Gretchen Whitmer now is all of a sudden saying I didn't lock down the schools you have Charlie Chris saying no no Rhonda stand is locked down the schools but they never stopped the flow of people coming across the border as soon as Joe Biden became president of the United States He said how the heck with that title 42 stuff come on in so non-citizens can move freely about the country Americans had to stay put oh we are seeing a record number of illegal aliens coming across the southern border I mean just this year the the uh the border patrol are put out their stats which came out Friday night I think they tried to hide it in the news dump on Friday night but we are seeing two point almost 2.4 million illegal alien encounters this fiscal year alone that's the most number that have ever been recorded I mean ever been recorded and then you have over 600 000 gotaways you have almost 198 people on the terrorist watch list that the border patrol has caught trying to cross our border not to mention those that they didn't catch I mean this is a wide open border this is lawlessness at the border and the Biden Administration doesn't seem to care one little bit about it uh you know it's it's bringing uh it's bringing every Community down to the Border making every Community a border community and bringing illegal aliens across that are are doing nothing but damage to this country and we need to stop that and we will stop that and I was just going to say that can you outline some of the things Congress a new Congress can do come January uh with hopefully the Republicans taking the Senate as well um we have a history you know the Republicans republican-led Congress refuse to build the border wall when Donald Trump was president what could Republicans do this time with a Democrat president well I will tell you that um one of the four pillars of our commitment to America is a nation that's secure and part of that is creating a strong infrastructure across the southern border part of that infrastructure is going to be the border wall and it's also going to be increasing the number of border patrol agents it's going to be making sure that the remain in Mexico policy is is put back in place because that is what has been helping us significantly to keep illegal aliens out of America out of the United States and that's why what the Congress can do and we can do it through the article one authority of the purse we have the checkbook we can fund what we want to fund and we will not fund what we don't want to fund and that is bringing illegal aliens into the United States the funding for that has to cease as soon as we regain Authority as soon as the Republicans take back Congress and what a crazy idea if my choice is between funding programs for American citizens or non-citizens even if I disagree with the funding I would take American citizens first I know crazy America first

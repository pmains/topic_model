all right so he has said that the senate impeachment trial for president trump is doa dead on arrival he wanted to put his colleagues also on the record to show how they would likely vote in fact 45 senators did vote against proceeding with that impeachment trial and the senator from kentucky who led that effort joins us now senator rand paul good morning to you before we get to that though we want to talk about senator patrick leahy we know he was hospitalized for a bit last night he's set to preside over the trial have you spoken to him how's he doing i haven't but i've heard good things i've always been friends with pat leahy he's one even though he comes from the left he and i have worked together on civil liberties issues over time i still don't think it's appropriate even though i'm friends with him for him to be presiding over at trial though it's one of my points i made yesterday was that if the chief justice can't bother to walk across the street it means this really is an invalid trial they're trying a private citizen that means you or i could be impeached in private life they're not trying a president if they were trying a president the chief justice is supposed to come over he says he's no longer the president that was my point this isn't a constitutional procedure it's a political one yeah you've said many times this trial is illegal you've caught it a sham all but five of your republican colleagues agreed why else do you feel this is unconstitutional well the thing is is there's the idea of whether or not we should impeach a former president whether that's good for the country whether it's wise whether it heals the country or whether it divides us further there's also the specific question of whether or not they're saying oh he incited a surre insurrection and caused all this violence well if you look at the speech carefully he said go fight for your country and i asked yesterday on the senate floor if you're a democrat and you've never given a speech that says go fight for your country figuratively raise your hand and i didn't see any hands going out because every politician in the land has used that type of word fighting figuratively but the other thing is is about violence in specific i was at the ball field when the bernie sanders supporter nearly killed steve scalise nearly killed a few others that were with us that day one of the staffers was 10 feet from me who was shot but the democrats were using insightful words like the demo republican plan for health care is you get sick and then you die this was inciting to violence but not one of us thought bernie sanders was responsible for that violence in fact we took great care to be careful with our language that we didn't blame him for the shooting that almost killed steve scalise i don't think democrats are being very careful though they're just sort of you know them plus their allies in the media are just saying oh yeah um donald trump calls his violence well if you look at his language he never encouraged violence and the people had some crazy people there who did commit violence and they deserve to be punished but the thing is is i don't think democrats are being fair here they're being political and i think it's a bitter a bitterness that they won't give up on the election this is one more continued sort of uh bitter ranker that's coming from the election i think it's a big mistake for the country let me tell you what senate majority leader chuck schumer has said he said quote it makes no sense whatsoever that a president or any official could commit a heinous crime against our country and then be permitted to resign so as to avoid accountability and a vote to disbar them from further office what is your response to senator schumer well that's assuming that there was a crime that's the whole debate did he commit a crime so did bernie sanders commit a crime when he said you're going to die and then somebody went up and shot you know 20 or 30 of us on the ball field did cory booker commit a crime when he said get up in their face you know get up in the face of these congress people did maxine waters commit a crime when she said get together in a group invade restaurants when the trump official show and and mob them did kamala harris commit a crime when she said to people who were burning down our cities that she would pay for their bail you know there's a lot of politicians who get involved with things and by extension violence occurs are they all responsible and so that's the real question they want to impeach bernie sanders kamala harris cory booker no they don't want because they've got a double standard um but schumer's just assuming that that he's guilty of something that there's no evidence that the president said anything that encouraged violence and senator paul i appreciate you staying with us we are going to continue our conversation with you some of our stations though across the country are going to take a quick break to go to weather and traffic but you're going to stay here with us for those folks who want to watch this interview it's going to be on our facebook page as well as online on twitter as well as instagram very quickly right now it seems that senate minority leader mitch mcconnell relented on the filibuster stalemate uh as we know he had this still mate with senator schumer because he says he got assurances from west virginia democrat joe manchin and arizona senator kirsten cinema can you trust democrats will not try to vote to get rid of this filibuster though no i think they may someday but it's good news for now and i think it's important for the american public to know that when we were in the majority senator mcconnell myself and others we supported the filibuster which is supporting the rights of the minority it supports the rights of the minority not to be run over by the majority and it ensures compromise in our country and we took the principal position even though it would have been easier in the majority to get rid of it president trump asked us to get rid of the filibuster to make it easier to get his agenda he would get it by simple majority without getting sixty votes principal resisted that so we resisted it it's good that there are at least two democrats who are principled in resisting it now will they stay with it only time will tell senator paul you had an interesting exchange with abc's george stephanopoulos i want to show our folks at home a little bit of that real quick and i won't be cowed by people saying oh you're a liar that's the problem with the media today is they say all republicans are liars and everything we say is a lie there are two sides to every story interview somebody on the other side but don't insert yourself into the story to say we're all liars because there's some friends there are not two there are not two sides of the story this has been looked at in every single state the other oh sure you're forgetting who you are you're forgetting who you are as a journalist if you think there's only one side you're inserting yourself into the story to say i'm a liar what was your thoughts after that exchange what's funny i put that in in contra distinction to our interview just a minute ago instead of telling me your opinion you gave me chuck schumer's opinion and then i responded to it that's traditional journalism that's the way it's supposed to work but the journalist is not supposed to say oh there is no other side of the story and you're a liar this is the problem with the left and it's becoming such that whether you're on social media or anything else they're going to ban you if you have an opinion they don't like we have 10 seconds right we have 10 seconds senator paul what do you think is the future of the republican party what do i think is the say again the future the future of the republican party i think we're always redefining ourselves the party's an empty vessel unless we imbue it with values we aren't the party of one person i've had many disagreements with uh donald trump and will continue to but i've supported the party and supported the idea that we are the party of less regulation less government less debt and i'll continue to try to shape the party in that future all right senator rand paul thanks for joining us

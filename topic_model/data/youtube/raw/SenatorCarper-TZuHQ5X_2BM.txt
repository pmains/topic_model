madam president i i respect the views of my colleagues i respect the views of this colleague especially and he knows that we don't always agree on everything or even maybe most things but i think it's important that we be able to find ways to disagree without being disagreeable and i understand that the senior senator from utah is here today because he disagrees with a particular policy that is certainly his uh right that's his prerogative he's welcome to freely register his views as we all are for instance we have heard our friend from utah defend the principle of limited government and our system of federalism federalism on this floor many times um i've heard him and others colleagues of ours argue of passion that the federal government should not be in the business of interfering in state or local matters and yet here we are as our republican colleagues try to tell a local government that once again what it can and cannot do my friend from utah has introduced a resolution that seeks to overturn a law passed by the duly elected council of the district of columbia and madam president i'm not here to debate the merits of this law after all i was not elected by the people living in the district of columbia in fact no one as far as i know in this room was elected by the people of the district of columbia but the reason that these senators have the ability to try to overturn a law passed by the local d.c government is because the over 700 thousand individuals who call the district of columbia home continue to be denied full representation in in congress in fact we died any representation here in the united states senate under current law congress reviews all legislation passed by the d.c council before it can become law the district of columbia is not allowed to even control its own budget the mayor of d.c cannot even deploy the men and women of the national guard in case of an emergency right that every other state executive can utilize if this were the case for any other state or local government there would rightfully be an outcome outcry rather an outcry from the citizens of that state or local government i don't believe that our colleague from utah would take kindly to me or any of us uh in this body telling the city council and say salt lake city city with just under 200 000 residents what laws he could or could not pass and he'd be right he'd be right luckily the people of salt lake city have a senator who has come to washington speaks his mind on the senate floor and votes to vote to advance the interest of not just salt lake city citizens but the rest of utah as well i think that's really at its essence all that the people of washington d.c are looking for for me the the issue of bc statehood is not a democratic or republican issue it's a simple issue of basic fairness for a nation whose founding mantra no taxation without representation inspired the longest running experiment in democracy we should all be concerned that today more than seven hundred thousand tax paying americans over two thirds of whom are people of color continue to be denied a vote here in this body our nation's capital is home to more than just monuments and museums it is a home to american families who go to work to americans who start businesses to americans who pay their taxes americans serve our country in times of war and peace and to americans who are still denied representation again it's a home to veterans and service members who have signed up to protect our freedoms who have risked their lives for our country and are still denied the ability to have a say in our nation's future it is home to the hundreds of capital police officers who come to work every day at a nation's capital to keep us safe and are still denied a vote in the very institution they protect for generations those who call the district of columbia home have been denied the right to fully participate in our democracy and that's why we're here today that's why my republican our republican colleagues can call this vote to silence the decision made by the local leaders that d.c residents have voted into office and that's why they can exercise this federal overreach here today i sat at the beginning of my remarks madam president that my colleagues and i don't always agree on everything but we do agree on quite a bit but i strongly agree and want to associate myself with the words of senator mike lee and i think it was 2018 just a couple of years ago and he said then and and i quote we should allow each unique community to develop unique solutions according to unique local preferences and leave it at that we just repeat that we should allow each unique community to develop unique solutions according to unique local preferences and leave it at that i could not agree more and i think it's incumbent upon all of us who care deeply for our democracy and the rights of all americans to take up the cause of our fellow citizens in the district of columbia and use our voices to call out this historic injustice and finally right this run and with that i stand opposed to senator lee's joint resolution and i yield the floor

and closer to home the number of unemployed veterans remained stubbornly high the wall street journal says it's over 10 percent now senator tim kaine plans to introduce a bill he hopes will help cut that rate the aim is to make it easier for veterans to transition their military skills to civilian use senator cain is joining us now to talk about his first bill to be introduced and we're glad to have you thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule great to come we're talking about transferable job skills but when you think about military skills you think of of specialized training talk about how um give us an example right absolutely of how this might play out in your bill somebody securing what they need to to move their skills from military to civilians so the way the way i came up with this idea and it's being talked about a lot now is during the campaign i would meet somebody who had been a battlefield medic would leave the military go to veteran status and say you know why don't i be a nurse or a physician's assistant and they would be told you get no credit for your military service go back and take course one to get your physician's assistant degree somebody who'd operated heavy machinery go back and get a commercial driver's license somebody who was an aviation mechanic you get no credit for that go back to school to learn how to maintain aircraft engines well that's what i've been doing for the last 20 years so i heard that again and again and it occurred to me diane that in an all voluntary uh army military when people leave the military and they go to the workforce somebody will say to them we're glad you served but they won't understand the skills that they have what technical skills what leadership training so if we can take the specialties the military specialties that people obtain when they're in service and every time they get a skill get the civilian credential that matches a commercial driver's license physician's assistant degree welding certificate get the commer the credential that matches it then when they get ready to leave they're not just bringing in a military rank they're bringing in a credential that's understood by civilian workforce that is the long-term goal the bill that i have uh talked about today called the troop talent act of 2013 would do three things it would first increase information from the employers to the military to service members about what these military specialists are and in civilian terms here's a skill somebody has if they've done this job second it would it would police the way credentials are given out to people and make sure their beneficials that really work in the market not that somebody's going to get charged to take a test and get a piece of paper that's worthless and finally in one field information technology it's good for virginia because we have thousands of jobs in virginia that are going wanting because we don't have trained information technology folks and so many people in the military are so skilled in technology make sure they're excited about this but what about business businesses i mean their their bottom line uh concern is competitiveness sure making sure that this person this veteran that they're considering for a position uh is is a good fit for the company and doesn't come with some liabilities or badges how do you convince companies that this is a good thing to get involved you do it two ways first you show them that people have the skill so this morning i was at fort lee um folks going through the ordinance school there go through many of them an 18-week program to learn to do machinery machinists and welding and they get a certificate from a these american welding society that is a very valid certificate understood around the the country you first show an employer that somebody's got the skill and second if you're in the military you know dedication teamwork willingness to sacrifice you know work ethic all those things are taught in a very significant way uh the employer doesn't have to teach those skills themselves they've got somebody who's already done it and demonstrated that they'll sacrifice for the good of the greater and that's the exactly the kind of employees people 90 days on the job already and you're already knee-deep in in making things introducing your first new build and also with the sequester cut yeah it's the sequester cuts are tough i mean in a different way i was with military members yesterday in hampton roads military family members saying we're going to see that being stopped though i hope we we had a bill in the senate that had more than 50 votes to stop it completely the other side chose to filibuster it so we couldn't get that passed at the end of march we just passed the senate budget uh march 23rd that basically changes the sequester instead of across the board cuts that make no sense let's do targeted cuts let go of programs that we don't need rather than furloughing you know the army hospitals that are treating wounded warriors getting furloughed that it just makes no sense we ought to do the better senator thank you so much for joining us absolutely

thanks mr. Chairman I want to commend and thank you for for your leadership by I want to especially commend those who spent what was 61 meetings with with you and trying to define a way to a bipartisan the proposal I won't express my thanks to all of our colleagues on this committee in the interest of accuracy is 61 hours I'm sorry all right I have felt like many many more I'm sure it did I I want to especially thank our staff finance committee staff Democrat and Republican as well as our personal staff for the enormous effort in time that they've invested in this process and all those that have come before us and the course of this year and last year before I joined the committee to give us the the benefit of their input I believe that with the passage of this bill or something close to it will begin to move to transform the health care system today that costs more than any on earth does not provide better outcomes results in some 14,000 people losing coverage every day leaves odor of over 40 million people without coverage and puts American companies at enormous competitive disadvantage with their business rivals around the world there many facets of health reforms that are necessary an integral in adopting sound health reform policy but I want to make if I could today special reference to three that have been major priorities for for me and I know for some of our colleagues one of those is raining in the growth of health care costs the second is moving away from fee for service delivery system and the third is encouraging wellness and incentivizing healthy behaviors more healthy behaviors I believe that at July sixteenth 2009 was a game changer and debate on health care reform on that date senator Conrad is chairman the Budget Committee of the Senate asked CBO director Doug Elmendorf if any of the health care reform bills up to that point rained in the growth of health care costs as I recall dr. elmendorf replied no and went on to say that health care bills up to that point significantly expanded the federal responsibility for health care costs on that day in July we did not yet have a Finance Committee package to examine we now have a Finance Committee package we've heard back from CBO on that package we heard that our package would expand health insurance coverage to ninety-four percent of Americans up from eighty-three percent today we heard that our package is a whole cost some 829 billion dollars over the next 10 years significantly lower than the other reform proposals in Congress and I might add fully offset fully paid for in fact it provides a net surplus I believe of 81 billion dollars over the next 10 years and over the next 10 years beyond that surplus added of much as eight hundred billion dollars I made it clear to my colleagues in to all who will listen that I'm not interested in voting for a bill that increases our national debt and it does not begin to rein in the growth of health care costs over the last several months I've become convinced that one key piece of reforming our health care system is moving away from our current payment structure of fee for service of you that i think is widely shared by others on this committee the current payment structure of paying health providers for each Health Service a day provide stifles collaboration surprises efficient care management in many instances during the visit that I've shared with all of our colleagues about about a month ago to the Cleveland Clinic and nonprofit healthcare delivery system it's moved away from fee-for-service and now pays its doctors of salary I saw firsthand what can be accomplished when we move away from fee-for-service when we create a patient-centered model of care that focus on primary care prevention and wellness management managing chronic diseases and harnessing information technology the delivery of healthcare although we can do more our finance committee bill takes a number of important first steps and moving away from our current payment structure one of the provisions in our finance package that many of us believe can be a game-changer in this regard is the creation of CMS's Innovation Center and later today I'll ask dr. elmendorf to talk with us a bit more about that but the innovation centers purpose will be to test evaluate and expand different payment structures and models which aim to foster patient-centered care and to improve quality in addition to reining in the growth of health care costs and moving away from FIFA sir is I believe that encouraging wellness and incentivizing healthy behaviors are critical to reform we know that if we incentivize people to take better care of themselves we can rein in the growth of our health care costs as well and recent findings have shown us that the biggest factor contributing to most people's health status is their behavior our behavior in roughly forty percent of our health status i'm told is a direct result of our choices about food and physical activity another twenty percent is a direct result of social and physical environments such as our homes in the places where we work that means for most people the way that we eat the way we drink the way we exercise or don't as well as our work in home environments shape as much as sixty percent of our underlying health status today it's pleased to work during markup with Senator Edison and to a fashion a bipartisan amendment that will better enable employers to incentivize employees to address some of the major causes of poor health that lead to higher health care costs what are they smoking obesity high cholesterol high blood pressures among others let me conclude by saying none of us is suggesting that our committees proposal is perfect but I do believe that represents an important next step and today I hope that we will report out of committee of finance package that will provide us with the foundation as we move forward merge to health care bills in the Senate the American people are counting on us we cannot afford to let them down thank you

well welcome to another act talk with doc show i'm here in las vegas nevada at the safari club international's uh 50th anniversary celebration we have a special guest here today with us former secretary of the interior ryan zinke ryan welcome great to be with you to ag talk with doc show here um just for my listeners just a little bit of background on secretary zinke was born and raised in montana absolutely went off to college in oregon played for the ducks and that's an and uh an undersized center i've been told well i i played with daffy duck on the side of my head before phil knight with the check so i didn't have all the big o's and stuff but it was a great experience yeah and then you joined the navy yeah and like a 20 plus year career in the military yep a navy seal still team six and still team one what was the differences between those two teams well is that top secret well they're all officially we say there's no seal team six at all that group has a responsibility the national counterterrorism team we've seen the last wars uh heavy concentration heavy use of the seals across the board and special forces so uh my last tour was i was a special forces commander okay and i can tell you i was never the best jumper diver explosive expert in seals but i always knew who was my art was i surrounded myself with just unbelievable patriots uh very aggressive uh very competitive among the seals but i had the opportunity to work alongside special forces and rangers and god bless them because it's not an easy vocation but they do it magnificent so you finished a career in the military you ran and became the congressman from montana and then you got a phone call from president trump to be secretary of the interior take us on the inside of that what was it like to be interviewed by president trump and and what was his mantra his goal what did he want out of the secretary of interior in when you were working with them well it was anyway i'm the only secretary that brought my wife in for the interview because my wife had been on the trump campaign before she was on the congressional spouse's bus and helping the president and my wife had actually had been to new york at trump's office before uh the interview was supposed to be about 30 minutes it ended up being extended uh he's very very quick on the read uh some barrage of questions and it's kind of funny at the end of the interview most of it was about national defense mostly in my wheelhouse right very little a conversation was about interior and uh and i was getting that because what about the va i looked at him because sir you don't hate me that much because the va is a behemoth right a lot of work in the va and it needs reform from from ground zero but interior we got an enormous amount done and accomplished interior uh energy component we went from 8.3 million barrels a day in declining in just two years we were the largest producer of oil and gas of energy right and i'm not a fossil fuel centric i'm just american energy center there you go that i spent as a seal i spent most of my career fighting for other people's energy right and quite frankly i don't want your kids your grandchildren to ever see what i've seen so it is better to produce in the united states it's environmentally better to produce energy in this country under our regulations and washington produced overseas and in ag we're watching fertilizer fertilizer prices go through the roof and a lot of it because we don't have the capacity we have the resources but we don't have the capacity to produce in this country and it is a national security uh issue not to have the fertilizers here because we're being held hostage once again from foreign entities right so as in kansas we don't have the public lands that you do in montana and across the nation and as i become a congressman senator i found out i don't know is a third of our energy uh come from public lands it's it's a significant amount and then the same thing with the mining fertilizer prices back home have quadrupled from the the nitrogen-based products the phosphates the pod ashes have doubled and just talk a little bit more about what the secretary of interior could do to help drive down those prices a little bit just you know the access to mining and and just what are the challenges right now to get in that mining industry well first of all on public lands there's no greater stewards than those in agriculture whether it's our ranchers or farmers they understand the importance of stewardship of land i've never been an advocate for selling or transferring public land but i'm an advocate for management and public land is for the public's use and access and we increased access for hunting millions of acres recreation but public lands on on the multiple use scheme which teddy roosevelt can show put in place so we benefit from it right we also have to look at our national strategic outlook and things like oil energy and pot ash we have enormous resources in this country but the permitting process needs to be expedited and look there's some places to mine or some place is not but let's make the decision early and do it the right way yep and in the government what often happens when we're in an interior uh a really short story uh you have a trout and a salmon in the same stream okay upstream you might have forest service holding downstream you might have dams if you look at our how we manage this in a federal government the trout are managed by the fish and wildlife service interior the salmon are managed by department of commerce uh the dam system and water is managed by either the either department of interior through reclamation or army corps of engineers or both forest service property the subsurface is managed by the forest service from department of ag subsurfaces blm through bureau of land management through department of interior so you have multiple agencies with multiple tasks under multiple leaderships with multiple missions managing the same stream and this is on the permitting process in the trump administration we looked at reorganizing making the permit system more joint so someone that wants to develop or mine or use public land doesn't have to do a labyrinth of years and years and years for a permit and waste money let's make the decision either yes or no in a compacted area to sell things like fertilizer as a national priority and it shouldn't be yeah there's there's there's no more important thing than making sure there's there's food on the table across america and the shelves are are full what's driving the cost as you know is elevated uh natural gas elevated energy costs and we're going to have to look at the supply chain and make sure that america cannot be held hostage on fertilizer and those key components that drive our economy there you go i want to turn and talk drill down a little bit more into montana fish ranching and farming and the connection with kansas to me is cattle you all raise a lot of cattle and those cattle are those those calves young heifers and steers end up in kansas that are feedlots in our packing plants how does um access to those federal lands impact grazing i think that it just blows me away how much federal grazing there is as well well and it's interesting a lot of the problem that i see is you have dc and this is where the president and i disagree i said well this is the swamp this is mr president i'm i'm secretary of interior america has a lot of beautiful swamps we have swamps in louisiana and mississippi and the carolinas dc is not a swamp of the sewer it's a super everybody no i've already branded it but yeah okay what part of the problem is in in the case of of use of land of public land when the decision emanates from dc i mean how does dc think they can manage the yellowstone river when they don't know where it is when their only context of yellowstone is a very good kevin costner series there you go but you know living out there and using the using the lands correctly and make sure there's traditional use that's so important but when these decisions are to lessen the ability to graze and leases for traditional use on our food stuffs you know you're exactly right montana raises a lot of feeder cattle we send them down to do nebraska or kansas and that's a critical component of our food source and so public lands is so incredibly important in this country but we have to use them wisely and we have to be stewards and watch these catastrophic forest fires or in some cases down in the in the breadbasket you know you have these grass fires some of them have been on public land but a lot of it has been from not taking care of the land not removing the dead and dying timber these forest fires don't do prescribed burns late in the season right rather than these catastrophic uh burns in mid-season it affects everything it destroys habitat destroys uh watershed which is important in a legacy and in public lands again belongs to us all and we have to take care of them great ryan i want to ask you a personal question now i want to go back to the summer of 2017. okay on june the 13th i finished vote steve scalise grabs me and says hey let's go visit ryan let's go to his office credible office we got to see your pocket knife collection your knife collection and some of the trophy animals that you've had the pleasure steve and i had a great time visiting you the next morning steve scalise was shot and you helped save his life and some people don't really know this part of the story can you kind of tell me what was going through your mind that june 14th morning and and what you did to move into action to help steve well it was actually a u.s park police helicopter that and it wasn't me per se but it was uh interior asset is they minor and what they heard on the emergency band was that there was an officer down and so what they did is they they diverted a helicopter and when steve was transferred you know dc traffic was terrible and he was bleeding out and it had it not been for the diversion of that helicopter on the initiative of of the pilots and they transferred him from basically a freeway over the hospital otherwise it would have bled out and it was just the actions of the u.s park boys you know spontaneous uh and god was looking out for steve oh my goodness and we're all glad to see his recovery uh he was tough but yeah i think with that thank god for a u.s park police helicopter and the initiative of the guys on the ground yeah he showed up at the hospital at the blood pressure of zero i thought he was gone if it hadn't been for brad winston's efforts to put some tourniquets on that's right a military guy military experience all throughout the the park service there people knowing what to do and making the right decision well and brad you know here is just god's grace that brad is a fine physician exactly he understands in a military and he understands trauma and and he was on it but it was a tragic day and it should give us pause i think the biggest threat face in this country it's not russia it's not china it's not even iran it's the division of most countries we can't hate our neighbor and in montana you know if a barn is on fire same thing in kansas you don't ask if it's republican or democrat you just go put it out right and if the barn door is broke you don't burn down the bar and you fix the door so we have issues in this country that we need to fix we have no border we have high inflation it's robbing everybody and the hatred and the division in this country has become a distraction to getting things done so we're going to have to address you know let's not hate our neighbor let's rally on the principles and character that has made this country great limited government self-determination the government should not tell you what to do or what to become and protection the constitutional freedoms and that's all the constitutional freedoms if you don't like the constitution there's a process there's amendments great amendments over history of time women now can vote yep but it's it's our country and we rise and fall as americans together if this country fails and it could if the division continues then then america will will end at least the america that we love and so i'm i'm a little bit of a cheerleader saying it's fixable it is totally fixable but it's up to american people to grab the bull by the horns and and say let's get rid of the hate to solve the problems and we have to solve them as a nation there you go ryan thank you for joining us thanks for coming to ag talk with doc and my folks back home you'll see why he was a great congressman he was a great secretary of interior and we look forward to having you back in dc soon what's good the fertilizer why the price is down and uh that's make farming great again there we go thanks everybody

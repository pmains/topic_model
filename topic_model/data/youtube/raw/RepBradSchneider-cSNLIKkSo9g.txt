Curren I want to associate myself marks my colleague from Illinois this is a win for American workers for their families for their communities for our nation as a whole I want to thank chairman Neal and ranking member Brady for the working group and in particular our staff who worked so hard tirelessly to bring this deal forward the u.s. MCA legislation before us today is the result of many months of hard-fought negotiations between Congress and the administration and it is a true victory for working people in our country compared to the initial version of the agreements shared by the White House last year the improved trade agreement before us today includes markedly stronger protections for American workers and crucially serious enforcement mechanisms that ensure ensure all parties will follow the agreement agreement well I believe the agreement includes higher standards to preserve our environment I do regret the administration was unwilling to make any commitments to address the very real and pressing issues of climate change nevertheless the u.s. MCA is a major step forward for American workers and businesses fighting to compete in an increasingly interconnected world it also puts to rest the president's threat to pull out of NAFTA without this certainty of a replacement a testament to the hard-fought negotiations is the backing of this agreement from stakeholders as diverse as the afl-cio and the United States Chamber of Commerce I support the passage of the u.s. MCA implementing language and urge my colleagues to do the same with that I yield back

i'm concerned and i am uh glad to hear that the residents of north dakota were so concerned i think the country has had a real wake-up call in the wake of kovid where we learned that little things like mass gowns and gloves the chinese government threatens to shut them off can become a national security concern and in this case you are seeing the chinese buy up america they are buying up major tracts of land not just in north dakota but also in texas also near an air force base and in other locations they're buying up our food supply major chicken and pork producers they're buying up key energy producers and then of course they're pouring that money into their massive military buildup uh but the the my question is why is it the committee on foreign investment in the department of justice and across the biden administration why aren't they taking a closer look at this this is what the senators were demanding and why aren't they putting a stop to it and some of those cases i just listed they looked at it and then approved it that's unacceptable and when you see republicans take back the congress this november you are going to see us take a much tougher stand on the chinese communist party they are waging an economic war on the united states and they are looking to win that war before there's ever any type of military conflict

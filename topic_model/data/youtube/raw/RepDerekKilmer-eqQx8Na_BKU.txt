Thank You mr. speaker folks in their rural communities of my region don't want our top export to be our kids with that in mind we're we're going to make sure that the timber industry can grow in a way that doesn't put conservation at odds with job creation earlier this week I joined a summit on the Olympic Peninsula to talk and strategize around cross laminated timber and other mass timber products with local businesses and government and community leaders we discussed how these mass timber products can utilize an abundant and sustainable resource while building on a workforce and infrastructure that sets our region apart and can give the nation greener buildings construction sites around the country could student use sturdy innovative renewable wood products grown and manufactured on the Olympic Peninsula as agriculture secretary tom vilsack said at a sawmill and Aberdeen recently this is how we've got to do business working together and finding common ground is the only way forward working together we can develop timber 2.0 innovate and build opportunities in rural communities and make sure that Washington State leads the way and with that I yield back the balance of my time

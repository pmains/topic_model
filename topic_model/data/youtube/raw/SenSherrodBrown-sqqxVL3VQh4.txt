go ahead Thank You chairman thank you for doing this this hearing thank you all for joining us I want to thank Senator Hasson for her questions on opioids 11 people a day die in my state from opioid addiction and there is a there is a responsibility shared more widely than we sometimes say I I so appreciate chairman Grassley's yes-or-no questions and I appreciated the seven of you going along with this yes or no and I would like to ask a series of yes-or-no questions and please keep it to yes or no they really are yes-or-no questions mr. Gonzales start with you is it true that pharmaceutical industry benefits from US taxpayer funded research yes sir it is yes yes across each of you yes yes yes sir Frasier yes okay thank you is it true that no other nation invest more taxpayer dollars in basic research that directly and indirectly benefits the industry yes yes yes yes I'm gonna sort understood the question is it true that that that no other nation on earth invests more taxpayer dollars in basic research yes is he proportional to GDP senator I'm not asking that that was close enough thank you is it true that the u.s. allows drug companies to dole to - that the US government allows drug companies the longest period of exclusivity on drugs biologics I'm sorry on biologics mr. Gonzalez I believe that's true yes that's true yes yes yes yes we know Medicare limits prices with doctors and hospitals is it true that Medicare cannot negotiate to lower prices with drug companies that is true directly yes yes yes other agents work on their behalf to negotiate but they do not negotiate directly yes they can't negotiate not directly yes thank you yes is a true US taxpayer subsidized pharmaceutical advertising and marketing activities through the tax codes business expense deduction mr. Gonzalez yes yes yes yes no different from any other advertisement yes thank you we note the United States is the world's largest market for pharmaceuticals is it true that we pay the highest in the overwhelming number of cases is it true that we pay the highest drug prices in the world mr. Gonzalez the average government price would that would not be the case no no that that we as Americans individually pay the large and pay the highest drug prices in the world as an average that would be true I'm not sure that it would be a senator because January prices are some of the lowest in the world and government prices for many of our drugs even before panel expiry sometimes as low as you're poor loyal so on average probably it's true but there are many I know there exceptions I'm looking for average dr. Ferrer I would say that the list prices are higher but the net price of the net price in the United States is more comparable to much of their pricing outside the US Frazier yes outside Medicaid in other things yes nine out of ten products in the u.s. of generics so the pricing of the generic products is much lower in the u.s. than other come together to the earth you are right and branded oh don't don't confuse generic numbers of drugs sold with cost of in the aggregate your answer no but nine and ten I'm telling you but you are right that in the innovation the price is outside the US in many cases it's much higher so I would agree with that patent to drug yes generic no okay thank you last question is it true that drug manufacturers said that what mr. tobert talked about list prices is it true that you the drug manufacturers set those list prices that is correct that is correct but in of course today is a negotiation it takes place with PBMs and insurers about the price and the rebate level in Darfur it's true for this price but the Delta between distant next price is the highest in the US correct yes we set the list price free yes we set list price well actually I wouldn't agree that we set the list price it is the result of a major negotiation and I have to say that the problem in the US healthcare system it is that everything is gear around list price a lot of incentives which creates a hydraulic effect for release prices to go down I would be very happy to get much less list prices and the same dr. brand cordially we set realistic price okay thank you so taxpayer-subsidized your research subsidized your marketing you continue to raise drug list prices on them the median income of a person on Medicare is $26,000 a year the average annual cost for a single specialty medication was more than 52,000 and 2015 Americans can't afford to pay for prescription drugs that cost more money than they make in a year we can't continue to give big farm of the blank cheque that you've had to pay for high price of prescription drugs but I guess it isn't surprising that big drug companies take all the taxpayer money they can what's so troubling is that this Congress continues because of the lobbyists that Senator Whitehouse talked about and other pressures that this Congress continues to allow you to do so senator must answers

each Veterans Day I reflect on the famous words spoken by President Ronald Reagan freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one generation away from Extinction it is not ours by inheritance it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation for it comes only once to a people when I hear those words I think of all the brave men and women who made a commitment to defend our country I think about their willingness to put on the uniform fly to a far-off land and lay their life on the line for our freedom and security I think about all those who stood up and said send me I'll go I think about those who stormed the beaches of Normandy those who fought in the muddy trenches of Vietnam those who did tours in Iraq and Afghanistan regardless of when they serve these soldiers are all connected by a profound sense of Duty to the United States of America our veterans are the finest example of Great Character and selflessness the world has ever known it's because of their sacrifices that freedom has been passed down to our generation and it's because of their courage that it will be preserved for the next on this Veterans Day we say thank you to our nation's heroes in Eastern Washington and from sea to shining sea they risked it all to ensure our freedom and to make sure the promise of America is kept for that our nation is eternally grateful today and every day may God bless our veterans across our nation and may he have mercy on the United States of America because freedom is never more than one generation from Extinction [Music] thank you

Florida congresswoman Kat kamek set to join us congresswoman are you there yep I can hear you great congresswoman thank you so much for taking some time if you could obviously you just shot through the uh the speech what are your initial thoughts on uh President Biden's State of the Union well I got to tell you it was a little disorienting first from the yelling and then the whispering uh it was a little weird from that standpoint but more more importantly it seemed like there were two state of the unions it seemed like President Biden couldn't decide whether or not he wanted to send a message of unity or attack Republicans because he seemed to talk about both in the same breath he conveniently forgot about Chinese spy balloons that dominated the news cycle for the last week and of course left out the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan it was really a speech that was divorced from reality in so many ways and pretty concerning that in some of the most dire times that we've seen in the regulatory state that is really forcing American families to make tough decisions historic 40-year highs for inflation on top of all the other challenges that we have going on he's seeing still content on a highly partisan agenda that is more about political wins than getting things done for the American people so disheartening but at the same time it just shows us that Republicans we've got a lot of work to do congresswoman does it also show us that there's a lot of not just a lot of work to do on behalf of the Republicans but that Democrats must do the work as well how do we get to a place called unity and Common Ground for the common good of the American people to do what this president has talked about heal the soul of America how do you see that how do we personally get involved in healing the soul of America despite what we hear and see from this present but what we must do in Congress you know I think it starts with doing the opposite of what President Biden did tonight you can't talk about unity in one breath and then attack Republicans in the next that is exactly where the trust starts breaking down furthermore I feel that he was incredibly disingenuous in talking about issues that impact all Americans regardly apart regardless of party affiliation especially in talking about the border and Fentanyl poisonings in one breath he says we need to pass only his bill only he can fix the Border but then disregards the fact that Republicans have been calling for security at the border for years we have talked about the fact that the the source of this fentanyl that is poisoning and killing 300 Americans a day is coming from China and subsequently being processed and then traffic through Mexico into the United States these are all facts that he conveniently ignores on the front of the economy he talks about only a made in America but in the next breath he's talking about taking on corporations and conveniently omitting the fact that he is regulating American industry out of business so he really can't have it both ways we've got to get back to that place of unity but that starts with putting your money where your mouth is and in this case he has done anything but of course woman thank you so much for taking some time to join us

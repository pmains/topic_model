I cannot recognize representative Brad Sherman from California for five minutes it's of course natural that the Congress bemoan that Karen bass is leaving us but she's coming to us in Los Angeles many of you would like to have a mayor as good as Karen Bass um there are many issues in Africa but I'm going to devote my five minutes to the conflict in Ethiopia and Tigre which is the bloodiest conflict in the world this decade um we've seen some food get in and the I hope that we also focus on the medicine getting in as well um I want to focus on Eritrea you our Embassy in esmara has verified that air train forces and have been in Northern Ethiopia that they've blocked humanitarian assistance so they've committed human rights abuses including rape and the killing of children there is no legitimate reason for Eritrean troops to be on in in any part of Ethiopia I'm of course hopeful that they'll withdraw their troops but they're not a party to the agreements that the assistant secretary has cited um assistant secretary fee uh will we have uh support we use support additional sanctions on uh Eritrea if they fail to withdraw their troops including sanctions on President aforki himself and on mining uh in uh Eritrea uh thank you Congressman absolutely we uh concur with your assessment of the negative role of Eritrea and Ethiopia it's I think a positive development that as part of these discussions the issue of foreign forces is part of the agreement and the withdrawal of foreign forces Eritrea does not withdraw yes we would do those sanctions I would point out that we could also look at U.N security Council efforts of course Russia would veto because uh Eritrea is one of the five countries in the world to actually vote against the Ukraine resolution we could include uh not only uh that but we could look at an anti-shipping campaign not aimed at ships bringing food or medicine but those bringing luxury goods to us tomorrow um for two years the Ethiopian government has used hunger as a weapon um we have to have a contingency plan should the Ethiopian government fail to meet its conditions under these agreements assistant secretary fee will you commit to not restoring agoa and not supporting IMF World Bank Etc loans to Ethiopia until the Ethiopian government fills its obligations under the agreement including humanitarian Aid protection for civilians human rights monitoring and a restoration of services including the internet yes we've made clear to leaders of the Ethiopian government that implementation full implementation of the agreement reached in Pretoria and elaborated in Nairobi is essential to restoring uh the partnership that we previously enjoyed um we've got tens of thousands of tigrants uh ethnic to Grants and other parts of Ethiopia that have been put in detention centers the U.N International commission for human rights on Ethiopia in September of this year said that the detentions are ongoing and that reliable information indicates that torture is occurring at these facilities will you commit to not supporting lifting agoa and support and not supporting uh International lending until these ethnic de grants are released yes that part this is part of our dialogue with the Ethiopian government and with all parties who committed abuses during this terrible conflict and then there is the disputed area of Western tigray we saw ethnic cleansing there uh in November of 2020 the agreement calls for um a constitutional resolution as to which Regional government should control Western Tigre that could very well mean a referendum would that ref wouldn't any such referendum have to include only those people who live there before the ethnic cleansing rather than excluding those who have been driven from their homes and including those who moved in after after November of 2020. Congressman I know that issue is going to be discussed by the parties uh as you said under their constitution and I don't believe the details about how they would conduct or any referendum or address uh resolution of that that dispute have yet been determined so I'm not in a position to address specifically and and a hypothetical scenario generous time is expired

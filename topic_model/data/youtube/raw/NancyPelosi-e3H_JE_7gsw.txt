good afternoon everyone thank you very much for joining us today we're very honored to have two very special guests brenda kelly nellum from woodbridge virginia she is as a beneficiary of medicare but she has made such an enormous contribution and she will tell you about that and our other very important person is sam burnett he's a medicare beneficiary and a caregiver he's from toledo ohio but he was raised in baltimore maryland so i have to tell you that uh we are also joined by many of our members members of congress the two of three who are spearheading this uh uh conversation this afternoon congresswoman doris matsui of california is a co-chair of the senior task force she will be joined by congresswoman jan chukowski who's on the floor right now but she will be with us in a moment and congressman chaka fattah who will be who is with us right there from uh from philadelphia thank you chaka for your leadership this saturday uh we're coming together to celebrate what is happening this saturday our nation will mark the 46th anniversary of medicare when president when president lyndon johnson signed the bill on july 30 1965 he said and i love this statement so i'm going to read it no longer will older americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine no longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that seniors have so carefully put away over a lifetime so they might enjoy dignity in their later years no longer will young families see their own incomes and their hopes eaten away simply because they are carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents for the last 46 years that's when the bill was signed it has been the responsibility of elected officials to preserve and strengthen that promise today we come together to stand stand strong for that promise we come together to stand strong for medicare over the years we have celebrated the anniversary but today we come together not only to observe the anniversary but also to protect medicare republicans are determined to balance the budget on the backs of our seniors last week in the house a vote was taken on a republican plan which we call cut cap and end medicare it would end the medicare guarantee forcing seniors to pay at least six thousand dollars more for health care while protecting tax breaks uh for big oil for special interest corporations that send jobs overseas that simply just isn't right seniors pay more oil companies get subsidies this week we will vote on the latest republican bill proposed by the speaker boehner that will end medicare cut medicaid benefits and jeopardize social security protect the top two percent of americans at the expense of 98 of the american people that's just not right passage they want to pass a short-term deal on the default against defaulting that would lead to a credit downgrade higher interest rates and a tax hike on every american because that's exactly what an increase in interest rates would be on credit cards home mortgages car payments you name it uh and and then it would end in six months so we could we would immediately start this discussion again that's just not right on the other hand senator reid the leader in the united states senate if the democrats put forward the responsible plan to reduce the deficit and that protects the middle class and medicare social security and medicaid beneficiaries it also includes many proposals already proposed by the republicans they just won't take yes for an answer if we don't come to a conclusion soon democrats in the house are saying we must plan pass a clean debt ceiling bill while continuing our discussions as we know we must to reduce the deficit the time is long overdue for this debate to end for us to get to work to address america's number one priority the creation of jobs the creation of jobs the creation exam let us come together for a balanced bipartisan solution which reduces the deficit protects the middle class and medicare and social security and medicaid beneficiaries that does not impede our economic recovery in the creation of jobs let us come together again to create jobs so thank you all for being with us today i'm honored by the presence of each and every one of you we're specially honored by the president's presence of brenda kelly nellum she has been honored and recognized in the oval office she'll tell you why we're awfully glad she's here please welcome brenda hello hello i hadn't planned to talk about my uh honor in the oval office but i was honored in december for my work uh for payments for doctors for medicare and military and we got that bill passed for a year i worked on that and so that is an honor but i'm here to talk about something else today hello my name is brenda kelly nellum and i i am a member of the lines for retired americans and i live in woodbridge virginia and i'm a medicare beneficiary i am honored to be here today with leader pelosi and other members of congress to celebrate the anniversary of medicare which i believe is one of the country's greatest success stories i have been fortunate to receive medicare benefits the last three years because of medicare my husband and i can afford to see our doctors and fill our prescriptions i never forget forgot when i first enrolled in medicare i had a simple outpatient surgery but when the bill came it was ten thousand dollars but because of medicare i did not have to struggle to pay off that bill medicare helps seniors afford their health care can you imagine what it would be like if we had to direct to rely on private health insurance even if a company would sell us a plan i don't know how a senior could afford it 46 years later in 2011 medicare is doing its job it was designed to do and it is better thanks to the new health law and it will be easier for seniors to afford our prescription prescriptions and to visit doctors for preventive tests and screenings i'm really grateful for medicare we need to do everything we can to preserve the program support it and never allow cuts to take place seniors like me are very worried by the talks of cut for medicare certainly we could do be more vigilant about fraud waste and abuse in this program but we cannot cut coverage that seniors rely on i'm so glad to see all the support in this room our nation's seniors and for for our nation seniors and for preserving medicare let's celebrate its many successes and keep it strong for years to come thank you as i mentioned earlier the co-chairs of our seniors task force congresswoman doris matsui and now with us congressman jan chukowski are here a couple of weeks ago we had a visit with the press to talk about the impact of of any reductions in medicare medicaid social security particularly on women at that time we had with us the person who was then the newest member of congress kathy hokel and she spoke today we're very blessed to have with us the most senior member of congress congressman john bingle who will join us at the podium shortly and so i would like to yield the floor to congresswoman doris matsuya of california thank you thank you very much leader pelosi and thank you for your steadfast commitment to seniors all of us appreciate working with you now for 46 years democrats have defended medicare it's in our dna and we stand here ready to continue that fight over the past several months i've heard from thousands i believe it thousands of my constituents who voice concerns about the republican attacks on medicare they do not want and will not stand for cutting benefits to allow wall street executives to maintain low tax rates or to continue to provide subsidies to big oil take mona for example mona started working as a teenager and has paid into medicare as long as she can remember now as a beneficiary medicare is making the difference in our ability to make ends meet but if republicans had their way mona's financial security would be eroded i've also heard from paul paul who has a young family and paul who is concerned about his parents who are both medicare enrollees he said and i quote i don't know what we would do to cover the cost of their medical needs if the program was cut thank you for standing up to those who think vouchers or privatization is the answer to medicare it is not david a disabled vietnam veteran and recent retiree is scheduled to start receiving medicare benefits next month i think he summed it up perfectly when he said the republican medicare plan is meant to divide and conquer so let's be clear default crisis should not be an opportunity for house republicans to force through ideological cuts our responsibility to america's seniors the middle class and future generations is just too great now it is my pleasure to introduce sam burnett sam who is a school administrator from toledo ohio who's a medic medicare beneficiary and also a volunteer caregiver sam thank you what a joy to be here to see so many people that care this much i guess i'm here to do two things i'm sam burnett and i'm from toledo ohio and i'm with the national committee yeah we were talking about baltimore as we came in and crab cakes and we're we may have to eat those together with the national committee to preserve social security and medicare and have been for 10 years and after i left the job of school i went to work for the church and in that process i saw so many seniors that survive on medicare and medicaid and in that process i'm also with the alliance for retired americans so in that process i represent about seven and a half million seniors who read and write and all we're asking people to do is to do the right thing i'm a medicare manufacturer i'm 80 years old and in that process i've seen so many people who would have thought i'd got a hand for being 80 years old they said you don't live that long and be that fat but here i am but anyhow we've had a ball as we find the seniors who need that service medicare has provided that over all those years and i can't tell you 46 years of service to so many seniors is very significant and while i'm here again we're just asking the members who you see behind me to do the right thing protect medicare and protect it and make it sure so that my seniors are not worried and concerned about it and as i met just sunday i had three or four people come up and say to me are we going to get our check are we going to have our medicine are we going to be able to go to the hospital and the answer is i think we will if we have these people to help us do that my last comment at church and sunday i had a couple that were celebrating their 69th anniversary and they only got that way because of what we have done as a great government a great country and we serve those people and we need your help to do that and what a privilege it is for me to be here and tell you it's a great country it's a great program and let's keep it and even improve it thank you thank you so much i'm congresswoman jan chakowski and in addition to representing a district in illinois for five years in illinois i was the executive director of the illinois affiliate of the alliance of pro-retired americans so i bring that proudly bring that credential with me last year we gathered in this very room to celebrate the 45th anniversary of medicare and medicaid and we had cakes and balloons and we heard from americans whose lives were made so much better because they could depend on medicare and medicaid and last year i talked about what it was like before medicare when being old meant you were probably uninsured when you didn't get medical services unless you or your children had money in their own in their pockets to pay for the care where private insurance companies set the rules and determine who they would insure for what services and at what cost today were gathered to mark the 46th anniversary but without cake or balloons we still hear from americans on how they rely on medicare and medicaid but we're not in the same festive frame of mind as we were last year instead we're in a fighting mood and we're here to tell those who don't cherish medicare or medicaid as we do hands off we will not let you we will not let you destroy our national treasures we will not let you take us back to the bad old days of the last century and not all of us were present at the birth of medicare although i believe that john dingle was actually in the in the chair at that time but not one of us is willing to be present at its demise am i right we are not going to let a republican plan to eliminate medicare go into effect we're not going to let the republicans double and then triple seniors out of pocket costs at the same time by the way that they want to cut social security benefits many americans are hanging on just waiting until they turn 65 so that they can finally become eligible for medicare's guaranteed coverage they put off going to the doctor or getting needed prescriptions or surgery because they simply can't afford it and we're not going to raise the age of eligibility so that they have to wait even longer and above all we're not going to turn medicare's guaranteed benefits into a handful of inadequate vouchers throwing seniors back on the mercy of the private insurance companies my republican colleagues like to say that they aren't eliminating medicare they're just changing it well i say you can call it whatever you want maybe care sort of care i don't care but you cannot call it medicare so this year we're not having an anniversary party but a re-commitment ceremony we're here to stay state our fierce and unswerving commitment to protecting and preserving medicare and medicaid so that we can go back to celebrating it with cakes and balloons for generations to come thank you and now it's my pleasure to bring on my colleague chaka fattah well i don't believe that we can honor the greatest generation by allowing this congress to become the default generation we are the wealthiest country in the world we can afford to take care of our responsibilities and highest on that list is our responsibilities in terms of our our senior citizens who have done the work to build this country uh we are the most powerful country on the face of the earth and uh sam i'm i applauded you because you're 80. you know my mom is now 80. she's been in the hospital for a couple weeks but she's coming home this week and uh but that medicare is what allowed her not to be stressed out about being hospitalized and my dad was he was there with her every minute they had to move him out of the way so they could attend to her but the point is is that medicare is a commitment that we have and we're not going to allow this republican majority to lose the moral compass for our country we're going to focus on this and we have the right leadership nancy pelosi is the best speaker the congress has ever had and and she's made it and she has made it abundantly clear and i'll conclude with this we will not equivocate we will not compromise not one inch on medicare period now we like to find some ability to go forward with this republican group that's here to you know solve a few of these problems for uh the time that they're going to be around the way they're acting they may not be around for a long time but there is no ability there is no ability for us to agree on anything that takes away benefits to people like my dear mom who like sam is now 80. but uh she's still got she said i'm not waiting around here just to expire i got work to do thank you very much thank you very much congresswoman matsui congresswoman chuckowski congresswoman as i mentioned earlier and as congresswoman schakowsky alluded to our distinguished dean of the house of representative congressman john dingle was in the chair and gaveled down the medicare vote and he has that very gavel that he used to do that we're very honored he's with us today and invite him to say a few words you'll see members leaving because they called votes but uh as he comes up here i want to acknowledge a former colleague congresswoman barbara cannelly who also was the head of the committee assault reserve social security and medicaid you don't mind if i call you madam speaker they're going to give her back the job because because medicare and social security have got to be protected and that other side ain't going to protect it but this this wonderful woman will we thank him i was sitting in a chair when we passed medicare one of the great days of my life and it was one of the great days most americans i didn't realize when i was a puppy then how important it was going to be when i got to be 85. well it's a great program and it works and it's worth protecting it's a commitment and it's an insurance it's an insurance that protects our people it's a commitment that we're going to take care of them and we're not going to let them take it away or give us a bunch of shrunken vouchers in that place so madam speaker thank you for getting us together remember much is to be done we have to protect medicare for our future and for those who have it now we also have to protect social security the same folks who are out to destroy those two programs in their inception are still busy trying to do the same thing so let's get at them we aren't going to quit while they're still have their heads up so keep going as i mentioned we have a vote so i only have time for one or two questions and they weren't supposed to come until later uh any questions from the press that has he has resigned that's it i said at the time uh that i pray for him and his family uh obviously they have issues to address and uh i wish him well well let me say this we all agree that we need to reduce the deficit because that's important for us to do but as we do so we want to make sure we have the right priorities we don't think a right priority is to make seniors pay more for medicare for fewer benefits while we give tax cuts to big oil we don't think it's right for us to eliminate a senior's access to medicaid which helps them in nursing's home while we give tax breaks to corporations that send jobs overseas and when it comes to the next generation we don't think it's right to make kids pay more for their college loans while we give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country having said that in our american and our affordable care act we did address the issue of how we can reduce cost in medicare to strengthen the program to make it solvent for a longer period of time what we're talking about is how we can reduce cost one way we can reduce cost is to stop paying pharmaceutical companies nearly a hundred billion dollars more than we need to do and say that it's about but instead we want to reduce benefits so of course we subject every initiative that involves so many people and so much money to the scrutiny as to where we can have savings but those savings do not begin by increasing the the cost and lowering the benefits to our seniors another question well i would like to see it have revenue in it because i think that's a really important part of the deficit reduction but if but i commend leader reid because he has created a path let me just say that over 30 times we have lifted the debt ceiling since president reagan was president over 30 times not one time did we subject a president to this uh a burden of saying you can't we won't lift it unless we reduce the deficit of course we will reduce the deficit but it should not be connected and and the uh uh the idea of that we could jeopardize whether they're sending out social security checks or military checks or that our credit rating would be affected by this is appalling but i commend senator reid for trying to find a path i commend the president for his patience for his respect for every view on democratic or republican view giving it time consideration trying to make it work uh i wish the same uh uh respect for his time was and the responsibility that we all have was there so i would like to see what that proposal is about the committee to include revenue as well because if you just make cuts you pretty soon will be cutting benefits there's just no way that you can cut three trillion dollars in domestic spending uh especially when they don't want to have a firewall between domestic and defense so we you know we have some uh ways to to do it that it would work that would work that would truly reduce the deficit enable us to grow our economy create jobs educate our children honor the values of our country a dignified retirement for our seniors the education of our children the creation of jobs the security of our country and while we reduce the deficit in a values-based way with that i'm going to have to go vote but i thank you all for coming are we all set to protect medicare medicaid and services we're together on that are we thank you all very much

so your reaction to President Trump pulling back on that strike the fact that he was contemplating a strike in the first instance is deeply concerning president Trump has mismanaged our foreign policy from the very beginning especially with regard to the Middle East we had the entire world community at the table with the jcpoa to make sure that we had peace in the Middle East and to make sure Iran could not manufacture nuclear weapons the fact that they are days away from considering manufacturing more uranium and militarizing their manufacturing is a serious concern and it's because President Trump fails to lead he has not worked with our allies he's not worked with the EU he's not worked with NATO he's not brought the country together and the reason why we were able to have the Iran deal in the first place is because we put such crippling pressure on them make no mistake Iran is not our friend they engage in terrorism they fund Hezbollah and they do missile technology that they are not sanctioned to do but the truth is what President Trump is doing is destabilizing the region putting America and our interests at risk by being so disruptive and by sabre-rattling it's really a problem that he is contemplating war

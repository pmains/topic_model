hello everyone I want to wish everybody a happy and safe from immortal Day weekend and it's the beginning of the summer but before we begin our summer tour summer Joy's let us always remember what Memorial Day is all about when I was a little boy my grandmother always made sure that Memorial Day started by going to the cemetery so we'd always go visit my uncle his name was Robert Guthrie we call him Uncle Bobby Uncle Bobby was killed in the Korean War and so I'm not saying we didn't go and enjoy the picnics and things outside but we always began our weekend understanding what it cost our family to lose an uncle I never knew they had cousins that I was never able to have but it's thinking OneNote since the Revolutionary War through today there are American men and women who sacrificed their lives so we have the freedom and opportunity and we want to honor remember one with the way-out honor my uncle is by having this flag this flag was the flag that was presented to my grandmother and in night in the spring of 1952 he was killed March of 1952 it's a 48 star flag so I may have one of the few 48 star flags in the capitol building business about our my uncle is to honor everybody that sacrificed their lives so as we get together this weekend with friends and family and enjoy the beautiful Kentucky weather let us first remember why we are gathered while we have this special holiday is for people like my Uncle Bobby in the people that is sacrifice for our country

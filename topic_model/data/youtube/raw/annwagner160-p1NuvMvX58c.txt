knows for five minutes I thank the chairwoman and Secretary notion thank you for the courtesy of coming back today I'm especially pleased that as the vice ranking member of financial services and also the vice ranking member of Foreign Affairs that we are focusing on the state of the international financial system here today the secretary I was pleased to see that the u.s. seized a North Korean cargo ship earlier this month carrying coal North Korea has also conducted missile tests spun for the first time in almost a year and a half with missiles that appeared to resemble Russian technology as talks with the North Koreans stall in North Korea demonstrates in its increasing aggression what specific measures can we expect to come from Treasury sir well the president is determined that we continue our efforts to enforce of the UN sanctions and the US sanctions against North Korea and they've had a very important effect on bringing the Chairman to the negotiating table and we will continue to enforce those sanctions especially in the banking arena across multiple arenas yes they've all been very effective secretary the Obama administration mistakenly believed that Burma was on the path to reform and it lifted sanctions and embraced eye-fi investment given that Burma has continued to commit atrocities against ethnic groups across the country do you think IFIs should continue engaging with Burma and if so how can they help prompt a more rights respecting environment I'm concerned about the situation there we will continue to have discussions with the if' eyes and others and monitor this situation so that there is the appropriate outcome well and again I just I hope that we will impose additional sanctions that were lifted by the Obama administration given the past has been taken visa vie the atrocities that are happening against so many different ethnic groups Burmese civil society organizations have expressed concerns with the IFC's lending proposals in luxury development projects infrastructure and agribusiness given the country's corrupt business environment and at lack of property rights how has the IFC used his position to promote transparency and inclusive economic development in Burma well let me just say I share your concerns I know our international department has been having conversations and I expect to see David Malpass very soon and I will raise this specifically to his attention there is no reason in my mind that the IFC and others should be doing this without the appropriate conditions attached well and I've been very pleased to send some information along some questions if you'll be having those discussions cool thank you after issuing its first US dollar denominated bond issue issued this month that the china-backed Asian infrastructure investment bank or the AII be raised 2.5 billion dollars and attracted orders of more than 4.4 billion dollars the AIB has said that the funds will be used to invest in infrastructure projects across Asia where the a III B is a major financier of belt and road projects what are the World Bank IMF and Asian Development Bank doing to support the belt in road initiative well I can speak for the the IMF and the World Bank and they are both very focused on debt transparency and making sure that China follows rules of debt transparency that are consistent with the Paris Club and others and in making sure that if debt is taken on by these countries that it is sustainable and that they can afford and if there's proper financing for infrastructure that's one thing but if there's money that's designed to loan to own that's inappropriate and how is the u.s. ensuring that countries aren't aren't becoming overly indebted to China or entering predatory contracts well those are conversations we have at the g20 consistently and I think there are there is a lot of support from all of our allies on this issue thank you I'm about to run out of time but I would like to forward some information about Burma to you for your further discussions Thank You Neal Bannen

a lot of people have asked whether or not the new health care bill increases our nation is a debt and the good news is for the first 10 years of since it's of violence passage the debt actually goes down by about a hundred room roughly hundred forty billion dollars even better news is for the second ten years the national debt is expected together by roughly another 1.2 trillion dollars so congressional budget office which is need a democrat nor Republicans nonpartisan says we can look for roughly 1.3 trillion dollars of deficit reduction over the next 20 years most of it in the second twenty years to help reduce the budget deficit rather than to increasing there are a number of benefits that kick in right away there others at kick in in 2011 and some of their really big ones kicking in 2014 but in terms of things that are meaningful in 2011 there are a number of young people under the age of 18 who have a pre-existing condition they're being denied coverage because of those pre-existing conditions they lose their health care coverage that they lose with Ron able to get again young people under the age of 18 will not be denied access to health care because of pre-existing condition that's a big one young people young adults whose come out of school graduated from school or 22 23 24 25 years old they'll be able to continue to get coverage under their health insurance plan o their parents up to their 26th birthday then finally they have folks that are Medicare eligible who are participating in the Medicare prescription drug plan they'll begin the doughnut hole it's going to be being closing for them this year next year it'll close in a big-time way and I think those are three immediate deliverables the built this Sept this year I never people have been concerned about losing their Medicare benefits actually three I think very positive things that happen under the legislation rather than losing benefits you actually lose these replaces one for folks that use Medicare Part Medicare Part D prescription drug program that's still in hold it concerns a lot of people whose drug costs reach a certain level and we're going to be being closing the jebel Cole that they share continue to close it over the next ten years but this year next year making a big move toward reducing the size of the doughnut hole for folks second thing that are the great benefit for folks currently when they reach age 65 and Medicare they're eligible for one with one physical point annual physical paid for by Medicare for the rest of life is at one under the legislation that we passed folks who become medicare-eligible can receive every year of their life for the rest of their life in annual physical they live to be a hundred file it means a year the relative oh 440 under them what that includes these physicals will include cognitive for screening is as well and the last thing that I think is real places there's a lot of Medicare fraud going on we were expecting there's a lot of draining the Medicare trust fund in a big-time way life expects us that xbox is either Medicare trust fund was down to about eight years just a few months ago that was extended to 25 years in part by going after the flood recovery money I know some folks have been concerned that what we're doing is a government takeover or find a pie and work for a Republican senator Olympia Snowe from Maine on the health care bill but hit a SAP person he sees that after the bill passed that there was an active signed into law by the president actually looked what would pass look actually a good deal like what the Republicans often as an alternate for Clinton care in 1993 and 94 what we're trying to do here is to focus on what works to reduce health care costs and to improve outcomes and it's not a government takeover not government-run government-funded that's what they do in England it's it's basically figuring out what works large purchasing pools be able to bring down administrative costs as a percentage of premium trying to make sure that people have access to two medicines that help them to get better and trying to encourage incentivize people to really to take control of their own lives and to actually do some things in terms of personal responsibility it'll help me from healthy yeah and one of our telephone tell me he thought said to to me we had thousands of people on his telephone town hall meetings and we'll do some Wars people just seek to look learn what's in this legislation that we passed one fella said the region if this if this is such a great thing that you're doing in creating exchanges which are large purchasing pools in all 50 states by 2014 where individuals and families and small businesses can come the exchange by their health care coverage over the the internet use a larger purchasing pool drive down health care costs he said me if this is such a good deal senator Cochran why don't you get your health insurance through the exchange and they said under the law I have to when the exchanges stood up and open for business in 2014 so then he said well how about your staff and I said what my staff it's required by law to get their health insurance through the exchanges as well when they are stood up in 2014 and the idea is to take what works to replicate while works required purchasing pools offer wide variety of choices including the kind of coverage that we now get des members of Congress and federal employees drive down premiums by lowering administrative costs that those are some of the things that will that will happen under the legislation that we passed

Thank You mr. chair in the DL J's filing last week of a joint status report to judge Sabra 11 children were identified as having parents that were determined to be excluded from reunification under the judge's order due to criminality a total of 18 children as I understand separated from their families could not be reunified because the parent was determined to be unfit or presented danger to the child mr. McHenry is that accurate to your knowledge yes ma'am the filing represents our position thank you so removing a child from their family in our domestic child welfare system requires trained child welfare agency staff and a determination by a judge that removal is in the child's best interest it's a system that is designed to protect parents rights and to protect the best interest of children at the border the decision to remove a child from their parent is made solely by US Customs and Border Protection Agency's agents in the field miss Asher is that correct who makes the determination no ma'am I'm with ice so I'm sorry Prosser so we make that determination of course we do utilize our office of chief counsel we work with the consulates of the so in in medical or domestic child welfare settings trained staff often use screening tools to identify abuse neglect and trafficking I don't believe it's within your agency's purview to really make those decisions in the sense that you don't have the training so I'm not blaming you I'm just saying you guys are making the decisions without the proper training so in the domestic child welfare setting a determination of a child's best interest is made by a judge what training do CBP agents have to inform a determination of a child's best interest my agents are trained starting at the Border Patrol Academy and dealing with with children and the potential for fraudulent families originally families but are they deep but are they true in in a child that might be neglected or abused like a social worker so you're so the CBP officers are also social workers no ma'am we are trained though throughout our career we also follow the law T V PRA and various policies when it comes to separation it is these are the words of the protocols that the agents follow in determining that parents pose a danger to their children if if for one example and the one that they are separated most often or for serious criminal but could you give me an example when I when I went to the border I was at McAllen and I talked to one of the CBP officers and I asked could you give me an example of a crime and the officer recounted a parent who had been convicted of DUI so you know in our nation's child welfare system if a parent is deemed to have neglected or abused their child a whole process takes place no one person decides right there on the spot we're going to you're ineligible to receive your child back so that's what I'm trying to get at here is that my concern is is that we have one system that is in place to protect children and your agency which IDO and again this is an unfair burden on you so I'm not faulting you but based on what would you make that determination and we are not making a determination that they cannot be placed back together but as an example and I see this because I get the daily reports quite often we have individuals that have convictions for domestic violence and if I may explain a little further as well yeah very quickly I'm only interrupting you because I'm running out of time I turned them over to ice ice is not going to put somebody with that type of criminal conviction in a family residential center so we have to make that so case okay so let me let me just finish so tell me what happens to these children long term so we have determined that a child cannot be reunited with their parent what happens to that child long if that child does not have family in the United States is that you commander way yes ma'am for those children where there's been a final determination by oor that the child can't safely be reunified which is a child welfare decision that's a different decision thank you when you were just discussing with okay robos very very few children in the Mizell class were in that situation right but what happened as their cases reviewed by the ACLU and the judge what happens is those children then become true you ACS and sponsors are sought for them as they are for all on it so are they eventually put up for adoption the UAC program does not put children up okay let me ask you one more question if a parent is deported and they know where their child is in the United States how do they get their child back we contact the parents we provide their contact information right fill you these so how so I'm in Guatemala I know my child is in New York how do I get my child back and who encouraged the expenses for children who were separated right and and deport and the parents were deployed transport the child with at our expense for reunification it's a partnership of ice and HHS and the ACLU to affect we and the government of the home country so the parents do not have to pay that's correct yes ma'am yeah I yield back Winton

we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back everybody this is going to be a great episode because we have none other than ben shapiro on you may know him he writes a book like every five minutes um writes a lot of things uh jeez i mean well how many i'm not sure how many columns you write then but it's a lot a pretty busy guy um fastest growing conservative podcast in america as you like to say i mean i see no proof of this but okay well i'll take your word for it if it's true it's true um look ben thanks for being on as always and uh congrats on the new book release i appreciate it so uh we'll we'll get to the to the book um the authoritarian moment uh it's actually pretty relevant especially you know given the past year that we've had um but you know we were just talking offline uh i was a little late to to our meeting which i apologize for uh coming out of a classified briefing with secretary of defense secretary of state uh general milley the chairman of the joint chiefs secretary of homeland security and our national um our director of uh our our director of national intelligence or dni so um a basic update about what's going on in afghanistan and you know my takeaway from it was the limited questions that we got to um there's a lot of bipartisan outrage over this self-imposed august 31st deadline um and nobody really believes what the secretary of state is saying he is actually saying that he thinks all the americans who want to leave by august 31st uh we you know we should be able to meet that deadline that's just i mean i just i see no indication that that's that's possibly true and it's frustrated me to no end um frankly this entire situation has frustrated me to no end i think you and i are in agreement about what our general strategy should have been and um it was simply not followed and i think there was bipartisan foolishness over this whole thing i mean i totally agree with that and as far as the the sort of situation on the ground over there you know the the august 31st headline it started off as self-imposed but really now is being imposed by the taliban because there's a push by some in the binding administration to extend it at least a few days so we can get everybody out uh and the taliban are pushing back and they're saying no no that's our red line if you do that then we can't guarantee anybody safety beyond that august 31st date i think the taliban have an interest in making sure that everybody does get out because the last thing they want is for americans to start dying because if americans start dying then americans here are going to be unhappy enough that we might be interested in bombing the hell out of them um but i i think that what is much more likely at this point you tell me if you agree down because you know this stuff better than i do given that you're in the classified briefings i think that the most likely scenario here is that we're just gonna bribe the hell out of the taliban we're gonna be spending them pallets of cash we'll be sending them all sorts of goodies and they will allow the americans to leave and then two months from now after joe biden has declared victory then we'll start seeing all the pictures of americans being humiliated and we'll start seeing the pictures of the pallets of cash that we've sent over to the taliban and the reason i say this is because this is essentially what obama did with iran we sent them palliative cash iran later revealed that it was humiliating for the united states or when the iranians took a bunch of american seamen hostage and we got them released and then later they built statues of the american sea men on their knees on boats uh in the middle of tehran so i wouldn't be surprised if that's the way this goes my concern beyond obviously the immediate is that i think that the game that the biden administration is pretty obviously playing here is okay this is an acute crisis if we sort of bluster and bloviate our way through it and we buy ourselves a couple of weeks to get as many people out as we think we can then the american people two years from now they'll forget about all of this because they actually want us out of afghanistan they don't care about what comes next they're not interested in the geostrategic implications see to me there there are two rolling disasters here one is the actual humanitarian situation on the ground with 10 15 000 americans still stuck there uh and and you know somewhere between 60 and 100 000 members of the uh afghan military or afghan contractors people worked with us still stuck there right that's that's one crisis and the other crisis which has i think more significant long-term effects is all of the after effect of this including the rise of china china is now going to have access to tremendous amounts of american military technology if you think the taliban are going to be analyzing those drones we left them they will not the chinese will just pay them a billion dollars and they will ship all of that technology over to china where china will simply you know reconstruct the technology this is what they are famous for doing is stealing our ip after all so they'll do the same thing with their military tech the chinese obviously are making inroads with the taliban uh they're gonna get their rare earth's minerals um you're gonna start to see iran ramp up its activities in the region you're gonna start to see russia ramp up its activities you're gonna start to see american allies look around the world and say okay well if the united states is this bad an ally to the afghans what wouldn't they do to us and maybe we should start triangulating a little bit not necessarily abandon the americans but at least start making overtures to some of these other countries that the united states has now granted a broader role on the world stage so the the ramifications of this are going to be felt you know for american foreign policy for probably decades to come but i think biden's calculation is americans only see what's right here in front of their face and so right now it's really bad his approval ratings are in the 40s but if the americans come home then a month from now things will be better for him so just lie and bluster your way through it yeah that seems about right and this this is the problem with um with creating foreign policy off of a public opinion poll that that really doesn't get into the nuances of what we're even talking about because yeah look a majority of americans say yeah bring the troops home this sounds good you when you're asked a question on a survey you're always going to just say the thing that sounds good all right they're going to go back to trying to figure out what they're going to cook for dinner right you know because it's like any person answering this question has put even the modicum of thought into this first of all but second of all other surveys that ask a little bit more detail like okay well what about a residual security force to maintain stability and make sure taliban does take over would you be in favor of that uh after we you know removed our combat troops and and and you get a majority saying yes too so it's not it's not like the the public opinion is so singularly focused on just bringing all the troops home uh as as biden might expect it to be and again as many on our side expect it to be one of the problems right now is we seem to be trying to salvage the old plan which was just take everybody out that's sort of the what the actions i see on the ground what i'd like to see what i'm pushing for is acknowledge that there's now a new reality that we live in and that reality has become an emergency situation of of a neo which is a non-combatant evacuation operation and we can't possibly do it from just kabul airport uh it's a soft target it's easy to hit we're getting reports now that that isis coruscant might be hitting it within the next 48 hours of v-bits and coordinated attacks and uh it's it's it's a complete disaster i i've advocated for look you got to retake airfields throughout the country and there has and and we will leave when we think that everybody who wanted to come with us is gone and that's just what we should tell the taliban if they don't like it they can kick rocks because we're america that that should be our message unfortunately you're completely right that won't be our message it'll probably accommodate that will probably pay them off uh which will of course incentivize them to engage in the same behavior that got us to this point in the first place but biden's national security team is the same as it was under obama and this this methodology of appeasement uh will continue and um it's it's a hope and change was obama's uh slogan and that was actually the perfect way to describe this foreign policy too just hope for change if you're super nice to people soup's nice uh people will do what you want and it's it's um it's it's really been depressing for a lot of us who served over there um yeah i mean i can't imagine what it's like for people actually served over there for for folks who you know even remember 911 i know that's now half a generation away it's 20 years ago um but the exact same people who perform 9 11 are now back in power i mean it's actually the haqqani network that is providing security in kabul the haqqani network is basically an al qaeda offshoot the top three leaders of the taliban right now are omar's son omar was in charge of the taliban uh and uh and the uh the co-founder of the taliban and the head of the haqqani network and those are the people that we are handing over power to and not only that essentially playing pr agents for you remember that the obama administration did this with regard to iran they were so hell-bent on doing a deal with iran that this forced them into the uncomfortable position of having to pretend that iran had moderated and that the iranian regime was actually a moderate regime and that their human rights predations and spread of terror all over the region that really wasn't that big a deal i think they're gonna see the same thing from the biden team it'll be well you know the taliban they're more moderate than they were uh they're more open to change sure they're they're really bad right now but but as they you know they're gonna have to take their role on the world stage and you hear biden saying stuff like this he said oh they have a choice to make they have a choice i'm pretty sure they made that choice when they decided to live in the 7th century and stuff all of their women into into burkas and then into the basement i'm pretty sure that choice was made a while ago but the idea seems to be uh that that choice is still on the table biden knows that's not true but i think that biden has not changed his opinion since 2010 when he told richard to hold brook you know effort you know it didn't hurt it didn't hurt nixon and kissinger in vietnam so it's not going to hurt me now and sadly he might be right because as you point out the only time americans typically care a lot about foreign policy is when americans get killed so if no americans get killed here i think that biden will be able to save his own bacon if an american gets killed god forbid uh then uh then i think that um he's in in dire political trouble so all of his focus right now is what do i have to do to get the taliban to release everybody so i can at least claim that this was a well-planned well-orchestrated operation even though all evidence suggests the opposite the last thing i'll say on this is it's a matter of costs and benefits this is what i've been trying to tell people for years um we all agreed to go into afghanistan okay no nobody gets to say that they were like oh guys i knew this would end up like this there's no point going uh nobody gets to say that everybody agreed to go in there and so from that moment on you always had two choices either keep a presence there uh attempt to maintain some kind of stability in whatever way we do that or give it back to the taliban and put us right back into the situation we were in on september 10 2001. you know we weren't at war on september 10 2001. somebody was sure it's all at war with us this is something that people forget and so you've always had those two choices and i think everybody who's in the no more endless wars crowd who basically again makes their foreign policy based off of a slogan they've always they've always negated they've always been in denial about those two choices right there's always been this sort of third utopian option to them which was we can just have it both ways we can just bring our troops home and also not really worry about attacks on the homeland but that's never been an option it's never been true um i i and now with all the intelligence reports coming out saying al qaeda will probably be back to their operational their old operational standards meaning they can they can engage in external operations uh within six months to 18 months that's the assessment that's not good uh isis is they're already thinking isis is going to attack in the next 48 hours it is it is amazing to see how how often no more endless war uh that sort of slogan slides into no more war a sort of almost pacifistic utopianism i mean the reality is that afghanistan was not an endless war by the time we left we'd had one combat casualty i believe in the last 18 months uh and it was in february of 2020. uh so the the you know notion that this was in any way similar to the war that we were fighting in afghanistan circa 2010 or 2011 is just not true i mean barack obama started announcing troop withdrawals in 2011 by 2014. we had about 10 000 troops on the ground as opposed to 30 or 40 000 troops on the ground uh just a couple of years earlier and since then we have been pretty steadily withdrawing troops from afghanistan to the point where we had 2500 troops on the ground uh by the time that joe biden decided that that was unsustainable that made it the i believe on the list of countries where we had troop station that made it the ninth the ninth most populous country in terms of number of american troops on the ground like we had we had more troops in spain and qatar than we did uh in afghanistan by the time that we left and also the sort of no more endless war crowd fails to acknowledge also that it's our opponents do believe they are fighting an endless war so the question is how are you going to defend yourself from that in the same way the soviet union felt that they were fighting an endless war on on capitalism and so the question was going to be always do we see that ground to them or do we not see that ground to them this isn't you know a game of one hand clapping there's another hand out there and they have an agenda and i always find it interesting that that the same people who like i wish that people could muster the same passion for we need to pull out of afghanistan um that they seem not to be able to muster for pull out of japan pull out of korea we've been in korea literally for what uh nyon 75 years at this point um and uh and we still have 26 000 troops in south korea and it is worthwhile noting that if the united states military were to withdraw from south korea right now there's a serious question as to whether the south korean regime would would survive for you know a plenitude of years given the aggression of north korea and they're backing by china so wherever the us you know removes its boot print bad things tend to follow and that doesn't mean that the boot should have been there in the first place that that's a there's a serious question to be asked about that and the question is to you know how many boots should be there period but when you remove all the boots then the back foreign policy in nature abhor a vacuum and and that vacuum is not going to last for very long in fact this one didn't even last for for a moment it's strange to me how this this mentality is infiltrated so deeply into the conservative side uh there's a lot of people who call me a rhino because you know i i have this view of our foreign policy it's like okay so i'm all right now granted that's like the left calling somebody a racist right that's sort of the equivalent on our side i i don't not sure why i don't like what you're saying but i don't like it so you're a rhino got it but but explain to me how how complete isolationism and refusal to acknowledge the cost and benefit analysis of leading or staying in a foreign intervention i i'm not sure how that that makes you more conservative it's a very strange and a highly emotionally charged opinion that has occurred on our side and and i struggled to find where it came from it's it's it's a bit strange to me i think it i mean there and look there's been this strain in american foreign policy thought on the right for a long time i mean paleo cons have believed this for a very very long time pat buchanan was preaching this in the late 80s in the early 90s um there was this strain of isolationism uh inherent in sort of the john birchism of the 1950s so it's not completely foreign and it's not completely brand new uh the rise of it i think is in response largely to the unsuccess of the iraq war over time uh and the failure to acknowledge that there were some pretty significant successes in the iraq war as well uh and when it comes to afghanistan it just became the trendy thing to say i mean it was adopted by several straight presidents after george w bush right barack obama suggested that afghanistan was the good war but we needed to change our mission there uh to not include making sure that the regime was particularly stable we just had to keep enough boots on the ground there to conduct counter-terror which is at least an argument and then trump came in and he pledged to get out of there and then biden came in and pledged to get out of there as well so you have this bipartisan consensus that it was vital and important to get out of there so i'm not going to pretend this is something new because i don't think that it is something new i think it's i think it's it's new to those of us who remember 9 11. uh for for those of us who grew up in the 911 era and i was 16 when 911 happened uh or 17. and so the the sort of market shift in american foreign policy this recognition that america would not be left alone and that if you you know just pretend the rest of the world doesn't exist the rest of the world will find you uh that went away you know within probably five years at the beginning it was very partisan the republicans were like well i thought 911 just happened and democrats by 2004 were already pushing a lot of this line and talking talking down the iraq war saying we're definitely going to lose there talking down the performance in afghanistan by 2005 2006 and then it started getting adopted by the right in the aftermath of bush when bush proved to be unpopular in the second term so yeah i i don't know that it's it's a truly ascendant philosophy on the right i think i mean the american people are are two things they're knee-jerk we don't want to be involved in things and then they are also knee-jerk if something bad if something happens that's bad then we want to be involved in things and it's the job of people who actually you know know things about these parts of the world to explain how they work in more nuanced detail and you explain that at the top with regard to polling data like the poll number of do you wish to be in afghanistan or not virtually all americans are going to say yeah i wish we weren't in afghanistan but if you say it requires a skeleton force of 2 500 troops to secure bases against al-qaeda and afghanistan euphoria against it most americans are going to say for it so one is significantly more more nuanced and more detailed in the framing yeah there seems to be this strange sort of sense of moral superiority if if if you claim to care about the that you claim to care about veterans and the troops more because you want them home safe it's like like national defense is not a bunch of seals on san diego beach just looking out over the horizon looking for the rooskies like that that ain't national defense guys you know you need to be before deployed you know a network of alliances um i want to move on from this though and and uh maybe quickly get your take on because it turns out what we're doing in washington this week we were called back on august recess but not to deal with afghanistan uh or even debate you know maybe should we recognize the taliban as a legitimate governing force i think that's a worthy debate right now i don't think we should uh but you know the secretary of state is is toying with that idea that's what we should be talking about um it's not uh we are talking about a giant infrastructure bill and a giant spending package which will which may all get lumped into reconciliation uh it's actually still unclear to me as we record this exactly what the strategy of the democrats is going to be on this um i you know i i guess uh maybe a quick take from you on how detrimental this amount of spending could be for our country uh it's disastrous i mean i i think that right now what we are looking at in terms of the biden doctrine is essentially surrender abroad and then a sort of weak slovenly gluttonousness at home like we're just yeah as as my friend noah rothman it says we're gonna just kind of sit in a warm bath and wait to die it seems like the economic strategy here is as long as we can up the welfare benefits and spend money that has not yet been created uh then you know we can live in comfort the rest of our days which is why so many people seem pretty comfortable with the level of bailouts that were put out last year during an actual pandemic and want that to continue at infinite items so um i don't think that biden sees the downside of this in fact i think that biden actually the downside may be the benefit i mean even in his sort of economic projections the suggestion was that this year was gonna go great guns next year was gonna go great guns and then by three years out we were gonna be experiencing for the rest of the decade like 1.5 1.6 gdp growth that's terrible that those are bad numbers but that is a recognition that when you burden the economy with this amount of spending and the required amount of regulation and taxation on the other end that you're going to destroy an enormous amount of entrepreneurship you're going to destroy an enormous amount of job creation uh and and i think that biden is kind of okay with that because he realizes that he's probably a one-term president for health reasons and you can either go down in history as a guy who did stuff or he can go down in history as a guy who didn't do stuff and the presidents who tend to go down in history as successful are the ones who do stuff whether that stuff is good or bad remember fdr presided over three terms of a great depression and well three and a half terms of a great depression um and um he's still considered this historically wonderful president which is kind of incredible considering he lengthened the great depression by at least eight years according to studies from ucla so doing stuff is much preferred in the democratic party to to not doing stuff and it doesn't have to bear much resemblance to reality i am pleased that there is at least a group of house members who realize that there there's going to be some blow back to them in blowing out the spending this way that the long-term benefits may accrue to the democratic party because once you get people dependent on government they tend to vote democrat um but there may be some short-term blowback in purple districts and democrats could easily lose the house in in 2022 over it uh it'll i'll honestly i'm curious to see how it works out because the whole play i assume from sort of the moderate republican caucus the mitt romney's and the susan collins's of the world on the infrastructure bill is we'll trade you our support for this pared down infrastructure bill which is still a trillion point one and in return you have to shoot down this 3.5 trillion dollar budget and the you know i've been skeptical that democrats were actually going to shoot down the 3.5 trillion budget but maybe some of these democrats in purple districts and in purple states are starting to feel the heat given the fact that joe biden's approval ratings mean that that his administration has very little coattails so maybe uh maybe that romney collins calculation will end up uh strategically being correct we'll find out yeah it's really been the only defense of i think supporting the infrastructure bill the infrastructure bill is not quite as bad as our site says it is but it's definitely not good either it's just it's simply too expensive uh that's my problem with it i also think there's a bit of a myth that we're just not building any infrastructure like there's a sort of mythology out there and look we could always we could certainly engage in projects that are i think ready and approved you know everything in the army corps of engineers has a backlog that that are well vetted projects that we that we should fund that's like 100 billion dollars you know i'm not sure when they get a trillion from um it's it's it'll be interesting to see if they end up being right and uh the democrats fall apart on this i mean they tried to get it done last night they couldn't we were here until 1am um i like the way you point out though look i think one of the um you're always good at pointing out the essential differences between the left and the right i think framing it for people so people understand what it is we're actually debating right because too often in politics we get we get really mired down in this sort of well he's the worst person well actually we'll remember that one guy that you voted for who's also the worst person and this just sort of becomes the stupid tit for tat in reality though we have very different dispositions we think very differently about the nature of of governing um the human nature and how much it can be molded and this is i'm making a segue here into your book as well um but you talked about action democrats need action action at all costs and and that action is a sort of a form of bribery and i think unfortunately americans have become highly conditioned to this bribery and part of that bribery is safety uh you know we will we will make you safe we will promise you this sense of safety will this is sort of the progressive false promise promise you a sense of security and safety that only we can provide for you but of course the logical end to this is we'll just put you in prison keep it perfectly safe there you can be in prison it's fine we'll feed you we'll clothe you you don't need to do anything um and and i think this gets to sort of how you how you start the book the authoritarian moment um how you differentiate between right-wing and left-wing authoritarianism can you sort of expand on that and how people should think about it sure so there's been this long established phenomenon that sociologists have talked about of right-wing authoritarianism and right when authoritarianism is is typically characterized by obedience to rules um by uh by willingness to use authority to cram down those rules on others and and when you think of right-wing authoritarians you should be thinking of of people like general franco and spain for example um and uh and for a long time sociologists who tend toward the left said there was no such thing as left-wing authoritarianism it was a total myth it just didn't exist there were there were no people on the left who are authoritarian now people are on the right right exactly they're just such nice people they're just wonderful uh and uh and then it turns out that that of course is not true right and that you can use precisely the same sort of descriptors to apply to people on the left except the sort of rule following that they want is rule following for a different purpose so these sort of characteristics of left-wing authoritarianism are three in in number and this is put together by a university of north dakota professor i believe uh the the three sort of aspects that that are most typical uh are a a willingness to use top-down censorship which you see in most american institutions these days ranging from universities to your corporation a belief in revolutionary aggression that the institutions themselves are a problem and need to be torn down either from without or from within and a sense of under moral superiority a belief that your moral authority is greater than the other guy that the reason that you guys disagree is because that guy's a bad person and i'm a good person and you see all of this like all over our politics right now and and you see again i think there are right-wing authoritarians but the people who are in charge of the major institutions in american society right now corporate america the universities the the mainstream media social media they're almost entirely comprised by either left-wing authoritarians or people who are extraordinarily vulnerable and willing to surrender to left-wing authoritarians and that has a real effect on the body politic it has an effect on how people talk to each other and think about each other and it's it's really dire i mean there's a reason why bipolar statistics every single political subgroup in the united states with the exception of the far left feels uncomfortable saying what they really believe about politics and the reason is because they're afraid that the institutions of society including the sort of mob effect you get on twitter or facebook are going to come against them if they speak what they actually believe about controversial issues the only people who feel comfortable are people on the radical left and and that has really i think that the book is really less about the power of government than it is about the authoritarian mindset that has taken out taken over all of the sort of extraneous to government uh aspects of american life i think that you can easily see authoritarianism in government right now in for example coveted policy which is utterly insane um and you're saying that on the state and local level it's like its own method of infection it's like it's so it's like its own pandemic this sort of and and you get into uh you always use big words in your books which is annoying but okay okay it just means mob rule all right yeah which is uh which is just threats you intellectuals uh but you know our founders were concerned about these things they they were very specific about creating a republic a republican form of government that was not a pure democracy uh they're worried about mob rule but there's like there's there's sort of uh the government sanctions mob rule which i suppose would be a pure democracy and then there's the sort of mob rule that i think you're referring to which is much more cultural and and you know again with even with coveted policy it's it's largely a culture war that we're fighting there there are there are legitimately a lot of i wish we were the large silent majority on this i don't think anybody's silenced about it but but i don't know that that's true there's plenty of people who who are firmly in the camp of you know i need my neighbors to keep me safe i need to make them do things that keep me safe um it i think it's taken on new heights in covid because at least there's some sort of rationale because it's a pandemic but but that rationale expands to a lot more than just covet as far as what i want my neighbors to do for my benefits maybe what i want them to say maybe i think they shouldn't be able to say certain things um and we're likely to be perfected by the first amendment but you know when it comes to tech censorship the democrats don't i haven't seen legislation from them that would that would say look you need to censor this kind of thing more facebook but they but they certainly have a lot of heated rhetoric that would indicate that oh they say that out loud right i mean what they what they've said over and over and over is if you don't monitor what's on your service facebook then we will for you which of course congress doesn't actually have the power to do what they can do is and thomas solos pointed this out if you provide a subsidy to someone and then you remove the subsidy that's the same as penalizing them uh and that is that is what they've done i mean section 230 is a subsidy to big tech it is a subsidy that is designed to elicit a broader range of public opinion and the democrats have basically said unless you narrow the public opinion you allow we will remove the liability protections so that is precisely the opposite of what conservatives have said which is the whole purpose of section 230 was to broaden the protections for broader speech so you really need to keep the protections broad this is why i'm always amused when i see some people on the right who are anti-facebook say well you know we and elizabeth warren are on the same page like no you are diametrically opposed elizabeth warren wants fewer things on facebook you want more things on facebook that is not the same thing at all um but it does speak to um and you're seeing this from the biden administration right now with regard to things like vaccine mandates right joe biden said yesterday that he wants to see private enterprise place vaccine mandates on people who work for them he's the government okay so what is the next step there that federal contractors it's not just going to be the federal government right federal contractors must be vaccine only contractors or people who work with federal contractors have to only be vaccine mandates like it gets into really dicey constitutional territory but on an ideological level and you do see it manifest with covid particularly post the availability of the vaccines before the vaccines at least there was a case to be made that if you're in a public area with a lot of seniors and nobody can vaccinate uh that you have you you should put on a mask out of good grace and to protect your neighbor but once everybody has the capacity to get a vaccine then we are now talking about you just want to control your neighbor because you want to control your neighbor and this is what i can't i honestly can't fathom it there are so many people out there who are vaccinated right because a huge percentage of blue cities are vaccinated particularly the elite upper crust these are the exact same people who are calling for mass mandates and and i just like i've been vaccinated since march um and i once i was vaccinated i did not care right once i was vaccinated it was you do what you want to do i will do what i want to do if you choose to be unvaccinated and then you know get immunity to covid by getting covered that would be your choice i think it's not a particularly smart choice depending on your age and health condition but it is your choice but i'm vaccinated i took the vaccine to protect me and i took the vaccine because you know again i think that it's a good i had my parents get the vaccine because i think that it is important for them to get the vaccine my wife got vaccinated like i'm very very pro-vaccine but this this desire to control other people has outstripped the science to the point where you have members of the public health establishment saying things that are overtly untrue just for purposes of control i mean anthony fauci said literally yesterday he was on many hassan's show on msnbc and he said it doesn't matter what kind of mask you put on don't worry about that just just put on a mask okay the data are very clear that cloth masks do virtually nothing with regard to with regard to delta and and the surgical face masks are only about ten percent effective and that's if you use the mask properly they're only about 10 effective against delta so no that's that's not correct and then joe biden came out and in complete defiance of all available science he said the mask that every time your child goes outdoors leaves the front door you you should mask your kid okay that is not designed because he is worried about what your kid is going to do based on the science the risk of your child dying today from covet if your kid is under 18 the risk to your child dying of kovid is lower than the risk of you dying from covet post-vaccination if you're 40 and vaccinated you still have a higher risk of dying from covet last i checked then a two-year-old does dying from covid so what exactly are you talking about it is now it goes back to something you mentioned before which is there's an almost religious belief on the left that government is capable of solving all problems this is the biggest problem most of us have seen in our lifetime so if government is incapable of solving the problem this challenges the leftist worldview and so the question is okay what's the solution that either you can rethink the idea that government is capable of solving all problems or you can say that the real problem here is that you haven't masked harder right well the real problem here is you right it's it's principle skinner it can't be it's not it's not me who's wrong it's the children who are wrong and and that mentality i think is pervasive it is i mean you know and i think conservatives have something to offer here that maybe we don't do a good enough job we're always very reactive to the left um and another thing i find interesting by the way is our complaints about ourselves if you go read like leftist literature on how we can how they can do better they have the exact same complaints they believe that we have all the institutions they believe that like we have the media power that we have the emotional reasoning while they have all the facts they i i swear i was just reading a book it's called a don't think like an elephant uh it's a fascinating book uh and it's they they think the same things i don't know i it's a little tangent but it's interesting in how we how we go through with this but but you know we have something to offer the american people because i think most people are on our side with this which is which is basically a live and let live philosophy now to an extent like you and i are not libertarians and i think there's a big difference between a conservative and a libertarian we're just more closely aligned than say what the left is but there's there's a lot of americans that do believe in a live and let live philosophy with most things and i don't know that conservatives have done a great enough job maybe selling that point and also i would say selling the the the challenge and the adventure of personal responsibility and i love the way this is how jordan peterson talks about it and he sort of got me to start thinking about it this way it's not talking about a lack of personal responsibility as a problem but talk about it as a challenge an adventure that you embark upon that gives you the dignity of individual freedom and the dignity to pursue your happiness as our as our declaration of independence prescribes uh i think it is something we can offer it it it's wildly against authoritarianism again it's it's interesting uh donald trump is calling authoritarian all the time um maybe he talked like one but it but he certainly never took action like one uh but that sort of gets lost in the mix no that's right and and i i think that the point that you make there is exactly right and it does go to two visions of what freedom constitutes for for the right freedom lies in the ability to find meaning in your life and most people find meaning in their life by obligating themselves right this is jordan's point is that most of the things on your deathbed the stuff that you are going to think about having spent your life doing properly is the time you spent with your wife the time you spent with your kids fulfilling your obligations to others helping your community you know quote-unquote building a better world for the left the stuff that that you know gives you freedom and meaning uh is freedom from obligations right well this is why they're always talking about freedom from want right there can't be true freedom until we have provided for all of your needs well that's that's a certain uh it's it's sort of a an empty view of what freedom actually constitutes for for conservatives freedom comes with responsibility because freedom is is impossible without responsibility for the left freedom from responsibility is sort of the point and so if government can can act as the the sort of buffer zone between you and reality then that's government's job and that's a real problem because reality does not care about your buffer zone reality is not interested in whether the government pretends that it can stop a pandemic or whether the government pretends it cannot stop a pandemic the covet is just going to hit whom it hits and this is what we're finding out right now worldwide right we're seeing that that in in israel they have an 80 vaccination rate and they right now have more people in the hospital than they've had any time since last summer uh they have an extraordinary number of people and they had 10 000 infections today now that is the highest number that they've had in months and months and months uh new you've seen in australia they're they're trying to block out reality by locking down 25 million people on the basis of about 700 cases and about three dead a day so you can either put your faith in government to protect you from all the risks of the world or you can recognize when there is an outsized risk that sometimes requires government intervention and then the rest of the time realize that risk sort of exists and that that does not alleviate you of your responsibility to be a good person to other people but it does mean that other people do have to leave you alone and i i think conservatives have a lot to sell here which is why people are flooding to florida for example and they're not flooding to new york and or california in the same way people are when people are asked their opinions i think that they tend to think about how they want to think about themselves but when people act in the real world their feet are taking them to florida and their ideas are taking them too often to new york and i think that people ought to get with uh they ought to uh get past their own cognitive dissonance and realize that probably their feet have the right idea yeah i mean we need to live in reality it gets back to afghanistan conversation you got you got to live in reality not the world you wish you lived in um that would make you feel better uh you talk about the time we have left um the tactics that the left is used this renormalization as you call it the tactics that they've used to achieve more and more authority and sort of especially in the cultural sphere um where we are in that fight maybe i mean where do we stand should we be optimistic should we be pessimistic how are we doing uh and then how do we reverse it so i'm pretty optimistic that the pushback has begun on a large number of these particular issues because i think the left pushed too far too fast so the process of renormalization as described by now nicholas taleb is that you have to take an example a family of four you have a daughter in the family who decides that she's gonna start eating vegan she comes home one day she says listen mom you can make whatever you want for everybody else but i need vegan food now mom has a decision does she make vegan for the whole family or does she only make vegan for the daughter and another meal for everybody else and so she says listen i only have time to make one meal it's vegan for everybody tonight now the family goes to a block party same logic applies we're all eating vegan because jessica over here you can make two meals the block party person goes well maybe i'll just put out some chips and dip and and that'll be as good as it gets and now you have 20 people who are eating vegan because of jessica that sort of process of renormalization is very common in institutions you see it happen all the time you have to have an intransigent and aggressive minority declaring that they will not be moved on a particular issue and they can move a bunch of people in the middle so long as they're not asking too big a sacrifice so this relies on a couple of things one the the sort of apathy of people in the middle and two an ask that is not too big the problem the left has taken advantage of the apathy of most americans toward politics most americans don't follow politics right the biggest shows on fox news might get 4 million viewers a night there are 340 million people in america so you know most people are not following politics day to day um but the the apathy is there but the problem for the left is that they overcome the apathy when they do things that are totally crazy and the left over the last couple of years has started pushing things that are totally crazy ranging from men can be women to the police are bad and we should get rid of the police and once you push that hard there is going to be pushback and i think that the kind of normal apathetic politeness that most americans have toward politics is dissipating pretty quickly i think that trump frankly was a symptom of that i think a lot of people on the right were like listen for a long time we've put up these sort of very polite candidates like mitt romney romney or john mccain and we've gotten bullied and we've gotten pushed around and so i don't care what else trump says bad stuff about he says bad stuff about you and you deserve it and so we're going to vote for that and i think that that is the sort of gut level the love that a lot of the base have for trump personally but i think that broadly applied right not applied to a specific person broadly applied in the sense that we are not going to move from our ground and that apathy is no longer an option and that niceness with regard to aggressive behavior is not a solution i think that's taking root and i think it's taking root with a broader and broader segment of the population and i think that that's you know it's it's dangerous in the sense that any sort of polarization is dangerous but it's good in the sense that i'd rather have the polarization than a mono a monopole than have a monopoly the way that the left had until very recently in the cultural sphere yeah i i think we should be optimistic too another reason i might say that is because you know if you look at this is what i tell people all the time who were upset and frustrated i say look you know 20 years ago who were your thought leaders in the conservative movement and maybe you could name rush limbaugh there's not there's not that many we didn't have this sort of uh institutionalized uh i think conservative influence or cabal uh it is the best i guess phrase that i can come up with for it but you know you are around 20 years ago i mean you were around but not really around like not like you are today and um there was there's plenty i think there's plenty more examples of influential conservatives that are also making the right arguments now of course as always we have plenty of i think make the wrong arguments and maybe take us a few steps back but for the most part um we've learned to operate in that sphere of say you know entertainment i mean look as a as a congressman i understand that i have to operate in that sphere i jump out of airplanes sometimes right just what is that for it's for pure entertainment okay now the problem is is if you don't use that entertainment towards good ends there's a lot of performers up here that just like to perform but then they don't have any substance on the back end i believe that you you grab people with entertainment and then you deliver them some substance and also you know do your homework on why we believe what we believe i just i think we're doing better on that when we had before we think we still have problems but i think we should be optimistic in that sense you guys did wire are you know you've gotten into the movie-making business for instance i mean maybe maybe talk to us about that as far as our solutions go where can we do better do we have a chance of transforming some of these institutions like the mainstream media um even some of our federal government institutions you look at something like the state department it's just over like 90 democrat leaning you know this so these these institutions our educational institutions are no longer transformative they're no longer transforming people that come into them they're allowing themselves to be transformed by sort of the cultural mob uh and i think i think that's how we lost universities but how do we fight back against that or do we have to create our own so those are the two alternatives right and i think that it depends on the institution as to which tactic we use so some institutions are too far gone i don't think you're gonna infiltrate hollywood and make it neutral to conservative ever again um so you just have to build an alternative and so we're doing that at daily wire they've thrown half the american population out of the theater and so we are welcoming them into another theater and hopefully we'll have increased offerings and bigger budgets to to do exactly that sort of stuff and we're really really good at alienating i'm a really good actor i don't know if you know that just in case you guys know we're gonna we're gonna have you at least at the very least uh and uh and so that's you know that's some stuff that we're working on out here there are other institutions that are still up for grabs and here i think particularly of corporate america where corporate america is still answerable to its shareholders despite its most ardent attempt to make itself answerable to quote unquote stakeholders which is just another way of saying we're not answerable to our shareholders uh stakeholder capitalism is one of the dumbest ideas ever but shareholder capitalism is still the the preferred model and there can be moves made within these corporations if you have a hundred members of your corporation who sent a letter to management saying they want black lives matter messaging on on their web page you can get 200 members of your corporation to sign a letter saying no and then the corporation has a choice to make you can as a shareholder you know actually impact how these businesses are on and again because it exists in the private market market share makes a difference and you can launch competitors that actually fight back against these these sorts of dominant institutions uh you know there are other institutions that like the university structure yeah i think the one good thing about the university structure is online is going to destroy it it's just a question of how long and that also can be solved by the business community the real reason that that people are willing to spend 200 thousand dollars sending their kid for a lesbian arts degree at swarthmore is because that degree still means a better job on the other end because you still have the swarthmore degree when businesses start doing what we do at daily wire and we don't screen for college applicants instead we will look at we'll look at where you've worked before we'll look at your work experience we'll maybe look at your gpa from high school right we'll look at other metrics then the the sort of bargain that is inherent in college goes away and i think that that is going to be a good thing so i'm optimistic about taking back some of these institutions i'm optimistic that a lot of these other institutions are making themselves um vulnerable to to outside influence the ones that are the hardest are the ones that have actual control over the means of dissemination and that's where you get into big tech or amazon web services you know places that people have sunk billions of dollars into building this massive infrastructure on the basis of its neutrality and then they've turned around and become not neutral that's really a problem and that's really scary and it means that they have a really big head start in in that space um but you know again the the the best that you may be able to do in some of those circumstances at least remove the government monopoly that's been granted to some of them uh and in uh in other cases uh you can you can build competitors i think that's a great answer um i'll be respectful of your time you know i have but i but i have to note okay you've been on my podcast twice it let's be honest this is one of the greatest podcasts you could probably do guest on i mean just a lot of people say that that a lot of people okay they say it's the best um but you know you've only had me on yours once do you still do the sunday specials i love the sunday specials i haven't seen one in a long time yeah they've gotten a little bit rarer um because it was hard to get people to come to studio because of covet um hopefully we'll start getting back to doing those a little bit more more often uh we've been doing some of them remotely uh and uh we we also kind of wanted to uh i'll be honest like after after we had you dan we started to think you know dan was really good but i gotta say that the general the general characteristics of the people we're having on is starting to drop somewhat uh and uh and so we really need to up our game so better to do it you know once every three weeks and make the guest excellent as opposed to you know once every week and suddenly you have michael knowles on you're like why why god why it's the worst how is is your book selling better than his empty book is uh yeah i i will say that that all three of my last books it's sold better than his his empty book did and his empty book sold really well that did really well surprisingly i got no royalties from that and i wrote as many words in that book because i wrote thorough on the cover with my name i wrote as many words in that book as he did i got zero money from that and i got him in advance from a publisher to take his self-published book and then have it published by simon schuster and i will never forgive myself for that it is just horrendous oh man that's sad poor michael knowles he takes so much heat from you i mean but he also takes so much money from me so you know i feel like wait wait in the morning created him i mean geez yeah i love it all right well you know what i'll look forward to that invite then um but it sounds good and uh hey uh thanks for being on uh appreciate it and uh look it's it it is a great book um your work often is and um it's worth reading uh gotta say really just always appreciate your expertise on things and your take on things and the way you frame the arguments for the conservative movement it's it's more important than ever i mean my the biggest threat i think to conservatism is us not understanding what makes us conservative and why our arguments are better than the left that you know we can talk about fighting all the time and i put fighting in quotation marks um and people often when they say that they mean yelling and screaming they mean performing for some kind of fundraising mechanism what it really needs to mean is argumentation that is effective and that is persuasive so if we're not persuading anybody to our side that fighting doesn't have an outcome of winning and i would think that winning is the actual goal um and so appreciate your uh your enormous contributions to that effort ben i'm back at you dan appreciate the time

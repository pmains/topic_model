gentlewoman from California is recognized for one minute Thank You mr. Speaker I thank the gentlelady from New York for yielding I ranking member in the Rules Committee and thank her and our colleagues on that committee for trying so hard to have this rule contained an amendment that will allow us to vote on the extension of unemployment insurance for all over 1.3 million Americans who will lose those benefits if we do not pass that extension I would particularly salute congressman sandy Levin of Michigan the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee for his relentless championing of this issue of fairness to the American people we come here to talk about a bill that is to end the sequester and then end the sequester it does and I commend the conferees I'm very proud of the work of congressman Chris Van Hollen the ranking member of the Budget Committee on the Democratic side needed loi the ranking member and appropriations our assistant leader mr. Clyburn representing the leadership in those negotiations I thank them for taking this to a place fighting it to a draw so that we come to the floor to fight something to end sequestration but the opportunity was so much greater and apparently the Republicans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity when it comes to creating jobs mr. Van Hollen had in his bill just a few points in terms of priorities one was to create jobs and economic growth for our country in the short term and in long term if we close one loop close a loophole build the infrastructure of America close a loophole build a bridge close a loophole special interest tax loopholes for special interest invest in the human infrastructure of our country early childhood education long-term economic growth close a loophole pay for unemployment insurance I don't think it has to be paid for because it's emergency spending but nonetheless let's have an opportunity to vote to extend unemployment benefit when we do not when we ignore those investments in the future we're not reducing the deficit we're increasing the deficit those nothing brings more money to the Treasury than creating jobs and the revenue that produces nothing brings more money than Treasury in the education of the American people starting with early childhood education and as far as unemployment benefits are concerned the economic impact is clear every dollar spent on unemployment benefits grows the economy by a dollar fifty two cents according to Moody's Analytics a dollar and a half for every dollar we spent and that's a conservative estimate failing to extend unemployment benefits will cost us over 200,000 jobs over the next year we can't do that a recent report shows that extending uio instead would produce 300,000 jobs so again this money is injective spent immediately injects demand into the economy creates jobs grows the economy as well as honoring our social compact that we have with the American people people work hard play by the rules lose their job through no fault of their own insurance is what they have we should honor that insurance so it's disappointing yes because this is some package is so limited but as I said it was fight to a draw I recommend that I colleagues vote to support it so we can take it off the table and make way for the discussion we should be having about comprehensive immigration reform the votes are here give us a vote mr. speaker passing a farm bill very important to the economy of our country raise the minimum wage there's nearly two-thirds of people making the women minimum wage or women paycheck equity tax fairness in the workplace for women the list goes on and on and ending discrimination against LGBT community people in the workplace there's so many items on the agenda that have the support of the American people in large numbers yesterday was the anniversary of Newtown past about the Brady background ville all these things are an agenda we have a neglected up until now we just haven't had time for it I guess they haven't been priorities for this Congress but they are priorities for the American people and for the Democrats in Congress so again one reason to vote for this package even though you may think its meager and you may not like all of its priorities as the gentleman said is to at least have a agreement on the budget that enables us to move forward for bigger fights that when / improve policy improve the lives of the American people honor our responsibilities to them but I are colleagues to vote for the budget but to vote against this rule because this rule says no it says no to the Congress we're not even going to allow you to speak or vote on unemployment insurance benefits extension it says no to the American people that if you work hard and play by the rules and lose your jobs through no fault of your own the safety net isn't there and that safety net is not there just for individuals it's there for the system our beautiful free market system deposed in cycles and sometimes unemployment is higher than others and there's some outside forces at work that people lose their jobs we caused up and so it's about a safety net for our economic system as well as for individuals why why would they not allow us to bring this up and extend this extension is it the money it's not if it's the money will find it is the price do you think the price is too hard to give people dignity to allow them to keep their homes and and meet the needs of their children two million children would be affected by this add tens of thousands of veterans affected by the care about veterans here we children here but apparently not enough to extend unemployment benefits so why my Republican colleagues would they not would you not allow us to have a vote on this I no the support is there on the Republican side I know that the Democrats would vote a hundred percent for this do you not believe that these people are worthy of receiving an unemployment insurance I say insurance that something paid into benefit check if so let the American people know that but this debate will not end today while you may not give us a vote on the floor to extend these benefits that we see where everybody is on the subject and why this fight will continue because this is about the morality of our country the respect that we have for people the value that we place on work the pride we take in a great work ethic of the American people but sometimes it just seems the harder they work their forces that are in a deck stacked against them and this Congress is saying this deck is not going to include you as we deal out the cards so it's really I can't explain it to anybody except to say it's a values decision and apparently there's not enough shared values on the subject of the respect we should have for our workers to even honor the subject with the vote on the floor of the house it's an outrageous rule to come to the floor I thank you around here for fighting it and I urge a very strong no vote on the rule vote no on the previous question which would allow us to bring the what afraid of you afraid of the vote are you afraid of working people who are out of a job what are you afraid of let us have a vote on the floor with that Mr Speaker I urging a no vote on the rule a yes on the bill I yield back the balance of my time

the Federal Communications Commission is repealing that neutrality it will change the way the internet operates as we know it so what is net neutrality and why is it so important net neutrality is the principle that no matter who you are or how you connect everyone should have equal access to the Internet without net neutrality Internet service providers could charge you more to view certain content block your favorite websites or even slow down your internet speed altogether and when it comes to economic development net neutrality allows small businesses to reach their customers online at the same speed as big corporations without those protections rural businesses and entrepreneurs could be forced to pay huge corporate rates or be cut off from their customers altogether that is why net neutrality is so important because without it we're at the whim of big corporations they can favor websites that make them a profit while blocking or slowing down websites that can't pay their fees so I'm demanding the FCC listen to the thousands of Montanans who have contacted my office and preserve our free and open Internet ending net neutrality ends the internet as we know it

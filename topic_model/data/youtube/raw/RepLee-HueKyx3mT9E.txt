our Chairman and ranking member and chair and ranking member for your bipartisan leadership on the subcommittee one of thanks the Chairman and ranking member Bishop for including funding for the healthy food financing initiative and the managers amendment this program as I mentioned many times in this committee before this committee it's important to increase access to fresh healthy foods by providing on-time loan and grant financing to healthy food retailers to invest in low-income and rural communities it creates jobs and also healthy food choices often missing and many of our districts it's important that our committee continues to fund this program so I'm pleased to see it included in the manager's amendment today thank you very much I'm still concerned quite frankly event adequate funding levels including you know in this bill it would cut AG investments by more than 1 billion or about 5% also it would cut food for peace by 200 million and as you know there's a looming famine on the continent of Africa some of the policy riders in this bill would politicize science and help on Dietary Guidelines block improvements on sodium and also on grains in our schools and also weakens FDA's oversight of tobacco these riders are extremely problematic but I look forward to working with our chair and ranking member as we work to move forward on this bill and address many of the outstanding issues but thank you again for including the provision that I mentioned or thank you miss Lee

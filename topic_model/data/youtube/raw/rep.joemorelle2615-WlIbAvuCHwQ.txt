thank you uh madam speaker i uh i must say uh and i have the highest regard for uh my colleague but anyone who would accla equate the black lives matter movement and the protests organized over the murder of george floyd and equate them with white supremacists like the one who killed 10 people in buffalo and targeted black americans is equating that is irresponsible and reprehensible at best these are not talked about um false equivalence i am nearly speechless that that that we would even begin down the road and maybe that says a lot about why um the national republican effort has changed so dramatically in just two years when this congress uh accepted by voice vote the domestic terrorism act that we have before us

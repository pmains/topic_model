Thank You mr. chair Thank You mr. odden good to see you again so clearly the concern that you've seen for many of my colleagues with respect to the Community Reinvestment Act and ensuring there's no discrimination in lending and I know the OCC is required to ensure that the banks comply with laws prohibiting the unfair and discriminatory lending correct that's correct and so with that you're ensuring the banks senator not with CRA that is fair lending actually there are fair lending exams done based upon the HMDA data so that you're that you do that is correct correct thank you and so in ensuring that there's no discrimination let me ask you this it's so are you ensuring that the banks are complying with the Fair Housing Act am i ensuring that they're complying with the Fair Housing Act correct yes we are and are you ensuring they're complying with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act yes we are and has your office reported any violations of those acts to DOJ yes we have so they're actively looking at that now thank you very much let me ask you this going back to the CRA enforcement it's my understanding you've instructed your bank examiners to change how they consider CRA bank exams is that true not to my knowledge oh we are we I believe we're sending out a bulletin today yeah so so there is bulletins that we send out where we update procedures and it either yeah we've been holding we've been holding a we we frequently will provide Q&A or bulletins as updates and so we've been holding hoping we were going to get the ANPR out and so there were some updates that went out if that's what you're referencing to our CRA updates and how the bank examiners will be in the criteria they will be looking at when they're engaging in these exams is that what no no no the criteria has been you know there for banks over 1 billion 236 million there is a point system that is lending investments in the service now let me ask you this because I'm just trying to get to something specific I only have so much time so I appreciate my colleagues also asked my understanding is that the the bank examiners are consider the CRA when they're engaged in these bank exams isn't that correct we actually do specific CRA and are they looking to ensure that there's no discriminatory lending going on as part of the CRA review so so what occurs in a CRA exam is we do a HMDA review first to ensure that we can rely upon the information that the financial institution has given us it doesn't mean that they're doing a fair lending exam at the same time they're doing a CRA exam but are they still looking at if there are item data points that that that may let me ask you this as part of their CRA exam are there any concerns that they look at our data points if they look at to ensure there's no discrimination in any manner whatsoever they don't look at any of that any of the Honda points there's nothing in the mortgage lending or anything that they look at to ensure there's no discrimination is that's what I'm hearing you tell me that your bank examiners don't look for that let me be clear okay so prior to a CRA exams starting we do a HMDA exam a home to review to determine the accuracy of the data if there are items that are discovered in the HMDA that would lead our suspicion that there is not that there is fair lending questions then we are required by statute to do within 12 months of fair lending examination we are also frequently doing fair lending examinations independent of CRA okay and so knowing this and I know the OCC supervises about a thousand banks correct 1,300 okay and how many of those banks if you know make fewer than 500 mortgage loans or home equity loans we looked at that data it's less than 5% okay and then as you will know Congress passes a lot understand of the volume I'm okay and Congress passed a law that exempted banks that make fewer than 500 Morgul own mortgage loans from reporting publicly on much of the loan and borrower characteristics like points and fees interest rate and other indicators of loan quality so how can you ensure without that data let me let me finish my question okay and then you can clarify let you clarify how can you ensure that without that that you're not determining that there's the presence of discrimination or not if you don't have all of the information you need to make that determination so just as a point of clarification those banks that will be excluded still have a HMDA light that they have to file the enhanced HMDA data is what the other financial institutions will submit no I I recognize that that's why I opposed it I think HMDA light doesn't give us enough information to determine whether discrimination or not and that's my question to you we've added throughout that additional data how do you ensure there's notice we use the HMDA data to point us in the direction where we think that there's you still have access to all of the HMDA data or just the HMDA light like you called it well only the Institute well it's been being enhanced and there is new enhancement based upon the CFPB's you know criteria but what what will occur is and that data will come in to us for ninety-five percent of the volume five percent of the volume will be HMDA light okay so you're only referring and utilizing HMDA light data is what I hear and I know my time is up refer to my colleagues thank you

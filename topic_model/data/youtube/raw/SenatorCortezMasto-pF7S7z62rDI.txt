welcome governor Powell it's good to see you again thank you for taking the time with me welcome to your family it's great to see you here as well so I'm going to start with something a little topic a little different president Mester of the Cleveland Federal Reserve gave a speech earlier this month where she noted that more immigration is needed to drive the US economy at a time when the population is aging and productivity is stalling governor Powell do you agree with President Messer that we need not less immigration to help drive our country's long-term economic growth senator as as I mentioned earlier the size of the labor force is an important determinant of our potential growth over time labor force growth is really slow these days it's about 1/2 of 1% you know you go back 30 years it was 2 and a half percent so it's it's a big reason why our economy has slowed down and immigration has been a real contributor to that having said that immigration is another one of those issues that's really not in our lane and really those decisions are for you and your elected colleagues no I appreciate that but we've been talking about knowing the economy and part of your purview is labor and I appreciate your comments that immigration is an important part of that labor force that grows our economy so thank you as chair of the feds committee overseeing the Federal Reserve Bank's operations including the presidential search processes we have seen some improvement in the diversity of the regional bank presidents the boards of directors the banks workforces and better interactions with advocates advocacy groups in the banks communities if confirmed what will you do to increase the diversity of the leadership workforce and opinions in the federal reserve system thank you as I mentioned I am a big supporter of the full Reserve System and also of diversity I think we make better decisions when we have diverse voices around the table and that's something we're very committed to at the Federal Reserve both and at the Board of Governors and in the reserve banks so and that's something I've been deeply involved in during all my time there and I would say that so I've had a chance to this is something people have been working on for four decades now and you begin to see what works and so my view of what works a lot a lot of private companies have been very successful in in advancing diversity and what seems to work is to have a holistic plan that you stick with over a long period of time and it's about it's about recruiting it's about going out of your way to bring people in once they're in it's about giving them paths for success and it's about having it it's about having an overall culture and company that is very focused on diversity and that sticks with that focus for a long period of time that works it's not something you can do overnight you mentioned the Reserve Bank presidents Orcas that's something that I have been responsible for it I assure you we we always have a diverse pool of Canada and I agree and I appreciate that's not just check the box it is a cultural change that is constant so thank you for your comments there congressional Republicans are set to pass as we've discussed today a tax cut bill geared towards large corporations at the same time this committee is about to consider legislation to roll back rules for some of the nation's largest banks what can you do at the Fed to ensure that this tax windfall and this deregulation actually benefits workers and doesn't just translate into more executive bonuses and stock buybacks well our tools are what they are so we have monetary policy which can shove the economy in the direction of stable prices and maximum employment and we have regulatory policy which can ensure safety and soundness of institutions when institutions become more profitable I just taking your suggestion you know some of that is going to go to shareholders some is going to go to customers some of some is going to employees so but we don't really have tools that affect the distribution of profits right and so but you do have a component of consumer protection we do and you do have a concern about the workforce and growing that workforce and make sure there's a strong workforce correct yes so part of the concern that I'm hearing and I didn't have I really haven't heard a lot of that discussion is what you're going to do to address specifically those consumer protection issues and particularly also protecting the workers and that workforce ok consumer protection we haven't actually talked much about so we've been assigned you know an important role in consumer protection we take it very seriously I'm committed as chair as I have been as a governor that we're responsible with responsibility for our budgets that consumer protection will be will have the resources it needs to do its job whatever Congress assigns us we will try to do well and aggressively and you know that's our that's my undertaking to you I appreciate that and and III know my time is running out and I will submit the rest of my questions for the record but I like many of my colleagues do have concerns I come from Nevada dodd-frank was there for a reason because we had a horrific crisis as you well know we talked about this and the deregulation of dodd-frank and many of these regulations that were put in place to protect individual consumers are so important and I am concerned about rolling back any regulations that is going to open that door and less than any type of consumer protection any type of work that we have done particularly Nevada across this country to protect individuals so look forward to having further conversations with you with respect to the idea of tailoring your regulations as well thank you governor Powell large banks have been fine to combine 160 billion since the crisis yet recidivism continues and regulators have been very reluctant to impose harsher penalties take for example Wells Fargo which has a new scandal that arises it seems every week do you view the post crisis response on the part of regulators towards the largest banks as being too harsh well I guess I would I would regard the fact that we're still seeing things like what you referred to in the paper as very disturbing I don't think I would characterize our reaction to these kinds of problems as too harsh I do think it's appropriate that we that we strike a professional tone in our you know our supervision and regulation of financial institutions and we always strive to do that but no I you know I my main reaction to what you referred to is is one of concern that institutions are still having problems with bad behavior bad conduct toward consumers so can we then address the issue and I'm looking at this as well but the conversation that you just had with Senator Brown regarding stress testing and the changing of the thresholds which would then diminish any type of stress test for Wells Fargo as well as Bank of America and some of the others is that true the way you read the ability no no I don't think it would have any effect on stress testing for Wells Fargo or the or the other larger institutions it would only affect institutions institutions between 100 and 100 and 250 billion in assets it wouldn't impact them domestically their domestic operations you know would not to my be my understand if it did would you have concerns it would depend on what the effect would be but I don't I don't see any case for for for legislation of that nature that would affect the largest and most complex institutions thank you

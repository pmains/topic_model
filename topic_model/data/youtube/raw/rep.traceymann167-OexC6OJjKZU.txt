madam speaker i rise today to commemorate the life of a truly great kansan dr barry flinchbaugh who died last year at the age of 78. dr flinchbaugh taught my ag policy class at kansas state university which is the best class i took at college he had a larger than life demeanor was committed to production agriculture was involved at some level in every farm bill going back over 50 years and was sharp witty and hilarious dr flinchbot did more for kansas farmers than possibly anyone else during his lifetime his expertise in act policy led him to meet every president from harry truman to george w bush but he wasn't interested in notoriety he was passionate about his family his field of study and his students who were his legacy and his pride of joy i was one of the five thousand students dr flinchbot taught over the span of 49 years and i can picture him now cigar in hand holding court in the classroom in his office surrounded by transfixion people many of whom would later go on to become leaders in the very field that they learned from him i'd like to close with one of his coats that i think will we all need to hear a special in this deliberative body at the present time he said there are two ways to make public decisions compromise or dictatorship there's nothing in between and with that madam speaker i yield back

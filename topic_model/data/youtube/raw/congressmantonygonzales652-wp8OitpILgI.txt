joining us now to react texas congressman tony gonzalez and sheriff of cochise county arizona mark daniels thank you both so much for joining me tonight so congressman that statement from the press secretary about texas and the role that the governor is allegedly playing what is really amazing considering the biden administration is doing nothing to stop covet positive illegal immigrants from coming into the country and then the justice department is now has now sued the state of texas to stop them from stopping the transport of coveted positive illegal immigrants yeah katie things on the board are as bad as they've ever been and they're only getting worse by the day the biden leadership has failed his policies his border policies have failed and have caused have brained hell on the texas frontier right so months ago uh throughout this process many people have asked me hey what can we do you can remain vocal and you can stay engaged thankfully fox has done that back in april senator cornyn senator cinema henry uh congressman cuellar and myself put together a piece of legislation bipartisan border solutions act one of the things that it called for was to add 300 ice agents to the equation after months the administration has finally done that there's going to be 300 ice agents that are headed to rgv and del rio's sector uh that's just the start right now over 40 percent of border patrol agents are in these processing centers we got to get them back out on the field but this solely lies on joe biden's failed border policies yeah sheriff the the cartels are loving this uh distraction in the rio grande valley of thousands of people flooding into the country and pulling border patrol agents off the front line in texas tonight we saw in outside of el paso a border patrol agent was fired on 20 shots by the mexican side of the border in arizona where you are cartel activity has picked up substantially uh since january 20th uh 2021 so talk about that aspect of it there's the the immigration issue but then there's also the drug and fentional problem and this criminal element that is being emboldened in places like arizona well katie thanks for having me and what congressman gonzalez i wanna go say something real quick what he stated about the uh the bill him and senator cinema and others pushed national sheriff association supported them we thank them for what they're doing on that end when it comes to the southwest border katy it is a fracture a complete failed uh policy it's a fracture the the stats the political stats i i call them when it comes to how they're perceived in washington dc they're being avoided on the border they're real to us last month alone 220 000 legal entry 37 000 getaways you combine that totally since president biden's been president that's over three hundred thousand getaways a hundred thousand come out of my region of the state of arizona we are very concerned drugs are up hundred to three hundred four hundred percent the war on drugs we gotta get it backs it's coming because 250 people are dying every day of drug overdoses katie we're in a bad situation here on the border yeah i want to pull up some numbers on fentanyl on the screen because the federal government's job is to protect americans from foreign threats and we're seeing now that as of july 16th 8 500 pounds of fentanyl had been seized by customs and border protection so congressman this is this there's so many such a dynamic issue but the bottom line is that the bite administration is enabling cartel activity enabling drugs to pour into the country and aiding and abetting illegal immigration into the country and it doesn't seem like it's going to stop uh and despite the bipartisanship that you found in congress now you're 100 right katie you know while while joe biden is sleeping comfortably in washington dc determining if there is going to be a mass mandate you know in texas i've got families that are watching their game cameras to see you know if there's if there's migrants that are on their property as they're putting their children to bed i mean people do not feel safe in their homes in uvalde where i'll be on tuesday with representative fortenberry uh you've got you've got migrants jumping off the train uh record numbers and look it's dangerous to the migrants as well i mean they're dying horrible deaths you've seen it throughout so uh i urge the biden administration please get engaged for the sake of everyone involved the chaos that you've caused along along the border is is unacceptable it is an unacceptable indeed with lots of consequences congressman gonzalez and sheriff daniels thank you so much up next can

gentleman from Florida mr. Posey is the record class of five minutes thank you very much mr. chairman and ranking member for holding this hearing on the Administrative Procedures Act in general and astroturfing more specifically the creation of false impressions of widespread spontaneously arising grassroots movements in support or opposition to something is is in fact a real problem as you all have expressed and I'm glad there's more people aware of it you know number one most most people believe that their elected representatives make all the laws which is you know grossly inaccurate understanding of how this place and many state governments work they're unaware that in most cases most laws are made by unelected people Unruh khaliqul people unaccountable people and and they do it without having the statutory authority that they're supposed to have and they've been able to get away with doing that for decades I've read multiple times multiple sources at the odds of someone being hauled into federal court for violation of the law or a thousand-to-one in favor of it being a law ie administrative rule enforceable is the law that an unelected unaccountable bureaucrats that lawmakers actually passed it's I think the the biggest problem with the operation of our government if a federal employees caught stealing cash hopefully they're prosecuted if a federal employees caught stealing equipment whether it be a copy machine or a backhoe hopefully they're prosecuted but federal employees routinely steal the resources of hardworking Americans American businesses and American households with absolutely no consequence whatsoever and that's why we need to have some authority and and the astroturf FERS our partners in that crime by the way I believe you know every member of Congress gets a copy every day of the Federal Register which is mostly administrative rule proposed changes rules executive order - yeah and they range from sick from that thick to five a day this thick and I don't know a single member of the House or the Senate that reads them because we can't do anything about them we've abdicated total control to the unelected unaccountable bureaucrats and the only way we can change any rule that they make is to pass a bill in opposition to it and you all know how simple that is up here to do right dr. Bella mentioned the EPA I mean the EPA has outlawed the use of glider kits based on flawed information criminal information that's been been deemed false they won't change their rule you mentioned it that's just one of many the FDA how well-intended can you be but you want to put all the premium cigar manufacturers out of business so that children don't smoke premium cigars I guarantee you there's not a child in United States of America ever smoked two previous Agard they don't have the statutory authority to do that they've been confronted with it and instead of admitting they're wrong what do they do they give the industry of the finger and say we're going forward anyway even the CDC seems to have engaged trolls and astroturf first when they want issues forward so the last time Congress addressed the Administrative Procedures Act to change it to try and make it right they they basically said well you have to do a cost-benefit analysis on any called benefit analysis on any rule that causes over a hundred million dollar impacts so if you just impact every family in the United States by the total of nine hundred ninety nine million nine hundred cetera you don't have to do anything and of course a lot of the agencies don't comply with that requirement so you know it took eight years to fix this problem in one state and we haven't even started to kick off here maybe maybe this hearing will serve us a kick off mr. chairman and if it is I applaud you for that and almost running out of time here I wish I could tell you about what was fixed in Florida it's a riveting story that back doctor back doyon are you aware of any rulemaking processes that have gone into litigation based on alleged astroturfing i am not but we can certainly look into it and get back to you okay dr. belham i am not aware of any either is anyone okay it seems likely that mass comment campaigns will be seized on by a rule maker when they support a position that the rule maker has already embraced and otherwise ignored have any of you seen instances of that before your smiling I think we all have if we're honest about it but listen to vet it's not a phenomenon of new technology we always like the evidence that supports our point of view yeah okay hi mr. chairman say I'm out of time I yield back thank you

grow things exactly what you want to see how exactly all right let's get the Democratic response to president Trump State of the Union address last night joining us right now is congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland who serves as House Minority Whip and leader Hoyer it's great to see you thank you for being here today good morning thanks a lot good to be with you so tell us what you think the president laid out of speech that calls for bipartisanship this year you think that's going to happen well I called for bipartisanship I don't think any of us thought on our side of the aisle that was a very bipartisan speech one of the problems was it started out pretty smoothly but there's getting get pretty hardline as he went into a number of the issues that he discussed and of course criticisms of previous administrations in how he had changed we also think he made some pretty glaring misrepresentations about why the economy is where it is for instance on jobs as you know there were more jobs graded in 2016 than there were in 2017 there may be reasons for that but the fact of the matter is this president was advantaged by inheriting a growing economy an economy that was stock market had increased 300% between the end of the Bush administration and the and the end of the Obama administration so we were disappointed with the speech he says America's stronger I'm not sure that's the case I think and he said it was we could be proud we're certainly proud of being Americans but when you look at the respect that America has held in around the world and you see a very sharp decline on a very sharp decline in the confidence in America as the leader of the free world those I think lead us to being less confident as a nation in many respects and I think that the president's unpopularity or lack of popularity if you want to say it that way reflects Americans being disconcerted about how he's leading this country all right so I'll take that as a no when it comes to bipartisanship I think that to know would be appropriate as you looked at on our side of the island we didn't we didn't hear a lot of bipartisanship we heard some good things but not a lot of bipartisanship when it to where we see the economy right now where we see the stock market after the tax cuts what do you think the impact of just what we've seen this earnings season has been from tax cut clearly the stock market is up and I took somewhat fragile may perhaps although it's been a continuous rise over the last year that's positive news for but it doesn't really reflect I think what's happening in middle-class America and we think the tax bill as you know is going to create a great amount of debt it does give some moderate help to working people but it gives the overwhelming majority some eighty three percent of its benefits to the upper 1% of our country we thought and we believe and President Obama indicated we need to bring corporate tax rates down so that we could be competitive with the rest of the world so we think bringing those rates down was a good thing now whether or not we certainly didn't agree to bring it down that low because we think the debt that is going to be exploded and that's going to hurt the economy in the long term and hurt future generations long term standing help us with this you heard the president talk about the infrastructure plan he floated a number of 1.5 billion dollar a trillion dollars rather half half a trillion dollars more than the number that some people have talked about earlier some of the early drafts we saw we're talking about a two hundred million two hundred billion dollar federal fusion can you see a bipartisan way to get some type of new structured plan together here Joe clearly the Democrats seem to believe that we need to invest in infrastructure and we believe so I think there's not disagreement on that the issue is where you get the resources another 1.5 trillion dollars there was nothing in the speech that said how that was going to be raised how that was going to be gotten so that we could invest in the infrastructure the president proposed I certainly want to see the details of that the Democrats want to see the details of that what we don't want to see is an increasing exacerbation of the deep deep hole that we're creating for our debt with the one five trillion dollars from the tax cut 1.5 trillion dollars and infrastructure and other programs the president mentioned and is very substantial increase in defense but there are no ways that the president has indicated that we're going to be able to pay for that there for future generations apparently I'm just going to be pushed deeper deeper deeper into debt that's not that's not good for our country it's certainly not good for future generations so that was Andrews because if it was me you know I talked about the Terps to start out probably because we will always will always have will always have the Terps will always have boomer esiason you and I did you've got that yeah Perdue tonight which I'm you know I think I think really that good there anyway we'll see you know we've come close Joe and a number of times with Michigan yeah we play Michigan's state I guess this coming Sunday the fact of the matter is that we come close but we haven't gotten there yet of course we had to very substantial injuries right a lot of parody this year if you've noticed I don't I don't know you know I see Xavier you lose and then I see him beat great you know I don't it's like anybody could do anyway what I was gonna ask you that that was softening you up a little bit so that I could go to so five to five different responses I saw you know he's a Republican are kind of Ari Fleischer but he said that that is a sort of a representative of that there's no clear Democratic I don't know message or or candidate for 2020 and as we get closer everybody's gonna go further and further left until they actually fall off Dolph the face of the earth and I'm knowing you do you ever look at the geographic center of the Democratic Party right now and kind of look around and just say how did I get here what are you uncomfortable where it is right now so let me tell you the good news Joe from my standpoint okay I think you're going to see us when a lot a lot of moderate seats around the country moderate seats being seats that you go Republican or can go Democrat swing seat and I think we see throughout the country in many areas of the country and the opportunities take back seats that we've held or seats that Republicans are losing so I think you're going to see a balancing but I also think you're going to see a continuing unity of things that we think need to be done investment jobs investment infrastructure maintenance of healthcare for all Americans access which has been undermined substantially by this administration and by the tax bill where some 13 million people are going to lose health insurance as a result of that as premiums go up very substantially but I think that you're going to see a lot of moderate districts one to identity it sounds like you're saying you wish the party was less you know hasn't moved quite as far left here you're pushing the moderate Democrats are problem-solvers ultimately and that's what we're going to be focused on making sure that Americans particularly working Americans who we don't think we're very advantaged by this tax bill that working Americans have better jobs and a better future thank you thank you for your time today thanks a lot okay still no it was a big Boomer Esiason statue down there no Steny I've taken up a collection to try and get a waiver right sculptor the right person my guess is someday that will happen I think

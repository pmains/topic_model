move to strike the last word Gerald recognized for five minutes I rise today in support of HR 1737 a bill that will send a strong message to director Cordray and the CFPB efforts to go around Congress as original intent have not gone unnoticed I also want to thank mr. genta for his work on this bipartisan piece of legislation after issuing guidance in 2013 with zero input from Congress or industry if you have witnessed such an overreach by a federal agency as we were seen with CFPB and indirect auto lenders although the CFPB has zero oversight when it comes to an industry that my family has been involved in for 75 years the 2013 guidance was meant to intimidate auto dealers by intimidating banks that do business with them in a 2013 press release by CFP the director Cordray the bureau noted that consumers should not have to pay more for a car loan simply based on their race well as someone who has sold cars for 44 years I am a car dealer the comments about director Cordray are insulting and they have zero evidence to support them since releasing the guys in 2013 the CFPB has acknowledged they did not analyze or estimate the economic impact it would have on customers in addition an independent study commissioned by the American Financial Services Association found several significant flaws in the bureau's methodology which led to inaccurate incomplete and unreliable conclusions about pricing disparities in the auto finance market finally recent settlements between the CFPB and lenders such as a lie have highlighted the bureau's strong-arm tactics and inability to prevent fraudulent claims at a hearing a few weeks ago this committee heard testimony about the lack of oversight implemented by the CFPB when paying claims to those who are potentially discriminated against mr. gündüz bill would finally bring transparency and clarification to a process that has been neither HR 1737 has the support of the Texas Automobile Dealers Association and I ask unanimous consent to enter a support letter from them for the record without objection on behalf of 1,200 57 franchise dealerships in 284 cities and towns throughout Texas and the 90,000 Texans they employ I urge my colleagues to support this meaningful common-sense legislation in the end its reputation that matters to the auto dealers customers tell them that their prices are competitive and that their service is competitive not the federal government who I might add needs to look at its reputation I yield my time back gentleman yields back for what purpose of gentleman from Georgia seek recognition strike the last word gentleman is recognized for five minutes and

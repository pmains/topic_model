Thank You mr. chairman and kudos to you mr. berry for the double-clutching getting out of Groundhog we used to call it granny but you're probably more politically correct I my first question is to mr. Gillan and that is referred to before that we need to win the race to 5g what constitutes a win is that people covered businesses cover geographic area covered what constitutes a win dafak G for us it is that that next generation of innovation and opportunity happened here first so as a matter of having enough scale that we have enough entrepreneurs and innovators to build off that platform and so absolutely it starts with a number of people covered in a timely manner okay so that and by the way I would that's the definition of expect the number of people covered in one block in New York City is far more than the county I live in and my County is bigger than most the state's not most of a fair number of states so the question is is it how do we get how do we get five G into rural America I mean how do we how do we get it there the senator from Braska talked about you know precision farming but it's more than that so how do we get it there all right let me put it this way I'll be more specific will you commit to a pilot program for Montana on 5g I'm happy to work with your office and with something that looks like I think for us 5g starts with the densest area so it is places like Missoula it is town squares and that goes from there just like 4G and we continue to work on getting 4G more and more in Montana the job is not done by far okay so and I'm not picking on Verizon but I happen to have one of your phones in my pocket okay have you seen the map on the advertisement the Verizon puts up and by the way I think all of them were this way I'm picking on you because I forgot this have you seen that or advertisement yes sir do you agree with that map I've only had the chance to be in Missoula which had great coverage but I'm not doing the rest well let me tell you something Missoula and Big Sandy is a hell of a lot different say that and and and III it's a 75 mile drive for me to Great Falls from my farm and I bet I don't have coverage 25 miles and yet that maps Allred you don't talk about that just yes sir and I do appreciate the question and this is something that uh that National League of Cities and governments across the country are facing is that there's a real misunderstanding as to 5g especially when they ask states to preempt local governments with respect to deployment so the industry comes in and says we will have 5g in your communities and throughout the state and it's the next-generation broadband and we absolutely need it and really what they're doing is densification of 4G networks and in very dense local city areas for the most part just give you an example the state of Nebraska is currently debating a preemption small cell deployment bill the same as far to past last year and the city's led by the link city of Lincoln talked about lowering their rates for attachment to city-owned poles to city and county owned poles they were willing to reduce the rate from the market rate of about $2,000 per pole to $95 per pole if the industry would agree to build out the entire state over a reasonable period of time that isn't the problem the problem is did you look at these bars on this phone when I go home there are none right there are no bars on this phone so we're not even close to talking about 4G or 3G or any G where I live we're not even close I might be able to get a text message but unless I'm standing in the right corner of my house with my mouth held in the right action this phone does not work okay and it's that way I live in one of the more populated areas of the state go ahead well senator I get back to the eligibility map which and you raise a really important point it says it's covered yeah and it says a lot of places are covered yes what the FCC did was decide how do we fix that the FCC is wrong they screwed up we're getting screwed because they screwed up so how do we fix it well you've got to get better data and what they decided to was to collect data that was not what I would get the call could they collect some data who'd they collected from who did they collect it they they they requested perimeters for the data and information from all the carriers the carriers gave this to see exactly what they requested we suggested that that was the wrong conclusion what they chose was the recommendation from the two largest carriers on how to measure coverage and I'll tell you that in the last eight years the FCC is time and time again under very several administration's said we had 98% coverage throughout the entire United States well you made the statement your opening statement garbage in garbage out there's got to be a way to get the FCC's attention on this mr. chairman on this issue it's come up in almost every one of these questions we are not going to solve the problems of wireless broadband anything in rural America if we don't have good information and I would just say I've got 400 questions to ask you guys I'm not going to be able to do it so we'll put them in writing and you'll have a lot of work to do but the bottom line is is it if we don't get this right you know you're limited to 300 questions Riano okay I'll pair back to 299 with due respect but but the truth is I know there's plenty of folks out there that say things like why do these guys even live in rural America they did they knew they didn't have the coverage when they moved there I've got to tell you I looked at my grandfather's diary from 1915 and you're right he said you know damn it there's no cell coverage out here we got to do better folks when it's not working thank you

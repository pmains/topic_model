it's a hearing uh the general topic of the affordability of housing uh i will say that representing one of the most rural districts in america we've had these challenges even before covet and it's very very frustrating to see what the government response has been and actually how much worse it is here in the last year and a half i think talking about worker shortages yes talking about the energy crisis and all of these things that are that are triggering the supply chain crisis and uh we have a list here of the cost of fuel oil going up 98 and a half percent over the last year gasoline 60 percent and a list of several other items if you can find them at any price the fact that the new inflation rate says 9.1 percent uh actually that seems rather modest compared to what the actual feelings are for workers trying to fill their gas tank to get to work and i realize that some folks have the options of of mass transit not everyone does let me emphasize that and and i think that a one-size-fits-all approach out of washington or throwing more money at it more taxpayer dollars at these challenges i i think could very well trigger even more inflation and i hope we can avoid that i i do i commend many innovators i do have a a constituent business a renki manufacturing industrial nebraska they actually recently bought a local motel to transition that into temporary housing for their welders not to mention other workers to move to the community a very rural community so that they can begin work producing items that are hard to get these days and i i think that when you look at the building materials cost of concrete that's energy driven and i realize that a lot of the energy costs the the high energy costs are the results of bad policies here in washington and i think it's it's very hurtful to folks who can afford it the least across our economy we've heard about uh here in the discussion today passing reference to available capital whether it's the occupants of housing whether it's developers whether it's tax incentives but boil it down to available capital and i think there's a lot more we could do to discuss issues such as that but i i think we need to be very careful about using even more taxpayer dollars to to attempt to address this when it can it will likely do more damage than than help the actual problem and we we are now looking at tax hike proposals over there in the senate there's this 3.8 percent sur tax on small businesses and farms and ranches that the senate is considering i think that would be disastrous that would be the opposite thing we ought to do if we want to see more affordable housing among other products in our economy and and look at available capital that can do far more to address the problems we need to fix ebitda to ensure the interest expense on home construction is is fully deductible you know obviously we need to get folks back to work i was seeing numbers on the number of folks who have not returned to work since the 2008 crisis and i think we need to be mindful of that i salute to folks like the arizona home builders association who has a program we had hearing about this when i chaired the human resources subcommittee that they they stood up a training program in the prison system for workers in the building trades and we had a great bipartisan hearing a hearing from former inmates themselves who have who have benefited and so actually these these workers let me elaborate they had multiple job offers and and increasing wages right right after they were released from prison once they got into that job position though i know that the associated general contractors in my district they are major funders of a heavy equipment program at a community college in hastings nebraska the students come out of that program with multiple and substantial job offers i might add and that is a collaborative approach that i think has been especially productive very briefly mr pindo could you you know you've had a very comprehensive view of the housing market could you discuss what the impact of tax increases in worker shortages would be on actual home prices thank you for that question you mentioned the possible expansion of the net investment income tax to net business income anything that increases marginal tax rates including these stealth provisions that are sort of hidden and then they spring on top of other marginal tax rates are counterproductive and they're doubly counterproductive when applied to small business owners a key driver of economic growth and jobs but this would hit new construction particularly hard 63 percent of all home builders and two out of three specially trade contractors generate less than a million dollars a year in total business receipts according to the nh and ahb so this would just really decimate um the housing industry and it doesn't need that given um we need more supply not less

this is the bill it's only a page in not even two pages not even page and a half but the real change in law by the member of house democrat leadership chairman nadler says quote a chief justice of the united states and 12 associate justices any eight of whom shall constitute a quorum so in essence a hostile takeover of the united states supreme court not going through the traditional process that's been in place for over 100 years and i think the gentleman knows if you go back historically the president in power when the senate was held by a different party was led by a different party i can't recall a case in generations where if in the election year there was a vacancy in the supreme court it was filled and everybody in the country knew that that was an issue in the election of 2016. in fact it was probably one of the deciding issues that helped elect president trump was that there was that vacancy and the public wanted to be engaged in the direction of the country as well as the direction of the court it was it was absolutely a debated heavily debated item in the 2016 presidential election and president trump won that election but again i've never heard anybody suggesting changing the constitution to take away the senate's advising consent role but we do see here a bill that was filed just this week by a leader in the democrat party to have a hostile take over the supreme court similar to what's been done in socialist countries and i think it's important to point out how who's proposed those kind of changes in the past and what it's led to and i know president biden himself is on record many times criticizing heavily the idea of packing the supreme court now that was before he was president now that it would be him that would be able to appoint these extra judges i don't know if his positions changed but it's dangerous precedent it's the kind of precedent that exists in soviet-style nations i sure hope it's not here but mr nadler did just say yesterday when asked about speaker pelosi's position he said quote speaker pelosi and others will come along so i was just wondering if that was something that the gentleman was planning on bringing to the floor that would be a divisive issue as opposed to things that we could work together like infrastructure that would be unifying

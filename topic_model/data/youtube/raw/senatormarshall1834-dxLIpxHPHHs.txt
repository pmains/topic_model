congressman Marshall let me ask you about is very unusual to have an announcement sort of in the middle of a midterm election year like we saw today from the Speaker of the House does this portend do you think problems for your party this November no absolute absolutely not I'm sorry to disappoint you but I think this is a very personal decision for Paul it has nothing to do with Donald Trump it has nothing to do about the election when Paul came here he was a young single person they had three kids now that are better teenagers and Paul generally wants to go home and be more than just a Sunday dad that the Republican Party will be just fine as long as Nancy Pelosi is the face of the Democratic Party we're going to be okay on the Republican side does it concern you though when you look at the number of special elections we've seen all around the country since Donald Trump became president we've seen his approval rating sitting there in the high 30s in the low 40s you saw most recently in southwest Pennsylvania you're getting a new colleague there in Congress tomorrow a Democrat from a district that presidents Trump carried by 20 points in 2016 you've seen Democrats in so many of these special elections shaving 10 15 20 points off the Trump margin that doesn't concern you at all certainly it's a it's a wake up call for us but I think you need to be looking some other the other polling on all the generic polling the Republicans are closing the gap with maybe - 15 down to minus three to five down Trump's gonna carry a lot of states I think to be a Democrat in a state that President Trump won so I think I'm gonna take my hand the hand that's been dealt us any time over what the Democrats are facing going forward again though just on that point not to belabor it but your new colleague tomorrow is a Democrat from a state that President Trump won and from a district that President Trump won Connor Lam there from Southwest Pennsylvania that seems to suggest maybe Democrats are making some inroads there now I guess the US has seen a different election process than I saw I saw this new person run away from Nancy Pelosi I saw him run away from the Democratic Party if he votes the way he says he's gonna be voting he'll be voting with the room in caucus so when there's primary elections that are going to pull the Democrats to the far left it's going to really hurt the Democrats come to fall so again I'm very confident that we have a solid Republican majority going into the next 116 Congress what so what is gonna come next for Republicans Paul Ryan is stepping aside we're hearing Kevin McCarthy Steve Scalise these names being mentioned do you have a favorite right now who you'd like to see lead the party no I think what my focus at today is to keep our party together to circle the Wagen around Paul Ryan he's been a great leader I think we owe it to him to support him through the rest of this race I've heard through the I Paul and not on in January first and we're gonna do that Steve and Kevin are great people they're also going to help circle the wagons and if anybody tries to circumvent this will cut their legs out from under them we're gonna protect Paul Ryan make sure that he has accessible finish to Speaker of the House does that cause any additional difficulty though for Republicans out there trying to run for re-election in again you you may not be too worried about the environment but I've certainly heard some of your colleagues speak differently about it does the does it complicate things for Republicans strategically to have this opening at the very top at this point in election year you know I don't think so we have an incredible bench of leadership ready just a great group of people that'll step into this role I think it'll seem very seamless I think that the the leadership in this Republican Party shares the same goals with Paul Ryan and I think it really comes down to the the local level you know what is your representative how is the representatives relationship with with your own constituents I think the people that elected me elected me for who I was and what I stood for Kansas values and they they certainly respect Paul Ryan and he's certainly been up a great face for the Republican Party but we'll move on you know it doesn't end when when President Bush you know finished his here's a presidency up the world didn't in then and it won't in when Paul Ryan leaves as well but Paul's did a great job him and Jenna just been great mentors great friends Delana me very welcoming and I just

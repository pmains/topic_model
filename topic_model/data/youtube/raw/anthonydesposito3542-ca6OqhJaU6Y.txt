hi hamari I'm Dan Flavin Tana Henson supervisor I'm joined by dr. Dave Dave Dave Hubert head of emergency services here in the town of councilman Anthony T Esposito right now we're going through a health crisis and if we all remain calm and follow the advice we're be giving we will all get through this together simple things as washing our hands covering our mouth when we call social distancing and most importantly remaining at home instead of going out these are really important advice we're being told and we need to follow it when we all listen we can flatten this curve we can turn this around and we can all get better together but again the opportunity here tonight is to answer and ask some questions from a leading medical provider right here but the key thing again folks we need to remain calm but we need to listen we need to do things like not touch our face and that's difficult for a lot of us and we need to make sure we social distance these are the things that were being told and they need to be followed so again I'm joined here tonight by my colleague and that's first councilman Anthony D Esposito Thank You supervisor and dr. Dave and I don't think that we could reiterate enough that this is serious and we've seen in the news over the last few days that it's becoming more serious and I think as Don mentioned we really need to do our best to follow the protocol follow directions stay to ourselves keep that six-foot containment and really do our best to keep everyone healthy dr. Dave I just want to thank you I know I speak for my colleagues on the Town Board and for so many of us here that we are thankful for your guidance in your leadership during this coronavirus you know the catholic good said enough doctor you've done a great job helping residents who are watching at home but also providing great health advice and watching out for our here in the town and before we start I just want to say thank you to all the town employees that are out there working hard from sanitation to buildings to every department general services you all are doing a tremendous job and we're staying together we're a family and you know what we're all gonna be together in the end so let us start with doc maybe you could give us a little update on what's transpiring and a little advice for those viewers at home sheriff supervisor good evening everybody so the most important thing just to reiterate what the supervisor has been saying and the councilman is we all need to do our part this is you know I've been in emergency services for many years the councilman as well and our colleagues we need our civilian first responders every one of you out there watching today and watching this this video today is time for you to take your parts in the cause to get this corona virus under control to get that curb flattened as the supervisor was mentioning so these are the things we need you to do you it's scary I understand if people this is something we've never experienced in our lifetimes but we know what we can do to stop the spread of this virus we know what we can do to help and just keep ourselves safe keep our families safe keep our friends safe and socially we need to this is a social fabric keep all of our friends and families and neighbors and citizens safe so do social distancing this is not a joke it's not something that was made up well to some people it does seem like a skit from a comedy show it is for real this this virus is spread by direct contact that means that you're shaking your hands with somebody you're touching them you're hugging or kissing them eating next to them or being within a six foot radius for a period of time if you don't follow the recommendations to avoid direct contact you do have a possibility of spreading this virus and we're seeing now more and more that people are fighting to the hospital very sick and the hospitals are keeping up right now but we need to help them by not getting them overrun with any more patients than the sick ones they're already taken care of so you guys have to stay home stay home if you're sick there is no reason that you can't for me or two of your life stay in your homes don't go out and less for emergencies and stop the spread it's direct contact if you're not next to other people the virus has nowhere to go and then we start to get control of the situation that's rapidly expanding follow the directions for social distancing if you don't contact people then you're not going to be in trouble you're not going to be spreading the virus and finally as the supervisor and the councilman mentioned we need to take personal responsibility washing hands I carry Purell with me at all times you know we if you don't have access to hand sanitizer then soap and water make sure that you're constantly washing your hands you've done always have them clean and consider that your face is the danger zone this is how the virus enters it has to go through your eyes or through your nose or through your mouth so if you don't touch those parts of your face consciously every day think about not touching that even if there's someone sick around you you clean your hands you don't touch your face that's that's your protection that's your body armor that allows you to not get sick because you're not introducing the virus into your body so you have to we all have to take these steps to slow the spread of the virus if this is a crucial moment where where it can if either we're gonna get control of this or it could go on for a long time and so as a group we're gonna take care of each other we're going to do the things that we needed to stop the spread of this we're going to take responsibility stay home if we're sick and then we're gonna talk to you guys a little bit more try to get some additional tips I don't you guys want to anything else before we know I you know I do want the residents to know you know right now you know you're essential services are still being complied with you know the water is being provided the garbage is being picked up yes we've limited access here in Town Hall we're still have created a network of telephone numbers and email addresses you can visit on our social media pages to get inquiries at the building department the clerk's office the receivers office but again following the doctor's advice follow the mandates of New York State to help stop the spread of this we've taken precautions and it's both for the residents at home as well as for our co-workers here we're here to provide the answers one of the questions we see doctor a lot of people are saying what's a temperature that you should be a little more concerned that if you see it on your thermometer on your head scanner okay so self monitoring we should all be doing that as well and that's what the supervisor is asking in this question so basically with a thermometer you should be checking your temperature at least once a day better twice a day and we're finding that some people are getting what would be considered a low-grade fever so you know realistically anything higher than 99.5 you should keep an eye out anything more than 100 point four that's definitely a fever if you do develop a fever do not panic first things first don't go outside stay your social distancing don't have direct contact with other people then the next step you should do is call your doctor call avert the plenty of options of virtual urgent cares now you want it you want to not just immediately go to a hospital or to an urgent care or to a doctor's office if you have mild symptoms it is very safe if you have mild symptoms and you check your temperature and you have a low-grade fever to take care of yourself at home we have to save the hospitals and save the doctors offices for the sicker patients people that are just feeling symptoms like symptoms that you may feel from this in addition to the fever may have a cough you may have a runny nose a congestion in your in your sinuses you may develop nausea vomiting you may develop diarrhea interestingly a lot of people are complaining that they're losing their sense of taste and smell and you may have abdominal pain or pain in your back called flank pain all of these could be symptoms of coronavirus if you get those symptoms and you're not having serious symptoms stay at home do not panic call your doctor find an urgent care and lots of options virtual urgent care and to treat yourself at home we really it's really important that we do this as a group that we don't take you know don't take up the spaces in the hospitals with complaints that aren't emergent make sure you're going with serious problems so that way you know and there's lots of resources that have been put together now for everybody in India that you can get access to tell what health and these things so use those resources that's the best way to take care of things if you start to develop a fever and you're not sure what to do great well I think this is a question I know there was something that we addressed the supervisor and I and my colleagues on the Town Board were in support of and we appeared with our receiver of taxes Janine Driscoll earlier this week what supervisor I'm sure you could answer this best after your decades in the receiver of taxes office Henry is asking if the second half school taxes due date is being extended the the councilman the receiver as well as the Town Board asked the governor to extend the time period to pay taxes your second half school taxes it's due generally may 10th this year it's the 11th because it's a weekend we've asked the governor to extend it we haven't gotten a response yet we are very very hopeful and we're staying on top of it following up I spoke to the governor's law representative today and he says they have the they're waiting for an answer from the governor we're hopeful because right now the last thing people should have to worry about is paying their property taxes right now people should be following the doctor's advice staying indoors you know you know maintaining that distance you know 55,000 people a year come to the tax office we don't want that so Henry and all the other people out there as soon as we get information if that payment is going to be delayed we will get it out there and we're very hopeful the governor will do the right thing and extend that tax payment okay another question someone's asking is you know with when we're providing the advice to stay home try to do telemedicine or you know go to the hospital if you are really feeling the symptoms one of the questions was you know why do we why do people at home keep seeing the numbers on the news and I think it's important to point that that the town of hempstead doesn't provide those numbers those come from I guess how long are common yeah it's the county health department but I guess if you can explain a little as to why they're sharing the numbers and why we're encouraging people that unless you are really symptomatic and having to hold breathing that we're trying to keep the hospital's sure so we are in pots of communication up with the Health Department as the town's physician I basically am talking to the director and the Commission over there on a near-daily basis if not a few times daily this is important because this has to be a coordinated response starting with you as our civilian responders going up through all of our first responders police fire and EMS and all our doctors and nurses and medical providers and obviously the other the leadership in the town to make sure that we're providing everyone with the essential services so the question is to you know when should you call for help and the best answer to that is the symptoms that I would say are concerning that you really need to go to a hospital or see a doctor any increasing shortness of breath and sometimes the people that get sick they get sick rapidly if they're going to get sick and they develop shortness of breath if you feel like you're having trouble breathing not a discomfort not a cost but actually the air is not going in and out or you feel like you cannot get a deep breath do not hesitate that is an absolute reason that you need to seek medical attention immediately also with the some people getting nausea and vomiting and diarrhea they can get dehydration from that so if you're unable to keep down fluids or you're having a lot of vomiting and you feel that you're getting dehydrated in the week that also is extremely important that you seek out medical attention so most people that get this it's just like a bad flu they have their body aches their sense of smell goes away they have a fever but otherwise they are okay they take tylenol and that's important also there's some literature saying that anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen may make this worse so stick with tylenol that's your best bet the people they get really sick from the anti-inflammatories seem to be more the hospitalized ones but there's no reason that we shouldn't follow those recommendations for you at home and then that's always the second part of the question I guess why the coyote is sharing the numbers now so it's important that the county is sharing those numbers because you as the public need to understand that this is real those numbers are doubling every two to three days that the curb that the supervisor was mentioning earlier that's how we're tracking one of our biologists here in the town is actually helping us as the is the EMS staff providing us with the intelligence so that we are following that the department and this county released those numbers so we are able to tailor our response from your end that should just indicate to you that this is serious that we must do the things that we're talking about don't get overly concerned about the numbers that's more for us to take care of as medical professionals but it just gives us an idea of if our our interventions are working and gives us that idea of what resources we have to bring to make sure that we can take care of everything for you guys so just you know watch the news listen to our recommendations stay at home any symptoms that seem to be really serious that's when you go for us you'll go to the hospital and if you have serious symptoms do not hesitate to ask for help just stay at home if you don't have something you know serious sometimes a lot of people want to know if they want to get tested how would they go about it so as we mentioned earlier that the last time you were here and I believe independent that I'm sorry I dropped but just to follow up on the super fighter's questions I think it's sort of a two-part because I see them coming in now not only how should they get tested but when they should decide to get tested how's everyone get tested or should we be saving the test for those who are in okay I'm real so first off that they are still a shortage of tests now not because we're not receiving them but because more and more people are going to get tested so that still is a little bit in flux the Jones Beach test site which I believe we have up on our website that phone numbers so if you go to our website that phone numbers on there that that is still the best of Avenue to get tested you can also reach out to your primary care doc hospitals do have the tests but they are saving them for the most sick to make sure that we are treating people appropriately when they come into the hospital and urgent cares also have those tests the tests aren't extremely important for us as medical professionals to make sure that we are treating the proper people and that we are quarantining or asking people to self quarantine to stay at home for the contacts of people that have corona virus even though we have community spread right now we still want to slow the spread that's why we're doing all stuff that we're talking about so you don't if you have symptoms of a viral syndrome and it seems like it's coronavirus and you're at home and you are quarantine youself at home and you've let your direct contact know that they should keep an eye out and they should stay home the test is not going to change your outcome what we need to do is save those tests for the very sick and for those that are in the hospital so we can use them or as physicians sometimes if we're unsure because the symptoms of coronavirus can sometimes be multitude of different symptoms we'll use that to help direct care but as as the public you do not need the tests in order to get yourself better so save those tests for us as healthcare professionals let us decide who needs to get those tests the most eventually hopefully we'll have access like they did in South Korea through lots of tests they are actually able to get those as an over-the-counter test at a pharmacy in in South Korea they tested a large number of their population over a quarter million people got tested we are not to that capability yet at the point we are then it would make sense that everyone get tested because then it would be a lot easier to keep the people home that have it but until then keep the tests for the healthcare providers keep the tests for our first responders keep the tests for the truly sick and make sure that again from the social justice perspective that we're working together as a team and we're not using tests that we need to really get the sick people better I think one of the questions that's popped up is and I guess it's focused more on our employees but not really because you know it involves anyone who visits Town Hall and I don't think there's really an answer for it because as we've talked about in the past week or so this is really unraveling each and every day but people are asking you know when when do you think things will get back to normal when do you think Town Hall will be open again when do you think kids will be able to go out onto those baseball fields and I don't think we really have an answer right now yeah I mean I mean company the answer to people asking those questions is minimum a few weeks we are hopeful if people do the social distancing if we take the step we're taking the slow to spread that that after a few weeks they may be able to release some of the more you know restrictive rules and regulations that we're following now with businesses being closed and restaurants being closed and obviously you know as medical professionals I hear this every day that it's an effect on the economy and we understand but but if we don't stop this now and this persists for not weeks but months that will be a much greater hit on our economy so sometimes you know like like you have this isn't cancer but as sometimes in cancer you have to give chemotherapy to take care of the problem and then that gives the body a chance to fight it off on its own so it's something similar here we need to take steps that are inconveniencing ourselves now because if we do that you know shorten the length it'll make it less people sick it will allow our hospitals to function properly it'll allow mergency services not to get overloaded and then you know in a few weeks once we're getting better then then they can make those decisions but if we don't take those steps now and it continues to get worse it could be a lot longer than that so we're very hopeful that people listen to this message please do what asking of you it's very very important more importance probably that you can do right now than anything we've ever asked the civilians in our town to do the town of hempstead and our neighboring towns if they're watching we can make a difference if you guys follow these rules it's this is the time to act is it the time to be our civilian first responders this is time to look out for others make sure we have each other's backs it's really important one one thing I've tried to stressed it to everybody would work in the town if you do not feel well don't come in don't come in and and I can't stress that enough to people and it's just something I hope you can reinforce to to everybody out there that you know either works in the town works in another job about the importance of if you're not feeling well you know not going out and just remaining home and taking that extra step you know because it really in the end can make such a big difference yeah absolutely supervisor you know we know one should be going to work said I know we have this work ethic in a matter and I mean I can tell you that you know as a doctor you know even we're not immune to the fact that sometimes you know you have to go to work and you feel a little under the weather and you know you're gonna power through and prove that you know that you're strong and but but this is not the time to be doing this that have an extremely low threshold if you're having any symptoms then stay home yeah take a day or two you feel better great you take a day or two and you develop a fever awesome but no one wants to be the one to spread this to somebody else especially if that person you spread it to ends up having a life-threatening complication or dying and you realize that that you contributed to the spread of that that is not something anyone should have to have on their conscience it's it's literally that serious so if you we all do this together and do what we're supposed to be doing we'll watch each other's backs and we won't have to have these conversations much longer but but it's just don't go to work second do not touch your face wash your hands social distancing don't treat this like a vacation I can't iterate reiterate this enough right now how important this is and doc I think you know anybody who's I guess been involved in emergency management we all know that everybody handles stress very differently and I think one of the questions that's popped up and I think it's a great question you know this is a stressful time not only who are the people on the frontlines but those who are home because they're nervous they're scared they have people in their lives loved ones who could be vulnerable so some tips that you may have to maintain good mental health while staying home yeah doing social distancing is it okay to get out there and keep your distance and take a nice walk around the block is it okay to jump on your bike I think these are all questions and there's sort of mixed messages that people are getting yeah so and counseling that means just to what you're saying this is a stressful time for all of us if this is this is an unprecedented situation that no one in our lifetimes have seen the the last time we had any kind of pandemic similar to this was the flu pandemic in 1918 so we're talking hundred years ago so only the people that are sent Ariens right now would understand what Spanish flu was in 1918 and that was it and thankfully that that 1918 pandemic killed millions of people we're not going to see that from this but we don't want anyone to or have a bad complication so so you know if you have a chance read about the Spanish Flu understand that while this is not as deadly it is still very deadly to those that get sick but this should not stop us from living our lives you we have to maintain our social fabric we have to maintain some sense of normalcy before I came over here tonight I was vacuuming my house and petting my cat because you know I have spent and all of us have been multiple hours a day working on this I'm working this evening that's why you see me in my scrubs and so you know what we have to take personal time it you reach out you know between social media and the phone I can't tell you I have been talking to people I knew 25 years ago reaching out making sure that I'm okay reaching out to our EMTs so look out for each other take care of our first responders take care of our you know take care of our doctors and nurses and pas and techs and all the people on the front lines and and it's okay to go outside as long as your social distancing you know we don't want a million people in a park we want one person taking a walk you know you want to go out and walk your dog around the block as long as you're not directly in contact with people being outside is not dangerous but it's population density if you're in densely populated areas if you're in parties if you're in in rooms we have multiple people that's where it's easily spread if you have fresh air around and you want to take a bike ride or you want to you know you want to take a walk as long as you're not around other people then it's perfectly fine to do that I mean I mean you need to do some things to keep your sanity you need to make sure you acknowledge that this is a stressful situation and you know you know don't lash out at people a lot of times when you're stressed you internalize it and then you get upset and get angry it's okay to be stressed we need to explain and talk to each other and be open that yeah I'm stressed but we're gonna get these together that just like after Hurricane sandy when you know we were we took a huge hint and it was the worst thing that we had seen probably before this and you know and and we all took together we all got together as a community and helped each other and to recover it's going to be the same thing now so just just you know call the seniors at our home call your family members just you know we have lots of ways to keep me in touch with people and then that's how you keep your think on a similar note we'll haul though that we're encouraging people to try to keep as normal of a life as possible like you mentioned we also need to follow the rules of protocol in place I mean if you're gonna pack people into a park if you're gonna pack people onto a boardwalk there's going to unfortunately be repercussions and we're not going to be able to have it anymore right and I just want to point out our partners in government in New York State have AK Ovid 19 emotional support hotline and the number is 184 4 8 6 3 9 3 1 4 so that's 180 4 4 8 6 3 9 3 1 4 you know we had a couple of questions about some of the town services and again we go back to the fact that in the interest of our co-workers as well as a residents we're limiting access right here in the Town Hall so what we've done is we've created a an auto attendant hotline where you can dial 5 1 6 8 1 to 3600 and you'll be able to log in to or leave a message with the clerk's office or the building department or the tax office or the parks department and somebody will call you back let it be any question or an application you're looking for in addition to that through the building department we are having a staff call up and walk people through the permits we're trying to provide as much service as we can while also recognizing we don't want people coming here we don't want people out as the doctor said we're trying to take every precaution and it's really been a great two-way street the residents have been incredibly understanding and we're very very fortunate we work with some amazing people here in the town and I know many of you watching and I know Terry's watching right now this is an amazing workforce and I want to thank all of you I cannot stress this again I understand you know this this is a tough time for all of us and so many of you are coming in you're essential you're doing your jobs and I recognize that stress and and the board and all of us can't thank you enough and the residents can't as well because it's really important what you're doing and you need to recognize that because we definitely do on a sidenote the doctor was also talking about I took I took the time to go out to a store and a lot of the stores have food again a lot of them have groceries out there and they're taking steps of limiting the number of people who go into a store so I know like last week and in particular that stress level you talked about and I felt that we all felt it you know what you can take that that ability now to go out and get some some groceries some fresh you know vegetables some fruit but also it's nice to see the stores are recognizing that they're limiting the number of people out there you know we want people to get Adam and the councilman touch base on it we've limited some of our parks we don't want you playing basketball we don't want you playing tennis we don't want the kids in the gym equipment we want to have to give you the ability to get out there and maintain some Saturday because I recognize it as well as you I mean you know the doctor here as far as I'm concerned your your tireless you're working during the day with us you're at night you're at the hospital and to think before you go to the hospital you here trying to provide some answers to the residents and we're very very grateful for that but if you do have those questions you can also go to the town website and we've created individual links you can email those departments with with any questions and we'll try and provide you with the timely answer to give you those services you may need councilman I really just want to say thank you as well not only I know I said before but I know I speak on behalf of my colleagues on the Town Board to say thank you to each and every member of CSEA 880 for the work that you're doing whether you're here or whether you're working from home whatever the case may be we appreciate it and to everyone else I mean the town of hempstead is the largest township in America we are a diverse town and whether it is the cops and the firemen and EMS whether it's the medical professionals at the hospitals or the doctor's office or it's the people the grocers that are working grocery stores everyone is dealing with stress in different ways and everyone has loved ones and family at home that they also need to worry about and I just you know you know we always say that in some of our darkest times it really brings out some of the best in people and I just you know so all of you listening listening at home to all of you who are away from their families for extended periods of time to make sure that our neighbors are kept safe and healthy it's appreciated more than anyone could imagine and like the doctor said like supervisor Clavin said if we stick together if we follow the rules you know there's some rough days ahead no doubt but you know we have brighter days ahead and we'll get through this and I really hope and pray that what we've gone through makes us all better people makes us a healthier world and a safer Township yeah absolutely and just really quick guys so you know and the many roles that I've been playing with the town

[Music] [Applause] you can tell that man behind the mask is rand paul a bunch of protesters descending on the kentucky senator and his wife kelly as they left the senate the president's rnc speech from the white house actually it was a longer trip than that he joins us right now for his first live interview since that confrontation uh senator good morning that looks scary yeah you know my wife and i it was horrific you know we had two women with us who were friends of ours we had looked out you know we came out of the speech at the white house we looked into the street our hotel was only right across the street from the white house but we couldn't go because the mob was already chasing people down that chose to go out that exit so the secret service says get on a bus and ride to the trump hotel so we got on a bus it took 45 minutes to get through all the mobs we get there safely and then we say we'll get an uber to go all the way back where we came from and we wanted to be dropped off at the hotel but as we got close to it the streets were blocked and no one would let us through and what happened is there was two blocks and i regret that i made this decision but i said we're gonna walk the two blocks we walked one block but as we walked one block we could see some police in the distance but we also saw a mob of about 30 people marching and yelling they all of a sudden saw me right as we got to the policeman fortunately or i don't think we'd have survived we got to the policemen and i the policemen i don't think recognize me and as they came closer they were shouting my name and the crowd doubled to 60. and then it doubled again to 120 and as they were surrounding us and it got closer and closer and everybody kept pushing back the policemen were forming a barricade with their bodies i whispered to the policeman they know who i am you've got to get reinforcements it's going to get worse he called for reinforcements but we didn't get any reinforcements we waited but the crowd was getting bigger and bigger and pushing in there were yelling threats they were trying to push the police over to get to me they were grabbing at us and it got worse and worse and worse and then finally we decided to make a move i said we've got to move it there's not going to be reinforcements we have to try to get to the hotel which was another block and they were shouting threats you know to us to to kill us to hurt us but they're also threat saying shout shouting say her name briona taylor and it's like you couldn't reason with this mob but i'm actually the author of the briona taylor law to end no knock raids so the irony is lost on these idiots that they're trying to kill the person who's actually trying to get rid of no knock raids and they were shouting and screaming and just it really these people were unhinged but i can't tell you how i'm not sure we would have made it so as we're walking sort of surrounded by the police they're attempting to push the police over to get to me so at one point they push a policeman backwards he stumbles and he's trying to catch his balance and i catch the back of his flak jacket to stabilize him and you know make sure that he's okay because he's our defense i mean if he's down the mob's loose on us and you've seen the pictures of what they do to you if the police are not there if you defund the police if we become portland if america becomes portland what's going to happen is people are going to be pummeled and kicked in the head and left senseless on the curb that would have happened to us i promise you had we not had the d.c police to support us i mean we are thankful that we have police and we've got to wake up we can't have the whole country we can't have joe biden rule the country and have no police i mean it we can't walk down the street in dc safely now that's how bad it is i i saw one police officer was actually using his bicycle uh to try to uh to keep the crowd back he fell into you you almost stumbled and fell down you and your wife are both okay right we are we were unharmed but you know it's still going on this morning there's still mobs in the street blocking the streets and i know it sounds like over the top to say that people are from out of town but i think we're going to find out that these people are hired and from out of town specifically in our case i believe there are going to be people who are involved with the attack on us that actually were paid to come here are not from washington d.c and are sort of paid to be anarchists yeah and this is disturbing because really if you're inciting a riot that's a crime but if you're paying someone to incite a riot that person needs to go to jail as well but we can't live this way it's getting worse and worse you know i like being free to be able to walk out and go for a walk in the park we cannot go outside now it's become so dangerous for us and i don't hear joe biden or kamala harris saying one thing about the violence this mob is their voters this is the new democrat party and if we don't resist this the united states is going to become portland we're going to become chicago all of these failed cities democrats have run the president said in his speech if we allow them to take over the white house we are going to become portland that's the country will be on fire we have to have law and order we have to support the police you know i i can't say that strong enough senator uh some of the papers today are reporting that what is what was being yelled at you was as you said say her name say her name brianna taylor um you know you said there were obscenities i would not like you to repeat those but you said there were threats tell us what the threats were well the threats were to f you up to you know to kill you the threats were if they could get hold of you and i truly believe this with every fiber of my being had they gotten at us they would have gotten us to the ground we might not have been killed we might just have been injured with by being kicked in the head or kicked in the stomach until we were senseless you've seen the pictures most of the networks will not show the the pictures of this this is happening in all of our cities it's got to stop and thank god for the police had we not gotten to the police i truly believe that the police saved our life and we would not be here today or we'd be in a hospital today had the police not been there and i'd like to thank them if they're watching this you know we thanked them last night but it was still a melee they were still trying to get people you know away from us even in the hotel people were following us into the hotel well let me ask you this as an exit question given the fact that you said the that these people are still on the streets protesters are still on the streets and i we heard from griff jenkins about a half an hour ago that apparently a number of the businesses in washington dc are boarded up because they're worried about trouble going forward does a prominent republican like yourself somebody who is very recognizable need to have security to simply walk on the streets of washington dc or major cities in america probably yes from now on i don't feel it at home at home people are so friendly i can go to the grocery store and i want to live you know the life of a normal person where i go to the grocery store and buy groceries or stop at the minute mark and at home i do feel that but this also isn't normal there's something going on here this is like the fbi needs to be involved what do you mean something's going on senator what do you mean something's going on you've got a feeling tell us what you think my feeling is is there is interstate criminal traffic being paid for across state lines but you won't know unless you arrest them otherwise you just think oh these are the you know some normal hoodlums from a big city i promise you that at least some of the members and the people who attacked us were not from dc they flew here on a plane they've all got fresh new clothes and they were paid to be here it is a crime to do that and it needs to be traced the fbi needs to investigate but the only way you can do it is you have to arrest people and usually we say oh well you didn't get hurt so we're not going to arrest them they were inciting a riot and they would have killed us and the police not been there they all need to be arrested and i'm not saying forever but they need to be arrested questioned they need to say where are you staying and the the bills need to be subpoenaed by judge to say who paid for your bill how did you get here on a plane and staying in a fancy hotel and yet you're acting like a criminal something's going on here and it's much bigger than people think but the bottom line is we can't let the united states become portland and that's what my fear is that the united states is going to be on fire if we have no police and look i've been for reform i've authored 22 criminal justice reforms they were yelling at me you we're not going to let you go alive unless you'll say out loud you're for criminal justice reform and i'm like you idiot you are so dense that you have no idea that i've been a leading advocate for criminal justice reform with president obama with president trump and you're going to try to kill me and i've been trying to help the problems and so this is what's sad but it's such lawlessness if we have this kind of lawlessness i would say people are going to get killed people have been killed you know the the the former police chief his story was you know so sorrowful to listen to his wife last night that was killed in st louis you know the little girl sicoria turner eight years old was shot in the middle of the day in atlanta because they took a wrong turn but the police they had let the they had let the mob take over a street corner armed we can't let our cities be taken over by these marauders and thugs well we are glad you are safe you and your wife kelly and we thank you very much for coming on to tell us our story your story

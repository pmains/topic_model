considering these potential impacts on savannah georgia on our naval facility at king's bay on our barrier island chain cumberland island sapolo island tybee island it is vital in my view and i know i've discussed this with the chairman as well that this upcoming infrastructure bill includes significant investments in coastal resilience to help communities in coastal georgia and coastal communities across the country prepare for increased flooding worse tropical storms increased storm surge events can you speak to the kind of infrastructure that will help communities like savannah georgia adapt to what's coming so that's a great question um we have a whole host of solutions at least from the engineering and science community and then i would suggest that we for every specific location we need to do a deep study on on the hazards that these areas are facing and what sort of solutions need to be taken now and one point here also i would like to make is that there the risks we are facing are dynamic not aesthetic so we need to have strategies that are adaptive in time meaning that some of the actions we need to take now and but some of we need to also have uh plan for sustained funding so that as we hear more about the from the earth science community and climatologists about the trends of the future climate we are able to make decisions on the goal and improve the state of infrastructure further the type of solutions that might be available now for for coastline communities can range from nature based systems to flood walls and levees to improving the storm water collection systems to elevating homes and or buying out some of the houses in the flood plains and the the good news is that the benefit to cost ratio for many of these measures are very high and it's highly justified to take those actions thank you dr shafiz with the chairman's permission just one final question uh for you dr cletus please the impacts of climate change and these events will not be uniformly distributed low-income communities vulnerable communities communities in the flood plain communities who already live in under-resourced neighborhoods dilapidated housing will be more severely impacted i'm thinking for example of the gichi communities along georgia's coastline descendants of west african slaves brought to georgia and other parts of the southeast to work in coastal plantations who still endure a high level of poverty these communities are going to be hit the hardest what can we do to ensure that our investments in coastal resilience help and protect those who are most vulnerable dr cletus thank you dr also i think you raised a very very important point and what's most important is that we understand that we need to engage with these communities directly they need to be at the table as solutions are being developed that will benefit them because they have very good ideas of what can work and what can't as you pointed out they're places like st diamonds and tybee island where we have thousands of homes that are at risk from chronic inundation we have places like brunswick where nearly one half of the residents are african-american nearly one-third live below the national poverty line it's projected to have more than 800 homes at risk of chronic flooding which would put 20 percent of its property tax base at risk so we have to make sure that we are deliberately allocating funding programs and policies to these communities reducing the barriers to access many of these communities are underinsured uh they're they're not able to navigate the bureaucratic red tape to get assistance uh recent research has shown that fema funding is disproportionately uh inequitable along racial and income lines this is very very troubling we need to be tracking this data to make sure that the people who need access to these resources are first in line thank you dr kwedus thank you mr chairman thanks and also senator van hollen for

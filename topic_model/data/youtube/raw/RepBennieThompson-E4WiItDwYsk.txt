well you thought your passport mug shot was horrendous well it's not as bad as the confusing travel rules and the wait time just to get your travel document now there is concern that the passport pandemonium is creating economic harm in washington congressman vinnie thompson the chairman of the homeland security committee and sir thank you for being with us today thank you for having me well you wrote a a an editorial recently calling uh what's going on right now passport pandemonium what do you think happened here well i think uh state department officials and dhs officials did not anticipate the volume of the requirement for passports for people going to mexico the caribbean and bermuda and and not anticipating it we had the lines uh members of congress had uh their telephone lines jammed with people calling saying they can't get passports for travel what do you worry the economic impact could be from this well we've talked to people in the caribbean and they're concerned that uh travel will be canceled as you know for many of those areas where we require transfer passports tourism is their number one economic engine so uh there is very much the potential uh for loss to occur uh i'm happy that congress looked at it uh passed an extension so that people will not have to have passports uh in the interim uh to be honest with you our officials are going to have to do better at anticipating things like this you know congress said congressman that from the department of homeland security might very well be that they don't have enough money to fund some of these things could congress give them more money to try and get this accomplished more quickly well i think one of the things we're doing uh in the homeland security budget we've busted up over 2.1 billion dollars uh to fill in a number of the gaps hopefully that will do it but in the interim uh as you know we've suspended the passport requirement which should in effect uh get the ball neck out of the way uh it will get worse over time as you know because our land and sea borders will also have this requirement so we're going to have to put some 800 new employees in place uh in anticipation of this new rush of people to get passports what about the pushback from people who are worried about defense and who say that we should not be waiting until 2009 to actually be checking our borders so closely well the uh they're absolutely correct but the issue is we don't have the technology or the manpower to do that if we did it lions would be long if we did it the economic harm to those countries would be far more significant than what they are today all right congressman thank you for joining us today we appreciate it again representative thompson now let's hear from the homeland security department on this joining

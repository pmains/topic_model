Supreme Court is to promote their own policy promote their own values they enjoy legislating from the bench and server does don't really see it that way we don't actually look at judges okay you're conservative you're liberal we look at you whether you're going to follow the Constitution and you're going to interpret the law accordingly that's the right way to look at a Supreme Court justice Rick Cavanaugh clearly does that there's really nothing to indicate otherwise this idea that his temperament as bad he's thirty years as a judge his temperament was was was was laudable this entire time and then of course you attack him with these terrible terrible accusations and and he gets a little upset about it and we're all surprised and we attack his temperament I just think that reeks of of tariffs terrible partisan politics 30-second response yeah me look I agreed the Supreme Court process has become highly partisan and that's unfortunate the Supreme Court is that article three branch to the government I mean this is something that should be above politics but it's been hijacked by the process and that you know there's no doubt at all of it you know how we move for as a country is going to be key judge Cavanaugh I believe again he lied about certain things in his past history about you know teenage drinking and things of that nature but if he's gonna lie about stuff like that we've got to take a big look at this at the big picture this is the highest bar to the highest court in the land and he wasn't a judge for 30 years he's been adjust for about 10 years I mean so you know he had a good record but the ABA dropped him down a level on this he didn't he didn't ask for a full investigation from the FBI last week and he could have done that that would have helped us find the truth Gant crenshaw 30 seconds oh my god well listen going back to these same points you know that this again this this idea that prick Cavanaugh's lied about his record in high school that we should be examining his yearbook in his calendar and examining exactly what he meant by drank too much what we all mean by drank too much can we all just agree that this is this is getting into really ridiculous territory it really is and I think I think it's just so transparent and so obvious what the Democrats have done with this I mean it's gone beyond partisan politics it really has it it's just it's just unfortunate to see okay next question Republican candidates across the country are trumpeting the economic impact of GOP tax cuts citing historically low unemployment and healthy growth in GNP Democrats warned that this prosperity has been bankrolled with trillions of borrowed dollars and is highly unlikely to pay for itself by generating additional revenue from growth dancringe all you have expressed hawkish views on government spending is the tax cut justified well get listen if we're gonna look at whether the tax cuts are doing good for our economy doing good for our society it's best to look at the results it's best to look at the numbers so we have three point nine percent unemployment right that's the best and I don't even know when we can remember over four percent consecutive GDP growth also a great number that creates more business it creates more investment creates more jobs we have almost three percent wage growth and Texas I think is even better especially in you know in Texas out of the top 15 cities in America with the best economies right now five of them are in Texas you know why because we have great we understand that low taxes and low regulation actually work we're seeing consumer confidence at all times high we're seeing that the stock market at an all-time high we're seeing small business Optimum's optimism at an all-time high I don't see how any of these things are bad okay yes about the debt we should absolutely be concerned about the debt or we got half the equation right let's cut taxes but we're not tackling the debt the way we should well let's talk about what actually causes that is it really is it really lower taxes I don't think any text and believes that their taxes are too low what it really is is mandatory spending almost 70% of our spending is on mandatory site that Social Security Medicaid Medicare and interest on the debt now my generation is gonna have to pay for this our kids generation is gonna have to pay for this it's completely unsustainable and we're looking at good policy we have to ask what is sustainable know what makes sense what common sense solutions do we need to implement in order to put ourselves on a solid financial and fiscal footing all right again my generations can have to pay for this stuff so I want to tackle the hard problems I know my generation is ready to do that we need government policies that are sustainable and makes sense and then our pro-growth all right we never thought we'd actually see almost three percent annualized growth which is probably what we're looking at for this fiscal year that was laughed at okay but we're looking at doing it right now and you know I talk to businesses all the time on the campaign trail they're very happy with where we're at and I think we should continue down that path but we do have to tackle spending so let's do it Tod looting this massive tax cut a good thing or recipe for disaster you know I had problems with the tax cut for for several reasons one it did blow you know a fiscal hole in our budget which is gonna add significantly to the national debt a couple trillion dollars over the next ten years I don't think it makes any sense there's not one person who can say they're fiscally conservative or even responsible who voted for this tax bill that's just not the way it works the other big issues I have with the tax cut in particular were it was so focused on corporations you know the stock market's at an all-time high corporate earnings are all-time high those are great things but why give corporations massive tax cuts and make them permanent and give people who I talk with every day on Texas to smaller tax cuts and you don't make them permanent to begin with they're trying to work on that right now but they're not permanent yet so I looked at that and thought why are we doing it this way we we need to help our people get back to where they were before Oh 1809 and the Great Recession that occurred then too many people are struggling to get back to those places if corporations were investing in their people if they're increasing wages salaries instead of just giving them bonuses that would make sense but for our economy to really get going we need to invest in our people we didn't make sure they have the skills the education the training they need to plug into our economy and a significant way to get real careers and not just you know a Jo B job I mean this is something where we've got to work to ensure that people are able to get plug in whether it's through community colleges well as to unions or business apprenticeships whether it's there's a myriad of ways I want to create a pipeline of lifelong learning to sure that people are able to do that ensure that are able to find the kind of career they want in need was run those benefits I don't think we can sustain this by giving all the corporation's to the tax cuts when they're not investing in our people when they're just buying back stock or other things that nature I'm excited unemployment slow it's been going down and jobs been going up for over 90 months this started a long time ago not just with these stack these tax cuts so we've got a look at that you know Dan 2 is talked about you know trying to cut Social Security and Medicare and so many things are privatized in a way where you know I always cracks me up but people want to privatize Social Security when the markets at all-time high we gotta realize it comes down Dan 30-second response to that yeah brought up the debt I think there's ways to tackle the debt the vast majority of our spending is mandatory side I've never said cut it okay what I've said is do things like raise the retirement age if if you're my age I don't need to retire at 67 and most people my age agree with that you can put these programs on the path to solvency you're tacking corporations those corporations are a bunch of people who hire a bunch of people they're our neighbors okay that's what that is they say they're not investing and our people is fundamentally fall so I've actually toured lots of businesses around here who are using their own money to to train workers I mean it's really an amazing thing and I'm glad to hear that you'd actually book with Republicans to make the tax cuts permanent gotta leave it there 20 seconds yeah I mean to me again this is about investing in our people how do we invest in our people to allow them to get the skills the training they need to be able to plug in and get a solid career for themselves and for our kids in the future Automation is real and what's going on with outsourcing jobs are not coming back we've got to ensure that we're doing that moving forward okay lots of schools in the second congressional district keeping in mind the rash of school shootings what would you do to improve student safety and should new can gun control measures be part of the formula I'm gonna go with Dan well first of all it's it's absolutely heartbreaking too for any parent to imagine sending their kid to school and not feel the Third Estate going to be safe we want solutions that that are just gonna feel good but actually do good so we have to talk about what those might be let's start it let's also keep in mind too that you you have to protect the rights given to us or protected for us by our government which includes the Second Amendment I want to know that when I was on deployment my wife could defend herself okay and to defend our home because I wasn't there but we have to talk about what to do with our schools and and and how we might accomplish that so looking at things like psychological first aid all right are we giving our schools the resources they need to to to help kids who are obviously having trouble yeah we need to look at that we need to look at ways to make our schools more secure to the physical security sense okay maybe that means a single point of entry maybe that means providing ways for teachers to create barriers maybe it's more armed guards on a school canvas in the end that has to be decided at the school level itself we also have to look at other creative ways to invoke our legal process to actually do some good here all right first of all let's enforce the laws we have that often is the the culprit every time we see a shooting like this but there's other ways too what about like a gun violence restraining order that idea is gaining a lot of traction where basically you see all these red flags taking place that could have been prevented but there's a legal process in place to actually say go confiscate that person's weapons well you could actually create a process where where a teacher or doctor or parent could say listen judge here's all the issues we should actually confiscate weapons that really takes it down to the local level instead of infringing on everyone's rights to defend themselves in order to solve this problem we don't need to conflate the two issues Todd Linton

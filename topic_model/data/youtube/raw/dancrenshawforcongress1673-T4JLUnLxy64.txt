- Put simply, our party is the party of freedom and good governance. We're the guardians of American identity. That wasn't always just
a conservative value. It's recently been
pushed aside by the left in their divisive identity politics, and their notions of false compassion, and a ever greater, growing government saying how you live your life. The greatest threat proposed by the left, is the undercutting of our values, and our traditions, and our history. This idea that America's
inherently flawed, well I disagree with that. And as conservatives we have
to provide a better vision. One grounded in optimism, and freedom, and the right policies, better healthcare, a secure border, better education systems that focuses on vocational
training, apprenticeships, and securing our debt, and
the main drivers of that debt. And I also said we're the guardians of the American identity. What does that mean? Well put simply, it's freedom, patriotism. It's saluting the red, white, and blue with God in our hearts. And as conservatives we have
to defend those core beliefs. See this idea that
America's just some place disconnected by a common
heritage or history. It's not true. It's an identity. And it's an identity
that's rooted in a story that began in 1776 and became the ideals that we know and love today. The conservatives are the
champions of those values. We're defenders of freedom. We are a vision for the future. (bright music)

and joining me now is democratic congresswoman from california karen bath she's the former chair of the congressional black caucus and is the point person for the ongoing talks on police reform congresswoman bass thank you so much for being with us today on of course what is another uh devastating day for for two families uh and the communities that surround them so let me just start with the status of these talks because there's been some confusion about whether you are formally uh negotiating and talking to your counterparts in the senate about this bill are these formal negotiations underway no there are not formal negotiations underway but i hope that that will start this week and basically the difference between informal and formal authority that would be granted to us by our leadership and so i've spoken to speaker pelosi i know that our counterparts you know senator booker as well as senator scott are we are speaking to our leadership so that hopefully this week we can move from the informal to formal so what's the hold up what's the hold up with leadership oh i don't think there is a hold up i mean i think that you will see it move this week i mean i think we needed to get to a certain place i feel like we're there now so i don't feel that there's i mean certainly have been completely supported by speaker pelosi and i believe that uh senator booker and senator scott have received their support as well we just need to now have that become uh public uh with public statements by our leadership which i think that you will see in the next day or so okay so let's talk about the content of the legislation itself uh my colleague leanne was just walking through some of the potential uh differences that you have here and my question for you is there a red line on any one of these particular issues if for example the ban on chokeholds is not in the legislation democrats cannot support that and if there are red lines like that what are they no i will first of all i mean you know that i'm not going to negotiate on tv especially just one side i don't believe you can come to a negotiation and say here take it or leave it i mean that's just not the way it's done i certainly have things that i want to see in the bill that you know might be my internal red lines but we have to see but i mean the bottom line is is that we have to have transparency we have to have accountability and i think what's going on in north carolina is a perfect example that of what we cannot continue to do that family i know was invited to to view the video they were prepared to do that they had their council fly in from out of town and then they get there and they're told they're not going to view it because we're going to redact things i'm sorry but that sends a horrible message to the community regardless of what the state law is that it has to be court ordered they offered to show the video and then they remig and i'm very concerned that uh something like that can be very disruptive in the community those are the kind of things that we have to stop we have to stop this culture of us versus them and i believe that we can begin that through legislation but so much more needs to be done beyond what the george floyd justice and policing bill will be able to do so congresswoman do you think democrats in the house are going to be willing to support something that doesn't go as far as the current george floyd poli in policing act and you will have to compromise to some degree with republicans on some of these questions to win their support where do you think uh the balance is right now in terms of saying no we shouldn't do anything because it's not good enough and if it's not good enough we simply can't support it or saying okay we acknowledge that this compromise may not go as far as we want but we absolutely need to do something i mean where that you democrats have often come down uh as saying you know if it's not good enough we're not going to do it where where is your head and where do you think the caucus is right now on that i think the caucus wants to see something done i think america wants to see something done i think those people that came out that maintained our majority that helped biden and harris get the white house want to see something done so there is the current bill but there are also things that the bill didn't do that i believe we can add in for example one of the big um uh spots that we need to fill is over mental illness mental health and so putting resources in the department of health and human services so that people can respond uh clinicians can resocial workers can respond along with or without police to address crises you know when people are in a crisis if you can treat them and make sure that they have proper health care ahead of time you can actually prevent the crisis that results in people calling the police and then uh unfortunately uh that ends in tragedy far more than than i think is is reasonable so there are things that the bill doesn't do that i believe that we can add in let me ask you uh as we wrap up here the one of the most contentious pieces of this is this idea of qualified immunity and potentially stripping officers police officers of that qualified immunity do you think that the what we've heard and the reporting around some of what senator scott's bringing to the table this idea that the employer would have responsibility does that go far enough for you uh in this question this question of qualified immunity for right now it does not uh because we want the officers to be held accountable too but i am open to listening to what senator scott says the point is is that we have to find a way to hold officers accountable so they will stop shooting people you know for example we need to spend a lot more time resources and emphasis on de-escalation training many officers i've talked to have said when they go through training they spend very little time a few hours on de-escalation but an awful lot of time on of course how to protect yourself but when you shoot that you shoot to kill you don't shoot to wound and so i think that there's a lot of issues that need to be taken up but accountability is number one so qualified immunity is one way for officers to be accountable civilly civically accountable if there's a civil lawsuit and then also the willfulness that uh your reporter was describing before whether it's where the officer intended to kill or whether his reckless behavior led to a death or her such as with dante wright i mean how can you be on the police force for 26 years and mistake your taser for a gun that's a situation where well if the officer received more training how much more training do you need to know the difference so i question the quality of training but i also say that qualified immunity is about accountability if senator scott has some other way to hold officers accountable i'm all ears all right congresswoman karen bass an illuminating conversation as always thanks very much for being with us today we really appreciate it thanks for having me on

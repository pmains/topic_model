they still don't have a health care plan that will protect americans during this pandemic and after the pandemic can you talk about what you saw last night and the stark difference between mike pence and kamala harris so boy you hit it right when you said stark difference i thought kamala was terrific when she just started out on health care on the failure of the president this pandemic but then when she said if you have a pre-existing condition then the republicans are coming for you and there's plenty of history to back that up that's where she was that's what she staked out you want to talk about anything else about the democrats we want to be we are the party that's trying to protect and expand your access to health care the republicans when when pence was pushed just a little bit what is your health care plan and it's that magic plan that has no details and he just doesn't want to talk about the fact that the republicans have been to the supreme court before to try to get rid of the affordable care act made their number one job when they got into congress other than cutting taxes for millionaires and billionaires was to overturn the affordable care act which they ultimately failed at and then they're back in the supreme court next november in order to get rid of the affordable care act in order to take away protection from the tens of millions of people across this country who have pre-existing conditions to take away health insurance from tens of millions of people to tell people under 26 you're not going to get to stay on your parents plan there's the difference if you care about your health if you know someone whose health you care about then you've got to be with kamala and with joe biden on this

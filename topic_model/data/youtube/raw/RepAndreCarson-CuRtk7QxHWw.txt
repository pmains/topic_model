I'm a credit congressman Andre Carson of Indiana he's a member of the House Intelligence Committee is one of just two Muslim members of the United States Congress that congressman thanks very much for joining us thank you for having us I'm gonna get your reaction to what's happening among the Republicans Scott Walker and now it's seeing I shortly he's going to about to announce he's dropping out but let's talk about what dr. ben Carson is now saying you're a member of Congress you took an oath to uphold the US Constitution you serve this country you're also a key member of the House Intelligence Committee you're privy to the most secret information the United States government has when you hear dr. Carson say he wouldn't agree he wouldn't like to see a Muslim as president of the United States in charge of this nation what's your response well dr. Carson has an esteemed track record as having been a successful neural surgeon but that is asinine that's almost like saying that a neurosurgeon could never become the president of the United States of America listen the founding fathers as imperfect as they were as imperfect as we all are we're very visionary in that they established an article 6 of the US Constitution that there shall not be a religious test to hold public office it's any person seeking the highest office in the land as commander-in-chief as CEO this great nation has to understand that he or she will represent all people kudos to Hillary Clinton for her tweet earlier saying the same do you free with care the console of American Islamic relations that dr. Carson should now drop out of this presidential race as a result of his comments I appreciate care for their boldness in this regard if he does not drop out he should certainly recalibrate and get new staffers and perhaps get a history lesson of what it means and what the Constitution means and what it really means to lead this nation I think that he has to understand that he is living in the 21st century we're in a pluralistic society we have a multicultural society multiracial society and multi-religious society and if he really is serious about becoming the president of the United States he should understand that fact representative Carson I'm like you to stand by we're only just getting started a lot more to discuss we got to take a quick break much more with all the news right after this

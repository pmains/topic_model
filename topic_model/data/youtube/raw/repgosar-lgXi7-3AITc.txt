from Arizona's right that's four five minutes Thank You mr. chairman I rise today to stand with veterans throughout the country and offer a simple amendment that seeks to prohibit funds in this bill from being used to create or maintain any unofficial record-keeping system at the Department of Veterans Affairs as many of you know numerous news reports have surfaced that assert that the Phoenix Veterans Affairs health care system has been using secondary unofficial records of veterans claims and appointment requests these allegations claim that the reasoning behind these actions was to misrepresent the actual wait times the veterans faced as they sought health care a whistle has come forward and alleged that the facility was taking the vets application information transcribing that information to an unofficial shared document and only putting veterans information any requests into the real system when they knew that the veterans were likely to receive an appointment within a two-week time frame if true on paper the VA central office here in Washington would be under the impression that the wait time goals for appointments were being met but according to reports veterans were waiting for months and months on end the House Veterans Affairs Committee is conducting an investigation into the matter and so far has said as many as 40 veterans suffered and died while waiting for appointments through the Phoenix VA system their investigation is ongoing and they fear there could be many more deaths as a result of this negligence I would like to thank the full committee chairman Miller chairman Miller and oversight and investigations subcommittee chairman Kaufman for their efforts on this front the inspector general's office at the VA is also conducting investigation into these allegations it is my hope that we get to the full truth soon and that those responsible are held accountable depending on the findings criminal charges may be even be in order but in the meantime my goal is to ensure that such record-keeping practices are not allowed to take place I have said this before it is sad that we have to legislate in this way but when government bureaucrats don't use good judgment in common-sense regulations and laws must be changed to prevent bad behavior no matter what the investigation shows and no matter who was involved this practice must be prevented in the future my amendment seeks to do just that only the official systems approved by the Veterans Administration central office should be used this way we have oversight accountability and uniformity is my hope that one day we also have a little boy a little more efficiency into these processes thank you for consideration and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the passage of my common-sense amendment and with that mr. Chairman I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back the balance

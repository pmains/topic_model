senator graham went down to the arizona-mexico border and this is what he found take a look the binding administration apparently has decided to stop plugging this hole here what good comes from allowing this hole to continue to exist this wall is here for a purpose it keeps people from coming in our country legally and you got a hole in the wall and i'm going to make sure the department of homeland security tells me why they're going to stop finishing this part of the wall it makes no sense i don't know senator graham joins us south carolina senator graham uh you know you might have a future as a correspondent for the hannity show uh in that shot let me tell you i i mean i'm looking at this you go i'm trying to understand this you have holes in the wall you can't that they were about to finish you see the equipment is there to finish the wall why wouldn't you finish what you started you already paid for the materials they're laying there and not fill the hole that sounds pretty i don't know where i grew up that sounds pretty dumb in new york if trump did it they're not going to do it even if it makes sense so i went to the border open-minded and i came back really worried for our country what you saw there are 18 holes in this wall near nogales arizona but on the mexican u.s border that panels are going to be put up to allow water to run through because water runs from mexico in the united states so they got ways for the water to get through these panels well these were the last panels to go into the wall it's like miles of really impressive fence and walls the bind administration is not going to put these panels up they consider that border wall so you got miles of walls with 18 holes in it and the material to plug the hole is laying on the ground the border patrol people are are just dumbfounded as what to do all the people remaining in mexico waiting for their date uh in the united states for asylum claims are being brought back to the united states and released in the united states these combination of policies by the binding administration are going to lead to caravan after caravan by june of this year if the obama administration continues to dismantle the wall and change uh the trump policies about asylum we're going to have a million people hit the border and they already promised amnesty so that's also part of it and catch and release and amazing people don't go to their court dates so merrick garland today i mean i find this pretty interesting you asked a simple question we have a smoking gun email james comey did to james clapper you know what the email says you even got comey mccabe and yates to all admit knowing what they know now they wouldn't have signed the fisa warrants comey signed three of them we know on the day that he signed the second one the first renewal before he signed the second renewal of the third one uh that he said he couldn't verify the dossier which was the bulk of information without which testimony was given to your committee they wouldn't have gotten the fisa warrant and merrick garland didn't have an opinion about lying to a fisa court knowing that it says at the top of a fisa application verified and it was unverifiable and now debunked you know he read the horos report a review of it a summary of it it said that was bad and it should never happen again that if somebody like kleinsmith altered documents on his watch they'd pay a heavy price i'm confident that durham's going to be allowed to do his job if durham is stopped from continuing the investigation of crossfire hurricane that will blow up in their face that'd be like having a hole in the wall on steroids the policies of the biden administration on immigration shine make zero sense they're going to restart the caravans they've dismantled border security that was working they changed policies uh remaining mexico that kept people from taking advantage of our asylum laws and all this is being changed because the left is demanding open borders i predict this that immigration will be a bigger issue than 2022 than it was in 2016. so is this going to be one where republicans stand together if you can't answer this fundamental question republicans will stand as one this is that the same republican party that kind of has some people it might describe as uh feckless weak ineffective lacking courage in the spine some of them just some right yeah well if you can't stand up to this then you're you're in trouble as a party what they're doing at the border makes no sense i've been involved in trying to fix immigration they're dismantling the trump border plan that worked and here's what i would say trump's going to give a speech sunday that's going to be very policy-centric every republican should rally around it i think it will help us with independence and i've never felt better about president trump's leading the party than i do right now let's talk about the president he has a big speech this weekend at cpac i know there might be a couple of republicans that you know um that aren't particularly fond of the president i don't know what maybe they want to go back to the good old days of the establishment only doing show votes to repeal and replace obamacare but not getting anything done i don't think that's the the future of the republican party what would you expect the president in this speech to be talking about number one he will position himself as the alternative to joe biden uh he i think will will make a speech that will unify republicans on policy that i think he he's been working the phones i was with him all weekend he wants us to win in 2022 and stay tuned i think you're going to see over the next couple of months donald trump lead the republican party on policy and give us the energy we need to take back the house and the senate the democrats are doing their part if we could get behind president trump and follow his lead we will win in 2022 if we argue with ourselves we're going to go we're going to lose and there's no reason to lose losing would be a bad thing i'm not sick of winning um so basically you're describing the leader of the opposition party any insight as to whether the president has made up his mind about running in 2024 stay tuned correspondents of this program have to tell everything they know i'm just saying if you want a future you know when i get my first check i'll i'll tell you all right i'll give you the check and i'll be i'll be standing before one of these dumb committees in d.c okay all right senator thank you

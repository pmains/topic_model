four minutes did you say yes ma'am four minutes i thank the gentleman for yielding madam speaker i'm sorely disappointed at the rule that has been proposed for the consideration of this homeland security appropriations bill one of the most important of the bills that the congress will face our constituents are entitled to have us speak for them that's the reason that they selected us and yet now we are being denied the opportunity to register the thoughts and opinions of the constituents that we represent there were some 70 amendments proffered to be offered on the floor on this bill only 14 will be allowed never in my experience and i've been here 28 years on the appropriations committee 26 of those years i've never seen a rule this restrictive on allowing members of the committee as well as the members of the body to express their views this is a muzzle of the minority you're muzzling the people that we represent you say well there are so many amendments it would take us forever and it would slow down our process of spending that's what this is all about the majority is attempting to muzzle the minority to speed up the process of spending borrowing and taxing and i regret that i think it's sad for the institution not to mention our constituents and the members of this body well those 70 amendments we could go through in no time fly flight last year well for the 08 appropriations for this department there were 178 amendments offered we didn't shut down the process and deny those people the chance to offer their amendment and to say their peace about what their constituents thought about the bill we simply went through them two days after a certain period of time we were able to work out unanimous consent agreements amongst the members of the body to reduce the time allotted to each amendment or we substituted a colloquy with the other offer of the amendment instead of offering the amendment and that satisfied them they had their day in court so to speak other amendments were not offered this is not nothing new this is the practice of this honored institution to allow members to offer their thoughts and opinions and amendments and if it if it takes time that's what democracy is all about it may not be pretty the making of sausage is not pretty but that's what we're in the process and the business of doing you're shutting down the members of this body who have legitimate in-order amendments almost in total and i resent that the ranking member of the subcommittee was denied the opportunity to offer his own amendment a legitimate in-order amendment that has never happened to my knowledge before you're making history but in a sad sad way give us the chance to speak for our constituents the people that want to know why you're shutting off their voice in this great deliberative body give us an open rule as we've always had it we've never had a restrictive rule like this on appropriations bills give us a chance to be heard john

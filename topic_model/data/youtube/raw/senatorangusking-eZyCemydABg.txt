mr. Krebs I just want to make you feel better about your title I enjoyed that interplay with senator Shaheen Jai forty years ago I worked here as a staff member and I was seeking a witness I think I may have told the Chairman this story from office of management budget from the administration they said he's the deputy secretary under of such a--such I don't know what that title means the response was and you could take this home with you he's at the highest level where they still know anything and I now realized by the way that I'm above that level so but I appreciate having you here I think you fellows understated one important point and I don't understand why the representative from the White House isn't here because I think he has a reasonable story to tell on May 11th the President issued a pretty comprehensive executive order on this subject that is not the be-all and end-all on the subject but certainly is an important beginning in terms of now here's my question though in that executive order there were a number of report back requirements that triggered mostly in August my question is have those report backs been done mr. Rawat no senator they are starting to come in and as you note there are a number that are still due out just base um were 180 days some were 90 days so I'm wondering if the 90 days which expired in August have have come back that's correct I don't have the full tracker with me right here I can get back to you on that I would appreciate that some have been submitted according to the original timeline others have been extended but but absolutely those are the essential elements of information necessary to fully develop and update the strategy to the evolving threats and build that doctrine and requirements and plans you see use the word key word the key word of doctrine and I want to talk about that in a minute but by the same token this committee passed as or the Congress passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act last December a provision requiring a report from the Secretary of Defense to the president within 180 days and from the president the Congress within 180 days that report would have been due in June from the Secretary of Defense involving what are the military and non-military options available for deterring and responding to imminent threats in cyberspace do you know if that report has been completed yes senator it was our original intent and desire to couple the two with the input both into the president CEO as well as the input back to the Senate based on the delay of the presidency oh we decoupled that because we recognize your impatience and we need to get may have heard you may have picked up some impatience this morning yeah so do we have it so so you we will be submitting it to you shortly and I'll get a specific date and you know shortly doesn't make me feel much better that's why because that geologic time or is that calendar time please let us know you mentioned the word doctrine and and I think that's one of the key issues here if all we do is try to patch networks and defend ourselves we'll ultimately lose there has to be and and mr. Smith you you use the term imposed consequences and right now we're not imposing much in the way of consequences for the election hacking which is one of the most egregious attacks on this the United States in recent years there were sanctions passed by the Congress but it was six or eight months later and it's unclear house how severe they will be we need a doctrine where our adversaries know if they do X Y will happen to them mr. Rawat no do you have any thoughts on that you see what I mean just being on the defensive isn't gonna work in the end if you're in a boxing match and you can bob and weave and you're the best barber and Weaver in the history of the world if you're not allowed to ever punch you're gonna lose that boxing match yes Center it's certainly agree that that both the demonstrated will and ability to respond to provocations in general and cyber and specific is critical to effective deterrence I think the challenge that we have that that is somewhat unique in cyber is defining a threshold that then does not invite adversaries to inch up close but short of it right and therefore the criteria it's very difficult to make them highly specific versus more general and then the downside of the general is it's too ambiguous to be meaningful as a as a dinner and part of the problem also is we tend to want to keep secret what we can do when in reality a a secret deterrent is not a deterrent the other side has to know what's liable to happen to them and and I hope you'll bear that in mind I think this is a critically important area because we we have to have a deterrent capability otherwise we know this is coming and so far there haven't been much in the way of price pay it whether it was Sony or Anthem Blue Cross or or the government personnel office or our elections there have to be consequences otherwise everybody's going to come after us not just Russia but North Korea Iran terrorist organizations this is warfare on the cheap and we have to be able not only to defend ourselves but to defend ourselves through a deterrent policy and I hope in the counsels of the of the administration that will be an emphasis on your in your response yes I agree senator and that is the point of the EO in terms of that deterrence option set is to understand them in the condo wider context of our capabilities different authorities and and to start being more definitive about what those deterrence options are and how we can best use thank you Thank You mr. chairman

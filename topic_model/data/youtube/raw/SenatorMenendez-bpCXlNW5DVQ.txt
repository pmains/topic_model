for those of you who just joined we'll be starting in just a moment hi welcome to the Public service loan forgiveness lunch and learn webinar um I'm Jennifer Brown I am the Senator's policy advisor on education and we will be going through a number of slides today again if you have questions during the webinar we have our chat open and Diego and Eileen from our Jersey City and parenting offices are monitoring the chat and we'll be asking some questions or will be answering some of your questions at the end of this webinar all right so today we will be talking about what is the Public service loan forgiveness program next we will be covering what are the requirements for the Public service loan program the third thing we'll be covering is the success rate what was happening before uh the Biden Administration and their announcement last October of The Limited pslf waiver then we're going to talk a lot today about the limited pslf waiver which expires next Monday which is the reason you're probably here today and then last we're going to open it up to some questions again individualized questions I would love for you and we'll cover this at the very very end to reach out to our office so that um Diego and Eileen can talk to you specifically because there are so many individualized circumstances here you asking your very personal question on this webinar probably will not be the best use of your time you should really reach out to our office and again this is all just very much talking about policy and it's informational purposes this is not any kind of personalized legal advice and or any kind of personal financial advice and this is something that is very personal and so you'll want to reach out if you have questions so our questions say will be general questions about the program okay what is the Public service loan forgiveness program and you'll hear me call it pslf it was a program that was created by an act of Congress in 2007 that encouraged workers to pursue a career in public service it did that by forgiving their loans after you work for 10 years of public service and make on-time payments on your federal student loans your debt will be forgiven this sounds great right so you have to be in the right type of loan the right type of loan repayment the right type of employment and the right number of payments what do I mean by that your right type of loan you had to be in a Federal Direct Loan you had to have Stafford Loans also used to be called Ford loans most people don't know the Ford loan and that not um nomenclature so it's really a direct loan you'll see that you'll see it says direct loan subsidized unsubsidized loans um you'll also see Federal Direct Plus Loans this is a big uh clue for you those people that have Parent Plus Loans pslf works for Plus Loans Parent PLUS graduate Plus Loans as well and also direct consolidation loans so if you had ffel we'll talk about ffel in a second loans and you Consolidated those loans and you don't have a direct consolidation loan you have the right kinds of loans for pslf I am saying alphabet soup right now to 99 of our 53 participants that are on this webinar um this is why you will want to contact Diego and Eileen um for your very specific loan situation because they can help you determine which one of these loans that you have if you have these kind of loans okay so that was the first one you had to be have the direct kind or the proper kinds of loans Next Step you had to have the right kind of repayment plan you had to be on an income-based repayment plan also known as IDR you had to be on this is terrible I'm like we're having real alphabet soup here pay as you earn also called pay or new ibr um then we also had income contingent repayment icr and revised pay as you earn repayee this is those these are the kind of repayment plans where you would have to send out to the Department of Education each year a certification of your income and they would then ask you questions like what is your family size what is your income and then they would tell you how much you had to pay that's what all of these letters mean if you are on any kind of other kind of payment program graduated repayment program extended repayment program the standard 10-year repayment program you might not have been on the right type of repayment plan if this is you don't worry there are a lot of us that were in that boat that's one of the things The Limited waiver um seeks to fix so don't worry but again these are the kind of plans that you're we're supposed to be on for pslf to work now you also had to be in the right type of employment this is one of the actually most complicated parts of this so originally PSL was intended to serve local state and federal governments you work for the state of New Jersey you work for this for Union City the city of Union City or you work for the US government you were definitely in the right kind of employment if you work for a public school you work through a K-12 institution that is funded by a state or County or a Township here in New Jersey you are definitely in qualifying Public Service you announce the next one public hospital that's a public is kind of a strange name here here in New Jersey if you work for one of the Rutgers hospitals if you work for anything with Rutgers and is affiliated with the Rutgers University you are definitely in the right kind of employment um also if you work for another hospital system that when you go to their website it says not for profit um you might work for a uh public employer if you work for a public library you work for anywhere that you know is funded by again a local state or federal government entity and you're doing Library Services you are eligible last but very much not least is if you're working as an Adjunct professor or a staff member or a professor or anybody who even works you know in administration or anything at a public university anybody that's a not-for-profit university in the state of New Jersey you are eligible for pslf and you can have your loans forgiven through the uh program you have to work for this employer what's called full-time and we can talk about this 30 hour requirement because this is changing as of an hour ago um right now the requirement is that you have to work full time for that employer full-time means 30 hours a week there are some weird issues with adjunct professors um and also if you work 30 hours a week but if that employer doesn't offer you benefits and so they say you work part-time um there's some rulemaking that's coming out that will change that but right now the requirement is 30 hours so as long as you're working over 30 hours a week for one of these Public Service employers or more than one Public Service employer and you're getting over that 30 hour a week threshold uh you are in the right type of employment now the last requirement you have to make 120 qualifying payments that's 10 years worth you can't prepay your loans and hurry up to that 120 qualifying payments I'm sure a lot of Us wish that we could do that those payments also do not need to be consecutive you could you know work for as a teacher for five years take a couple years off you know maybe you needed to stay home with your family or give some caregiving to your your parents or someone and then go back to teaching you don't have to restart the clock on your 10 years you have your five years before and you pick back right up where you left off and keep counting after that so no this is a really big misconception that you have to have 10 years of consecutive payments it's not true your your total just has to be 10. while you're working for that qualifying employer in the right kind of payment plan with the right kind of loans okay so before pslf back in 2019 when we was the first people that were eligible for this program because the program started in 2007. we had a lot of folks that were in the program and enrolled in the program the initial rejection rate was 99 it was seen as a complete failure or an almost complete failure of the program so it was just really Troublesome because all of these folks were denied because they were their loans were not in their right they were not didn't have the right kind of Federal loans more specifically a lot of folks who had Federal loans these ffel loans hadn't Consolidated into a direct consolidation loan the biggest hiccup for most people is that they were in the wrong repayment plan they weren't in those income-based repayment plans they were on the graduated or extended repayment plans not these income-based repayment plans or that they worked for an employer that they thought was qualified but wasn't qualified um or they weren't working enough hours so a lot of folks were rejected for those reasons so what did the Biden Administration do they announced this limited time waiver it's a limited time opportunity one time what you know to fix all these problems and the deadline for that waiver is next Monday October 31st 2022. and so what does this waiver do what does it mean what do you have to do before next Monday let's hop into it okay so The Limited waiver fixes a lot of the problems that I just talked about it helps you course correct here in the middle of you know your repayment so it will allow you to fix these direct loan types it would allow you to consolidate your loan and get your loans into the correct loan type so that you can get credit for your 10 years or however many years of public service that you've already worked this is a one-time offer you can consolidate later if you decide that this is something that you might want to do there are some consequences to that as the education Department's announced this morning right now if you were to consolidate you know we have some constituents where they were able to consolidate they had worked in public service for 15 years they Consolidated earlier this year and they had all 15 years um their Public Service counted and they no longer have student loans that is why you wanna consolidate you want to take your loan types that don't normally work and convert them into loans that work for this program you have to file for consolidation by 1031 and then after that you have to file an employer certification form and we can talk about both of those points later but again the takeaway from this is if you have an incorrect loan type you can use the limited waiver to take your loans that are not eligible and make them eligible it's like taking them from purple to Green or red to Green bad you know red stop green to go and that's what this consolidation allows you to do it allows you to change the color of those lines now similar thing here on the payment plan The Limited waiver gives you a chance for when you were in the path you know back in 2007 2012 2015 even heck earlier this year right now if you were in the wrong repayment plan and you were making plan payments on your loans in one of those extended or graduate or 10-year repayment plans it allows you to get credit for the those time that time period that you were making payments on the wrong in the wrong repayment plan it also allows you to get credit for payments that may or may be less than what was uh owed so say you owed a 500 loan uh your bill was 500 and you only paid 250 because that's all you could afford it allows you to get credit towards pslf for that 250 dollar payment that's a big deal that helps a lot of people that were originally not able to get their payment counted to be able to you know add up those payments to 120. there's no changes in The Limited waiver to the employer requirement you have to be working for a non-profit employer um and of the the 30 hour requirement there's but there is a small change and this is a really significant one for a lot of people especially those people who are maybe retired um or who have left the profession remember our teacher here that we were talking or a public servant that they had worked in public service for 15 years um you know what if you're in working for 15 years as a teacher and you left the teaching profession and you're now doing something else or you're retired Under The Limited waiver those those 15 years that you were working in public service and making those payments you can now apply for pslf and receive pslr forgiveness even though you're not working in public service so if you're retired you're no longer employed you're working for a non-qualifying employer you can still file for the waiver now and receive forgiveness under the pfl program even though you're not currently working for a qualifying employer that's a big deal all right military deferment and forbearances those all count towards forgiveness so before when you were on a deferment or forbearance that did not count at all towards your 120. I feel like you know you're you're adding up those payments you're cobbling them together to get to 120 you know these are the things it's like Shoots and Ladders if you all played that game these are the Shoots and Ladders that would bring you back down to a lower number this Under The Limited wave are those military deferments and forbearances those count towards the 120 and so you're getting those points to get to 120. okay if you leave with nothing else today you will leave with the fact that the limited waiver expires next Monday so you have to consolidate and you also have to go to the studentaid.gov pslf website download a pslf help tool form walk through that form and download What's called an employer certification form no later than 11 59 PM next Monday you have to do this you can if you wait until after that point in time it is too late now let's go dig into these things because I am sure that someone here is confused I do see that there are some questions in the chat what do you need to do right now today or what should you do if you have any questions about this first off you want to confirm your loans are eligible for pslf um this is how you do that this is the first stop for you before you wanna if you want to call our office you can log into studentaid.gov you select my aid from the drop down click on view details view break down that this is the very very specific way to do that it looks like this and we will make this PDF available on our website so that you don't have to be hurrying and scribbling this down or taking screenshots we will make this available to you and you can also call Diego and Eileen at either of our office and they can walk you through this so you click on my a you'll click on view details you'll click on view breakdown there and you'll click on view loan details and then it'll look it'll give you this long list of loans and it tells you oh this is you know subsidized or unsubsidized or Parent Plus or you'll see this thing called family ffel or Perkins or private okay so again this is like it's like a decoder ring here okay and so we're going to you know be using you need you know this is confusing and so what we're going to try to do here is decode this for a second and with our decoder ring if you see any of those loans saying subsidize or unsubsidized and it says direct or it says or it says U.S government you know Mohela navient Fed Loan Great Lakes um Advantage hold your loan and it says subsidized and unsubsidized you're in the right loan type same with parent plus you are in the right Loan Center you see something that's graduate plus Parent PLUS those are eligible if you see an ffel loan um or it's held by you know Sallie Mae Navi another one that's held by navient and some of the other companies that you don't see direct with it you might have an ffel loan and you'll need to consolidate before Monday in order to be eligible actually if you have an ffel Perkins loan you actually don't have to consolidate before Monday but it's advantageous for you to do so for other reasons in order to get into pslf um if you have a private loan even loans that are issued by the state of New Jersey you're unfortunately not eligible to be able to participate um in the pslf program trust me I wish I could change that I have not been able to change that I wish I could wave my magic wand and change that okay so let's talk about consolidating how do you well you go that same student aid.gov website you go up to manage loans you log in and you fill out a direct consolidation loan application um it is confusing because you will have to pick a repayment type remember you want to pick those repayment types that we were talking about earlier on the repayment income based repayment pay e repayee um are some of the ones that are options here if you have questions about that please feel free to reach out to Diego and Aileen they can help you through that process that is very a very confusing process as well there's a lot of TR there's a lot of pitfalls here and so again we're here to help you um you know our caseworkers are here to assist you to walking through this process there's other folks in this system as well that are more than happy to help you through this process so here you you know you'll have to put your a grocery income here are some of the um payment plans that you have to select you'll go to the bottom of the list the bottom of the list is where the payment plans that are eligible for pfls exists um you know the standard the graduated the extended fix the extended graduated are not eligible payment plans for pflf you have to go down so you can see on this screen it's repay here and payee here is where we're getting to the good types of repayment plans someone here is thinking and asking but consolidating my loans might raise my interest rate well yes that is that is absolutely true it could raise your interest rate but under pslf you're you're cut your calculation is a little different it's not just your interest rate it's not like paying off your mortgage or paying off your credit card or paying off your car um it's a different calculation and so you'll want to that is one part of your decision-making process and going forward here all right let's move on to what about your employer this is something that comes up a lot and so if you're wondering gosh is my employer eligible you can actually check this on the department of education's website so if you go back to your tax form or you can call your employer and you ask them what your employer identification number is it's on box two of your W-2 and you can then use the pslf help tools on the Department of Education website determine if your employer is qualified what does that look like so you can go to this pslf help tool you search for qualifying employers it's after it's below this login to start you'll put in the employer identification number you don't want to use a dash and you can then put in your start dates and you hit search um and so if you were say you were working for Rutgers or Rutgers Hospital you would put in their Ein that 22601086 number and you would get this see that green eligible check that means your employer is certified with psls that means you want to submit those employer certification forms and move forward you congratulations work for a qualifying employer all right so what happens if you put in your employer's identification number and you get one of these yellow undetermined it used to say potentially ineligible so what if you work for the New Jersey Association of public accountants it's a 501c6 organization they're a non-profit organization and the Department of Education has not figured out if they're determined or under undetermined and so what you would do is you would still potentially want to fill out employer certification form and send those in You Know download the form before Monday and still send it in okay and then that will cause the department to move forward and determine whether your employer is certified or eligible or not eligible okay so and here here's this and I'll continue my thought you do you just need to download the employer certification forms by the end of the day next Monday you don't have to actually get them signed or submit them by the end of the day next Monday you just have to download them so oh my speaker is breaking up I am so so sorry if it continues please chat and let us know when we can switch our audio here um so you just need to download the ecfs or the employer certification forms from the help tool from studentaid.gov you do not have to get them certified by your employer and you don't have to submit them to your servicer or Mohela because every one of them now has to go to Mohela by the end of the day next Monday you just have to download them okay but you don't hesitate after you download them don't let them wait you know six months or a year you want to do this it might take some time you know to get these certified I've we've seen and heard from the Department that certain states are taking a long time I don't know about the state of New Jersey but other states you know we're saying it's going to take seven to ten business days to certify employment for this so don't freak out if it takes your own player a little bit of time you're good if you download your employer certification form from the pslf help tool by the end of the day next Monday again you can reach out to Diego and Eileen and their contact information is on the last slide or you can call our Jersey City or Barrington office if you have any problems with the help tool or filling out the helpful they can help you in filling out the help tool okay so what if you get that yellow undetermined button how do you know if you should you know go through this or the juice is worth the sweep so again if you work for a federal and a state government or a tribal government you're good there has been and I will put this out there just so you know we've heard from teachers we've heard from some County employees and some Township employees and even some state of New Jersey employees that when they put in the Ein for their employer they got that yellow button back don't worry don't worry download the form get it certified and send it in if you work for a federal or state or um or Township don't worry it's just the education department saying they um they haven't determined that employer yet um it's not in their list of pre-approved people that's what literally what that yellow button means but if you work for the federal state or government organization directly it says state of or county of you're good now if you work for a 501c3 employer any of them it doesn't matter what you do it doesn't matter what they do um you can use this IRS tax-exempt organization Search tool and find out if they are a 501c3 it's a section of the tax code employer so again doesn't matter what they do doesn't matter what you do if they're that you're you're good okay now it's a little bit more complicated remember how I said oh what if you work for the New Jersey Association of CPAs they're a not-for-profit organization but the pslf law that was passed in 2007 allows other organizations to be able to qualify so what if you work for a head start organization that's run by a non-profit that's not on a 501c3 you could potentially work for a qualifying employer um you know I will tell you that a lot of the veterans organizations are 501c 17 organizations and so you could certify if they provide public service for the military under this okay so again if you get that yellow button and you have any questions please reach out it's um we can help you our constituent Services folks can help you go through this process but don't stop there make sure you download the form and you you look at this this is a very complicated situation I'm going to go back just because I want to say it again if you work for a federal state or Township organization you're a teacher or a bus driver or anyone that works in a school or anyone that works for any of the state or County governments and you get that yellow button when you apply please make sure you download your form and move full steam ahead and submitting your application we know of problems there and we want to make sure that you get counted it's the same with any 501c3 employer we want you to make sure that you're getting everything that's entitled to you under this waiver so if you have any questions at all please make sure to reach out to Diego Eileen okay and here are some more ones here are some more organizations if you work public education Public Health these are just non-501c3 organizations when you look them up on the IRS helpful um these are a little more difficult it's really a lot of people don't work these are there's not a lot of these organizations a lot more folks work for the state and local governments and 501c3 employers so they are eligible so again you get that yellow um box it's not it's just caution you have a little bit more work to do now there is a red box that says not qualified and if you get that you don't need to worry about submitting that employer certification for that employer but if you have other employers that you worked for in the past that do qualify you would want to submit that ECF all right so you've now checked your employer to see if they're eligible and you've gotten the green or the yellow so what you want to do is then go back to that help tool screen you'll see it in just a second you'll want to file for the limited waiver well how do you do that when I filed for The Limited waiver I thought it was this you know big thing it's a there is a forum there is an application form I'll show in just a second or you can just send an unemployer certification form the department and you then count for this limited waiver there is an actual form to fill out but there is also if you just send an employer certification form so you know if you've been pursuing pslr for a long time and the you know you you work for a new employer or you've Consolidated and moved things over you just need to send a new employer certification form um to the department but you do need to use that pslf help tool in order to generate that employer certification form okay so how do you use this pslf help tool you go to studentaid.gov pslf there's a big screen there it looks like this you'll click that login to start you'll log in with your FAFSA identification don't worry if you haven't used your FAFSA identification since 2005 when you you know first did this you can put in your social security number your I-10 your any kind of tax identification number and it will then regenerate that process for you so that you are able to log in and use this help tool so then you'll search for your employers just like we did before here's the Rutgers one um it'll do the same exact screen as when you were checking before but then what will happen is after you've filled out all your employers it will then generate this um these employer certification forms for you for each of the employer with all of this filled in you know the employer name their Ein their address their website it'll pull that information of when you began your employment to your end date now then your employer will then start checking things on this if you are employed full-time or part-time how many hours a week you work and then they will sign at the bottom I will tell you please make sure that your employer is signing with a pen um probably blue ink um not with any kind of you know where they're typing their name on a computer or they're pasting in their signature from JPEG that will get rejected from the Department you want to do what's called a what signature you want a blue ink you want them to physically sign the form um that is a big hint for you guys to save yourself some headaches later and so if you have multiple employers that you put into this pslf help tool you'll get separate employer certifications for each one you then have to send out each of those employer certifications to each of those different employers I know that you all have questions if you have individual questions about your particular circumstances please please please reach out to one of our caseworkers we have heard it all we have seen it all and if we don't if they don't know the answer then we can help find help you get the answer also importantly if you're having issues with your student loan servicer or the website you know we they can help you get those those resolved for example I will tell you at one point in the last number of months the employer certification the pslf help tool wasn't emailing you the employer certification forms and we found this out and we let Ed know and it got fixed so again if you are having problems please contact us no question is too small this is very complicated if this is confusing to you it's okay it was very confusing us I had one of my colleagues this morning say I have been dealing with this for more than a year I still don't understand this so that's why you know we're not trying to give any kind of advice here we're trying to inform you of what's possible but Diego and Eileen can really help you walk through these steps and again we know that there are problems with that everybody has individualized problems but also that there are some problems with getting a hold of servicers we know that there are problems with some of the letters that are being sent we know that there are some other issues with folks that might have questions about their um you know decoding what loans they have or their employer or you know what if their employer won't sign the form these are the kinds of questions you want to reach out to Diego and Eileen about okay now remember this is a limited time offer you have to act by next Monday um you will see in the paper today and tomorrow that there are some new announcements that are happening from the Department um we are still digesting those announcements and trying to understand what's coming out of the department but we are excited to you know work through those and you can look at our office for for that and also from the education department about what those changes are going to be so um we are going to take some questions now um I don't so we will be sharing these PowerPoints I think we're going to be putting it on the main page or on our press site um I'm we it will be very apparent from menendez.senant.gov um I'm pretty sure it's going to go on a header or something so you can also if you um you know we can also send it directly to the group of folks that we emailed to be a part of this so if you got our earlier invite um we will be sending out a copy to that okay um so I'm gonna go with this first question um so it is I work for County government um Hudson County I believe is the county and um it is your congratulations on your first year anniversary November 8th 2022. so you can um I'm gonna do this like very broadly so you're just starting pslf you can still do this anytime and let me also tell you that you everybody who's in this system if you do this is not all just the people that are gonna magically get loan forgiveness because they've worked for more than 10 years in public service so what if you just started like you still want to do this you don't have to do this as fast as everybody else but what you do want to do and what I really appreciate this question is every year on your employment anniversary you will want to send an employer certification form to your loan servicer to certify your employment so that you know that they are counting your loans and that you're racking up your month of payment to get to your 120. um you want to continually send in those employer certification forms once a year if you change employers you want to send in those employer certification forms you want to do this once a year so this is really important it's not just about the waiver but in the future you want to continue to send these in and you would also still go to the um Department of education's website fill out the pslf help tool and generate those ecfs from there okay I'll do this one next how long does it take for you to receive notification if pllf has been approved great question because the answer is it depends so we have heard things from where folks didn't even know so let's talk about this process so there is a pslf waiver form when you go to the help tool there's a one page where you check some boxes like I just want to see how any payments count or I know I have 120 payments um if you send in one of those you will get some letters back uh about that application that has ranged anywhere from months to I've heard a year now from folks um which is not very positive to tell you out loud but it takes a while this is a very confusing process some other things that I will tell you once you reach 120 payments you can see that on your servicer site they will update your payments and you can see how many you have then it gets sent to Ed and then they'll send you a letter on your servicer site a lot of people will see their balance is zero please I will tell you if you're consolidating you will also see a zero balance at one point but if you've applied for pslf and you've and you will see uh your that your servicer has you as a zero balance even before you receive a letter this has gone very quick and this has gone very slow so um you know again there are a lot of people that are applying and so it does take a while but you should really talk to Diego or Aileen um about that process if it's taking too long because we do know that there are some servicers there it's taking a long time or there are reasons why we should you know they will be able to help you in contacting the Ombudsman and asking why this is taking so long but that's a perfect question thank you for that okay great one I'm gonna generalize this question if you worked in public service and you have Parent Plus loans for your children does pslf apply to you yes yes it does it does the waiver might not help you but pslf applies to you Diego and Eileen can help you with your your specifics of that situation but yes Parent Plus Loans do qualify for psls um let's talk about employment dates um you're having a problem with employment dates where it's rejecting you putting it in um on the pslf help tool just don't click this is my current employer make sure that it um there's like a little drag button to the left or right you can certify past employment um please remember that if you have employment before I believe it's October 31st 2007 that does not count for pslf it's either October 1st or October 31st but um so if you're trying to put in employment from the 90s unless you held unemployment past October 2007 it's going to reject you now something else I will point out about um dates we have a lot of constituents contact us about they got a notification of their employer certification form didn't have proper dates on it um you'll want to call up your servicer and say please look at this again you can either upload the employment certification form again or you can call them and say that that is wrong that we have heard that please contact Diego and Eileen um or Eileen and um about that because we can help you with that issue um foreign that asked the direct Parent Plus Code you question you'll want to contact Diego and Eileen that's really specific um if you have a mix of loans that qualify and don't qualify this is a pretty good question only the ones that you can consolidate and that qualify are eligible for pslf you can't make private loans suddenly Federal unfortunately I wish you could trust me this is one of those things that comes up all the time that I wish I could wave my magic wand um oh great question so if you you have two different employers and you you know you move from one qualifying employer to another qualifying employer you will need to contact your old employer and your in order to have them certify your old employment and then your new employer to certify that employment your new employer even if you maybe work for a different office or Branch or sub agency or wherever our County um you know you that that's your old employer and your new employer you want to keep them separate because your new employer can't certify for your old employer unless you all worked for like the state of New Jersey and they want to handle that for the person that asked about Carteret I said that right um you can contact Eileen and Diego about Diego about that oh you need to download the ECF by next Monday now if you submitted in August you need to do it again no that just means that your employer is or your servicer is backed up in processing those if Mohela is your servicer which if you're pursuing pslf you're probably being moved to Mohela there is a way for on their website for you to check their um if they've received that document um it's on the pslf drop down menu and you enter in your social security number and your last name and your birth date and it will tell you if it's processed or not they have been running slow they have not been processing so if it is Mohela that is your servicer they have told us that they will start processing they were supposed to start processing on 10 15. we have heard the end of the month it is coming they know they're supposed to be processing but also if it's an extreme delay please contact our office and we can you know help you in getting that resolved oh great question student loan cancellation can you still apply for student loan cancellation and pslf why yes you can it is a very so there are reasons why you should pursue this or not pursue this and this is again why you should contact Diego and Eileen about your personal facts and circumstances but you know for I'll give you an example my brother-in-law who's a teacher um you know he had a forty four thousand dollar loan balance he had a Pell Grant um and this reduced his balance to twenty thousand dollars with the cancellation and he still has three years left with pslf time that he needs to work in order to have his loans forgiven but because his loan balance decreased his payments were halved because his loan balance was halved so there are reasons why people may want to consider um applying for the student loan cancellation you know asterisk asterisk where this will get worked out in the courts this week as to whether we hope that this is going to move forward but yes you should think about that yes you can do that and there are reasons why you should in there some folks that maybe don't want to so there's that um let's see yes so there's a question here if you should apply if you've not made 120 payments it's the same question like before like where you're just starting out in your career you want to not have a surprise at 120 payments this takes a while as you're we're starting to see with people chatting in and things like that you'll want to go ahead and have your employment certified and have you know your payments counted because the case there's a problem you can take care of it you're not waiting until 120 payments and then having a really unpleasant surprise and then being on the the fun with Diego or Elena being very upset being proactive here is a really good thing um and so make a game of it count it up like you start an Excel spreadsheet or a Google sheet about it and watch as you you do that I have personally made it a a fun game of how much I have paid and how little how much less less I have and it there's there was rewards at certain periods of time so I gamified that so the pro the person that asked that asked about if you've started your career and going back to school um the answer is it depends um that is one that you would want to contact our office about um there are because this is a really complicated why I'm not answering that is that's really complicated I would have that person even if you may live in North Jersey contact Eileen um in South Jersey so the Barrington office the human being that asked about going back to school contact Eileen um so the spousal loans this is individual so if you are a public servant and your spouse is not a public servant your public service doesn't count for your wife's public service or your your husband's public Source or your you know um and so it's all about your public service it's the same thing with um uh but if your spouse works for a public for a governmental entity or a not-for-profit and they have loans does this work for them absolutely as long as they have Federal loans you can apply in New York New Jersey all 50 States territories it doesn't matter where you live as long as your loans are federal um now the person that asked about they've worked more than 10 years but they're now retired this is why the The Limited waiver and there's the magic for you so if you worked for more than 10 years there is a program that was announced April 19th that was not the subject of our webinar here today that would give you some credit potentially for forbearance or deferment months or some other things that were going on um and you can potentially receive some payments credited or count towards pslf from that the department is was supposed to go ahead and do those now um before the end of the year and you know with cancellation this is and pslf is a little bit more popular than I think they expected it to be um which is wonderful um but there that review is taking longer than they thought and so there's extra time so this cute this person that hasn't made the 120 payments yet this is something to call our office and have a very personalized discussion about but you know I find that a lot of folks are in this situation where like you know they they haven't made those payments because maybe they were in deferment or forbearance and that's one of the you know life occurred um and so there is something that's happening and maybe we can talk about that on a different webinar um or we can refer people out that's this is still very new so um this is a Diego and a lane question for the person that asked about pslf and permanent total disability that is definitely a Diego and Aileen question um because there's so many situations with us um okay I think that we have we left have we um foreign [Music] oh that's a parent plus loan okay so the person that has asked about the parent has a loan under the student I believe that would be a parent plus loan and if it is a Parent PLUS Loan then um that would qualify but you should again we can look by going on to the studentaid.gov site not we but you and then Ortho Diego on Aileen can go on um studentaid.gov and figure out what kind of loan that is and and who has it and if it qualifies for pslf and so that's why you'd want to contact our office of you know you can send them screenshots or we can screen share and um they can they can help you do that I think that we have asked all the questions again here's the numbers for North Jersey and Barrington um you know Aileen and Diego Diego is in North Jersey Eileen is in Barrington if you have questions they're the

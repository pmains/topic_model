I thank the chairman and certainly our witnesses for bringing attention to China's attempt to bully and intimidate Hong Kong into abandoning its rights and freedoms Hong Kong success as a free and open city exposes the injustice 'iz and hypocrisy of the communist system in China Congress stands in unity in bipartisan unity with Hong Kong residents as they fight to protect the rule of law and respect for human rights in their City yesterday the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress formally approved the national national security law in time for it to go into effect today on July 1st the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China this is a date of great significance for pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong miss Peterson I think we know how this new law has affected the annual July first protest sadly but how should the United States respond to these violent crackdowns on protesters thank you for that question well I think obviously we should be condemning it we should join multilateral groups at the United Nations to condemn it we should become more active in the UN Human Rights Council which is being asked to set up an independent monitoring mechanism and I fully agree with everyone who has suggested the safe harbor act because I think it is very a very strong and significant show of support more than just talk to tell people that you will provide safe harbor if they have to flee an authoritarian machine I want to say one brief thing about this the statements that this law will only be enforced against a small number of people I think that was Carrie lambs hope because she really hoped that everyone would be so frightened by this law that everyone would stay at home and that's one of the reasons the law was brought into force during the covert restrictions because it makes it easier for the Hong Kong government to try to persuade everyone to stay home but clearly that hasn't been the case I think that there will be far more arrests than perhaps Carrie Lam had predicted and the big question will be whether the people are tried in Hong Kong where I do think the judiciary is still independent or whether the mainland will use article 55 to bring them to the mainland for trial which would really be a terrible violation of the British trend information thank you thank you Singh more than just talk I think is the operative word there the Communist Party's moved to impose this national security law on Hong Kong seems to be inspired in in part by domestic instability stemming from the party's catastrophic handling as you just mentioned Peterson of the corona virus pandemic and I just came from the China task force where I presented a compensation for Americans Act piece of legislation that I hope we can move forward mr. Lee do you expect discontent at home could push an unstable Beijing to take even more shocking actions against the people of Hong Kong thank you for the question you know I held it the way they try to you know in a way to protest but the tea table I think we have all have to appreciate the foyer of people today these risers and they have actually seen you know instrument of some factors one is the lesson to you know but actually they have used and you know that is mr. public security only and I'm personally most thoughtful 75845 for Israel under the policies security olla little state because now they're usually excuse the proven idea and saying that they would end all gathering and so when we want to organize thank you thank you mr. Lee real quickly China seems to have accelerated in timeline for passing and implementing the nation national security law in order to turn the tide against pro-democracy candidates at September's Hong Kong Legislative Council elections I don't know though you have time to answer because my time is about out miss Peterson but how do you anticipate the national security law will impact the makeup of Hong Kong's Legislative Council what actions can the international community take to protect the pro-democracy movement this September thank you for that question well very briefly I do anticipate that the Beijing and Hong Kong government will try to use this law to disqualify pro-democracy candidates from running for office I think the democracy movement is being very careful to try not to boil it violate the law or at least to make sure that there are candidates who can still stand but it's going to be very difficult I think they will try to use it as a pretense for disqualifying them thank you Miss Peters in my times ex parte I appreciate the indulgence of the chair agilent's of the chair and I want to thank chairman Elliot for his leadership on this committee and here in Congress it is an honor to serve with you sir I yield back

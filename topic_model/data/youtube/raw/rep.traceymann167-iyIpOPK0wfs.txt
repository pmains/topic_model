today marks one year that president biden has been in office and you think back over this last year all this happened in our country there's no doubt that america is worse off today than it was on this day back in 2021. i just look at things like inflation i look at the debt that skyrocketed i look at empty grocery sales i like the producers who are seeing their margin squeeze because they can't get fertilizer or their input costs a lot of our input costs for our producers are doubling tripling quadrupling this is a massive problem we have skyrocketing energy prices not to mention we have an open southern border we don't even know who's coming in we don't even know how many drugs are coming in not to mention what we did in afghanistan and how we've weakened our standing in the world and now we're getting wishy-washy as russia is thinking about invading ukraine uh now's the time for strong american leadership unfortunately we're not seeing that in the white house but we have to push back and we're pushing back with policies we're pushing back uh with the courts and today uh this week marks the 49th anniversary of roe versus wade hopefully we're going to see the supreme court uh overturn roe versus wade and enter a new chapter of american history and really the next next chapter of our great nation so thanks a lot a lot of work ahead of us better days to come

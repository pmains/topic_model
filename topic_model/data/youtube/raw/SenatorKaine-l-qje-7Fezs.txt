well new this morning small business owners throughout south west and central Virginia are anxiously waiting to see what happens with the Marketplace Fairness Act better known as the internet sales tax bill the bill would allow states to tax internet companies the same way brick-and-mortar businesses are taxed it took several weeks that passed the Senate eventually doing so with seventy percent of the vote in early May but since then the bill is stalled in the House of Representatives Virginia senator Tim Kaine helped pass the bill in the Senate and says he's frustrated with the lack of progress you hate to work on something like this in the Senate passes by 70 votes and see it stalled and so I hope if I think of enough mayors and governors and and retailers contact House members that's probably the thing that would persuade them to move for now many republicans argue the bill is a tax increase tumors

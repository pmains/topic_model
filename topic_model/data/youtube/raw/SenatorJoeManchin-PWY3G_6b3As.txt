So what I focused mainly on was my academic GPA
in high school. I took multiple AP classes and dual
college credit classes in high school, and I did well in those classes. A lot of people say like, you need to get\your standardized testing scores up. Mine weren't actually that great. So I'd say if you can't get those up, you can counterbalance
that with a good GPA. I had multiple leadership positions
in high school sports, so that helped. I was captain on football and wrestling,
so I know that definitely helped as well. And like if you've already gotten
in preparing yourself for like actually getting here. There's not really much you should do. If you've already gotten in, you're you're pretty much prepared for whatever
they're going to throw at you during this. So I would say if you've already gotten
in, just enjoy your time at home with your family and friends
because you'll definitely miss that.

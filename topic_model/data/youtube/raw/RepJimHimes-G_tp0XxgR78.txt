I thank the gentleman from New York and and and and Thank You mr. speaker and I also thank the ranking member I very much appreciate his comments that he will support this bill I will just observe as a member of the Intelligence Committee that we have seen our politics twisted into almost unrecognizable form by the unprecedented attacks of the President on the Department of Justice on the FBI on the investigation as a whole this report must see the light of day and must be available to the American public for a catharsis that will allow us to start with the facts to understand what happened and to rebuild the faith that the American people did and should have in the Department of Justice in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and in the government in general so I rise in strong support of Congress in strong bipartisan fashion passing this bill so that the American people will understand that the truth will be out there and it will help fix our politics with that I yield back and thank the gentleman the gentleman yields back

joining us online is senator roger marshall dr marshall represents kansas in the united states senate he is now promoting legislation prohibiting the department of defense from dishonorably discharging service members for choosing not to receive the covenant 19 and vaccine senator marshall really appreciate the time it's great to be with you again so let's talk about what the actual regulations are for service members at this point with regard to covid19 the basic idea seems to be that if they refuse to get a vaccine even if they have natural immunity then they theoretically could be dishonorably discharged correct ben that's it it's really pretty simple this white house wants to separate every soldier who's refusing to take the vaccine he wants to make them a felon and give them a dishonorable discharge and i think what your listeners need to realize is just how how horrible a dishonorable discharge is uh it's basically giving you a making you a felon it's gonna keep it may state you from being able to vote it's gonna take away your second amendment it'll probably keep you from getting a job you're going to lose all your veterans benefits access to the va hospitals as well as any type of retirement money as well so this is a horrible thing to do to soldiers and yes you mentioned they do not acknowledge natural immunity so has there has there been any bipartisan support for what you're attempting here which is to at least allow people if they're going to leave to leave with an honorable discharge as opposed to a dishonorable or is this breaking down purely along partisan lines you know unfortunately it's still on partisan lines uh we hope if we could get a to a floor vote perhaps with the ndaa the national defense authorization dollars here at the end of the month maybe we'll get bipartisan support because there has been some bipartisan support on the house for this so senator marshall so much of this seems to be tied to the biden administration's notion that if they just yell loud enough about vaccine mandates that somehow they will yell their way out of their own bad policy joe biden yesterday was talking about broad-based vaccine mandates by the way he still has not issued a regulation from osha he said a month ago he was going to issue an actual government regulation via osha that was going to force businesses to either vaccinate the people who work for them fire them or test them those were the three opportunities that are going to be afforded apparently biden still has not issued that regulation he's just jabbering about how wonderful vaccine mandates are at this point i think the reason by the way that he has not issued regulation along those lines is he's very much afraid the courts will not only shoot it down but may shoot down the chevron doctrine at the same time and completely undermine the administrative state but the the focus from this administration seems to be our failures our economic failures our coveted policy failures they are entirely the result of your neighbors and friends who refuse to get vaccinated and so if you just give me more power and if you allow me to punish more of your enemies then we will we will punish and and authoritarian our way out of this thing yeah you're right i call this by inflation uh the policies of joe biden have led to inflation we'll just call it bite inflation and this policy of mandates for all the employers is only going to exacerbate that situation i think we're going to have some horrible jobs numbers today i think gosh i don't know if you've been the grocery store lately but i was stunned i hadn't been in about six weeks and i was just done sunday night when i went to the grocery store let alone at the gas pumps so this policy not only is it unconstitutional look we all know a federal mandate for vaccines is going to be unconstitutional but he's never really paid attention whether it was within the limits of the law or not he's joe biden and he can do anything he wants to do he's acting like a totalitarian he's turning this country into a socialistic country ben i think the big choice america has today do we want a free economy or do you want big government socialism we could really sum all the laws that this president and nancy pelosi are pushing by those two phrases which which does america want a free a free economy or do they want big government socialism so senator marshall obviously uh some of the issues that we're talking about here have sort of broader play when it comes to joe biden and his build back better agenda and all the rest of this so obviously the republican caucus sort of split last night over the issue on whether to push off the debt ceiling for a couple of months it seems like there was pretty solid republican support for not doing that uh somehow it seems that uh that that sort of split up what was the actual strategy there like behind behind the scenes what exactly was senate majority senate minority leader mcconnell suggesting was the rationale for why the the republicans had to basically let the democrats off the hook instead of forcing them to use reconciliation to pass the debt ceiling you know i think number one is just it shows democrat incompetence so many of the people on the other side have never signed a paycheck have never ran a job have never gone without a paycheck because they had to pay their help first and i think this just demonstrates their incompetence they could have easily done this through a reconciliation process but they want to play political gymnastics with this i would say and you know behind the scenes you think about uh the filibuster and how important that is i think there was concern that we would lose the filibuster if we didn't give in somehow some way since the democrats waited till the 11th hour to get something done the the old filibuster she started coming up and i wanted to just again realize what losing the filibuster would mean if we lost the filibuster the first thing that happens puerto rico and washington dc become a state we lose the minority forever they packed the court and we never have a republican majority again so i think it came down to almost russian roulette keep the filibuster or lose this battle we didn't want to win the battle but lose the war so we'll live to fight another day america really should turn its focus though back onto this reckless spending reckless taxing that's going to lead to more bite inflation yeah senator marshall one more question on that when if it comes down to september because this is only a temporary debt ceiling increase if this comes down to december again and the democrats have now had a long lasting opportunity to hash out all of their differences over build back better and they still have not come to a conclusion and they still don't want to use reconciliation in order to pass the debt ceiling do republicans just extend it again what's what are the limits to republican patients here yeah that's a good question and and that's the uh the political gymnastics we're going to have to run through i'm much more focused right now on stopping their five and a half i think gonna be seven trillion dollars of spending then i am worried about the debt limit right now i think the debt limit will actually end up we gave them enough leeway one thing we did win the one victory on the debt ceiling we did win was a number they wanted a blank check book they wanted an open-ended uh credit card so we do have a finite number how much more money they can borrow i think that those dollars could go into late december early january and then not make it part of this game so let's get locked in right now on what we can control and that's stopping the seven trillion dollar bill that again is going to lead to more bite inflation so let's talk for a second about that seven trillion dollar bill because obviously we've got this 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure package the bipartisan infrastructure package and it seems like the basic deal here for for joe manchin and kristen cinema was if republicans provide a certain level of support for that then they will minimize the size of the countervailing build back better 3.5 trillion boondoggle package joe manchin seems to be sticking to his guns at 1.5 trillion it looks like the biden administration is steadily moving down toward mansion and cinema they started off at three and a half trillion they're now down at about 2 trillion 1.9 trillion it looks more and more likely that something is going to get done here uh what what should republicans do at this point because again that there's not anything in that package that is really worthy of republican support yeah i think we gave cinema senator cinema and senator manchin enough air cover to keep fighting for another day i but i'm going to just share with this and i shared this yesterday in conference with the rest of the republicans i'm probably more worried about the policy going for as much as i am the the dollar amount and what i'm talking about is the the taxes what taxes do joe and and chris kirsten want to keep and what one do they get rid of the good news is when i sit down with both of those senators and look them in the eye they actually understand stepped-up basis they understand what a 1031 exchange is they understand what happens if we start taxing capital gains as ordinary income and how that will destroy the economy so i think what republicans have to keep doing is keep working uh with joe and kirsten and giving them some air cover so they can keep fighting but we need to really get locked in on this tax policy which again leads to big government socialism i mean it seems as though uh right now the democrats are still working on a pretty compressed timeline because for a couple of reasons one the economic report that just came out today is absolutely horrible for joe biden i mean is it it's terrible for the country it's terrible for biden 194 000 jobs he added which is like lower than many of the months of say the obama administration which was famously a low growth administration those job numbers are awful especially coming out of an artificial comatose artificially comatose economy last year we were supposed to be experiencing like seven digit job growth nearly month on month we have 10 million open jobs in this country right now goldman sachs had forecast are going to be six to seven hundred thousand new jobs added this month instead it's less than two hundred thousand jobs added but it's perfectly obvious that this is a direct result of the of the biden administration number one paying people to stay home number two panicking people about covet to the extent where they're saying that the unvaxed are somehow providing a threat to the vax sufficient that even if you're vast you should be staying home and freaking out over all of this the the bite administration pursuing as you say bad tax policy that is scaring investors out of actually investing their dollars because i don't know how many dollars i actually have in my pocket to invest given the fact that i don't know my tax rate is going to be if they make the the tax rates retroactive to the beginning of the year i literally have money sitting in bank accounts that i cannot invest because i don't know whether i'm going to owe it to the federal government at the end of the month the the the sort of insanity of all of this has led to low growth uh and yet the biden administration continues to push forward on this i think the reason that the the they're working on a short timeline is because with this bad economic report joe biden could try to ram this thing forward but he has done such a poor job at this point that manchin and cinema have an awful lot of air cover if they actually wish to kill the thing beyond that we also have a virginia gubernatorial election that's coming up the beginning of november if somehow glenn young beats terry mcauliffe in that election there could be a lot of moderate democrats who are scared out of their wits as they should be ben it sounds like you've been going to my town halls we've done over 60 town halls since february uh the anger is absolutely you can actually palpate the anger but now it's turning into panic that's what we're seeing we're having probably three to four times more people come to our town halls than we've ever had before and the the democrat socialists think americans are dumb that they don't get it that they need a nanny but americans do get it they've seen one crisis after another created by this president you know you could go back to the border violence inflation afghanistan and now vaccine mandates and they really they realize what's happening and they certainly feel the sting when they go to the grocery store and feel that bite inflation as well so you're spot on and that's why we got to keep the volume up don't let them law you to sleep on all these gymnastics that they want to talk about when it comes to debt ceiling we need to stay locked in on stopping this legislation that i think again just put it all together it's going to be 7 trillion let's stop talking about bipartisan infrastructure plan and human infrastructure which is socialism they want to spend 7 trillion over 10 years they're going to come back and say no it's only one and a half but once you start some of these policies you're never going to stop them i'm going to give your listeners one example they want to take dollars away from medicare to pay for some of their infrastructure medicare folks don't want this they want to expand medicare and it's going to dilute those people that are on medicare right now we're already facing a financial crisis with medicare let's not compound it we're speaking with senator roger marshall of the state of kansas center marshall appreciate your hard work on these issues and keep fighting because obviously the the country is a pretty large precipice right here you bet ben great to see you and i appreciate you covering these these issues in depth for your listeners

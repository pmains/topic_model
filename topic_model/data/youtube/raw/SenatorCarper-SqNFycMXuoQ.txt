yeah looking back on the the last uh several days there's actually a couple things to feel good about we passed last week uh very important legislation improving and strengthening our cyber uh defenses and our ability to fend off some of the uh 24 7 attacks that we're uh being visited on financial institutions on our military on colleges and universities research operations on businesses in our country and very proud of the bipartisan work that we did on cyber security information particularly on the information sharing front and some of the new technologies that are being deployed to help fend off the attacks from the bad guys from around the world i feel good about that i and not everybody likes the uh the the budget are given to your budget agreement that's worked out it's sort of in rough form but it is uh i i like to say have a friend you ask him how he's doing he says compared to what and the the idea of living from week to week not knowing if we're gonna have to shut down the government continuing to spend enormous amounts of time human capital uh just getting ready for a shutdown and hopefully it won't happen but preparing for the worst week after week month after month and i think we have for the most part said we're not going to be doing that for the next two years and that uh whether you like every morsel and portion of the uh the budget deal uh i think we can pretty much all say compared to what well it's better than the the path we were on and today uh as we prepare to take up an uh next couple of weeks transportation policy for our country and transportation funding to fund that policy the uh there's some late breaking news uh this uh this morning from the house representatives but they've taken a uh a very very modest transportation bill including funding uh extremely authorization authorization we're probably a two two part deal here we actually authorized uh uh transportation policy and then we try to figure out how to pay for it uh too often in the past we have decided to pay for it by bailing out the transportation trust fund and the the legislation we passed i voted against here in the uh the senate last month on transportation i served last last congress i chaired the senate uh subcommittee on transportation infrastructure i'm i think the number two democrat on the environment of public works uh bill i'm an old governor former governor spent a lot of time eight years as governor for my own state delaware uh focused on transportation infrastructure chaired the national governors association for for a year and and uh so i looked at these issues nationally as well as as a as as a governor the uh but if you look at the the authorization bill again that's the like the one of the two parts of our legislation to authorize programs a lot of what we did in the the senate uh coupled with what they did in the house was pretty darn good i was very proud of it i want to give shout outs to some of my colleagues center boxer senator inoff you know always think of them as two people work closely well together but on transportation issues on infrastructure issues they do and provided very good leadership and they're good enough to let the rest of us uh join in and i think we had a a good a good uh uh policy or a series of policies that we can be uh proud of and i'll just run through a couple of them here after this off of this chart uh i've been a big uh had made a big focus on freight transportation it's not just people who use roads highways bridges or transit to get places but we use we move an enormous amount of freight in this country we remove a lot of freight in this country on barges actually not many people think of that or ships we move a fair amount in the airplanes uh we move a uh a fair amount on on trains we also move a great deal of our freight uh by by roads highways and bridges and the legislation that we passed out of the environment public works committee on i believe a unanimous vote the unanimous vote makes really good progress on the freight transportation side uh trying to make our those highways bridges more uh reliable uh more uh affordable and and more more efficiency and more efficient that's and that's good well the the legislation we passed out of committee which i think is mirrored in the uh the the house bill house transportation bill is that we prioritize bridge safety i think something like one out of every i want to say four one out of every four bridges in our countries deemed by people a lot smarter than me that they're not safe and uh so we in our legislation we focused on bridge safety we focused on large facilities large projects of national importance not little bitty projects but but big ones of national importance regional importance the legislation the transportation authorization legislation from the house and from the senate also increases baseline funding and funding for public transportation and it focuses on clean air funding for toward the the most uh dangerous diesel emissions to to address the bang for the buck if you will if you ever go by uh road projects or road highway bridge projects and diesel projects or rather a transit project you will oftentimes see this yellow equipment it's usually yellow equipment it's almost always powered by diesel and the they put out those vehicles put out a lot of pollution a lot of pollution and we provide a little bit of money here to in the authorization uh legislation to say well that can't be good for us it can be good for the people who live around their work around there and let's uh see if we can't uh get some reduction in those emissions and now the other thing i liked about our authorization bill was the research grants that go to states to see if we can't find a better alternative to user fees which we've historically traditionally used and uh to eventually replace the the gas tax was something that makes more sense it could be something we call vehicle miles traveled in oregon they call it a road user charge it could be tolling it could be tolling in conjunction with uh public-private partnerships but just to look at the the alternatives to to to your user fees like the gas tax like the diesel tax which has not been raised for 22 years 22 years let's see what we've got next last time we uh we raised the the user fees in this country you know and part of me wishes i could be doing mr president part of me wishes i could be doing this uh the speech surrounded by uh former presidents who have supported the use of user fees and i think if we go back to uh the uh a long time actually when i was just a little kid before you were born uh but uh dwight eisenhower the the president who brought us the interstate uh highway system he was an advocate of user fees he felt that things were worth having worth paying for uh since then we've had other other presidents let me think about another president who thought that was a there was i think bill clinton thought the user fees were were an appropriate uh i want to say george herbert walker bush might have been one of the people thought that if things are worth having the folks that use businesses that use our roads highways bridges ought to pay for i think there might have even been one more uh yeah ronald reagan ronald reagan who who supported the the notion as as well said bipartisan democrats and the republican governors have said for a long time if we really want to have a better transportation system we got to pay for it and the the idea that the folks who use that system the businesses that use that transportation system have some responsibility to pay for it that's been the way we've done it for a long time and maybe someday when we have the ability to do these uh vehicle miles travel deals with not have to worry about privacy concerns and we figure out how many miles every car truck van uh in the uh the truck in the uh the the country travels and be able to assess a user fee i don't know if we're gonna be able to do that they've been trying to do this in oregon for a long time but maybe we'll somebody have the ability to do that but up until and that's to be a pure user fee but their concerns have been raised about doing that as well so but anyway since 1993 what's been happening well maintenance costs have continued to rise we raised the the gas tax 1993 to 18.3 cents we raised the diesel to per gallon we raised the the uh uh the tax on diesel federal tax on diesel to i think 24.3 something like that and what has happened us in the last 22 years uh believe it or not uh cost of concrete has gone up a lot the cost of asphalt has gone up a lot cost of steel cost of labor has gone up a lot and the the gas tax and the diesel attacks have stayed right where they are right where they were 22 years ago the gas tax has lost some 40 of its purchasing power 18.3 cents from 1993 is today worth about a dime about a dime and i think the 24 3 diesel tax is now worth somewhere between 10 and 15 cents and we have done nothing about it nothing about we've not even been willing to consider indexing these these user fees to the rate of inflation again why has the uh the highway trust fund voted let's let's uh not everybody knows we have a highway or transportation trust fund we do via not everybody understands is largely fed by user fees it is not everybody understands that when we run out of money in the transportation trust fund we uh we uh have to if we're gonna we're gonna still build rose highways bridges and transit systems we've got to do something about it and the uh what we oftentimes do is we move money from the general there's a general fund from our country and move that money over to fill up the transportation trust fund or the highway fund uh when you run out of money in the general fund we go around the world cup in hand 10 cupping hand and borrow money from all kinds of people including the chinese and say we like to borrow some money from you and by the way we don't want you to uh we don't want you to be uh mucking around in the south china sea or spratley island all those other places where i used to fly around as a naval flight officer we don't want you to be manipulating your currency we don't want you to be dumping your stuff your products on our markets and the chinese what you know one of the things they're thinking of maybe saying is we thought you wanted to borrow money and so get off our backs we don't want to be in that that that situation there is a growing need for uh for road repair as i mentioned earlier on bridges one out of four bad highways surface something like two out of every 10 miles of highways services are are not good we got vehicles that are more fuel efficient that's a good thing cafe legislation which we adopted dianne feinstein was the lead on that i was she's good enough to let some of us help her write that but over the next probably 10 years or so ahead of us we're going to continue to require more energy-efficient vehicles there's been an actual reduction in in annual miles driven the millennial generation a lot of them don't want to have a car and i remember as a kid growing up maybe you as mr mr president maybe he was a kid i couldn't wait to get a drive or have a car and that was sure of my generation not so my sons one yes one no and we got an aging system here an aging system that needs to to be uh to be addressed and the the face of congressional inaction uh what have we done to pay for our transportation system well we use budget gimmicks we're pretty good at pinch and smoothing those pensions must be pretty smooth right now because we've used that we've used unrelated uh offsets to pay for stuff say for example monies that go to tsa to supposedly to provide the safer travel in our our airlines and airways we're going to use that money instead to to go into transportation money that should be used to strengthen our ability to to monitor traffic coming across our borders a lot of vehicular traffic a lot of trade we're going to raise those fees custom fees but we're not going to use them to strengthen our defenses along our border um and other stuff that frankly just has no relationship with uh with transportation that's what we've done gimmicks what's next it's not not an easy thing to think about but these are some numbers that are that we ought to look at we bailed out the transportation trust fund in 2008 to the tune of 8 billion we bailed it out again in 2009 7 billion next year 2010 almost 20 billion dollars 2013 over 6 billion dollars and really got into uh the bailout business in 2014 23 billion dollars in the the current year of 10 billion dollars 10 billion you add it all up and it's about a 75 billion dollar bailout remove money from the general fund that does means we don't have money to spend other things that are legitimate needs in our country and we're using it to pay for things we ought to actually pay for or be paid for by the folks who use the businesses who use our roads highways and bridges now i've had a lot of people say to me why should we raise the uh these user fees why should we raise the the gas tax or the the diesel taxes and i i put it to simple it's fair it is fair the notion that folks people businesses who use these roads and highways and bridges ought to pay for them to me that seems fair and frankly it seemed fair in this country for about 60 years for 60 years and we seem to have gotten away from that we need to get back to that a couple of questions same question asked several times why raise the the gas tax and diesel tax and fix the trust fund this is 324 dollars what is 324 dollars that's how much the average driver in this country spends a year on repairs to the vehicles with replacement of tires we've done that axles you know tire rims wheel worms you name it it adds up to anywhere from i've seen it actually estimates as high as 500 we'll take the lower end 325 324 that's we pay for it one way or the other that's how much we spend on the average in vehicle repairs again the same question why raise the gas tax fix the trust fund the number 42 shows up here that's because that's how many hours a year we spend sitting in traffic on average it's not my numbers every year texas a m updates this number and they say in cities like washington dc you're philadelphia up the road from where senator coons and i live new york city up the road where some family our family members live or from denver l.a your name it's 80 it's about 82 hours per year 82 hours per year that's how much time we spend just sitting in traffic putting out wasting gas putting out emissions harmful emissions and uh this is the uh the number of billions of gallons of gas that we waste just sitting in traffic every year 2.9 billion gallons of gas that's a lot that's a lot um i don't know if it's the last poster that we have but uh but it's it's not a bad one to close on uh all my uh much my public life is senator coons my colleague is waiting here to for me to stop talking so he can speak but he knows he's heard me i've talked any number of times and i've heard him to say one of the major roles of government is to provide a nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation we have many roles in government but a major role of government is to provide a nurturing environment for job creation job preservation we don't create jobs senators don't create jobs governors don't create jobs county executives no matter how talented they are presidents don't create jobs but what we do is create a nurturing environment that helps support job creation and job growth what does that include world-class workforce young people not so young people coming out of our colleges universities that can read or write and think out of our high schools you read write think use math technology good work ethic um the public safety rule of law affordable energy affordable health care access to foreign markets and also the ability to move goods and products from place to place in this country and to export markets outside of this country uh our friends at mackenzie have a uh and an entity it's a wing of uh a piece of their operation a big consulting firm and it's called global institute mckenzie global institute they've done a little bit of thinking and calculating to see if we actually made robust investments fully robust not just limp along investments or not just you know creeping from you know year to year borrowing money from the the uh the uh general fund but who actually made robust investments what would it do what would it do uh and uh among the things that it would do this is we're talking about 50 to 120 billion annual investments from all sources state local federal do this for 15 to 20 years what would it do in terms of employment in this country and in terms of gdp in this country well here's what i would do it would add those kinds of investments in our transportation system would raise gdp by anywhere from about 1.4 to 1.8 percent per year per year not one time per year in addition to that about 1.8 almost 2 million jobs and about half those jobs would be men and women going to work building roads highways bridges transit systems roughly the other half would have because we'd have a more efficient economy and just the time and economy actually move products and goods much more effectively much more efficiently and have a more efficient more productive economy so we say uh thanks very much to the folks from mckinsey global institute if uh we actually actually do a lot of the people who will be put to work building our roads highways bridges and transit systems they haven't been working much lately uh because we've underfunded transportation investment now for years at the federal level and at the state and local level and if we fund it in a more appropriate way more robust way we put a lot of people have been on the sidelines unemployed underemployed put them to work doing something productive with their lives again and at the same time we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our economic recovery so that's that mr mr president that i say my colleagues have been waiting patiently for for me to finish and uh and i uh you know i'll close with these words someone said to me how do i feel you know that the house seems to have come up with a little more money we're not sure the pay for that they're using i don't understand it well i don't think most of us do somehow we found some magic money in the federal reserve and i hope it's legitimate i hope there aren't any unintended consequences that we're not aware of but we'll find out about that over the next several days i hope but uh i i'm not outraged by i was frankly outraged by what we passed here a month or so ago so grossly underfunded three years uh funding not very thoughtful funding and uh what we hear from the house is it's more robust and we'll i'm happy to take a look at that but what it is not it is not a user-free approach it basically doesn't say okay those who use our our roads highways bridges ought to pay for them we don't we sway from that we stray from that and sort of a grab bag of places that have nothing to do for money nothing to do for transportation and we're gonna use that money and it's only for a short while we'll be back in the soup again in four or five years uh i don't think so i don't think i think we can do better than that so you can just color me uh disappointed deeply disappointed and we live to fight another day but it's too bad we didn't take advantage of this day and seize the day thank you mr president

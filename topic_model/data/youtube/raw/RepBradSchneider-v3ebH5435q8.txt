recognition Mr Speaker I have an amendment at the desk clerk will designate the amendment amendment number 2 printed in House report number 115 - 665 offered by mr. Snyder of Illinois pursuant to House Resolution 879 the gentleman from illinois mr. schneider and a member opposed each will control five minutes chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of my amendment which would help those communities saddled with housing our nation's stranded nuclear wastes while the federal government has failed to meet its legal obligation to find a permanent repository this is something the constituents understand all too well the former nuclear Zion nuclear power plant located on valuable lakefront property in Zion Illinois has housed more than two million pounds of spent nuclear fuel since the plants closure in 1998 this waste situated on the very shores of Lake Michigan is both an extreme environmental hazard and a severe burden to the quality of life of the residents of Zion deterring economic investment depressing home values and driving up property taxes to fill the void of local revenue Zion is not alone across the country there are 17 nuclear power plants at various stages of decommissioning with even more announced closure slated for years ahead in these communities plants are typically the largest employer in the area and when they close and waste is stored on-site on site it is devastating to the local communities my amendment seeks to help these communities access desperately needed federal resources until waste is moved waste that is quite literally stranded in these communities due to the federal government's inaction specifically my amendment would require the Secretary of Energy to assemble a task force to work across all federal agencies in identifying existing resources and funding opportunities that could assist communities with decommissioning plans where waste is being in store is being stored in addition the task force would work with communities in the decommissioning process to develop a transition plan to mitigate the economic damage when a plant closes communities like Zion Illinois have been forced shudder the burdens of storage with no compensation in return I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and help our communities get the federal help they are owed and mr. speaker this time I'd like to yield one and a half minutes to my friend the gentlewoman from Ohio Marcy Kaptur gentlelady from Ohio is recognized for one and a half minutes I think my fellow Great Lakes member tentative Schneider for yielding the time and also want to thank the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee congresswoman Lowey for offering this amendment I rise in support of this effort to help communities that are left with radioactive waste after the closure of a nuclear power plant the Great Lakes region I might point out has no energy umbrella-like the Bureau of Reclamation for the 17 western states or for portions of the south the tennessee valley authority that can help communities readjust on a large scale for energy disruptions or changes in my district of northern ohio the davis-besse nuclear power plan is scheduled to be shuttered we are not waving the white flag just yet but this community and its people need the tools to cope with the aftermath of what if the worst happens when nuclear power plants close the impact on local economies due to the loss of jobs and tax revenue will be severe for years the davis-besse power plant has provided 700 good jobs and generated 20 million dollars a year in tax revenue for a rural county called Ottawa County of which 12.1 million each year goes to its school district that nine hundred megawatt power plant does more than produce power it builds community this major financial support could disappear and leave the community in that entire County struggling to support schools law enforcement and roads and therefore I strongly support this amendment to help these communities adjust as necessary to access federal resources and make a plan for economic revitalization thank you congressman Schneider for offering this common-sense amendment one that is so vitally necessary especially across the Great Lakes region which is so often neglected and I want to thank chairman Shimkus and ranking member Tonka for their leadership as well and urge my colleagues to support it expired gentleman from Illinois reserves what purpose does the gentleman from Illinois mr. Shimkus seek recognition thank you miss Chairman's chairman I rise to the minim although I will not oppose the amendment without objection and the gentleman is recognized Thank You mr. chairman I appreciate my colleague from Illinois one of those Chicago Landers that I talked about for bringing this amendment and I use his district and I've used it for years to talk about the challenges that we face if we if we don't do it if we don't if we do nothing and this authorization bill is designed to start doing something and actually it's it's designed to help us comply with the law that's already written Zion is the perfect example of of the need to move to a spent nuclear fuel to an interim site and then the final geological repository thus freeing up obviously great lakefront opportunities on the Great Lakes for redevelopment that would help this community that suffered further closure so I'm glad you're here I appreciate the the amendment and I'm going back to what Mark Sanford said this is a national problem we need a national solution that's what we're trying to do now in a bipartisan manner and good job thank you for offering the amendment and I reserve the balance of my time Jim reserves his time gentleman from Illinois is recognized Thank You mr. Speaker I would now like to yield one minute to my friend and a co-sponsor of this amendment the gentlewoman from New York Nita Lowey the gentlelady from New York is recognized for one minute Thank You mr. speaker and I thank the gentleman from Illinois mr. Schneider for working with me on this very important amendment Indian Point Energy Center in my district is scheduled to cease operations in 2021 when the plan closes the village of UK we'll be left with a large amount of stranded nuclear waste on site this amendment would help you cannon and the town of Courtland access vital resources for economic redevelopment until the Department of Energy takes title to nuclear waste and removes it from our communities the federal government must do all it can to support these de facto interim storage sites I urge adoption of the amendment and yield back thank you I reserve a classic how much time I have left John from Illinois mr.

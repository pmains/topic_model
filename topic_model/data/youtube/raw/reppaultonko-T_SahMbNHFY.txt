attach my comments to those pleased that you've just closed your statement by you know this bankruptcy that is driven by certain catastrophic situations with health care costs are impacting far too many families and this order of work here in the Congress is about prioritization you know we've spent trillions on war and we have really diminished the investments in domestic programming including health care we come up with all sorts of efforts called sequestration which is a hidden attack on investments for a domestic agenda we have to be cautious about how we're just guiding those priorities that we're establishing an hour budgeting here in Washington but if we're to prioritize based on where the public demands are let me just suggest this in closing I have gone to the alzheimer's walk in my district for the past several years and every year the same statement is made this is the largest crowd ever assembly it just keeps growing it tells me the consciousness of this country is that we want something done for this dreadful disease done doing something that will cure our individuals who are walking and living with Alzheimer's and dementia the people have asked for this by their participation in local fundraising events is that the way we respond to a crisis by hoping that we have good weather on the walk day that we use our goal our intended goal that given year as people are strapped with expenses of caregiving and of the medication that's dispensed to those with Alzheimer's and dementia there's a better way to complement that to lead the effort here in Washington with the research with the cure that can be found with the advancements in the pharmaceutical industry to be able to extend life and enhance life and the quality of life that's what I think so powerful about the opportunity we have here I believe we can be those agents of hope I do believe firmly that the priority here is to address this crisis that is devastating our American families and our economy let's go forward and be those agents of hope let's provide for a better tomorrow let's show people that there is a compassion that accompanies the efforts here in Washington and with that representative Garamendi thank you for bringing us together in an important discussion that needs to be followed up with resources and public policy and certainly prioritization that brings us to the threshold of responsiveness that is so needed and so deserved and so much correct thank you very much mr.

Joe is recognized Thank You mr. chairman I just want to make add a few comments here we have never before in human history seen children have adult onset diabetes we have seen a thousand percent increase in type 2 diabetes in the last two decades a thousand percent increase 15 years ago 3 percent of new cases of childhood diabetes or type 2 and now it's 50 percent are type 2 diabetes this as mr. Serrano said this is an epidemic that we all have to deal with and we better wake up and with all due respect to the chairman of the committee for us in 2014 to be talking about having a salt shaker on a chill a child's schoolhouse lunch table is it's it's out of step with the direction that we need to go in these kids are sick and they're going to be sicker and we have talks about Medicaid and long-term spending and how we're going to bend the cost curve and we're going to have all these kids that have diabetes half of the country in the next 10 years is going to have either diabetes or prediabetes we can talk until we're blue in the face about balance in the budget but you're never going to bend the cost curve in Medicare you're never going to bend the cost curve in the Medicaid program if we don't get the diabetes problem under control in the United States of America 50% increase in strokes for children strokes that was unheard of so many years ago until the food industry came in and they add salt they have sugar they'll add fat to our foods it's a problem and I just I want to make one last comment because the gentlelady said 31% increase in fruits and vegetables and that's it that's a real issue it's expensive the 800-pound elephant in the middle of the room is we just passed a farm bill that subsidizes all of the bad food that they're putting in the school that's so cheap it's not BS we subsidize corn wheat high fructose corn syrup it ends up in those Fritos that you were eating a little bit earlier and and the reality I saw yeah I got my I got my eye on you that one and those three empty bags that are at your feet - I always yield to my friend all right you got it but it's true our tax payers have subsidized these products for decades and now we've got a real problem on our hands we subsidize bad food and then we subsidize the health care to take care of the people who got the bad food and you want to know why people in middle America think we're out of our minds that's why and I think if we want to talk about Medicaid and Medicare and cost cost overruns and the health care our balancing the budget next couple decades this diabetes epidemic I am Telling You is the problem that we need to address and so we've got to see all these issues as interconnected and if we see them as interconnected then we can start solving them a little bit of money up front in the school programs can save us a lot of money in the long run I don't know if I have any time left mr. chairman do I have any I'd like to yield whatever remaining time I have left to the Italian grandmother who spoils her grandchildren they have

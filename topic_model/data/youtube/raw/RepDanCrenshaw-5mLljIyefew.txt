congressman i didn't know a three trillion dollar bill was free uh it's not free nothing is free brian and i'm sorry but i but i can't give you a good explanation for this because there isn't one and tell you what it's also well above three trillion dollars i mean the new estimates on it based on actually going through it in the budget committee are almost four and a half trillion dollars and there's only about two trillion dollars in tax increases so i know math is hard for democrats and especially so for the ones who govern but this math doesn't work out the other really interesting thing about about this is their lack of understanding about basic economics so biden said it costs zero dollars that's like saying when i go buy a cup of coffee just because i paid for it that it doesn't cost anything but of course it costs something i think what this bill really boils down to is straight up bribery for the progressive agenda for the progressive activists and trying to bribe the american people and tell you what because of this bill you might need those bribes because it's going to kill your jobs and it's going to kill your wages you know if you're in the energy sector it's an estimated 90 000 jobs lost because of the bills because of the provisions that are in this bill and the natural gas tax for instance not only that but your electricity prices are going to go up as a result and you're not gonna have reliable energy okay just like the problems in california and frankly that's what led to some of the problems in texas there's a lot of bad stuff in this i mean the corporate tax increase will kill jobs not only that but economists estimate it will also reduce wages so this is bad on so many fronts it'll lead to slower growth and stagnation and inflation which is just not something americans need right now so there's two bills just so everyone doesn't get confused there's 1.2 trillion that was handed to you guys at the senate pass with 19 republicans voting for it so-called bipartisan bill evidently there's 23 hard yeses among republicans in the house for that but there's 45 hard no's from the left-wing democrats where's the 1.2 trillion bipartisan plan and what does den do what does dan cranshaw do about that that's a really good point to make so there's the massive reconciliation package and there's the infrastructure package now in the infrastructure package my problem with the infrastructure package is that it's simply too expensive the stuff that's in there isn't that bad but i think it's about three times more expensive than it needs to be and the good news is the progressives aren't going to let democrats pass that one either because look i think the last thing we need after spending almost six trillion dollars over the past year because of coveted relief is more spending all right we need to rein it in do what works for the economy do what promotes growth and when you promote growth businesses flourish they're hiring people and wages increase you know where wages especially increase for the bottom quintile of earners that's proven under the trump economy and we could do it again again all joe biden had to do to be successful was do nothing but he can't help himself but they're going to be raising taxes from 37 to 39 on the upper class they're going to be taking the doubling the capital gains tax they're going to take the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 maybe even higher uh they're going to find a way to pay for at least half of it with tax dollars that usually go to grow the economy congressman it's a scary time i hope republicans can stand up for it because it's not even about politics it's about the future of the country thanks so much

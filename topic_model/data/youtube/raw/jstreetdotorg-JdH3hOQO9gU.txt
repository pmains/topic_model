good evening welcome to the third J Street national conference it is always such an amazing feeling to walk into this room and to walk down the aisle and see so many people so many people i know from across the country so many people who have been involved in this since the beginning and so many of you who are new to it in just the past couple of months it is a terrific site and it's wonderful to be together in one place at this time nearly 2,500 people are registered this year for our conference twenty-five percent more than last year a thousand more than our conference in 2009 and we owe our continued success and our growth to the hard work of thousands of students and local activists and I just want to say thank you want to say thank you to Richard Hanna for leading our roll call this evening and thank you to all those who are so actively involved in building j street from the ground up you are the heart of this movement and I offer you my deepest thanks I also want to say thank you to our national leaders to our boards of directors who are here I've seen our board chairs do vide gielo and Deborah's Agner Victor Kovner and Alex Stanton I want to thank our finance committee and President's Council and of course an incredibly heartfelt and deep thank you to the incredible J Street staff who has worked at a breakneck pace for four years to build J Street into a national movement and finally I want to say thank you to the 40 organizations who are participating in this conference you've seen their names scrolling on the screens as we gathered in the room you will find them out at the tables in the hallways over the next couple of days they are participating in this conference from Israel from the united states and from around the world and together we are building a dynamic movement a pro-israel pro-peace movement that is grounded in the democratic principles on which Israel was founded and the values that have guided the Jewish people throughout our history history is in fact the theme of our conference this year or more specifically making history so what does it mean to make history history is the record of actions taken by people to shape their lives and the lives of those around them the history of our generation will record the actions that we take and the choices that we make and the history of our era rests in no one's hands but our own in the words of Gandhi a small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history so making history means it's up to us to change course and to ensure the different choice are made if we are dissatisfied with the status quo and over the coming days at this conference will be grappling with some very very historic choices that lie ahead the first faces us in the form of national elections right here in the United States and 2012 and we all know how profound the stakes are in the broadest of senses in this election on issues as critical as the economy and health care social justice the status of women but we're also facing a choice in 2012 that relates to our work here at j street and over american policy towards Israel in the Middle East specifically it's a choice over what it means to be pro-israel some are trying to define pro-israel to mean alignment with the political parties of the right of the American and Israeli political map they would say that being pro-israel requires supporting every policy of the present Israeli government in fact they might argue that means going even further to the right so we see members of Congress introducing legislation to support Israeli annexation of Judea and Samaria in the name of being pro-israel we see candidates for president denying the existence of the Palestinian people in the name of being pro-israel in the name of being pro-israel we see state legislatures passing resolutions the call for one state between the Jordan and the Mediterranean without even realizing that this is the formula for the end of Israel as we know it and we see a well-funded machinery attacking as anti-israel political candidates who stand up for American leadership to resolve this conflict for peace for Palestinian rights all in an effort to intimidate them into silence out of fear of the political costs so in 2012 we have to fight this trend we have to make clear that being pro-israel means advocating for an Israel that is secure within borders cognize by its neighbors in the world and for an Israel that embodies the Jewish and the democratic values on which it was founded and that are core to us as a people that we will establish is the future of pro-israel the second choice that we are facing at this conference it's a choice that faces Israel itself Israel today is an exciting and wondrous country it's a miracle as several people said in the video we started with to see the concept of a Jewish homeland brought to life again after 2,000 years it's a wonder to watch a vibrant civil society struggle to ground that nations that nation in the values that we developed over centuries as we lived in other people's lands it's moving to see the burgeoning economic and social justice movements struggling to return the country to its founding vision and of course who among us isn't excited about the amazing advances that Israel is pioneering in technology science medicine and energy just a few weeks ago I had the extraordinary pleasure of visiting the headquarters of a better place it's a company that's aiming to launch a national electric car grid in Israel with plug-in capacity and battery changing stations all across the country it's an amazing sight it all grows out of an idea that was spawned a mere seven years ago by an Israeli entrepreneur and that was spurred on by Israel's President Shimon Peres it's a concept with the potential to revolutionize transportation for the world in a way nothing has since Henry Ford over a century ago while taking a major step forward in the battle against climate change it's amazing that that is happening in Israel yet I don't need to tell you that all of this is at risk if there is no change in the course that Israel is on the status quo between Israel and the Palestinian people is simply not sustainable we know that and most Israelis know that we know that at some point a choice must be made give up the land necessary for a Palestinian state and secure Israel's future as a Jewish democracy or keep all the land and sacrifice either the Jewish or the Democratic nature of the state this isn't a choice that's on the ballot for Israelis in 2012 but it's a fork in the road that lies dead ahead and the history of Israel that our grandchildren and there's will study will be based on the choice of path that this generation makes the third choice we have to grapple with each of us is individual what is each of us going to do faced with the closing window for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians one choice is to wallow in despair and I know how many of you here tonight and how many more have chosen to stay home are distraught about the present situation and yes there is much cause for despair there is no viable peace process to speak of the present Israeli leadership pays lip service to a two-state solution yet its actions undermine the chance for lasting peace peace whether it's expanding settlements on the West Bank failing to uproot illegal outposts as ordered by the Supreme Court or enabling Jewish settlers to move into Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem and within Israel democratic rights are being challenged the status of women is under attack the control of the religious right seems to grow by the week and here in the United States we watch our politics around Israel being dominated by voices that don't represent us we see our communal institutions and our leaders regularly held hostage by a few large funders or a few loud voices who urge them to stay silent and shut the door to debate I understand and I sympathize that all this is enough to make some give up and stay home but we know that the present we're living in is not the future that we want and history doesn't record the inaction of those who stay home history belongs to those who stand up and do history rewards those who see things going wrong and work hard to make them right those who fight passionately for their beliefs I am so excited tonight that we are joined by three Israelis we're taking an active role in shaping history to align with the values and interests of the Jewish people new voices like those of Stav Shaffir a leader of this past summer's protest movement me KL beat on the mayor of your home as well as a voice you have known your whole life that of almost oz these are Israelis who refuse to give in to the status quo they will never give in to despair they refuse to cede history to those whose actions run counter to everything they believe they are the activists who are fighting to make the history of the Jewish people and of the State of Israel in this generation they inspire us to step forward to take action and to make history ourselves in 2008 then candidate Barack Obama told us change will not come if we wait for some other person or if we wait for some other time we are the ones we've been waiting for we are the change that we seek that notion echoes a fundamental precept of the Jewish faith on which I was raised in my house growing up as some of you know the politics were a little bit different from the politics in this room but one lesson that I am so grateful to my father for teaching me is to never accept the inevitability of the status quo as a young man that attitude led my father to join the fight for Jewish independence and it led him to Vienna in 1937 where he stayed doing anything and everything he could for three years to try to get Jews out of Europe and to safety before it was too late and when he was finally forced to leave he came to this country in an effort to jolt Jewish Americans out of their complacency and to get them to recognize the looming catastrophe I grew up every Friday night reading with my father from pair khaya vote the sayings of the fathers and I learned there some of the wisdom that has been handed down to the Jewish people through the generations but there was one message that my father drove home above all else as a Jew you simply are not allowed to throw up your hands and despair and walk away changing the course of events in his in the Middle East today may seem a daunting task some of our friends may say there's nothing to be done they'll argue it's too late the window is closed on a two-state solution some will lay the blame on the Palestinians they'll say there's no partner you know the story we offer them everything and they started an Intifada we gave them Gaza and they sent us rockets others say the blame rests solely with Israel and that the government seems determined to erase the possibility of a two-state solution through relentless settlement expansion and with an exclusive focus on the Iranian threat that at times seems to deny the need to even think about the Palestinians given these obstacles and the seeming intractability of the conflict many of too many are saying why bother but they're in pair k a vote in wisdom first recorded 1800 years ago not much more than a century after the last era of Jewish sovereignty are the well-known words of rabbit are fun who taught us you are not required to complete the task but you are not free to withdraw from it the dozens of locals and J Street you chapters that are hard at work in your communities are doing their part to make history the three inspirational leaders you will hear from tonight are doing theirs we my friends have the power to make history it is up to us to return home from this conference with the charge to rouse our neighbors from indifference it is up to us to inspire our communities leaders to live up to the values that they preach it is up to us to build the political power that sets our leaders free to do what is right and in the best interests of Israel and the United States we have the power to make history and to rewrite the rulebook of American politics we have the power to make history and ensure that Israel's future is as a Jewish and a democratic homeland we have the power to make history and put the words of our sages into action no one will do it for us it is up to you it is up to us together let's make the history of this generation thank you

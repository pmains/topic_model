good morning everybody and senator braun thank you so much for leading this charge i support the vaccine i support the vaccine but not the mandate i support the vaccine not the mandate and i hope president biden was listening to the people of virginia yesterday in a state that he won by double digits a democrat governor lost i think the virginia people were telling the president we still value our freedoms our individual liberties i hope the president heard loud and clear to never get between a mama bear and her cubs and whether the issue is the our school curriculum guard rails for our school curriculum or the issues as a vaccine for a children or maybe making that choice between a jab or a job for those children's parents that the president is listing that we still value our individual liberties i want the people of kansas to know i'm up here working just to protect those civil liberties all of our god-given rights that we've been given i want the people of kansas i want congress i want the president to know that we are going to use every tool in our toolbox every arrow in our quiver to stop joe biden's unlawful vaccine mandate including if we have to stopping cloture on the cr to fund the government unless they take out this language which harms hard-working americans you know it was just months ago that we asked heroes to run to the sound of this battle to this epidemic a time when we didn't know what the consequences were what the morbidity and the mortality was from this virus we asked nurses and health care workers emergency responders to run to the sound of this battle we asked truck drivers to drive our supplies we asked people in the meat packing plants to keep that meat being processed we asked people at wolf creek energy plant to keep their energy going to keep the electricity running for our homes and now those people feel like they're about to get a slap in the face that they're no longer essential employees obviously perhaps 20 percent of americans have chosen not to take this vaccine and again i encourage them to take that vaccine but there's still going to be some that don't and that's going to lead once they're fired or separated it's going to lead to more inflation it's going to exacerbate an already horrible situation with our job shortage plug up more supply chains and again it's going to lead to inflation you know as a physician myself i value the sanctity of the physician-patient relationship i'm taking care of thousands of people with viruses and if i've learned one thing that one virus doesn't impact everybody the same way and that's why patients should have the right to sit down with their doctor to talk about covet 19 what are the risks to to to me to my health versus water the risk from this vaccine and allow that individuality to continue that america has come to enjoy i think the cra is a great way to respond to president biden again it's one tool in the tool shed we're going to do everything we can to stop president biden's unlawful unconstitutional vaccine mandate thank you

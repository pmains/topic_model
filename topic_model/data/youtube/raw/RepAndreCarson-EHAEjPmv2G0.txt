I rise tonight to express my deepest condolences to the Brown family who lost their son far too soon you know as a parent I can only imagine their pain and grief mr. speaker no parent should have to go through such an ordeal as a young african-american man I can relate to the frustration being felt on the streets of Ferguson and streets across our country the history of this great nation mr. speaker past and present is plagued with incidents of bigotry and discrimination in our justice system racial injustice continues to afflict our communities and with each incident like this one old wounds are reopened the feeling felt in Ferguson real and cannot and should not be discounted mr. speaker many right now feel abandoned by our justice system or unfairly singled out for suspicion these are very legitimate concerns that cannot be ignored or overshadowed by those who have turned to violence now as a former police officer mr. speaker I want to say I do respect our system of justice but I also recognize its shortcomings We certainly have a long way to go to guarantee our country's children of color are protected equally under the law in every instance in every neighborhood and all across this great nation mr. speaker no community should have to whether justice has prevailed when a decision like this one has been handed down we must not let Michael's brown Michael Brown's death be in vain that would be a disgrace that would be a tragedy but today our nation is still struggling to heal but this cannot truly happen until we honestly assess how justice is provided across our country this process starts with peaceful protest yes but it ends with lasting reforms that protects all Americans equally mr. speaker this will not be easier quick but what is clear is that this march toward a better more equitable country must begin with a unified front now through this tragedy we bring about lasting change and so tonight on that note I want to ask mr. speaker all of my colleagues my fellow Americans to stand with the Congressional Black Caucus to make this dream a reality mr. speaker you

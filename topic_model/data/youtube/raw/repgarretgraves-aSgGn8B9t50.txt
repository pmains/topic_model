mr speaker i i spent like like you much time in louisiana visiting with small businesses and visiting with with people that are just trying to make ends meet it was national small business week a few weeks ago and visiting businesses i heard over and over and over again the pervasive impact the incredible impact of high gasoline of high energy prices stephanie townes in chicago so i have kids i got to get them to school every day the gas prices are just so high i can't make it mr speaker we've had people talk about the inability to visit and take care of grandchildren the inability to fuel their cars to go to work the inability to even buy groceries because of the profound cost that we've seen related to energy related to gasoline but this shouldn't have been a surprise to anybody during the campaign president biden said we're going to phase out fossil fuels i guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuels and the secretary of the interior the cabinet official responsible for producing american energy said i'm wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands incredible incredible statements i'll say it again none of this stuff should be a surprise to anybody this is a post we put up on january 27th of last year and we said as a result of president biden's energy policies this is exactly what's going to happen let me say it again january 27th of last year six days after some of these policies we're gonna have higher electricity bills higher prices at the gas pump lost revenue for for hurricane protection and flood control and coastal restoration because because there's revenue sharing and that's where these dollars go i have no idea what the president is going to tell these communities whenever we end up having another hurricane in the gulf coast higher delivery costs that would be passed on to consumers more dependence on foreign energy sources like iran like russia like china and other countries that don't share american values and a net increase in global emissions which i remind you mr speaker under president trump we saw emissions go down an average of two and a half percent a year under president biden we've seen them go up 6.3 percent so why is this happening we've seen this administration try and blame price gouging try and say that we're going to fix it through the strategic petroleum reserve releases we've heard him even say that we're going to come in and um and and this is a result of of what's happening with with ukraine and russia but let me go back to the strategic petroleum reserve as a result of their announcement to release all of this oil guess what's happened china's bought some of it and others we've actually moved it from one storage cavern to another and are paying to store in the other place it doesn't even make any sense meanwhile prices have only gone up i have a feeling bigfoot in the loch ness monster are going to be the next responsible entities for higher energy prices don't take my word for it look blackstone ceo said we're going to end up with a real shortage of energy what happens when you have a shortage of supply prices go up and we have a shortage it's just going to cost more and it's probably going to cost a lot more exactly what we've seen the blackstone ceo says if you try and raise money to drill holes it's almost impossible to get that money they prevented access so here are the real reasons this administration came out and in the first day issued an executive order saying that they're going to ban new oil and gas production in the united states they we've nearly tripled under this administration under the bite administration nearly triple dependence on russian oil they imposed through this house of representative passed a bill up to ten thousand dollars a mile a year pipeline fee they've increased royalty rates through this house of representatives by up to 50 percent and the administration unilaterally announced the same thing mr speaker what happens when you impose higher costs do you think that the money just invents itself no they pass it on to consumers and boy have they nailed it they've nailed it let me quote a former treasury official for the byte administration lower gasoline prices undercuts the administration's climate change goals we're really to care about fossil fuel consumption we don't want lower prices for fossil fuel buyers we prefer higher prices they nailed it they nailed it the problem is the impact to the average american we can't afford this it is undermining our ability like i said grandchildren groceries energy bills we can't even afford to live our lives mr mr speaker as noted by mr burgess there's a solution the american energy independence from russia act if we defeat the previous question we're going to be able to bring up this legislation that unlocks american energy allows us to produce energy i don't know what these people have against the americans why are we carrying out policies that benefit russia iran venezuela saudi arabia you know who i care about i care about domestic energy producers i care about american workers why can't we meet our own energy demands just as this bill does congressman westerman and congresswoman kathryn mcmorris rogers supporter thank you congressman westman and congressman mcmorris rogers have legislation that unlocks american energy allows liquefied natural gas terminals to be permitted reduces the regulatory burden it ensures that the keystone pipeline can be built not the policies that democrats are advocating for where in the united states senate senate democrats said they want to urge saudi arabia to use their swing capacity to increase world oil supplies or the current run-up of world oil prices is effectively a tax on american energy families discretionary budget except that the money goes to the opec cartel rather than the u.s treasury actually on this one mr speaker i fully agree i urge that we defeat the previous question we unlock america's energy resources and we lower energy prices for all americans

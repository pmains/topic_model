Mr chairman and thank you all for attending today Mr bar I'm going to have a question for you in a minute about regulation W but I too want to weigh in a little bit on uh the FTX situation you know it's awful and simultaneously not all that surprising until June 2021 FTX was offering ordinary retail customers outside of the U.S leverage of about a hundred and one to one that Leverage is illegal in the United States because it's extremely likely that a customer loses all their money so no big surprise there FTX lent out customer assets for proprietary trading with its affiliate Alameda research misusing its custody assets which it did not own and breaking its promises to its customers so like Senator Toomey I agree this is a lot like MF Global in 2011 and it should be absolutely forbidden my state of Wyoming saw this problem coming in 2019 and banned Banks engaged in digital asset activities from re-lending customer digital assets now that may be surprising to some of the witnesses today but Wyoming has a tough set of rules for digital assets and I hope you'll look at those uh at uh at the Fed there were deep interconnections between FTX and Alameda that encourage both to take big Bets with customer assets that ultimately brought both down Banks today are subject to limits on affiliate transactions under regulation W and are required to disclose their affiliate relationships these limits exist to prevent special transactions like those that occurred between Alameda and FTX so Senator gillibrand and I uh Incorporated many of those ideas into the responsible Financial Innovation act and our act would have prevented the FTX bankruptcy by prohibiting misuse and lending of customer assets requiring proof of reserves for digital asset exchanges limiting affiliate transactions and providing Clarity for affiliate relationships and clarifying the bankruptcy treatment of digital assets so customers get their assets back quickly if an exchange fails it's obvious that Congress needs to regulate digital assets and the lemus gillibrand bill is the legislation that most comprehensively addresses these issues in a way that balances consumer protection and responsible innovation I'm confident that we can get good legislation passed in 2023 and I look forward to working with my colleagues to do that now Vice chair bar I want to turn to you again talk about regulation w why is it important that there be transparency on affiliate relationships for banking regulation and why should Congress consider that for digital asset exchanges uh thank you Senator uh regulation W is is one of the foundation uh regulations uh for banking it's really a quite uh important uh Rule and it it requires not only transparency but also substantive limits uh on the relationship between the bank and its Affiliates the basic idea is that we need to protect the insured depository from a possibility of uh risks being transmitted from the affiliate to the insured depository and therefore hurting the customers and the and the depositors of the bank and and potentially putting the deposit Insurance system uh or taxpayers at risk so those those kinds of limits on the kinds of transactions that Banks can have whether to fill with their affiliate are really a foundational part of of banking law so applying that to for example the FTX situation where there were over 130 related entities would a regulation W type uh of Regulation have assisted in preventing or at least disclosing some of the concerns that developed with FTX what was Senator I I only have available the information you hear reported about on the Press so I'm not sure I'm in a good position to to opine on a particular case a particular firm I don't think that would be prudent but I can say in general regulation W is a really foundational principle and it's it served the banking industry very well thank you Mr Parr thank you Mr Warren of Massachusetts I apologize to Senator Kennedy you're next after I apologize thank you Senator Kennedy Senator Warren

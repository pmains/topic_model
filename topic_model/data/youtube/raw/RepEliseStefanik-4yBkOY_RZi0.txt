Thank You mr. chairman I'm gonna go through pretty quickly because I have seven questions and I'm determined to get through all of them so the first one is for you mr. Lumpkin is the State Department the correct place to have this conductor setting aside some of the issues with the global engagement center do you believe that state is the best place for this point person to be I think it needs to be outside of all the departments outside of all the departments okay so what functionally how would that work would it be similar to the DNI in terms of having all the you know setting aside Intel having the appropriate agencies be a part of that process I think so it's the only concert that I know that's cross-cutting across all departments okay within DoD who is the conductor for I mean that's a great question because public affairs has a conductor at DoD it's in the information space and you have military information operations that resides oversight at ASD Solek right so I asked that question to highlight something that I think we need to focus on on the subcommittee for emerging threats and capabilities we have quarterly briefings when it comes to CT and when it comes to cyber operations and the briefer is able to go around the world and say globally what the threats are and what our operations are I fear that if we had quarterly briefings we would not have one point person who is able to answer our questions region by region by region so are those models that we should use as we seek to tackle IO so what we've worked through over the past 14 years on CT what we're currently doing in terms of elevating cyber command yeah I think that the Joint Staff j30 9 which which is their operation shop that's an information operation should be able to give you and represent what each of the combatant commands is doing with regard to information operations keeping in mind that the information operations piece supports military objectives so do you think that's an important kind of forcing mechanism in terms of congressional oversight thinking about having quarterly briefings on IO I do and I would recommend it okay what role does Cyber Command have in terms of IO I mean they're in because they what role should they I mean because they are they're largely in the intelligence community not in the information space there there is a role but it is is a narrow niche general breedlove um uh nodding your head I'd like you to add to that it was a great question that's what I was nodding my head too I mean in the end Cyber Command is more about the medium by which information is transferred and how to adjust and control and if necessary defend an attack and that meet him so I was shaking my head as I was trying to think through the answer there's not a good answer right now all three of you referenced the strategic communications messaging strategy when it comes to countering Isis can you specifically talk about how this is structured both you know within who the players are within DoD and State how we work with our allies and then the reason I'm asking that question is if we were to identify the top threats in the IO space I would list Russia China and potentially Iran as top three I'd love to get your assessment on the specifics of how that structure and what we can learn there and whether you don't think those three threats are where we should prioritizing having messaging strategies when it comes to those adversaries mr. Garneau do you want to go first on that look if I understood your question correctly but let me just um talk about this so when you talk about Russia information operations it tends to be the military piece or the site or the cyber piece and a little bit of the astroturfing of protest movements kind of china's is a in a a broader space and so it doesn't have a direct bureaucratic counterpart in our systems and that's part of the problem right so we need to create a place where it all comes together and I agree with dr. Lumpkin it has to be above the bureaucratic systems but who when we've got to have as part of our law enforcement you know how capability and ability to track United Front networking operations to see it spread across all the silos of our systems and it's much bigger than just the military place or the cyber face it's it's a hole of public opinion emphasis so let me let me rephrase my question since we have what you the three of you have said is a successful strategy when it comes to countering Isis in the information space do we need to come up with threats specific equivalents when it comes to countering Russia countering China and countering Iran in terms of our prioritization yes my the way with the contract was is in the coalition against Isis we had a a communications working group where we would go and we'd meet quarterly and we would sit there and hammer out you know the messages that audiences and and what they and how we were going to work it against a single adversary and and it was an ad hoc group worked very very well but I think you have to be focused on who is the adversary and and what are the outcomes you're looking for general Breedlove so what made this coalition and this capability successful is that the leadership of our nation and other nations in the coalition gave them the authority responsibility and accountability to take on the mission and I would argue that that's why we're missing in the arrangements with Russia and China we haven't really given one entity like maybe the global engagement center or some other entity that is uber other entities we haven't given them that policy authority responsibility and accountability thank you my times expired

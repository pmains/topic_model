good morning everybody i'm so proud to uh stand here joining senators murray rosen lujan and blumenthal today as well as dr verma as we introduce the let doctors provide reproductive health care act now particular proud to represent california a state that fiercely defends and will continue to defend abortion access i've seen firsthand the life-saving work that our providers in california do to provide critical reproductive care most recently a personal visit to planned parenthood in los angeles just last week now in the weeks since the supreme court overturned roe v wade we've seen democrats fighting to ensure that abortion care remains accessible but at the same time we see republicans continue to take extreme out of touch positions blocking contraception access and threatening to prosecute patients who will travel to other states to seek the care that they need so today we're introducing the bill to protect providers in states like california nevada new mexico and others where abortion remains legal now we've already seen the chilling effect among health care providers driven by uncertainty of their legal protections like the alarming lawsuit filed against a provider in indiana who legally helped a ten-year-old rape victim terminate her unwanted pregnancy we must make it clear for health care providers that abortion restrictions cannot be allowed to reach beyond the borders of anti-abortion states a decision to whether or not to have a child is one of the most personal choices that anyone can make and california will remain a safe place for people who make that choice for the students who want to finish high school before starting a family for the survivors of sexual assault whose abortion reaffirmed their right to choose for their own bodies for parents who desperately wanted a child only to learn later of the devastating news about potential dangerous life-threatening health risks for patients whose lives were saved by their abortion because abortion is often critical medical care access to abortion should not be dictated by politicians and lawyers now california and many other states across the country refused to turn back the clock to an era where abortions were outlawed and dangerous we must pass the let doctors provide reproductive health care act to protect the courageous women and men delivering essential medical care for those who need it and if i made just a few brief comments in spanish before turning it back to senator murray for questions protego [Music] thank you all again for uh for being here thank you for having me senator murray back to you

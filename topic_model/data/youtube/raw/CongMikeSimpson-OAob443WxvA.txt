madam speaker i yield two minutes to one of my hard-working subcommittee chairman on appropriations the chairman of the interior subcommittee gentleman from idaho mr simpson the gentleman from idaho is recognized for two minutes i thank the gentleman for yielding you know there's a way to avoid the consequences of a government shutdown that the gentleman from virginia mr moran spoke about just a few minutes ago and that is to pass this cr put it on the president's desk so that he will sign it and i believe he will sign it the gentleman from north carolina said this could have been avoided he's absolutely right this could have been avoided it could have been avoided by when the democrats control the house and the senate and the presidency last year actually passing a budget or passing an appropriation bill on the floor of the house guess what that never happened you left us with this mess and now you complain about the way we're trying to clean it up the gentleman also said this is an ideological position on which the republicans will not yield he's right and that ideological position is this country is in a fiscal crisis and we are going to get our house back in order if that's the position that we're being criticized for i welcome that criticism mr speaker nobody wants this government to be shut down and frankly there's absolutely no reason to close down the government the smart thing to do would be to pass this one-week cr that saves the taxpayers 12 billion dollars and addresses the dual goals of addressing the fiscal crisis that we're in and averts a government shutdown and it also funds our troops for the rest of this year it enables our congressional leaders in the white house to dot the i's and cross the t's on the final spending bill for 2011. that would be the smart thing to do many of the spending reductions contained in this cr are spending reductions that the president has submitted to congress and either there is fyo 11 or fy12 budget requests almost 1.3 billion of the spending reductions come from my own subcommittee the interior and environment subcommittee and these are spending reductions that will probably be in any final agreement that is made between republicans and democrats so the 12 billion dollars is not extreme it will be in the final agreement whatever that agreement is there is absolutely no reason why the senate cannot pass this bill and send it to the white house i believe if you put it on the president's desk he will fund it he will sign it so that our troops are funded i yield back

secretary johnson i think all of us can agree that we are facing a humanitarian crisis of the first magnitude more money may well be needed to deal with the consequences of this crisis but it does not address the causes of the problem and that's what's troubling to me it's contrary to the evidence to think that some 57 000 children would undertake an extremely dangerous journey to reach our borders if their parents did not think that they would be allowed to stay here once they arrived the administration has pointed to changes made in our immigration laws in 2008 as a partial explanation for the surge in the number of unaccompanied children and i think many of us would agree that that law does indeed need to be revised but it doesn't explain the search if you will look at the chart that i've distributed the surge in unaccompanied children did not begin following the passage of the 2008 law in fact the numbers actually declined between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2011. the wave of children arriving here clearly began in 2012. so we need to look at what happened that year well on june 15th of 2012 president obama took unilateral action and announced his deferred action for childhood arrivals policy now let me make clear that i think the president's action was motivated by compassion but it seems clear to me that it sent the wrong message to those parents in central america and it demonstrates what happens when the president unilaterally decides to issue an executive order affecting immigration without securing the border the number of children more than doubled between fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2013. yet until just recently the president did not even speak out to warn their parents and to tell them that the journey would be horrendously dangerous for their children and that they would be sent home we know that many of these children have been abused or harmed on their way here and when the wave became evident two years ago the president took no action at that time to try to stem the tide we know that it will take a long time before all of these children have hearings that could lead to their being sent home if they show up at all for the adjudications so my question is what specifically is the administration doing to propose changes in the laws or regulations right now so that these children can be safely and immediately put on planes and return to their parents and wouldn't such an action send the strongest possible message to the people of central america that they should not allow their children to go with these smugglers and come here senator first of all i know this from personal conversations with these kids i've spoken to dozens of these kids and i know from talking to border patrol officers who've spoken to these kids the first thing they say when you ask them why did you come here it has to do with the conditions in the three central american countries my mother told me that the gang was going to kill me or my brother was killed it's always initially that second clearly they know that if they come to the united states our laws require certain things that we transfer them to the department of health and human services but it's also the case that the criminal smuggling organizations are creating considerable misinformation about the state of our laws and so forth they're telling in order to induce the family member to pay three thousand five thousand or whatever it is they tell them things like you'll get a free pass and it will expire at the end of june or the end of may the fact is and i've been saying this publicly now for weeks and it's being repeated in central america in the spanish press that the deferred action program that was established two years ago is for children who've been in this country for seven years since june 2007 so it is simply wrong to say that if you come here today tomorrow or yesterday you're going to benefit from daca and so we continue to say that we continue to repeat that and they're saying that and repeating it in the central american countries i said that yesterday in a press conference i believe and but you know we're dealing with criminal smuggling organizations in order to induce payments of money we'll put out considerable disinformation about this now you've asked about changes in law i believe and i agree that people in central america need to see illegal migrants coming back the children the children accompanied by their parents and the unaccompanied adults and we're doing that we're already dramatically reducing the time it takes for that to happen and so we're asking for the additional resources to my department to the department of justice to turn these people around quicker including the children so we're asking for that and in terms of the change in law as i said a moment ago we're asking and this will be in a separate submission for the ability to treat unaccompanied kids from the central american countries in the same way we would someone from a contiguous country so that we have the ability to offer them voluntary return which the kids from mexico do accept

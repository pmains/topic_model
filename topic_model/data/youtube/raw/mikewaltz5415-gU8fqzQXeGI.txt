chris ray is issuing a stark warning for americans listen we consistently see that it's the chinese government that poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security there's been a lot of discussion about the potential that china may try to forcibly take over taiwan now with that to happen it would represent one of the most horrific business disruptions the world has ever seen this warning comes just months after president biden's justice department ended the china initiative program which was aimed at preventing espionage by china maybe director ray should brief the president and let him know the chinese government is stealing american technology the largest cyber threat we face and oh by the way has designs on taking over taiwan too my last guest john ratcliffe said all of that about two years ago joining us now is florida congressman michael waltz who serves on the house armed services committee congressman it's great to see it seems like a recurring theme china is the greatest threat we face so what can or should we do about it well first of all trey american industry corporations need to listen to the fbi and his counterpart in british intelligence very carefully they need to wake up if you do business with a chinese company if you do business in china you allow their researchers into your labs they are going to steal your intellectual property it is a matter it doesn't make them bad people or bad businesses or bad chinese students their government is forcing them to do so they will set up a competitor state subsidize it put you out of business and then dominate that market and what do they do with those key technologies number one they're creating local uh global dependencies on them that's everything from our pharmaceuticals to to our rail cars to artificial intelligence and technology and then number two as part of their sieve mill program they are handing civilian key civilian technologies artificial intelligence advanced materials over to their military to fund their military build up trade historians are going to look back at all of this and say you funded your greatest competitor you funded america your demise and we are drunk on chinese dollars from wall street to the nba to academia to our politicians across the board we are we have got to start instead of defunding police how about we defund dictatorships and my message to every group i talk to is when you see made in china put it down it's not just a jobs and a human rights issue it's a national security issue we've got to bring those supply chains back home all right to that point congressman during the pandemic there was robust discussion about our reliance on china for certain goods is that discussion still ongoing because the the reliance is still there but i don't hear the discussion quite like i did at least not on television maybe it's being talked about in congress well it is trey i mean look i know a lot of your viewers are probably having a lot of shooters out there are having a hard time getting ammunition you know one of the reasons why is because a key chemical in the primer that fires the bullet is only produced in china and russia china has cornered the market on it's called antimony well i put in the in this most recent defense bill to direct the defense department to start stockpiling it create a strategic reserve of some of these key minerals that the chinese have deliberately cornered all over the world and that's just one of them literally they could turn off our ability to produce ammunition that's kind of important for the defense department not to mention they could also turn off our antibiotics which we no longer produce here they could turn off our cancer meds and you've got biden dry in the left driving us towards a green economy china produces 90 of the of the world's solar powers uh and and 90 of the world's lithium that's the key element in the batteries that we need for for uh for a green economy so we've got to bring them back home and we are driving that conversation but i tell you what when we take the majority this november that's when we're really going to put our foot on the gas all right congressman you served in uniform with great distinction what is our position on taiwan if china were to attack or invade would the u.s defend militarily yeah so we've had this historic policy called strategic ambiguity where we kind of leave it up in the air to leave the status quo look i think that was a fine policy tray for for many decades but now that under chairman z and he is telling his country to prepare for war he is actively threatening taiwan he is talking about replacing the american dream with the china dream and replacing the united states as a global leader i think it's time to move on from that policy actually prime minister abe agreed that we need strategic clarity you've heard the president kind of slip up and i think that's what he wants to do as well and then his uh advisors you know roll him back but i i think it's high time that we make it clear as a deterrent measure and shift from strategic ambiguity to strategic deterrence uh and tell the chinese communist party in no uncertain terms we will defend taiwan and why is that so important to the american people if they take taiwan they take the computer chips and all the trade routes to our allies uh we can't allow that to happen congressman michael waltz thank you for joining us on a sunday night thank you for your service to our country in uniform also all right thanks trey

today i joined thousands of you nationwide who are marching to celebrate life as well as defend the innocent although we are marching virtually this year we are still high in the spirits of celebrating every human life abortion providers like planned parenthood will tell you differently but every single life matters including the unborn i was proud to force the senate to vote on defunding this organization our nation cannot expect to fully protect and maintain our other rights if we do not respect the fundamental right to life even starting in the womb it is unconscionable that the government would facilitate the taking of innocent life i have stated many times that i will always support legislation that would end abortion or lead us in the direction of ending abortion there are many ways we can work together to this goal and we can hope to accomplish some of these in the near future this is why i've reintroduced two of my pro-life bills today the defund planned parenthood act would ensure that your taxpayer dollars are not going to an organization that takes innocent lives through abortion the second bill is the life at conception act the constitution already guarantees the right to life in the 14th amendment however the life at conception act would simply enforce the law and ensure that the same protections are extended to the most vulnerable members of our society the proper role of government is to ensure that individual rights are protected the most basic of which is the right to life thank you for all your tireless commitment for marching to stand up for the unborn it is my honor to lead the fight on your behalf and on behalf of all these innocent lives

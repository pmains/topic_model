I'll recognize the my good buddy from the state of Florida cat camman for five minutes for your go Gators thank you and congratulations to my good friend chairman bill arakis for hosting this very important hearing today thank you to our Witnesses we're coming to the end so so hang in there with us this topic our Competitive Edge against an adversarial Nation who uses the existing multilateral system to bend the rules in their favor the Chinese Communist party is one of the most important issues of our time indeed the CCP has very little regard for basic human rights Environmental Protections or the rule of law as they continue on their quest for Global dominance so I believe that the greatest value that we have as a nation is our people our constitutional republic and our CQ our creative quotient um we are innovators from the space race to the deployment of the internet the United States has been an international leader on scientific scientific innovation and achievement our free market model paired with our national creative quotient including private r d efforts no doubt drives much of our success as a leader in the world so the work that we do here today will lead and carry us through the next several decades without question the U.S and our allies must lead the world in privacy regulations and technological innovation otherwise we risk allowing malign actors like the CCP to create a counter set of rules predicated on debt-trapped economies that will be enticed to leave the rules-based system and adopt a model made made to benefit authoritarian countries run by groups like The CCP so jumping right in Mr Pugh you said in your testimony and my good friend from Tennessee alluded to this you know the protections and privacy laws are wholly inadequate by and large how do we balance that Patchwork of state laws how can we do a preemptive Federal privacy and data security law that specifically uh allows for those protections while prohibiting the stifling of entrepreneurs or New Market entrants into Tech related Industries Quantum Computing social media AI Etc uh congresswoman thank you and I think you you really uh answered the question kind of yourself because uh preemption uh is is key and I think adpa was a great substantive step in terms of how preemption was resolved and that's exactly the thing we need one Federal standard not this Patchwork that is emerging granted only five states will have privacy laws in 2023. we've already seen dozens and dozens introduced uh this year and last year so I think the real potential of having even more laws this year and next is is going to be there and it's it hurts our small medium-sized companies because they don't largely have the resources to to follow all the developments the constant amendments at a state level whereas they have one standard look to it may still take resources but at least it's one standard so I think that is that is the key and making sure preemption is uh strongly reflecting a federal bill I appreciate that and I'm going to follow up again on my my good friend from Tennessee we were sitting over here talking about Tick Tock you know I'm the millennial in the room and so this is a generation grandmother Millennial but you know this is a concern to me my peers and the generation coming directly right after me the Gen Z's I grew up with social media Myspace Facebook today meta these have real world implant impacts uh privacy concerns heck one social media platform can be directly attributed to a political revolution in Nations abroad so we know that there are real world impacts that we have to contend with so obviously Tick Tock being a huge one uh representative harshbarger alluded to the fact that in China on Tick Tock children 14 and younger are are shown patriotic videos educational videos history videos and they're limited to 40 minutes in the United States they they have the algorithms set to do shorter videos that are meant to create dopamine hits in your brain there was a survey done between the United States and China a 14 year olds asking what is the most aspirational career you want to have in the United States the number one answer was social media influencer in China they said they wanted to be an astronaut if you want to look at the future of our two Nations start here that is why we need to be very serious about how we contend with Tick Tock and other apps like Tick Tock so my question and I know I'm running short on time is how can we protect our kids our data while simultaneously respecting free market economics and these applications the balance is a really tricky one but we need to have a game plan moving forward and how we contend with this and if any other Witnesses want to answer this I'm open to to hearing your thoughts very brief and then we're going to take the question for the records it's very important question so I want to I want you to have as much time to answer it uh this is what we're facing in this country please briefly the short answer uh congressman and chairman is passing a national comprehensive data and privacy and security law we did a report last year with 125 different entities across all ideologies in conjunction with Harvard and we've we think that really is the answer of solving some of these national security and privacy thank you thank you thank you appreciate

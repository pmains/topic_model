this sudden and unexpected gridlock prevented the people of Fort Lee from going about their daily lives it was the first day of school and the traffic apparently prevented many children from getting there on time many people were apparently late for work and local officials reported that first responders were being delayed as they tried to reach those in need on the morning of September 9 2013 is the school bell rang at Fort Lee High School that's home of the aptly named bridgeman as the bells rang at that school the damage had already been done prosecutors say it was the intended result of a conspiracy between two officials at the Port Authority the agency that runs the bridge in New Jersey Governor Christie chris Christie's deputy chief of staff who they say all work together to bring the borough of Fort Lee New Jersey to a standstill this in a scheme apparently time to cause maximum disruption by starting on the first day of school and the reason for all this according to an indictment filed by the US attorney in federal court on Friday retribution against the mayor of Fort Lee for refusing to endorse Christie's 2013 re-election bid and if these allegations proved true these are criminal acts that had an impact far beyond their intended victim to talk about all we learned this week about bridgegate we have on set with us congressman bill Pascrell a Democrat who represents New Jersey's ninth district that includes Fort Lee and next to em congressman leonard lance and republican representing New Jersey's seventh District good morning both you thanks for joining us well let me start with the bottom line question on this because now according to chris Christie's camp this is good news in a bad situation for the governor because the governor was not indicted he was not implicated by federal prosecutors know of this his name is not coming up in any of the the formal papers here at the same time as soon as David Wildstein the port authority official who cut the plea deal as soon as he cut that plea deal on Friday his lawyer goes outside and says yeah chris christie knew about this at the time and there's evidence to prove it so bottom line question for you do you think chris christie knew about this congressman pets girl i still don't know that i looked at this insider now deals with my constituents although other things in fact beyond the bridge but I'm more concerned about my the citizens of Fort Lee and when we talk about violating civil rights when you're talking about violating people's right to maneuver and product going from place to place your talking about pretty serious business so we will allow the judiciary system to do what it has to do in terms of Bridget Kelly and mr. Bharani I Weinstein has pleaded guilty to many charges I will see what he has to say and what comes from this I I think the governor has been exposed through all of this whether he is guilty of knowing or not going to me is secondary he has been exposed and I think his administration has proven to be a disaster for New Jersey citizens that's more important to me than dealing with the intricacies the courts will deal with that start with you congressman Lee and send this though are you confident that Christie didn't know as this was happening I believe the governor and I think he took immediate action when he found out and this is a true leadership the underlying behavior was appalling I condemn it but leaders are faced with these types of crises and I think that he took immediate action when he found out it it's being done in his name in the name of his re-election campaign that's what prosecutors are saying here is the mayor is refusing to endorse chris Christie's reelection campaign the fact that according to prosecutors these three would feel some impulse to do something as dramatic as messing with the George Washington Bridge to get a mayor of a town of 30,000 endorsed the governor does that say something about the culture of that administration I think it's the culture at the Port Authority and I think there needs to be major reform at the Port Authority and Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie and the legislative leaders in Albany and Trenton now have to come together but I think the governor took immediate direct action when he found out about it and I contrast this with President Obama and the lowest learner matter and of course the other matter okay now we're getting a bar down getting far afield wait a minute but let's let's stick to it those TFT I want to respond to it yeah go ahead III want to talk about the culture the Port Authority we knew about that long before chris Christie was the governor said New Jersey we can't blame the Port Authority and chris Christie although there is a culture within this administration in New Jersey there is a culture here and it's being peeled off a little bit at a time that culture started I think when Chris Chris tree was the Attorney General was the Attorney General you have you guys at a federal US Attorney when he was appointed he was appointed by a president okay i don't want chris christie to be in the position of appointing the next Attorney General I don't want him to be in the position of appointing the next Secretary of State or the next head of the CIA I think that his credibility has been diminished by all of this I'm not accusing him of doing anything illegal that's not the to sort the congressman pasco saying is look David Wildstein was a Christian pointy bill baroni was a Christian British Kelly

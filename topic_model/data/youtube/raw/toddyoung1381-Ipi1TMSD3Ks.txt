today we're also on the floor to talk about a different tragedy in the state of Indiana on July 17th it was a terrible shooting that occurred at the Greenwood Park Mall just miles from my home resulted in the death of three innocent victims now it could have easily been one of my neighbors or a friend or remind myself that could have been a member of my family who passed away there in in the food court on that very day as this resolution that we're introducing today States the United States Senate condemns this shooting and any violent action that seeks to bring harm to other individuals we grieve the loss of fellow Hoosiers Victor Gomez and Pedro and Rosa Pineda and we pray for their families but we're also grateful for the heroes on the scene that day for the First Responders or health care workers as well as a young man named Eli Dicken Eli was in the food court that evening he was legally carrying his own firearm and when the shooting began he used his weapon to bring down the shooter were it not for his poise during those brief moments his Brave and selfless actions this shooting would have been far worse so I ask all my fellow Americans to remember the victims and the heroes of this tragedy and I urge passage of this resolution thank you Mr President

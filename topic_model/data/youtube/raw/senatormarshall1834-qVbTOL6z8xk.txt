REMOVE THE STIGMA  AROUND THE PROCEDURE. IT'S A COST PEOPLE MIGHT NOT REALIZE  THEY'RE PAYING WHEN  THEY USE THEIR CREDIT CARD AT THE CHECKOUT. BUT  BUSINESSES SAY THEY'RE FEELING THE  IMPACT.  BUSINESSES ARE BILLED BY CREDIT CARD  COMPANIES FOR EVERY  TRANSACTION AT THEIR STORE OR RESTAURANT.  SENATOR ROGER  MARSHALL SAYS A BILL HE HAS INTRODUCED  WOULD PROVIDE  RELIEF FROM THIS EXPENSE. SHAWN LOGING IS  TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT  THIS LEGISLATION WOULD DO.  SHAWN? MIKE.  CONSUMERS MIGHT  NOT SEE THIS MERCHANT PROCESSING FEE DIRECTLY ON THEIR  RECEIPT. BUT IT'S  BACKED INTO  EVERYTHING YOU MIGHT BUY. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONVENIENCE STORES SAYS SWIPE COST A  HOUSEHOLD 900  DOLLARS LAST YEAR. SENATOR ROGER  MARSHALL INTRODUCED A BILL  LAST MONTH WITH  ILLINOIS SENATOR DICK  DURBIN.  IT'S MEANT TO  INCREASE COMPETITION IN ROUTING NETWORKS BUSINESSES HAVE TO USE TO PROCESS CREDIT CARD  TRANSACTIONS AND DECREASE THOSE FEES.  THE AVERAGE FEE IS ABOUT TWO PERCENT  AND CARD COMPANIES MADE MORE THAN 137 BILLION DOLLARS FROM IT.  SENATOR MARSHALL SAYS MORE THAN 80  PERCENT OF THIS  MARKET IS  CONTROLLED BY VISA AND MASTERCARD.  BANKS THAT ISSUE CREDIT CARDS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OFFER TWO ROUTERS  AND ONLY ONE OF  THEM CAN BE VISA OR  MASTERCARD, AND THE  BUSINESS COULD CHOOSE WHICH ONE THEY WANT TO USE.  SOT VERBATIM:  .THESE FEES HAVE INCREASED AT A DRAMATIC RATE FOR  THE LAST DECADE BUT  ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR.  WE'VE SEEN CREDIT  CARD FEES  SKYROCKET BECAUSE  THEY ARE A PERCENTAGE OF THE  TOTAL TRANSACTION  COST, SO WITH  RECORD GAS PRICES, WITH INFLATION WHERE IT IS, THESE FEES  MULTIPLY.  FOR SOME BUSINESSES. THIS FEE IS THEIR LARGEST EXPENSE AFTER  LABOR. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONVENIENCE STORES SAYS THE BILL COULD  SAVE 11 BILLION  DOLLARS IN SWIPE FEES.  THESE FEES ARE USED  BY CARD COMPANIES  FOR THEIR REWARD PROGRAMS, BANKING  SERVICES AND TO DEAL WITH FRAUD.

joining us now to share his own memories from that day is congressman adam kinzinger congressman kensinger thank you for joining us this afternoon yeah you bet good to be with you so what is on your mind on this anniversary how are you feeling and what are your thoughts yeah i mean it's it's it's interesting it's on the one hand it feels like this was a really quick year i mean for any number of reasons but january 6 of 21 seemed seemed like yesterday there's a lot of disappointment a lot of concern um i would love to have known last year or i would love to have thought that we'd be in a better place this year than we are where there's still a lot of people denying truth about the election and conspiracies so it's a real concern for the future of the country i'm optimistic long term on america but the short term i i really feel it'll be more pain and january 6 was just a symptom of that one of my memories of that day is anthony and i were interviewing you live on there as this was all unfolding of course all of us in shock outraged a lot of viewpoints have changed since that day as you well know a poll i was looking at this week showed that 52 percent of republicans say the riots were protecting democracy so i want to ask you like how do we change that i know your committee announced this week they may hold some prime time hearings later this year is that one way to get people to pay more attention to what happened that day look i think it's really important what the january 6 committee is doing to have a full accountability so that when the history books are written in the future we we know the truth and the history books will be based on what we know in this report i don't know if we're going to change people's minds today because i think what's happened and this is a big concern people have have have invested their own personal identity now in their politics and they've made friends based solely on their politics it's actually kind of the most stupid thing to make a friend based on if they believe the same thing about the role of government as you um and that's what i worry about is is do they really believe that you know for instance joe biden lost the election or is that just part of showing that you belong to this group and so i don't know the answer i learned in sunday school always tell the truth and all i can do is always tell the truth and the rest it's up to people to decide whether they want to believe it or not now you mentioned that uh so many people haven't changed their minds about their version of what happened that day one change i wanted to talk about is security on the capitol capitol police had testified yesterday that they are much better prepared for an attack at this time than they were one year ago today congresswoman kinsinger is there a feeling among your colleagues that uh it's safer well i mean the threat environments less safe we've got 9 000 threats against members of congress including some against me this year that's compared to something like a three or four hundred a few years prior now the actual capital building is more secure not necessarily because of any massive changes but because i think part of what was suffered on january 6 was a failure of imagination when when all of a sudden you had this breach of the capital the idea of what is our rules of engagement what can we do what should we do that's been clarified now and that will never happen again uh but i think it's sad that we have to be having a massive police force and we have to worry about these things and you know in the summer when i walk around the mall in dc watching particularly foreign visitors come and take a picture of the capitol because they know this is the representation of free governance it's sad to see it you know have to be secured like it is you know many people have said this could never happen again but you know some of the polling we've seen is really concerning with more than 30 percent of americans saying that violence against the government is justified kind of give us your perspective on how just how serious we need to be taking the threat of american extremists we need to be taking it very seriously so in a country of 350 million more than 350 million people just one percent is 3.5 million people that can do big things that can that can change things when you convince people that their voice has been stolen and in self-governance your vote is your only voice that's really where you have the voices every election if you're convinced that there's some deep state cabal that is robbing your voice from you i think violence is the next logical step maybe not tomorrow maybe not in a year but people can't be unheard for that long that's why leaders that fail to tell the truth are failing to do their job of leadership that's part of what that requires but i am very concerned in the long run all right congressman adam kinzinger we appreciate your perspective and time on this anniversary thank you

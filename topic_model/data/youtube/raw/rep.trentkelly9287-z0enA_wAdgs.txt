and now second and I'm just gonna I don't know I was going to joke about our accents because you know I didn't know if we needed an interpreter or not because we kept speak a little different English I can understand you but after the hearing today you know i'm not sure that we're not different more ways than just our accent and i think one of the smartest terms i heard today was regulatory humility and i can tell you I've not seen that display and I think if you look back I think you have 32 states who have filed lawsuit over world us I think you have both the House and the Senate for the majority of members regardless of which party think it's not being implemented correctly I think you have courts that are saying but it's not being implemented correctly and what I see is is the EPA sticking a flag in and saying we're right and the rest of America is wrong we will write and we will defend and I've heard several times you say we defend this action I don't agree with what the court said on that I don't agree with Gao that we broke the law I don't agree with this we will defend our science we will do this that is not humility that is the opposite of that that is arrogance I'm smaller than you I don't care how many of you are and how many different backgrounds you come from but I'm smarter than you and I'm right and you're wrong and I think I think a member asked you earlier repeal wotus do away with it it's not that it's a bad idea but the rule that we have now I can tell you that the majority of America does not believe protects them and they believe it is pitov and not helpful we need clean water no one understands that more than May one of the most crucial resources we have in America is clean drinking water is whether to water our crops we all want the same thing but the rule that we had now does not accomplish that but we are so entrenched that we have to have this one and I think if he would repeal the road step back get with Congress get with the farmers get without getting behind more or less get a whole group of people in a room and say what do we want to achieve and what is the most effective way to do that and let's all take a pride honour because we're all applied for regardless of what we are but to get back to the humility and get the smart people in the room get a group or Commission together and let's come out with a word is it works because I can tell you businesses farmers are legislators courts everyone right now knows this road is way that we have is not the Lytro let's quit sticking a flag in the ground and defeating something that doesn't work and this come up with something that does protect our clean drinking water and our mr. children a year back

one minute to the gentleman from oregon or from kansas excuse me tracy mann uh congressman thank you for hosting this thanks for all your work and leadership i rise today with you and scores of our colleagues to call for congressional review of president biden's vaccine mandates during his tenure in the white house president biden has circumvented this congress to issue multiple executive orders imposing vaccine mandates on all federal employees federal contractors healthcare workers and even private businesses with more than 100 employees these mandates are forcing americans to choose between their paychecks and their principles i've heard from multiple agents at the usda's farm service agency who have chosen to resign rather than receive the vaccine just a year ago these same agents were deemed essential connecting vital resources to farmers and ranchers and today they're out of a job congress should immediately review these mandates in full and take up legislation like my bill to stop vaccine mandates which would have prohibited osha from implementing a vaccine mandate on private businesses altogether anyone who wants to receive a vaccine should do so but that is a personal health care decision it's not an arena for mandates from the government and i'm deeply disappointed by president biden's policies and lack of response to the legitimate concerns surrounding them i'll continue to push against these overreaching mandates with all of us and we'll fight to protect the fringes of the american people with that i

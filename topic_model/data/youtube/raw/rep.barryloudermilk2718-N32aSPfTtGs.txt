and welcome back everybody welcome back to bartow's Morning News I'm Alan Sanders and it is my pleasure to welcome via our Zoom connection our U.S congressman Barry Loudermilk good morning Congressman how are you good morning Alan I'm doing well and I enjoy looking out the window at Cartersville I on the other side of my computer I'm looking at the Capitol but I'd much rather be back home it's great to have you joining us um and congratulations on re-election another session getting ready to start in January and no no surprise to anybody who's paying attention to the news cycle the leadership will change over to now a republican majority not as big as a lot of the pundits were predicting but a majority nonetheless what does that mean for you and your colleagues uh heading into the January 2023 well it's first of all we've got to make sure that we are organized and we're ready to go and this is what I've been telling my colleagues is we have to be ready to run right out of the gate there is so much that needs to be done you know we'll still be to an extent playing some defense but we'll be able to effectively stop a lot of the wasteful spending we'll be able to stop a lot of the uh if not all of the bad policies that will come out of Congress but we also have a heavy lift to do with oversight of the administration I mean people are frustrated with their government the distrust of federal government is at an all-time high and it's understandable why so we're going to be holding the the administration accountable we're going to be investigating but yet the most important things that we're going to be doing is we got to do something about this economy which is heading south very quickly we've got to do something about the fuel prices and gas prices the things that people care about the southern order and crime those are the things that are going to be a priority and the the very first bill you're going to see come out of the House of Representatives on that first day is to eliminate the 87 000 IRS agents that this this President and the Democrats in Congress uh put in place instead of new border patrol agents they authorized as 87 000 new IRS agents and so this is how Out of Touch This the entire party and especially the administration did well let me ask you because the the 87 000 IRS agents was embedded in the inflation reduction act and basically disguised Green New Deal um almost a trillion dollars when you look at all of the spending including uh ongoing labor if they were to hire that many folks can the Congress because it's already been passed can you stop the funding of that bill we can if we re-establish the power of the person that's something that that I've been fighting for since we since I've been in Congress is over the decades Congress has abdicated its authority to the executive branch it's time we get back to the original idea the original intent of the Constitution which is that Congress is the most powerful branch of the three branches of government we are given the power of the purse we are given the responsibility to budget appropriate and determine where things will be spent where that money will be spent and over the decades we've taken the easy Road out and say well we're going to appropriate this much money and just give it to the administration and they can use it where they think it ought to be used that's not the way the system was set up we have got to re-establish the power of the purse we've got to do some some pretty pretty hard things because our entire system has the the culture here in Washington DC has is all about money it's all about spending money the more money you spend the more power you can acquire we cannot sustain this debt that we have we have got to rein in federal spending we've got to re-establish federalism by putting more responsibility at the state level as the founders intended it's it's going to be a heavy lift but the only way that we're going to hold the the administration accountable is if we use our constitutional authority of the power of the purse to not only appropriate but say this is where that money is going when we do that we can start raining in a lot of the stuff that was sent over look the the inflation reduction Act was a green new deal that's what it was there was very little of it that had anything to do with the economy it was all big spending and that's why you saw inflation uh Skyrocket um not only did it did it impact inflation but the fact of passing it even caused gas prices to go even higher because it was the green new deal it was an attack on American Energy well let me ask this because we were talking about Congress and one of the things that it has is investigatory power it has the oversight um we hear from actually even from a colleague Northwest Georgia uh Marjorie Taylor green said we need to start looking at where all this money is going to Ukraine and other places but where do we sit with that I mean there's so much that needs to go on almost simultaneously it feels overwhelming but 20 billion dollars according to a headline that the administration doesn't know where it really went how are we going to keep track of that well another interesting thing about that Ukrainian funding bill is that and I told people when it passed the majority of the bill was actually going to our own forces but uh it was it was going to replenish weapons that we had sent to Ukraine but that portion that did go to Ukraine we should be we should know and not only no we should dictate what that can be spent on you know you know and people talk about the corruption in Ukraine yes there is corruption there there is corruption in every government there's corruption in our own government we don't even we don't even track where our expenditures go um when I was uh my first year in Congress I was on the homeland security committee and we had allocated money to go uh to start building a wall to to further provide better security at the southern border we also uh appropriated more money to for defense against terrorism the Obama Administration took all that money that we appropriated for those purposes and used it on global warming took money that was designed to protect the American people from International terrorism and moved it over to global warming these are the types of things where Congress isn't doing its job and so yes we need a full accountability where all the money is being spent not just in Ukraine but here in the United States uh there's so much more money that is misallocated it's because Congress hasn't done its job I think a lot of people and uh this will be my assessment and then I'm not putting words in your mouth I think a lot of times there's a rush to do something that feels good and so you put a bunch of stuff in a bill and then you move to the next thing and nobody is accountable there was I think there was a request to have an inspector General assigned to Ukraine funding but the administration chose not to so we have no accountability right now whatsoever um a lot of people up here have the idea of it's better not to know because if you really knew what was going on then you would be accountable for that um and you hit the nail on the head we have transitioned in this nation away from a a culture of logic and Forward Thinking to one of feeling it's what makes me feel good at the moment when you look at most of the bills that passed in the last two years here in Congress none of them actually addressed the issue but it was to be able to say well we did something even though what we did doesn't help or even makes it worse we feel like we did something the easy way out up here is to spend money in something to throw money at an issue but the throwing money at issues only makes them worse sometimes somebody has to do the hard work here and that's what we have to do in the new Congress all right before we take a break here's the here's the the million dollar question how do you and all of your fellow lawmakers try to convince people and and in and in Congress that more of this needs to be pushed under the states and less of it being put on the Federal government because it looks like if you keep following this trajectory we're heading to the one thing our founding fathers never wanted and it's an all-powerful authoritarian regime and I don't think we should we shouldn't be pushing for that no absolutely not and I think we're getting closer to this we we saw during the the pandemic uh under the Trump Administration um a movement toward federalism you know we we pretty much left it to the states and it was state by state which created a sense of competition what have you seen happen in those states that didn't lock down that they put the trust in the people they trusted their local governments you look at Georgia where now nine years the best state to do business in the nation you look at Florida they've gone from this blue state to Red State wine because people left all the other states to go to where there's freedom and liberty the states that didn't do the lockdowns the states that trusted their people that the states that put the liberty and uh constitutional rights of the individual first are the ones that are prospering so when you Institute federalism you Institute competition which then empowers the people and so this is how this is how we get back to this the problem is going to be when as we're transitioning people are going to have to quit being reliant on the the handout from the federal government and it's going to put our state legislatures in the difficult position too if you look at the Dobbs decision did exactly what we need to do it took the abortion issue out of the federal government and put it back to the states where it belongs and so uh we we just got to continue pushing that direction all right we got to take a quick commercial break and a little check in weather and traffic you mind holding for a second oh I'll be I'll be here all right we've got more coming our way with Congressman Barry Loudermilk your representative here in Bartow County in Northwest Georgia we'll be right back and welcome back everybody to bartow's Morning News continuing our conversation with our U.S representative Barry Loudermilk Congressman Loudermilk thanks for being here I do there's so many things I wish I had time for and we never have enough time uh one of the things I've been talking about on my show my Daily Show is what looks like the federal government getting very comfortable you using a backdoor channel to ignore the first amendment how can Congress get involved I know we've got two attorneys generals you've got Jeff Landry and Eric Schmidt doing some great work right now it looks like from the time of the pandemic and probably beforehand these relationships with social media have been intentionally used to censor Americans completely against what our our constitution says um you're exactly right and we're seeing Jeff Landry's a good friend of mine and uh he he is doing incredible work and we're we have to work on some things here uh whether it's a modification to Title 31 taking away some tax uh the tax loopholes that the uh social media companies use but then again all they have to do is move overseas and uh you know operate out of there it comes down to an issue of uh the censorship that we and it's truly been censorship against conservatives it's been censorship against political people that you don't like it's been upended a little bit with Elon Musk taking over Twitter and I think you're going to see more exposure coming out about that the only thing that's going to really make a difference in in the big Tech arena is the people I mean look at look at the influence the people have had on Disney to the point that Disney has gone back to a previous CEO they're talking about getting away from their woke agenda it's happened with Netflix it's happened with several other corporations when they realize if you go woke you go broke well this is the hardest thing to do because we so much rely on social media platforms is people's pocketbook makes a difference and uh we have to demand uh Integrity honesty and uh and no censorship all right 30 seconds something I said yesterday on my show and I don't know how you feel but shouldn't we know the names of people in government who authorized and helped craft language and policy that ignored or trampled the First Amendment shouldn't they be forced to be removed from their positions they're in government they're public they should know you cannot find backdoor channels to ignore the first amendment absolutely and besides that there is no entity in this government that can that can enact law other than the United States Congress and this is the thing that we have to push back again because of congress not doing its job over the decades the Administration has taken over legislative duties and and responsibilities through the rulemaking process they enact laws the Supreme Court just upended that last year or earlier this year with a decision against the EPA now Congress has to hold the administration accountable we have to ensure that if there's any policy that's passed it comes out of congress not through the administration through their executive accent executive orders we have to hold them accountable to the Constitution as always we never have enough time so we'll just have to have you back as uh the session gets in the New Year happy holidays to you Merry Christmas to you and your family and thanks for being here Congressman Merry Christmas to you and uh anytime Ellen all right take care we are at the top of the hour folks we got to take a break we'll be back we've got a brand new hour of bartow's Morning News set to rule so stick around for more

you've been sharing your findings with the SEC at all as you've been going through this yes okay how about the southern district of New York yes okay um I'm going to get to a couple of uh practical questions because I think these were the things I was going to ask you and then also ask Mr uh bankman freed in your declaration you said that the quote the ftx.com platform was not available to us users close quote however earlier this month cftc chairman Benham suggested in testimony before the Senate agriculture committee that two percent of funds housed at ftx.com were from U.S individuals can you confirm whether there were U.S individuals or in persons in fact customers of ftx.com uh yes there we've we found that there's a small number of U.S uh customers that had engaged in uh as customers it's two percent small in your estimation or is it less or more we don't have those kind of numbers on a on a investor basis we have it on a customer basis uh but you're talking about less than a couple hundred but it could amount to billions I mean you said earlier it is billions of dollars that was in there or at least it could be millions or hundreds of thousands we don't know that number or do you know that I don't know I don't know that number the the you know billions would sound very very high okay well you had mentioned that there was billions yeah but clearly I'm giving you the range so clearly as us customers there we don't have an accounting of what those particular customers have in the document exchange will determining this be part of your work through this bankruptcy process oh absolutely yeah okay uh will part of your work be determining which assets belong to which customers more specifically us customers of ftx.com yes we will do a earlier tracing analysis that will try to identify you know the most the sources and the use of all the funds so whether it's 10 customers that had a lot of money or a thousand customers that had some money absolutely okay can you provide some indication of whether customer funds from ftx.com were in fact transferred to Alameda research well it's definitely assets of of customers in the.com Silo were transferred to elevated no question about it uh uh we have not seen this at this stage from the U.S Silo but of course you know we do have one concern and that's the concern we're chasing down which is whether or not there's commingling between the.com Silo and the U.S Silo exchanges and and the reason for that is we know that there was sort of common control and access uh of authorized users at this most Senior Management level amongst all of the assets so it's something we have to we have to focus on we haven't seen evidence right now of that but certainly that's something we need to investigate and Trace okay and my remaining two minutes I want to turn a little bit to operations is there any evidence of his parents involvement in the operations we're investigating that uh as well as any other you know players in the email Slack you know the signals it's a it's billions of Records it's a very vibrant environment um so I hear that you haven't discovered that I mean it would seem interesting that uh that they didn't either give legal advice or business advice or parental advice Maybe well well certainly clearly you know I think in our first day papers we indicated that uh that Mr bankman had given legal advice okay had he been an employee of FTX has it been reported uh you know I don't know if he actually had an employee status uh we certainly received payments from uh the family did receive payments okay that sounds like employment to me you got a payment for okay well I I raised that because on December 8 of 2021 uh I met with Sam bankman freed in my office which I will note was just immediately before he came down to the hearing he was at least 15 minutes late and his father accompanied him uh in that meeting uh I asked and focused on what types of Regulation he was under his engagement with regulators and how that affected FTX um but uh it it seems to me that um there's a lot more to uncover here uh certainly Mr bankman freed uh has uh has let's say wooed many in New York Silicon Valley around the world and yes certainly here in DC uh he was uh they they loved everything everybody loved the exciting idea of a politically Progressive smart entrepreneur who is going to reimagine capitalism uh and uh and change the word uh the world feeling better about themselves all while making them gobs of money and I'm glad to see it's finally unraveled so my time is uh my time is up and I yield back

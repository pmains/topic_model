good afternoon sorry to go away from uh the supreme court that was pretty exciting this morning it was really a very i believe dignified um uh proceeding the first half hour the first half of it as you probably know was about standing and the second half uh about the merits uh of the uh of the of the uh doma and is it constitutional or not uh the questions that were asked by the justices i thought were very um evoked uh information and responses that were i think very constructive this is very you know it's it's very important it's as big as our constitution it's as big as our country itself because it's personal uh as as every uh marriage uh in our country uh between um same-sex parties i had the privilege of being there with karen and amy to well karen's i'm going to spell her last name for you g-o-l-i-n-s-k-i and her wife amy karen is a federal employee and she has a case at the court about whether her her wife amy um can get benefits as the spouse of a federal employee she was married in that window in california uh when uh before prop 8 struck like took away the opportunity to continue the occasions of weddings in california the um i on the basis of what i heard the questions of the justices the the response of the participants i'm very optimistic that doma will be struck down it doesn't seem to have to have a rational basis which is one of the criteria the rational basis of justification for for being and secondly i probably should say first uh the full protection of of all people in our country so equal protection has been a principle that our country was founded on that our constitution was written on and i think on the basis of those two the debate was going back and forth is it about equal protection is it about um rational basis i think on either score uh it would uh the arguments the debate seem to favor striking down doma which is very important though justices made the point on the number of occasions that they're left i think it's probably more than that but they were saying eleven hundred say over a thousand uh laws on the books or regulations that relate to um marriage uh that do not give equal protection to people who are married in a same-sex uh marriage in a they use the word homosexual marriage that's the word that they used you'll hear the report pretty soon i guess it comes out like a two o'clock well not even an hour uh but just being in the room sitting there with amy and karen as they say this is as big as our country as big as our constitution as big as our being a beacon of equal protection to the world it's as personal as every family and to sit there with them and also uh to uh to you've probably seen uh eating or she that's the case that uh her uh it's her she's the agreed party in the case that is coming before the supreme court well i don't know if that's the technical term uh maybe the federal government is the agreed party if the court strikes down doma and they have to pay her back the taxes over three hundred thousand dollars that she had to pay in taxes when her spouse died and uh because it was a same-sex marriage if spouse died and and the internal revenue service did not recognize that this was a married a married couple but edie windsor is a very courageous brave woman with a joy just to see her sitting there in the court head held high about her marriage and the fight that she's making for other people as well as for herself and again to have amy and karen who are going to be touring the capitol soon so you may uh you may see that happily married couple doing just that it was pretty thrilling i have to say you represent

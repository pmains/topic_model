so in one month we have taken the entire revenue system of the country without one public hearing without any witness testimony without the solicitation of one expert we meeting the Republican majority they've decided to go forward with this reckless plan contrast this with Reagan and O'Neill and Rostenkowski and packwood in 1986 when Gephardt and Bradley first offered their bill in 1982 on tax reform for years ensued before the measure came to the floor for passage and in that time 450 witnesses offered testimony every expert from every nook and cranny in America was invited to offer their vision of what a better tax system might look like it to those individuals that I knew them all because I went to the committee when mr. Rostenkowski was the chairman they saw that as the fabled achievement of their time in a bipartisan manner and you know what else secretary Reagan its chief of staff Jim Baker sat through the markups on that tax reform measure now secretary minuchin instead has said nobody at the top will get a tax cut and then they cut the rate from 39 six at the top to 37 well nobody at the top will get a tax cut we're going to double the exemption on this estate tax so that you might now keep twenty two million dollars rather than 11 million dollars without any formulas ation of taxation and my friend mr. Haiti and he is my friend he spoke before about the people's money well you know what the people's responsibility is a million new veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan that's the people's responsibility when we talk about responsibility and the people's money Medicare is the people's responsibility Social Security is the people's responsibility Medicaid today as we celebrate the extension of life expectancy in America Medicaid now cares for people with dementia and house armors these disease that's the people's responsibility they have carefully taken theology and wedded to science fiction remember what we heard around here all of these years don't worry tax cuts pay for themselves that was the offering in 2001 a trillion three hundred billion dollars worth of tax cuts well we get to 2003 and other trillion dollars worth of tax cuts and by the way there was time in between for a repatriation holiday at five and a quarter all advertised on the basis of job creation and layoffs ensued almost the next day this money is going to be used for stock buybacks and dividends there will be little investment in this last opportunity where we should have invested in community colleges and vocational education and apprenticeship programs six million jobs in America go unanswered every single day because of a skills alignment problem and also the horror of what opiate addiction is done across the United States and is sidelined two million people so what they're telling us today is the following we've got Tax Simplification what happened to the postcard as I said earlier we're gonna have to carry around a billboard for Tax Simplification to figure out what's in it they keep talking about phases and phase-out santo√±a will all be passed out by the time with this this is more complexity and wait'll people have a chance over the next few weeks to sort what's in this bill but here's something you might give some thought to the bottom quintile you're gonna get $60 a year the second quintile you're going to get three hundred eighty dollars a year the top 1% they're gonna get fifty one thousand dollars a year in the top 0.1% they're gonna get one hundred ninety three thousand dollars a year all in the name of middle-class tax relief so as we proceed to the holiday they're telling us this is their Christmas present and you know what they're doing with it it's going to be Christmas hangover debt and they're putting it on the credit card and adding 2.3 trillion dollars to the federal debt Merry Christmas

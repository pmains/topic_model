Shin to instruct it is really very simple it was strike language from the Republican bill that prohibits mandatory funding for plans for Planned Parenthood for one year here we are again with the bill that attacks women and women's access to comprehensive health care by defunding Planned Parenthood for one year this disastrous bill millions of women out in the cold shamefully this bill would prevent millions of women from accessing critical health care services such as cancer and STI screenings and contraceptive care even worse more the 390,000 women would lose access and up to 650,000 women could face reduced access to preventive health care defunding Planned Parenthood is not just dangerous to the health of millions of individuals but it would also hurt our nation's economic security according to the Congressional Budget Office defunded Planned Parenthood would increase the federal deficit by a hundred and six million over the next ten years and what's worse CBO found that the defunding Planned Parenthood would lead to more unintended pregnancies not less we know that Planned Parenthood is one of the nation's leading providers of high quality affordable health care for women and their families in 2014 alone Planned Parenthood provided critical health care services to 2.5 million patients more than 360,000 breast cancer exams and 270,000 Pap tests in my home state alone California Planned Parenthood served 776 women in 2014 eighty-nine percent of which were women on Medicaid denying access to the health providers such as planned parenthood will hurt women who need these services the most low-income women and women of color I don't know if these are intended or unintended consequences regardless this is what you are doing in this bill now

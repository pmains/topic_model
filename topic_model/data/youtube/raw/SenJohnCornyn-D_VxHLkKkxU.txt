MR. CORNYN: MR. PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM TEXAS. MR. CORNYN: MR. PRESIDENT, DURING MY TIME IN THE SENATE AND EVEN PRIOR WHEN I HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING AS TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN OUR BORDER COMMUNITIES WORKING WITH THE MAYORS, COUNTY JUDGES, PRIVATE LANDOWNERS, NOT GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AT EVERY LEVEL. THE MAJORITY OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE LIVED ALONG THE TEXAS-MEXICO BORDER FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. THEY'VE WITNESSED THE IMPACT OF POLICIES FROM WASHINGTON FROM DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS. THEY'VE SEEN SPIKES AND DIPS IN MIGRATION. THEY'VE REAPED THE BENEFITS OF LEGITIMATE TRADE AND COMMERCE. AND THEY'VE DEALT WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF SECURITY FAILURES. IN SHORT, THEY'VE SEEN A LOT. BUT VIRTUALLY EVERYONE AGREES THAT THEY'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S PRESENT BORDER CRISIS. OVER THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, WE'VE BROKEN ONE RECORD AFTER ANOTHER WHEN IT COMES TO MIGRATION. HERE ARE SOME SHOCKING STATISTICS -- U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION LOGGED NEARLY 2.4 MILLION BORDER CROSSINGS DURING A SINGLE YEAR. DURING ONE MONTH ALONE, THE AGENCY ENCOUNTERED MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION MIGRANTS. THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THIS CRISIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED, AND IT'S HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON OUR BORDER SECURITY MISSIONS. WHEN HIGHLY TRAINED AND PROFESSIONAL BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME PASSING OUT MEALS AND DOING ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS, THEY AREN'T ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY TRAINED FOR, WHICH THEY WANT TO DO, WHICH IS TO STOP DRUGS LIKE FENTANYL, WHICH KILLED MORE THAN 70,000 AMERICANS LAST YEAR ALONE. I WAS ABLE TO MEET WITH SOME PARENTS WHO LOST THEIR TEENAGE CHILDREN TO FENTANYL POISONING LAST WEEK IN HAYES COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT RIGHT OUTSIDE OF AUSTIN, TEXAS. IT WAS AMONG THE MOST EMOTIONAL EVENTS THAT I'VE EVER ATENSED BECAUSE THESE PARENT -- ATTENDED BECAUSE THESE PARENTS HAD HAPPY, HEALTHY CHILDREN GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL WHO TOOK SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A RELATIVELY INNOCUOUS PILL, ONLY TO FIND OUT IT WAS CONTAMINATED WITH A MINUTE AMOUNT OF FENTANYL, AND IT TOOK THEIR LIVES. THESE PARENTS WANT US TO STOP THE FLOW OF THESE DRUGS ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN BORDER. WELL, WHEN THE BORDER PATROL IS NOT ON THE FRONT LINES, THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO STOP THE TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINALS, THE CARTELS, OR OTHER PEOPLE ON THE WATCH LIST FROM SNEAKING THAT THE UNITED STATES. A FEW WEEKS AGO I TRAVELED WITH A BIPARTISAN DELL NATION OF SENATORS -- DELEGATION TO SENATORS TO EL PASO AND THEN TO YUMA, A SLEEPY LITTLE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. AND THE BORDER PATROL SECTOR CHIEF TOLD US THAT THEY ENCOUNTERED PEOPLE SPEAKING AS MANY AS 200 LANGUAGES FROM 176 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AT THAT LITTLE SLEEPY BORDER COMMUNITY IN SOUTHWESTERN ARIZONA. WELL, AS IT TURNS OUT, THERE IS A MAJOR AIRPORT IN MEXICALI, IN NORTHERN MEXICO, JUST ACROSS FROM YUMA, AND PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY FLYING THERE FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND TURNING -- FROM AROUND THE WORLD AROUND TURNING UP AT THE BORDER ASYLUM. THESE ARE PEOPLE EXPLOITING THE VULNERABILITIES IN OUR SYSTEM. SOMETHING WE CAN AND SHOULD FIX. BUT SO FAR THERE'S BEEN NO COOPERATION IN ORDER TO FIX OUR BROKEN ASYLUM SYSTEM. OVER THE YEARS I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF TAKING A NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES TO THE TEXAS SOUTHERN BORDER TO SEE THESE DYNAMICS UP CLOSE AND LEARN FROM THE EXPERTS ON THE GROUND. THE DISTINGUISHED PRESIDING OFFICER COMES FROM A BORDER STATE AND I MUST SAY, MY IMPRESSION IS THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE IN A BORDER STATE OR HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE AS BORDER STATE SENATORS, MOST OF WHAT THEY THINK THEY KNOW ABOUT THE BORDER THEY'VE LEARNED IN MOVIES OR BY READING NOVELS. IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S NOT REALITY. WELL, THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO GO TO THE BORDER. AS I MENTIONED, IN JANUARY A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SEVEN OF OUR COLLEAGUES JOINED ME IN EL PASO AND THEN YUMA, BUT IN EL PASO, A PLACE WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN FINALLY VISITED THE DAY BEFORE WE GOT THERE, THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SO SEVERE THAT MIGRANTS WERE SLEEPING ON CITY SIDEWALKS IN FREEZING TEMPERATURES BECAUSE SHELTERS WERE AT A CAPACITY. THEY'VE BEEN OVERWHELMED, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE BORDER. MY COLLEAGUES WERE ABLE TO SEE THEMSELVES THE IMPACT OF THIS CRISIS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, ON THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CATHOLIC CHARITIES AND OTHERS WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP THESE MIGRANTS IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. IT WAS A BUSY AND PRODUCTIVE TRIP, BUT I'M EAGER TO RETURN THIS EVENING TO THE TEXAS SOUTHERN BORDER WITH ANOTHER GROUP OF COLLEAGUES -- SENATORS THUNE FROM SOUTH DAKOTA, SENATOR WICKER FROM MISSISSIPPI, SENATORS FISCHER AND RICKETTS FROM NEBRASKA, AND SENATOR BRITT FROM ALABAMA WILL JOIN ME FOR A SERIES OF TOURS AND MEETINGS IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY STARTING THIS EVENING. WE'LL RECEIVE A TOUR OF THE BORDER FROM SOME OF THE DEDICATED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO PROTECTED -- WHO PROTECT IT. WE'LL GET A LOOK AT ONE OF THE BORDER PROCESSING CENTERS AND LEARN ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THEY'RE FACING DUE TO THE SHEER VOLUME OF MIGGENS AGREES CROSSING -- VOLUME OF MIGRANTS CROSSING THE BORDER EVERY DAY. ONE REASON FOR THIS INCREASE IS NOT BECAUSE OF POVERTY OR CREDIT VIOLENCE IN COMMUNITIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA, IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT THE BORDER PATROL CALLS A PULL FACTOR. THAT YOU CAN COME TO AMERICA'S DOORSTEP AND MAKE YOUR WAY INTO THE UNITED STATES AND LIVE THE REST OF THE YOUR LIFE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES TO COMING TO THE UNITED STATES OUTSIDE OF A LEGAL, ORDERLY, HUMAN PROCESS. THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING THIS UNPRECEDENTED BORDER CRISIS; AS A RESULT OF THOSE POLICIES AND THAT PERCEPTION, WHICH IS REALITY. WE'LL TALK TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AS WELL, THE SHERIFFS, THE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS ON HOW THIS FLOOD OF HUMANITY IS BEING -- IS IMPACTING THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE'LL RECEIVE BRIEFINGS ABOUT EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER. WE HAD ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND TESTIFYING -- TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE YESTERDAY AND WE ASKED HIM ABOUT THE 108,000 AMERICANS WHO DIED AS A RESULT OF OVERDOSES FROM DRUGS THAT COME ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN BORDER, AND HE SAID, WE WILL WELL, WE'RE -- WELL, WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. EVENTUALLY HE SAID, WELL, WE NEED MORE MONEY. AND THEN HE SAID, WELL, THIS ISN'T REALLY MY JOB. HE SAID, THAT'S THE JOB OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. IN OTHER WORDS, HE WAS PASSING THE BUCK AND, MEANWHILE, THE FLOOD OF HUMANITY CONTINUES AND THE FLOOD OF DEADLY DRUGS CONTINUE AS WELL. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS MANY SENATORS AS POSSIBLE SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SHOT AT FIXING THIS MESS, WHICH CAN ONLY HAPPEN ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, THEN EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST. I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES -- THESE COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO VISIT THE BORDER AND LEARN FROM THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW IT BEST. THEY ARE THE TRUE EXPERTS, AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING THEY DO TO PROMOTE THE SECURITY AND PROSPERITY OF OUR BORDER COMMUNITIES. I'M ESPECIALLY THANKFUL THAT THEY TAKE THE TIME TO SHARE THEIR PERSPECTIVE WITH OUR OTHER SENATE COLLEAGUES, SO WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO HOPEFULLY, FINALLY ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. MR. PRESIDENT, ON ANOTHER MATTER , TODAY IS TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY. A DAY FOR TEXANS TO CELEBRATE OUR UNIQUE HISTORY AND HONOR THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SHAPED IT. IT WAS 187 YEARS AGO ON MARCH THE 2nd, 1836 THAT TEXAS ADOPTED ITS DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FROM MEXICO. IF YOU READ THAT DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN 1836, IT BEARS A LOT OF SIMILARITIES TO WHAT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS DECLARED WHEN THEY DECLARED THEIR INDEPENDENCE FROM ENGLAND. BUT INDEPENDENCE FROM MEXICO HAPPENED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STRUGGLE PERHAPS BEST REMEMBERED BY THE BATTLE OF THE ALAMO WHICH LAID SOME OF THE GROUNDWORK FOR EVENTUAL VICTORY. ONE COURAGEOUS DEFENDER OF THE ALAMO WAS A MAN NAMED WILLIAM BART TRAVIS, A LIEUTENANT COLONEL IN THE TEXAS ARMY. DURING THE BATTLE, HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS WERE OUTNUMBERED TEN TO ONE. TEN TO ONE BY THE FORCES OF MEXICAN DICTATOR ANTONIO LOPEZ DESANTA ANA. ON FEBRUARY 24 OF THAT YEAR WITH HIS POSITION UNDER SIEGE, LIEUTENANT COLONEL TRAVIS WROTE A LETTER PLEADING FOR REINFORCEMENTS. AND I'D LIKE TO READ IT. IT WAS ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS AND ALL AMERICANS IN THE WORLD. FELLOW CITIZENS AND COMPATRIOTS, HE WROTE. I AM BESIEGED, BY A THOUSAND OR MORE OF THE MEXICANS UNDER SANTA ANNA. I HAVE SUSTAINED A CONTINUAL BOMBARDMENT AND CANNONADE FOR 24 HOURS AND HAVE NOT LOST A MAN. THE ENEMY HAS DEMANDED A SURRENDER AT DISCRETION. OTHERWISE, THE GARRISON ARE TO BE PUT TO THE SWORD, IF THE FORT IS TAKEN. I HAVE ANSWERED THE DEMAND WITH A CANNON SHOT, AND OUR FLAG STILL WAVES PROUDLY FROM THE WALLS. I SHALL NEVER SURRENDER OR RETREAT. THEN I CALL ON YOU IN THE NAME OF LIBERTY, OF PATRIOTISM, AND OF EVERYTHING DEAR TO THE AMERICAN CHARACTER, TO COME TO OUR AID, WITH ALL DISPATCH. THE ENEMY IS RECEIVING REINFORCEMENTS DAILY AND WILL NO DOUBT INCREASE TO 3,000 OR 4,000 IN FOUR OR FIVE DAYS. IF THIS CALL IS NEGLECTED, I AM DETERMINED TO SUSTAIN MYSELF AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND DIE LIKE A SOLDIER WHO NEVER FORGETS WHAT IS DUE TO HIS OWN HONOR AND THAT OF HIS COUNTRY. VICTORY OR DEATH. SIGNED: WILLIAM BARRETT TRAVIS, THE TRAVIS LETTER IS ONE OF THE MOST TREASURED DOCUMENTS IN TEXAS HISTORY AND IT LAYS BARE THE IDEALS AND CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE WHO FOUNDED OUR STATE. PEOPLE CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR COURAGE, BY THEIR SACRIFICE, BY THEIR DEVOTION, BY THEIR FORTITUDE. AND AS DEEP AND STRONG AND ENDURING SINCE OF INDEPENDENCE. HERE IN THE SENATE, BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS FROM TEXAS HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF READING THE FABLED TRAVIS LETTER OVER THE YEARS. THIS TRADITION ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO SENATOR JOHN TOWER, WHO BEGAN HIS CAREER IN THE SENATE IN 1961. I'M GLAD THAT TRADITION CONTINUES TODAY TO ENSURE THAT THE WORDS OF WILLIAM BARRET TRAVIS LIVE ON AND THE GENERATIONS OF TEXANS AND AMERICANS CAN APPRECIATE THE COURAGE AND SACRIFICE THEY DEMONSTRATED AT THAT TIME. SO TODAY I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR THESE TEXAS PATRIOTS, MANY OF WHOM WOULD LATER SERVE IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, INCLUDING SAM HOUSTON, WHOSE SENATE SEAT I'M HONORED TO NOW OCCUPY. THEIR COURAGE AND SACRIFICE WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. MR. PRESIDENT,

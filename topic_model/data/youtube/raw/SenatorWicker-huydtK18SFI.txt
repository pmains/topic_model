Thank You Senator Reid and we general Dunford we've we've heard it said that we're that America is losing the war in Afghanistan is that true senator what we've said is we're not winning and in it's at a stalemate and that's that's my assessment of where we are right now is as we're not at a point where we can bring a successful political solution to the war if if the American leadership including people in in this room including the Pentagon and the executive branch if we if we decide to win this conflict in Afghanistan is there any reason at all why we shouldn't be able to do so at the end of the day senator I think it's going to require the Afghan people to actually develop the peace process that will bring an end to the war what I believe the United States can do in conjunction with our coalition partners is provide the Afghan government in the Afghan security forces the support they need to bring an end to the war and is there any reason why we can't provide that support senator I don't believe there is any reason why we can't provide that support and I think the new strategy that we're here to discuss with you here this morning provides the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces with that level of support to bring this to a successful completion okay and and this has been alluded to and you mentioned the Afghan people is there any lack of resolve on the part of the Afghan people in including their hearts and minds to that that would be a stumbling block to us being successful in this new strategy I don't believe so senator it's very clear to me from my personal experience as well as recent polling that the Afghan people do in fact want a better life for themselves they do reject the ideas of the Taliban and from an individual soldier perspective I think the one thing we can all say is that the Afghan forces have been incredibly resilient and demonstrated the will to fight over the last couple of years under the most extraordinary conditions they certainly have always demonstrated a willingness to fight with our we viewed as an invading force senator I think anything but an invading force consistently the Afghan people have requested us to be there our presence is is favorable across the country again in polling typically somewhere between 70 80 percent of the Afghan people want support of the international community led by the United States we've made it clear that our objectives are to support an afghan-led peace process to support Afghan security forces bringing security to the country so I don't think there's there's very very few people who would consider us an invading force inside of Afghanistan the vast majority are very happy that were they are helping them to bring peace and security to their country and and in regard to the new strategy the new plan and the new emphasis on on America doing its part to get the job done how do our troops feel about that up and down the rank-and-file general senator I think if you speak to any young man and woman who has served inside of Afghanistan they want to get the mission done they want to they want to accomplish the mission we certainly and secretary mattis has just recently come back from Afghanistan last week all they want to know is what is the mission and they want to have the wherewithal to accomplish that mission and that's exactly what we're trying to provide to them I'm not at all surprised by your answer mr. secretary let me just ask you briefly about NATO you met with Secretary General Stoltenberg recently NATO allies have made significant contributions how we doing with upping the involvement of NATO and are you satisfied with our progress so far I need to get to NATO now that we've got the the strategy in hand now that secretary Jill and I have gone to Afghanistan and sit down with my counterparts I'll do that in November we are already in contact with them I believe from 15 NATO nations or partner nations fighting under NATO's flag for example Australia Georgia I believe we will see at least from 15 nations right now additional troops put in there there could be more than that those are just the ones I have indications right now that they're going to up their game what's their stake in all this sir if if anything they are even more vulnerable than the United States is in terms of transnational terrorists operating out of Afghanistan against against the European continent so they've got a lot at stake here but I think all the nations from South Asia India certainly China's got a stake in this Europe does this is a transnational problem senator thank you well let me just tell both of you I appreciate your work and and I for one support you and and I I just want you to tell us what you need and we'll try to get it for you thank you thank you

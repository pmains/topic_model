mr chairman you noted in your testimony the impact of supply chain bottlenecks on prices can you give a sense to to what extent you assess that difficulty is in the shipping markets and in port operations are driving those bottlenecks and contributing to high price levels in some sectors it's certainly one of the major factors we're told by our contacts that retailers for example that are trying to buy products for the holiday season can't get the product if they can get the product they can't get a container they can get the container they can't get a ship if they can get the ship it's it's it's at anchor outside of the port of los angeles so transportation is is uh is a big issue really really that our supply chains have gotten all tangled up and blocked up big part of it thank you mr chairman and mr chairman and madam secretary as you know georgia hosts the port of savannah which is the fastest growing deep water port in the united states it hosts the largest single container terminal in the united states we have additional capacity at the port of savannah broadly speaking have you been in any meetings principles meetings or national economic council meetings or discussions at a high level about surging governmental resources and ingenuity to solve these shipping bottlenecks when i reflect upon the capacity for example that our department of defense has to project power and mobilize resources and execute complex logistics around the world i can't help but wonder whether with a more hands-on and targeted approach we could resolve some of these issues at major u.s ports and in the shipping industry the national economic council is looking closely at this at this issue they have someone who has extensive experience with logistics and supply chains to take a very careful look and to see what we can do to try to untangle these supply chains thank you any recommendations to congress would be appreciated and if perhaps if there's some emergency legislative measure that would allow us to tackle this problem which is contributing to price instability and price increases let's follow up directly about opportunities to work together

mr speaker back in my home state of new jersey we had the honor of having a going-home celebration for a remarkable individual from my community he was known as reverend ron his name was ronald b christian and reverend ron ministry was unique because reverend ron looked at the least of us and took them in without judgment to help them with their ills whether they have drug issues or issues with the criminal justice system he never never judged because he had seen the worst that life could show you because he had gone through some of it himself and one day god stood him up and said now serve my people this great man passed away last week a week several weeks ago but i wanted to honor him on the floor of the united states congress he was a unique individual he was one of god's children on the outside of his churches said sinners welcome and he never wavered and he never turned his back we will miss the honorable ronald b christian from christian love baptist church

I'm gonna pick up on HR three what else did CBO say about HR three about about how many fewer cures there would be because of those price controls it's not a negotiation let's not call it that we know it's not it's a formula for price controls on drug prices so what did CBO say that would do to to innovation right so we also carefully modelled that as well using the economic research literature and show that over the ensuing several decades something on the order of 30 fewer drugs would be so we can afford the drugs but they won't exist so it doesn't really matter if you can afford them because they won't exist that's not a really good trade-off

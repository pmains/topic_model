thank you madam chair I'm curious if you would explore a little bit more mr. rose the threat you see by the Chinese sir one of the things that I would recommend is the director of operation directly annual threat assessment the bottom line is this China is developing a full spectrum of anti-satellite capabilities designed to negate America's advantage in outer space in stop yeah we get that we we know I remember in the 2012 presidential debates Newt Gingrich said we need to establish a presence on the moon he didn't say the Russians are doing it the Chinese are committing to do it he just said we need to do it without going further whereupon Santorum jumped up and said you're just pandering to the i-4 corridor Romney said well that's stupidest thing I ever heard I'd fire anybody on my staff didn't suggested that of course Michael Griffin former national interest rate advisor thought it was eminently important go back finally got to Ron Paul and Ron Paul said much discredit it's important to our national defense they need joke we need to send all politicians of the moon and into discussion about space in the presidential primary very next day what happened dr. Stephan knows and I'm sure dr. Woodson knows what happened to very next day they had to move the ISS why do they have to move it space debris where'd it come from China Chinese satellite II 2,000 pounds they took target practice on it week later they had to move the ISS again why they have to move at this time more space debris Chinese again no Russian space debris well why would the Chinese or the Russians shoot their own dog just to prove themselves and the rest of the world that they were capable to do on that if they can take their own satellites out they can take our satellites out so they're you know the the question that begs for an answers you know what are we doing about it and and how can we make sure that it gets yeah I think it's an important amount of national security sir I think we need a comprehensive response it needs to include norms of behavior so we prevent activities like China's a Sat test it needs to include resilient us systems that can operate in outer space and it we need to be able to respond if there is an attack on u.s. space assets but at the same time sorry I just add we also need to find a way to cooperate on common interests with both Russia and China yeah any of any of the three you read that book one second after we enforce since New York Times bestseller no I highly recommend it it's riveting it's very informative it's based upon apparently a confidential intelligence report that members of Congress get and it's staggering what happens I mean you know we've got 30-some satellites that make our credit card use possible or our cell phones or laptops give us our weather reports you know you take a half dozens of things at a at operation and we're in a Stone Age and the consequences are lethal they're not unfortunate they're not uncomfortable they're lethal for masses of people so I think it's very very important that we address this and I think to cheer for bringing us up today and hope that we'll continue this discussion further thank you I yield back

>>> WELL, THIS MORNING THE  IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY MOVES INTO A DIFFERENT STAGE. THEY SAY THEY COULD HANDLED IT  OFF TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  PRETTY SOON AFTER THE  THANKSGIVING BREAK. I KNOW IT'S SUCH A BUSY WEEK, SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, SIR.  >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, POPPY.  >>> LET'S LISTEN TO YOUR  REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE IN THE  HOUSE, CONGRESSMAN MIKE TURNER. >> YOU GUYS WANT TO BE THE  LAUGHINGSTOCK OF HISTORY TO  IMPEACH A PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES BECAUSE HE DIDN'T  TAKE A MEETING? PLEASE, GOD, UNDERTAKE THAT. >> YOU HAVE --  >> WE'VE DRAWN A LINE. WE'VE MADE THIS PRESIDENT TO  FEEL HE'S NOT VULNERABLE, NOT  INVINCIBLE. THAT PROCESS STARTED 2 1/2 YEARS AGO WHEN WE BEGAN TALKING ABOUT  IMPEACHMENT. YOU'LL NOTICE THE BIG CHANGE. IN HIS FIRST SIX MONTHS, WHEN HE WANTED TO COMMIT A CRIME, HE  JUST DID IT ON TV. NOW THAT HE WANTS TO ABUSE OUR  REMGSSHIP WITH THE UKRAINE, HE  AT LEAST HAS THE GOOD SENSE TO  DO IT SECRETLY. SO HE KNOWS HE'S NOT  INVULNERABLE. THE OLD PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD  HAVE JUST TWEETED -- ZELENSKY  GET ME GOOD DIRT ON BIDEN OUR  YOU'LL NEVER SEE YOUR AID. THIS PRESIDENT SEND RUDY  GIULIANI TO SEND THIS MESSAGE,  ALL TRYING TO KEEP IT SECRET  FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE TRIED TO KEEP IT SECRET,  BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WAS WRONG.  >> I'M CONFUSED. A, IS IT ANY BETTER TO DO IT IN  A ROUNDABOUT WAY WITH GIULIANI,  AND B, IF THE ACCOMPLISHMENT YOU SAY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE IS  TO DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND, BUT  YOU'RE SAYING THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT BE REMOVED FROM THE OFFICE. TO WHAT END FOR THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE IF IT HASN'T CHANGED THE  FUNDAMENTAL BEHAVIOR.  >> THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY  CRIMES WOULD THE PRESIDENT  COMMITTED BEYOND WHAT HE WAS  DONE IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS  INVINCIBLE, AT THE HE TALKED --  >> WELL, RESPECTFULLY IT WAS  JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO HE SAID  PUBLICLY THAT CHINA SHOULD  INVESTIGATE THE BIDENS IN THE  MIDDLE OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. >> THAT I WAS PRETTY BLATANT,  BUT IMAGINE THE CRIMES. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS HIM TW TWEETING ZELENSKY, I NEED  THOSES -- OR YOU WON'T GET THE  AID. THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT  OVERSIGHT.  >> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? IS THAT BASED ON FACT? I'M CONFUSED AS TO THE EVIDENCE  BEHIND THAT AND TO WHAT END FOR  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  >> WELL, WE KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE  SOMEONE -- WHEN YOU HAVE A  PROFESSIONAL BURGLAR, AND YOU  KNOW THEY HAVE COMMITTED THREE  OR FOUR BURGLARIES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS, YOU FIGURE  THEY WOULD COMMIT MORE IF THERE  WAS NO BURGLAR ALARM AND NO  POLICE DEPARTMENT.  >> SO IS IT A WIN FOR DEMOCRATS, YOU'RE SAYING, IF YOU DON'T  SUCCEED IN GETTING A SINGLE  REPUBLICAN VOTE TO IMPEACH THE  PRESIDENT IN THE HOUSE OR THE  SENATE, BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU  HAVE CHANGED HIS BEHAVIOR? >> IT'S A NECESSARY PROTECTION  THAT WE DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE  TO RESTRAIN A PRESIDENT WITH  CLEAR CRIMINAL TENDENCIES. IF WE DID NOTHING, IF THERE WERE NO BURGLAR ALARMS, IF THERE WAS  NO POLICE DEPARTMENT, HOW MANY  MORE BURGLARIES WOULD THERE BE? >> IT SOUNDS LIKE -- AND PLEASE  CORRECT ME IF I'M HEARING YOU  WRONG, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING YOU DON'T THINK YOU'LL  GET REPUBLICANS ON BOARD, AND  YOU CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THE  PRESIDENT WILL BE REMOVED FROM  OFFICE, BUT THIS IS THE BEST YOU CAN DO. IS THAT YOUR FEELING RIGHT NOW,  CONGRESSMAN? >> NO ONE IS COMING ON CNN AND  PREDICTING THAT THERE WILL BE 20 REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS AND VOTE TO  REMOVE THIS PRESIDENT, BUT NO  ONE SHOULD COME ON THIS AND SAY  THAT IMPEACHMENT IS THEREFORE  MEANINGLESS. THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS IS THE  CHECK THAT WE DO HAVE, AND IF  THE PRESIDENT FELT COMPLETELY  INVULNERABLE, GOD KNOWS WHAT HE  WOULD HAVE DONE. >> IT'S AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT  AND AN INTERESTING POINT, ONE I  HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH.  >> THAT'S WHY I CAME ON. >> WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE THAT. SO TO THAT POINT, LISTEN TO THIS FROM DEMOCRAT ANDREW YANG, WHO  IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. HERE IS THE ARGUMENT HE MADE TO  MY COLLEAGUE WOLF BLITZER LAST  NIGHT.  >> THE FACT IS DONALD TRUMP  THRIVES ON ATTENTION, EVEN  NEGATIVE ATTENTION. SO THE CONCENTRATION ON THE  IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS I DON'T  THINK IS GOING TO WORK FOR THE  DEMOCRATS, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE  NOT A SINGLE REPUBLICAN HAS  CROSSED PARTY LINES.  >> DO YOU THINK HE HAS A POINT? HE IS SAYING THIS COULD BACKFIRE FOR THE PARTY.  >> WELL, WE'RE NOT DOING THIS  FOR THE PARTY. WE'RE DOING IT FOR THE COUNTRY. WE'RE NOT DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S  A POLITICAL POLL-TESTED DEVICE. WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE THE  CONSTITUTION DEMANDS IT. THAT BEING SAID, SUPPORT FOR  IMPEACHMENT AND REMOVAL IS RIGHT ABOUT POSITIVE 2%. IT'S STAYED THERE CONSISTENTLY  OVER THE LAST MONTH, BUT IF THE  PARTY TURNS ITS BACK ON THE  CONSTITUTION, IGNORES ITS  RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING  IT CAN TO CONTROL THIS  PRESIDENT, THEN WHAT WOULD  HAPPEN TO OUR SUPPORT IN THE  POLLS? THIS PARTY HAS TO STAND UP FOR  THE COUNTRY. >> WE DO KNOW, AT LEAST FROM  "THE WASHINGTON POST" REPORTING, THE LANGUAGE SHIFT ON THE  INTELLIGENT COMMITTEE AND  ELSEWHERE WAS FOCUS GROUP  TESTED. >> LONG BEFORE THERE WAS ANY  FOCUS GROUP, I WAS ON SAYING  DON'T SPEAK LATIN. BRIBERY IS THE ENGLISH.  >> I THINK JIM SCUITTO I BELIEVE IS FLUENT IN LATIN. HE CAN SCHOOL US ALL ON THAT.  >> I KNOW ABOUT POLITICS TO KNOW THE LATIN-SPEAKING QUADRANT IS  NOT WHAT YOU'RE AIMING FOR.  >> FINAL POINT. YOU SAY THIS IS NOT ABOUT PARTY, THIS IS ABOUT COUNTRY. IF THAT'S THE CASE, WOULD IT BE  PRUDENT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LED BY NANCY PELOSI ON THE HOUSE SIDE OF THIS RIGHT NOW TO WAIT? SHE SAYS WE'RE NOT AT THE MERCY  OF THE COURTS, WE'RE GOING TO  GET A McGAHN RULING POSSIBLY ON  MONDAY. IF IT'S ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND  THE PROCESS AND NOT THE PARTY  AND NOT 2020, THEN SHOULD THE  DEMOCRATS MOVE MORE SLOWLY ON  THIS, WAIT TO TRY TO GET  DOCUMENTS, WAIT TO HEAR FROM  MOWER PEOPLE? >> IF WE WAIT UNTIL WE GET ALL  THE EVIDENCE ON THE CRIMES FROM  THE PRESIDENT, IT WILL BE WELL  INTO THE NEXT DECADE.  >> COME ON, CONGRESS MA'AM. CONGRESSMAN. HOW LONG ARE YOU WILLING TO  WAIT? >> THE POINT I'M MAKING IS WE  SHOULDN'T WAIT. NEW CRIMES COME UP EVERY FEW  MONTHS. WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS MOVE  FORWARD WHEN WE HAVE THE PROOF  THAT HE COMMITTED A PARTICULAR  HIGH CRIME AND MISDEMEANOR. I THINK WE HAVE REACHED THAT  POINT, BUT IT WOULDN'T HURT FOR  US TO GET A BIT MORE  INFORMATION. THAT'S WHY WE'LL HAVE HEARINGS  IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT  WILL ADD ON TO WHAT WE'VE DONE  IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBTS IN THE MINDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,  THIS PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO GET DIRT ON BIDEN FOR HIS OWN  POLITICAL PURPOSE, AND HE HELD  UP AMERICAN AID TO AN ALLY TO DO THAT. THE ONLY QUESTION BEFORE US NOW  IS, IS THAT REASON ENOUGH TO  IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT, OR SHOULD WE SAY NO HARM/NO FOUL? >> I REALLY APPRECIATE THE  CONVERSATION AND YOU COMING ON,

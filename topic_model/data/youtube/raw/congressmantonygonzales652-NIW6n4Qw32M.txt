congressman from texas and member of the house appropriations committee tony gonzalez congressman you are spending the holiday christmas merry christmas by the way doing something very important on the border but just before we talk about that you grief anita for reaction on the other side of the aisle let's get a republican congressman from texas and member of the house appropriations committee tony gonzalez congressman you are spending the holiday christmas merry christmas by the way doing something very important on the border but just before we talk about that you heard your colleague debbie dingle talking about not giving up hope despite senator manchin torpedoing the bill back better she believes something might get done in the new year your reaction yeah first uh merry christmas griff and you know what merry christmas to the american people you know for joe manchin stepping up and making sure that that build-back better socialist bill doesn't go anywhere you know i'm glad it died in 2021 i hope it dies uh forever in 2022 the bottom line is is inflation is through the roof the last thing we need to do is fill more pork into government spending i'm glad senator manchin uh you know was able to push back against it i hope he keeps it up now congressman let's turn to the border where you are you are doing something very unique on christmas day explain yeah griff you've spent so much time at the border and i appreciate that you're an honorary texan what i wanted to do today was highlight our border patrol agents are on the job 24 7 365 days a year i started the morning in eagle pass then we visited uh border patrol agents in del rio and comstock this afternoon i'll visit sanderson alpine and marvel texas our border patrol agents have had a brutal year and they're doing everything possible while it may be christmas it's really groundhog day in south texas you know when i was in the uh the del rio uh processing center there were over a hundred migrants already it wasn't even eight o'clock and there was already 100 migrants there these border patrol agents have done everything possible to keep america safe my hat's off to them the men and women in green and the texas dps working around the clock we're looking at pictures you've sent in from just this morning where you were in del rio and eagle pass talk to me just for a moment because many are away from families working hard today what is the morale like among the men and women in green yeah you know it's really tough to see because they're they're numb to it that's the best word i can put with border patrol agents are numb to what is happening and many of them have families they're blue-collar hard-working americans they put their boots on go to work every day including christmas that's what we wanted to highlight is they're out there on the on the uh the front lines trying to keep america safe you know i i urge people to stay engaged you know go to uh stand with border patrol.com find the latest on what's happening whether it's christmas or any other day the border is on fire it hasn't slowed down one bit agents are tired and they need help and we we in congress have to come together we should all be rooting for border patrol to be successful to prevent another 911 event type of occurrence from happening today is about border patrol being on the front lines and i'm grateful for that and congressman it's not just people we have to remind americans the narcotics that come across the border when i was down in eagle pass last week with the dps texas dps lieutenant christopher olaveres showing me the drugs they've seized and talking about in specifically the rio grande valley they've seized this is texas dps mind you not even the border patrol stash 887 pounds of fentanyl which equates more than 200 million possibly lethal doses yeah i'm in del rio texas literally right on the border right now but what has happened is every city in america has become a border city because of just what you mentioned the fentanyl and the illegal narcotics that is coming over is killing our children and it's very real it's a very real threat that all of us should get behind and i just wanted to highlight today you know on christmas while we're spending time with our families and loved ones just know border patrol agents are are standing to watch and they're protecting americans sadly too many of them are in processing centers we need to get them out of the processing center and we need to get them back out in the field where they belong so they can keep the drugs and terrorists away from our border yeah get them back on the line you know over the more than decade i've spent with border patrol agents down there they have consistently told me they need three things manpower technology and infrastructure we anchored the show last saturday from down where texas is building their own wall are you getting a sense about whether that may try and help things you know it will you know uh bottom line is this is a federal government issue you know and only the federal government can ultimately solve this and they can only ultimately solve it with policy that's why i urge the biden administration come together work with democrats and republicans alike to secure our border it's in everybody's best interest but but it is encouraging to see the state of texas you know uh kind of take a lead effort on it and there needs to be more of it what i'd also say is you know the biden administration recently implemented uh the remaining mexico policy the trump policy that worked but sadly the numbers have been so few only 188 folks have been uh processed under that under that um uh remaining mexico policy that's 15 a day when you're seeing thousands come over it's a drop in the bucket more needs to be done when republicans win back the house we're going to take lead and we're going to implement some of these policy changes well we will try and keep track on those numbers a very important point tony gonzalez thank you very much congressman for coming on on christmas we wish you and your family a very merry christmas as well as please extend that to all of the men and women of the border patrol working today thank you sir thank you griff all right and tomorrow during

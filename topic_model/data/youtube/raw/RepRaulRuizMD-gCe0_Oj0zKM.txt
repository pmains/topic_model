thank you dr. Berra for for yielding this Congress has a responsibility and an opportunity to work together to grow our economy and set this nation on a fiscally responsible path however the Ryan budget is irresponsible and places the burden of the deficit on hard-working American families and seniors this plan ends the guarantee of Medicare and as an ER doctor I know that many of my senior patients are struggling financially and rely on Medicare in their moments of their lives when they need it the most our priority should be reducing health care costs in order to make Medicare stronger and more sustainable but this budget transforms Medicare into a voucher program shifting the costs of health care onto the shoulders of our seniors and we must once again work together to protect and preserve Medicare reduce our deficit and decrease health care costs I urge my colleagues to come together across party lines and put American families and our seniors first I yield back my time to dr. Berra

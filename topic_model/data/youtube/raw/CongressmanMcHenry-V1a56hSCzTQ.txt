a deputy chief whip and a member of the Financial Services Committee gentleman from North Carolina is recognized for two minutes well I thank I thank the Chairman I thank him for his leadership on this important matter of national security today I rise in opposition to this bad nuclear deal the president's negotiated I don't oppose it because the president negotiated it I don't oppose it because it was brought forth by this administration I oppose it because it's bad for the security of America it's bad for the security of the world it's bad for the security of our most sacred ally Israel it's bad for the non-proliferation 'he's strategies the world has had to mean that we have fewer nuclear weapons on this planet now you have to ask yourself a few basic questions has Iran warranted the trust of the international community to enter into this agreement the answer is no it's very clear by their actions over the last 20 and 30 years that they should not be trusted number two we hear the Supreme Leader of Iran saying time and again death to America and Israel he's declared his nation as committed to the destruction of Israel he's called America the Great Satan now how can we believe a country is fully committed to our destruction yet at the same time uphold their end of the bargain we can't and so we must oppose this agreement based off of what is best for international security and what is best for our nation's security we also have to oppose this because it will mean during my lifetime or during my children's lifetime they will have more nuclear weapons not fewer this is a bad agreement and we should reject the gentleman yields

Cara Paige to the best of my knowledge Cara Paige never had a donald trump comm email address had no formal role in the campaign that I'm aware of I don't think I've ever spoken to him I don't think I've ever met him today the FBI spying on Carter Paige means that the FBI was biased against Trump let's talk about it all senator Santorum that does seem to be a little bit of a contradiction how can if Carter Paige wasn't part of the campaign a year ago a year and a half ago two years ago then why is the FBI spying on Carter Paige all of a sudden anti-trump well I mean they obviously were spying on Carter Paige because they thought he he was going to provide access to trump whether he did or not is another question but at least from I don't see the frankly I don't see the disconnect here I mean I think you can say look Carter Paige was not someone who was deeply involved in the campaign but if the FBI thought so and they were and they weren't about a process to to spy on him because of that that's the problem congresswoman yeah boy but you know that what brought Carter Paige to the attention of the FBI Donald Australian's and so that happened long before and so the aliens was George papadopolis one of the people that were advising him at a time when he didn't have very many advice is really amazing to me is that I don't understand why the Republican leadership would go so far as to support from in this manner to me I know that they're concerned about their agenda but the fact that they would really go this far that to put out a memo that they would participate in undermining the investigation or at least that's what they hope that this memo does and so I just think that's a really sad thing that their agenda of passing the tax well they called tax reform but we know it was tax cuts they blew this deficit up so that now they can come back and talk about Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare that that agenda is so much more important than the safety of our elections and our democratic process in answer your question you're on the House Judiciary Committee in the House Judiciary Committee put out a statement the Democrats on the committee put out a statement saying that House Republicans are now accomplices to a shocking campaign to obstruct the work of the special counsel to undermine credibility legit as me of the Justice Department the FBI to bury the fact that a foreign adversary interfered with our last election are you literally accusing a crime I am NOT gonna sit here and say that they're guilty of a crime we know that it takes a lot of evidence for the accomplice is a pretty big word the fact that they have gone this far to put out a memo like this where they only put out partial information as to say that the only reason why there was an investigation was because of the dossier and they know better they emitted the information the fact that they have attacked the FBI attacked the Department of Justice in the manner in which they've done we've never seen that before so why would they do this the only reason to do this is to support the president and to go that far to support the president to push their agenda I just think I mean I don't know where we're going with this can I talk about Carter page for one second because Time magazine obtained a letter Carter page wrote in 2013 boasting about his connections with Russians quote over the past half year I've had the privilege to serve as an informal adviser to the staff of the Kremlin in preparation for their presidency of the g20 summit next month where energy issues will be a prominent point on the agenda in 2013-2014 Carter page was spied on by the FBI in a different FISA warrant this person was on the radar of the FBI and in fact cooperated with the FBI in their prosecution of a spy recruiter during that period so he's this is the problem with Carter page he had a problem of connections with people that the FBI believed were Russian intelligence officials or at least passing information back to Russian intelligence officials so that's what muddies the waters here a little bit and in the words of Strother Martin what we have here is a failure to communicate that the FISA warrant was really targeted at somebody they knew to be to have a relation with Russians and so all of this spin about what it means for Trump or not I think is well overblown candidly and what could happen at the end of this is you find out the information in that they found in those phases will disprove some of the common narratives that are on the outside and I would argue that's why we should all let the investigation go forward Muller could get up next week and say you know what nothing to see here there's nothing that that he has said or indicated that there isn't they have found these other folks doing something wrong some of them have pled guilty and certainly you know there's some optics problems they have at the very least maybe some legal issues but the fact that they went up to Carter page when he was a target of FBI interest before remember these these intelligence warrants are not necessarily for criminal activity they're trying to determine is an intelligence officer operating in the United States are they cooperating with an intelligence or a person in the United States who would have access to give them information that they need then it would spin off into some criminal investigation and just to further that I mean John McCain basically said that releasing this memo or what he's seeing happen we do not want to be the tools of Russia because remember this whole thing is about Russia meddling in the election and nothing has happened on that in fact on the Senate side the Foreign Relations Committee the minority put out a 200 page document that listed 10 specific actions that Congress could do to prevent Russian meddling in the election this year and all of that has been lost in this this conversation about not just Carter page and the memo but about whether Trump is just using the Republicans to cover his own behind we need to make sure that there's not a taint in this election and you would agree you were Russian hawk when you were in in the Senate and you would agree we the United States needs to do more to prevent meddling in the election no look absolutely I think the the fact that the Russians have tried to meddle in the siliceous should be no surprise to anybody but the fact is that we should be we should have counter counter measures to try to prevent them and and and and mess with them as much as we can on our side so the reality I think I run right but I agree with you I think we have lost focus on that and we should focus me again I said the the part of the Russian meddling I it is going to be very hard for the prosecution to even come close to collusion that is a near impossibility but where the Russians did metal and I think week inflate these is in using social media and their cyber means and they were measured by some misinformation and it's which is interesting we watch them do this in the 70s and the 80s but they used to do it sending a spy trying to recruit a reporter to write a story behind an opposition party now they can talk to you in your living room on social media and that's the part that we have to get our 30 seconds Congress well many people say that's still continuing yes a few months away and really that's where all of our efforts need to be and I don't see that coming from the Republican leadership any concern about the elections for the midterm that's where our focus needs to be I was just gonna say just one quick example they had the Russians were sending out these photos of Aziz Ansari with his head photoshopped over a sign that said avoid the lines text your vote here specifically targeted on social media to first-time voters now when you consider the voter suppression ads that were being sent what about the president setting up a voting suppression Commission for the Eagles I appreciate it all for every time

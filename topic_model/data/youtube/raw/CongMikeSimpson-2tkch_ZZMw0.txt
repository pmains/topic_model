Sherman I have to say something about the good friend from Virginia you know wanting clarification doesn't mean you're willing to accept anything as clarification and I doubt many of those groups would accept what you're proposing as clarification that they would accept so I've got a problem with throwing their name out here and while you didn't say it the implication is that they support what you're trying to do here it was clearly what was implied now I don't think that maybe is what you intended but but wanting clarification doesn't mean whatever you do to and you know you could do way with the Army Corps of Engineers so you can't regulate anything that's clarification I don't think any of us want that with the gentleman yield for a moment now let me finish first okay the other thing that needs to be said here and I continue to hear this is that we have regulated waters that are regulated by the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers under the Clean Water Act and that if they're not regulated by these entities then somehow they're just out there and nobody regulates them you know who regulates them it's the state's its state water and to suggest that they don't care about the quality of the water I think is absolutely wrong and you mentioned in your comment that you know streams run underground sometimes they do it's called groundwater and when that happens if you get the federal government involved in regulating groundwater you want to start a war in the West you just started it and that's exactly what will happen if we allow the expansion of navigable waters into what are traditionally state-regulated waters the states can do a good job of this have been doing a good job of this yes do we need clarification i believe so we believe we need it also we just don't need to do what you're trying to do

mr president uh the senate has now invoked cloture on the nomination of brenda mallory president biden's nominee to serve as the chair of the white house council on environmental quality i rise today first let me just say thank you i just want to express my thanks and i'm sure on behalf of brenda mallory uh 53 senators who voted in favor of closure so that we could move forward and now debate uh her nomination so we that we thank each and every senator who cast that supporting vote but i rise in support of ms mallory's nomination to this important position this is a position a lot of folks never heard of but it is a hugely important one and i urge our colleagues to now join me in supporting at uh and confirmation a highly highly qualified nominee as well the chair of the white house council environmental quality or ceq as we call it i may not be the first position many americans think about when they consider a consequential presidential appointments but it is a cri a crucial body critical body with considerable sway over our nation's health and environment one of my mentors was a a republican named russ peterson great leader of the dupont company for many years governor of delaware and later served as chair of the white house council on environment equality during the administrations of both richard nixon and gerald ford governor peterson used to refer to his role as chair at the council on environmental quality as someone out of an orchestra leader an orchestra a conductor he would say you don't play the instruments as the chair of the ceq but you try hard to ensure that everyone in the orchestra is playing in harmony the ceq chair coordinates action across the entire government in order to ensure federal agencies are working in harmony that every federal decision advances the objectives of economic growth of better public health and of stronger environmental quality but while ceq chairs do work much like an orchestra leader a conductor to achieve harmony across federal agencies they must also pursue balance that balance includes at least three components one growing our economy two ensuring a just and healthy society and three protecting our environment for current and future generations those are the clear objectives of ceq is laid out in national environmental policy act of 1969 known as nipah nepa landmark law that created ceq often referred to as the magna carta of environmental laws according to its six pages of statute nepa nepa's purpose includes and i'm going to quote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere or stimulate the health and welfare of man i would add and woman nipah enshrines democracy by giving the american people a voice to help decide the fate of federal decisions for 50 years nepa has sought to ensure environmental protection public health and the notion that the american people should have a say in the federal decision-making process that affects their lives like our constitution nepa is one of our nation's most enduring and replicated laws the same principles of democracy and citizen participation that are enshrined in our constitution are also enshrined in nepal sadly the trump administration's ceq largely walked away from the tenets of this 50-year-old law issuing drastic rollbacks that undermine much of its very mission instead of advancing ceq's three objectives one a more productive economy two a healthier society and three a cleaner environment previous administration sadly repeatedly compromise public health and environmental quality for the sake of less red tape so one of the many tasks ahead for the next ceq chair will be to get us back on track to harmonize our efforts to address the climate crisis to safeguard public health and to ensure that we're treating others the way we want to be treated if that sounds familiar it should because that's the golden rule which is found in every major religion on this planet there are few people as well qualified to tackle this challenge as brendan mallory i believe she is a kind of dedicated public servant that we need to lead ceq at this critical time for not just for the agency but for our nation ms mallory is deeply committed public servant with extensive experience on both democratic and republican administrations no stranger to ceq ms mallory served there for a number of years after an impressive tenure of more than a decade at epa including under president george w bush she has earned respect from both sides of the aisle as the former general counsel for ceq she already knows the agency inside and out her experience her reputation as a collaborative pragmatic leader helped to explain why she has garnered broad bipartisan support among environmental leaders who have served before her get this 13 past republican ceq and epa appointees including a former ceq chair and four different republican epa administrators have publicly praised ms mallory and urged her confirmation now that doesn't happen every day as presiding officer knows but among those uh republican former republican epa administrators who have urged her confirmation are these bill riley christine todd whitman michael levitt stephen johnson and james connaughton ms mallory has also earned the support of the u.s chamber of commerce i'll say that again miss mallory has also earned the support of the u.s chamber of commerce and a whole bushel of environmental groups across this land she has represented business interests in the past as an attorney in private practice so she understands the importance of timely and well coordinated environmental reviews which are crucial for getting investments in telecommunications and an infrastructure off the ground ms mallory's expertise will be critical to the task that lies ahead in addition to restoring balance at ceq and its mission the next chair at ceq will address a number of pressing crises facing our nation today let me mention some of them they include the ongoing covet 19 pandemic they include the worst economy since the great depression as well as the enduring problem and challenge of racial injustice all three all three of these crises are compounded by a fourth and that is the climate crisis we have no time to waste we must tackle the climate crisis with conviction and with urgency my home state of delaware which i'm privileged to represent certainly cannot wait any longer we happen to be the lowest lying state in america our state is sinking and the seas around us are rising this is felt by other states across the country too climate change is an issue that hits red states and blue states alike our colleagues john deeley john neely kennedy and bill cassidy tell me that from louisiana tell me that louisiana loses get this a football field of wetlands to rising sea levels every 100 minutes let me mention that again louisiana loses a football field of wetlands to rising sea levels every 100 minutes another part of the country in the midwestern part of our country last year hurricane force winds flattened over half over half the cornish soybean crop in iowa literally in the span of about a week maybe even in the span of about a day out on the west coast wildlife fires ranged across california as big as the size of rhode island while floods in florida damaged homes and roads and deadly ice storms a month or two ago left millions in texas stranded without power water natural disasters and extreme weather don't discriminate they impact all of us brenda mallory knows this she understands the gravity of the situation and the immense challenge she has ahead of her should she be confirmed i know she's ready to seize the opportunity ahead of her in this role she also knows that the laws we write in the decisions we make can affect who faces the brunt of the consequences for too long communities of color have disproportionately suffered from our environmental policies from chemical containments in drinking water contaminants and drinking water to toxic air pollution from our roads and our factories our most marginalized citizens are too often exposed to environmental public health risks and left behind by our investments and policies we need to work to improve environmental outcomes for all americans all americans britain mallory at the helm of ceq can play the leadership role that's needed in addressing environmental justice and meeting the challenges of climate change in a way that lift up all communities and achieve a brighter more equitable future for each one of them as we address the crises that we face we have an opportunity to improve people's lives today and for future generations to do that we need principled enlightened leaders we need leaders who are humble not haughty leaders who have the heart of a servant and understand that their job is to serve not be served leaders who unite not divide leaders who build bridges not walls i'm confident that brenda mallory is just that kind of leader she will bring integrity she will bring honor and humility to her role just as she has done in her decades of service to this country as chair of the council on environmental quality she will be a leader who brings people together to form lasting solutions to the challenges that we face today with that in mind i strongly urge each of our colleagues to join me in supporting your confirmation i thank again those who voted for cloture a few minutes ago with that mr president i yield the floor thank you [Applause]

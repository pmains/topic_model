let's bring in senator bill hagerty from tennessee for more on this senator you probably heard some at least of what ambassador jacobson was saying that the message that's coming from the biden administration is that the border is closed but that we are opening up more legal routes to migration for these children who otherwise might make the dangerous journey from the northern triangle countries up through mexico again i said to sandra i said she's playing long ball here she's not playing short ball what is all of this going to do to change the situation on the border as it is today well john first thank you for having me and i think what we've got at the border is a crisis yet president biden has gone 50 days without having a news conference he should hold a news conference right now and call this what it is this is a crisis at the border it's a crisis of his administration's own doing i sent a letter to the white house to president biden asking them about the the immigrant protection protocols the so-called stay in mexico protocols that would have made a tremendous difference if we'd held those in place uh it dramatically decreased illegal immigration by 75 percent after it was implemented and what we've seen right now is a complete crisis that's taking place at the border i think that he should come in front of the american people and and talk about near term as you say what's going to happen here uh now the ambassador did say that the message that they are trying to send is that the american border is closed which clearly it isn't because a hundred thousand people crossed it during the month of february but she said that the cartels they're trying to put out two messages the border is closed but we're going to open up new legal routes to migration she said but the smugglers the cartels are only sending one message and that is a contrary message that the border is open which message is winning at this point well clearly the latter message is winning and the cartels are winning out and by what's happening today in the house they're going to offer a 1400 per person bounty for those people that cross the border again the democrats are putting forward a policy that would put those checks in the hands of illegal immigrants that's creating all the wrong incentives john and that's the type of thing that's going to make this crisis even worse yeah senator do us a favor if you can uh if you can hang around uh there in the russell rotunda ford uh with us for a little while as we kind of bounce back and forth through our coverage here if you can do that we'd appreciate it we'll come right back in just a moment okay sandra let's go back to senator bill hagerty uh from tennessee for more on all of this uh along the border do you expect uh senator and again this necessarily was not her bailiwick but do you expect anything that roberta jacobson said today will diminish the flow of migrants across the border that we're seeing right now i do not john because the message has been sent loud and clear they've halted all construction on the border wall again as we we spoke about just a few minutes ago they're creating new incentives for illegal immigrants come across the border they haven't given us any answers certainly when i reached out to the white house in a letter to ask them what their plan was are they going to give these people work permits are they going to test them for covet are they going to vaccinate them before they vaccinate americans there's so many unanswered questions but there are a lot of incentives that are creating this they're driving this this crisis from the white house it's a it's a crisis of their own doing yeah you know we we have the new numbers for february ahead of their release 100 441 000 people it's expected to go up in march and then again in april and may as we hit the peak here uh one of the other reasons senator what we brought you on was you're offering up an alternative or competing bill to hr one for the people voting act it's called the protect the electoral college act what's your problem with hr one and do you think it has any chance hr one of passing in the senate well john if you like the way the democrats are handling border security just wait till they get their hands on election security this so-called for the people act is another typically misnamed act here in washington it should be called for the politicians because what it does is it allows the democrats if it were to pass to federalize our election system you know the constitution is very clear in article 2 section 1 state legislatures have the sole responsibility for setting the election laws those state legislatures are directly responsible to their state's voters what happens in this bill they want to take all that away they want to incentivize again a lot of dangerous behavior internet registration no photo id required automatic felon voting one of the things that concerns me the most is the ability for people to ballot harvest in fact paid ballot harvesters will have unlimited bounties to go out and harvest ballots it's going to create a lot more concern about the election at a time when we need to be creating more confidence in our elections yeah and your your bill uh would uh restrict states from receiving federal money for election security if they don't allow the legislatures to control uh what's going on if if they were to allow executive orders or court orders or whatever to control the elections as opposed to the legislatures but again back back to the question i asked you do you think there was any possibility of h.r 1 passing the senate and if so how would that happen well not as long as the filibuster stays in place because i cannot imagine a single republican going for this effort which is really just a complete power grab by the democrats they've taken control of the executive branch the legislative branch this is their effort to make it permanent to go to a single party system so the only way this would happen is if the democrats were to go nuclear have you heard any suggestion of that i i've heard some chipping around at the edges but we're looking to senator manchin into senator cinema keep to their word to maintain the filibuster think what this will feel like on the other side they don't want to be in this situation either and it would remove any chance of having bipartisanship so my hope and my my expectation is that it will not change as long as the filibuster rule stays in place this will not become law yeah you also joined along with senators marcia blackburn who we're going to be talking with in in our next hour and several other senators and sending a letter to the cdc director michelle walensky after four researchers that the cdc was ostensibly relying on wrote an op-ed in the usa today saying that the cdc did not follow their guidance when it comes to school openings what are you saying about that and what do you want to know i think the cdc should be listening to the researchers not to the teachers unions and what we need to do is let them follow the science in this case look our kids need to get back in school we're losing a generational a generational problem here we've got with our kids not being in school this is going to be extraordinarily tough for us to recover we need to get our kids back in school we need to get our parents back to work this is going to be tough on our economy but it's tough on individuals too a lot of kids are in a tough situation at home they're in homes that you know frankly aren't that safe we need to get them back to school all right senator bill haggerty of tennessee it's good to see you thanks so much for joining us

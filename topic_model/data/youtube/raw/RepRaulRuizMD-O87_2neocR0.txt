environmental injustices disproportionately impact underserved communities and communities of color around the country we have experienced this firsthand in the eastern coachella valley in my district environmental hazards that worsen quality of life and harm the public's health children struggling to breathe on their way to school residents with undrinkable water from high levels of arsenic let me be clear having clean water to drink and clean air to breathe is not a privilege just for the affluent few it is a right and a common good for everyone that's why i am glad my bill h.r 3923 the environmental justice act of 2019 is passing the house this week as part of the clean economy jobs and innovation act my bill will strengthen protections for vulnerable populations give impacted communities the ability to hold big corporations and government accountable and provide needed funds to mitigate and prevent future instances of environmental injustice i'd like to thank chairman pallone and subcommittee chairman tonko for working with me on this important legislation thank you and i yield back

Patrick McHenry introduced the resolution to allow Graham to lie in honor today sir what does this day mean to you and the folks that you represented it's quite humbling and look it's it's it's wholly befitting and right that a man who had had a relationship with every president since Truman was was the pastor to presidents of both parties for over seventy years that he line honor here in this building he had relationships on both sides of the aisle and in the Capitol right behind me for four generations he preached the gospel globally everyone has heard this over 200 million people that he speak to live and in-person in over 185 countries but what he did here to minister to folks on both sides of the aisle politicians have some unity of thought around the gospel I think that that's what we really desperately need here as Americans today and I think that's what my constituents are reflecting upon more than just about anything else I wonder what sort of context his passing brings to the issues in the debates of our of our time today whether it's this high school shooting in Florida the ongoing battles between both parties there in Washington and this if you were able to share his own words of grace with us today what do you think what message would be well bill if you look at it Reverend Graham's legacy in the 50s and 60s most especially he was a Christian leader who was in the media regularly mainstream media of all sorts that he engaged in debate and dialogue to have an understanding around some basic financial basic principles for our society around faith around values and really the the foundation of who we are as Americans as citizens it's a powerful message then and is still a powerful message today thank you for your time sir a lot of people proud back in North Carolina knew your one of them Patrick McHenry the congressman there from the hill thank you sir thank you

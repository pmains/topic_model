well thank you very much good afternoon it is a privilege to be with you thank you for having me and let me say thank you for the the important the vital work you do defending truth and defending freedom your mission at the agency for global media is to inform engage and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy and ours is an age where we have seen digital platforms that allow for rapid and far-reaching dissemination of information our adversaries have weaponized those platforms to spread disinformation at the expense of our allies societies and our national security and it has never been more important for the United States to support our own platforms and to ensure that they are professional cutting-edge and committed to principles of the Free Press let me talk about America's voice in the world then let me talk about the voice of a Free Press America's voice in the world truth is powerful and often people think that might is the only thing that matters that military force is the only thing that matters that guns and tanks and missiles are the only things that matter but truth has the power to transform the world if you come by my Senate office you may notice that there are three busts in my Senate office a bust of Winston Churchill a bust of dr. Martin Luther King jr. and a bust of Ronald Reagan and the reason for that is that I think all three understood the power of speaking truth the power of words yes Churchill commanded an army but Churchill's impact was words that roused the world to defend freedom dr. King just a few weeks ago I had the privilege of joining several other senators in reading on the Senate floor dr. King's letter from a Birmingham jail most or all of us have read that before but I will tell you it is a different thing to read it out loud to hear it out loud you think about it dr. King never commanded an army he simply commanded the words of truth he simply spoke out against injustice and that transformed the world and Ronald Reagan you know some years ago I was in Jerusalem was visiting with Natasha renske famed Soviet dissident and Sharansky told me about how even in the depths of the Russian gulag the prisoners would pass from cell-to-cell notes did you hear what Reagan said evil empire ash heap of history tear down this wall my office the dominant feature is a gigantic painting actually larger than this poster board of Reagan's standing before the Brandenburg Gate saying the words mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall many don't know the backstory behind those words I believe those are the most important words uttered by any leader in modern times the back story is that three times the State Department edited those words out of the speech and three times Reagan with his own hand wrote them back and they proceeded to have arguments where the State Department said mr. president you can't say this mr. president this is too belligerent mr. president this is unrealistic we all know the Berlin Wall will stand for all eternity so you cannot say something like this and each time Reagan wrote it back he said with a smile you don't understand this is the whole point of the speech in just a few years after those words were uttered the Berlin Wall was torn to the ground that's important to reflect on the United States didn't bomb the Berlin Wall we didn't send in tanks to demolish it it was simply the words the the power of speaking the truth and tyrannies fear truth that's something America should should remember that our principals can tear down walls can topple tyrannies can promote freedom our options and foreign policy are not simply send in the Marines for every challenge in the world but rather America should consistently be a voice for freedom we should be a voice for human rights we should be a voice for democracy because that truth is powerful and it can transform the world and that's also where an American Free Press and the USA AMG come into play now to be clear we don't ask journalists to promote the viewpoint of the United States government there are plenty of countries in the world where governments run their media and the media is little more than a propaganda outlet for whatever the policy views are of the particular regime in power instead we believe in a different kind of press one that aligns with American principles it's a testament to our system of government that we encourage and protect dissent that we encourage and protect a free media because freedom depends upon a free media it's also important that we have focused we've been open and candid in discussing the need for reform I'm heartened that evidence of reform the evidence is that it's working for instance what Alberto Fernandez has done at the Middle East broadcast networks is as impressive as it was necessary al hora was transformed and relaunched not on the basis of past practices and old assumptions but against the backdrop of contemporary media analytics tools priorities and above all else media realities the station is now for the first time in a long time set to compete at the highest levels to distribute information in the Middle East I know that us a GM's leadership is committed to replicating that sort of success across the voice of America Radio radio free europe/radio Liberty la leo television Marti and Radio Free Asia over and over again I hear about your efforts to incorporate hard-nosed data analytics to the promise including the promise of new technology such as AI for the newsroom the need for reform will of course continue but us AGM is headed in the right direction and all of these efforts are aimed at ensuring that us AGM media outlets provide the best the timeless the most accurate information possible and again we don't want journalists promote the US government's viewpoints we don't need them - your role is to inform and that is a powerful role as we discuss tyrannies fear truth they shudder from sunlight so relay facts and I'll tell you few things are more powerful than highlighting distance that's a role I've taken seriously in the Senate in the last seven years over and over again I've gone to the Senate floor to highlight dissidents standing up to tyranny standing up to oppression because simply shining a light and telling their stories causes tyrants to fear the repercussions your role in engaging foreign audiences is a second and a powerful testament to america's principles rather than asking you to push prepackaged American talking points you or independence which audiences can see and sense for themselves is our talking point not a free press that pushes American values but a free press that is the embodiment of American values and finally your mission to connect people many of your outlets are broadcasting to places of alienation and isolation in too many of those places people have lost hope and the work you do is invaluable in bringing news of a different world speaking to power speaking to oppression speaking for freedom speaking for human rights is powerful it is transformational and it is at the very core of your mission and so for that I simply say thank you [Applause]

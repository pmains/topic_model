thank you uh chairman defazio ranking member graves members of the committee including my kansas colleague therese davis thank you for uh you have this opportunity to speak with you about transportation and infrastructure priorities for the first district of kansas my district aptly named the big first is the 11th largest congressional district in the country spanning 63 counties in central and western kansas as you can imagine with a district that size we greatly rely on roads rails waterways and other forms of infrastructure to connect our rural communities to one another and to the rest of the world the big first backbone is agriculture it is home to more than 60 000 farms and is made up of farmers ranchers feedlot managers nutritionists ethanol producers ag lenders and agribusiness owners who feed fuel and clothe the world farmers and ranchers depend on roads bridges and rail to safely transport these goods to market so the beginning of planting season to the end of harvest and from the time of baby cat hits the ground to the time we take them to town these forms of transport help to efficiently deliver our ag products around the globe however moving livestock and perishable ag commodities brings a separate set of issues for drivers that kansas are well aware of as the leader in counterproduction for decades farmers and ranchers and transporters bag goods across our district and state have fallen victim to archaic trucking regulations leaving little to no room for livestock calling exemptions s72 the haulers in ag college of agriculture and livestock safety the halls act is introduced by senator deb fischer my neighbor to the north and nebraska would address these concerns the halls act would update the hours of service exemption for ag products and livestock that have been regularly modified by congress to provide flexibility to ag and livestock callers this bill would add 150 air miles on the back end of the trip allowing drivers the extra time to safely navigate the rural roads where they haul it would also allow the hours of service exemptions to continue nationwide all year round removing the seasonal limits set by state designated planting and harvesting periods i'm supportive of the work of a coalition of more than 100 ag organizations to modernize the ag exemptions to the hours of service rule and provide flexibility for haulers and urge the committee to review legislation in full if similar legislation is introduced in the house or if the halls act reaches the house floor for a vote another important issue for rural districts like mine is aviation which is supported through essential air service and small community air service development programs both programs ensure that our smaller communities can maintain a minimal level of scheduled air service to larger cities whether through direct support or by working with communities to address air service issues as the home state to the air capital of the world essential air service enables communities like salina liberal dodge city garden city and hayes to connect to the world through aviation as your committee continues work on transportation and infrastructure legislation we must ensure that rural communities are part of the conversation and a priority for these discussions beyond transportation the importance of broadband cannot be overstated in connecting rural communities to the rest of the country whether for virtual school telemedicine or remote work rural broadband must be considered as an important piece in our infrastructure conversations whether occurring in this committee or others across congress the roads highways rails aviation as well as broadband connect all of us across the country and add to the quality of life in rural communities our investments today will promote rural economies long into the future and make our communities a prosperous place to live for the next generations thank you congressman davis for the opportunity to speak on the issue impacting the first district of kansas and i yield back the remainder of my time

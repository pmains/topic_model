thank you senator tuberville and thank you for the opportunity to bring this to light there is nothing more exciting than families following a sporting team especially when it's your children my mom was a basketball player i was one of those basketball players when i played we had six men on the team or six ladies on the team then we called two of them rovers that could cross half court i was a rover my daughter played basketball and there was nothing more exciting from junior high to high school of following the team and the closeness of the family and the friends that you make along the way this is incredibly important for young women and it's my job to stand here and defend these young women that's the reason we had title ix to start with and continue today to have to defend that is just it's almost unbelievable to me you know it was meant to ensure equity between men and women in athletic and education and the biden administration is carelessly threatening that equity it it just angers me the biden administration is working to redefine sex to include gender identity in the name of anti-discrimination but this is discrimination against women plain and simple the title ix has transformed women's sports expanding opportunity to women's and girls through scholarships through career opportunities the price of ignoring the biological differences between men and women will be paid by young women and girls they will pay when they're denied educational and athletic scholarships and career opportunities and eventually they will have to wonder why am i bothering to compete at all pretending biological females and transgender women are the same for all purposes will move girls and women backward rather than forward this is a no-brainer a ninth grader can figure this out simply put the biden administration is willing to compromise the prosperity of women just to further its own woke agenda an agenda that will do lasting damage to progress to title ix has given us for half a century and we will continue to stand here not only to defend title ix but defend defend all female athletes throughout this country so they can have their fair opportunity

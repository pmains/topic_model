see you soon all right well last but certainly not least we have the congressman tom emmer join who joined avery echanini earlier this week in a pre-recorded conversation um we're going to be sharing it with you now on just a little bit of a background on tom he is currently serving his fourth term in congress and sits on the house financial services committee he grew up in minnesota and served in the minnesota house of reps from 2004 to 2008. listen into the conversation now you don't want to miss this one good morning and hello everyone welcome to marketing for the now i'm adriani president of vayner nft and i'm so fortunate to be joined by tom emmer tom thank you so much for making the time to be here with us on the show glad to be with you avery awesome tom we'd love to learn a little bit more about you would you uh please introduce yourselves to our audience well uh my name is tom emmer i represent uh one of the eight congressional districts house districts in the state of minnesota it's called the sixth district of uh minnesota i i've been in the u.s house of representatives now i think this is my fourth term that we're a little bit more than halfway through uh i sit on the house financial services committee i'm the they call it the ranking member because we're in the minority the ranking member on the house oversight committee uh obviously uh i'm a co-chair of the blockchain caucus and have been now for a while uh because of some things i hope we're gonna talk about this morning uh because it's a big interest of mine uh and uh look i i have uh as i was talking about with one of your colleagues earlier i have uh my wife and i have seven kids uh ages uh 31 down to almost 21 uh and it keeps you young it keeps you young it keeps you looking at things that uh they're doing uh in a world that is fast changing and uh you know what avery uh all you and your peers uh are gonna be looking at a completely different uh social fabric than what we have had growing up uh and that's uh that's who i am that's where i come from that's why i'm so interested in what we're going to talk about fantastic and and tom you've um beyond just sort of your role uh in sort of leading the blockchain caucus you've actually introduced legislation to provide clarity for blockchain innovators can you share a little bit more about this legislation and what it means to to normal folks right i actually have introduced three bills that provide regulatory clarity for tax law securities law and money transmission laws and i've introduced one bill that focuses on leading digital currency innovation that would be open permissionless and private same attributes as cash but the first one the securities clarity act would allow the sec and token issuers to easily determine when a token is offered as part of a securities contract i mean some of your uh your audience probably is well aware of the lack of leadership we've seen out of gary gessler at the sec he seems to be conducting regulation through enforcement actions and public statements this would allow which by the way creates all kinds of uncertainty this would allow entrepreneurs innovators some certainty in the marketplace so they know if they have to comply with securities laws as opposed to what we have now in my opinion which is a full employment opportunity for lawyers who are trying to interpret uh this howie test that existed long before uh you know the satoshi white paper uh the next one is the blockchain regulatory certainty act uh this would assert that blockchain entities that never custody consumer funds are never considered considered money transmitters then we have the safe harbor for taxpayers with fort assets act which would protect taxpayers from a tax obligation that they did not seek out and might not even know they have as you know i if a blockchain forks you and i may not have anything to do with that decision but right now it could have some uh tax consequences that again i don't think we should be responsible for uh if we didn't actually create that for uh and then uh recently we offered the central bank digital currency bill uh this is one that's close to my heart because i've got some serious heartburn when our government says they're going to create a cedc and they're going to follow china's lead our bill would prohibit the u.s government from developing a surveillance tool that would strip away financial freedom and i believe deflate the dollar's dominance so those are uh the bills right now that we've been pushing uh and frankly we've got some great response tom you must have uh you must have had a lot of thoughts when the new executive order came out yesterday i think the executive order uh it's uh you know you might uh take a look at our twitter uh uh stream twitter uh uh oh no yes yeah thank you the twitter feed you might take a look at that because uh it's very interesting uh we did point out that we've had a chance to go through that uh here in the office uh let's just say the good news is uh they're directing the bureaucracies to start to study this uh let's be realistic uh good for you uh mr president good for you by the administration but in fact they've been studying it for quite some time now the question is if you're going to recognize the talent that is within these bureaucracies that is forward thinking that is actually looking at this as an opportunity as opposed to a danger it seems to me like the people at the top of the pyramid in this government are scared to death of crypto they're scared to death of by losing their ability to be the ultimate intermediary in our financial transactions and so they're trying how to uh you know they tried to kill it in my opinion initially they couldn't do that because this is going to happen with or without us i believe and now they're trying to figure out how to absorb it into themselves uh that's where cbdc scares the living daylights out of someone like me but i digress so they put it out they said they're going to study it great uh we were laughing this morning uh about the fact that uh gary getzler wasn't asked for anything that's probably the best thing that's in the executive order is they didn't ask him for any input since he's been giving awful output for the last uh several well i would suggest months uh but listen if we're going to take i'm a glass half full skies blue kind of person so if we just get rid of the cynicism uh and perhaps some of my skepticism uh the fact that they're actually acknowledging it and that they're going to uh you know have some discussion about it internally that we hope will lead to some external uh leadership i think that's a good thing but uh let's just say it's not all-encompassing uh these guys i have a long way to go before they understand what stable coins really are or what they might mean uh and the list is much longer than that they just hear crypto and some of them just go yeah well it's uh i like the way that you called it regulatory clarity which i think is really what a lot of consumers and crypto users are seeking so tom you're clearly incredibly well versed in this stuff what inspired you to jump head first into the world of blockchain and crypto was it seeing your kids sort of in this ecosystem or you know seeing your constituents it really starts with my own family right uh i i was one of these uh uh my wife and i were parents that you got to get out right i want you on the hockey rink i watch you out uh in the woods uh i want you fishing i want you doing stuff that's outside and you probably have heard this from your own family avery you know what are you doing on that computer get outside do whatever yes right well it's uh it really stems from all of them but i would tell you probably the most influential was our baby who's now a uh sophomore in college you know he uh he started working at age 15 as young people get money right they start to earn their own income they don't need their parents telling them what to do with it right so uh he literally built his own computer i got me to start thinking i would never do stuff like this in fact i probably was more afraid in the beginning that this kid is about to start mining his own bitcoin out of my house and what does that mean but what does that mean for energy bills right well but talking to him too by the way i avery it's i i've learned that the younger generation does not see things the way mine does my generation grew up with a book in their hand my generation grew up with newspapers on the kitchen table my generation grew up with a radio in the car that i pushed the buttons and the biggest innovation in the 1970s moving into the 80s was oh we've got fm what is this fm thing that's cool well that's not the world we live in today and so you're talking to somebody who sees things more in two-dimension right you start talking about those uh innovators today those uh entrepreneurs my kids uh and their peers they see in 3d they see beyond 3d they they have an ability to do abstract thinking uh and vision you know forward-looking vision that we don't have so i became in then i have a uh another child uh he's not a child he's a full-grown adult that's uh making a good living who got involved in in uh trading cryptocurrencies right i i personally have tried to stay away because if i do start trading people here are going to say look emmer's all into this industry because he's invested now now my wife would like me to be but uh i think right now if we're going to be an advocate for the uh entrepreneurs out there for this uh space in our financial system for this evolution i think it's better that we uh we don't have that criticism so i these guys got me to look at things that perhaps i never would have and think in ways that i never would have so i actually evolved because uh probably the entire my entire life i've been uh very suspicious of government and uh what this cryptocurrency exposure has done is it's expanded me to start looking at the real thing for me which cryptocurrency is facilitating is the evolution of web 2 which is all intermediaries based to web 3 where you and i we will have our own digital identities and we can do business directly with each other we don't need an intermediary you know it's it's that uh example that i've given before about youtube you know you're aspiring a young entertainer whether you're a singer a comedian who knows all the comedians they're not allowed to be funny about much anymore but let's just say you're a uh an aspiring entertainer today you're putting your content out there perhaps on youtube well great somebody else controls that platform and the only way you can derive value for the value you're providing is if you sell advertising directly to that uh youtube site i think of a world avery where i don't need youtube anymore i can create an nfte i could put it out there and people can literally give me value if they see value in what i've offered in that non-fungible token so and this will evolve more but to me that's the big issue is the evolution from web 2 to web 3 i don't need big tech i don't need big government i don't need big whatever keeping their eye on me and controlling my data which i by the way it's interesting to me we may not uh be pleased at times with certain politicians but it's interesting that uh the intermediaries in this country exclude certain political views but there's a guy in the kremlin who apparently can still uh gain access that's right that's that's why it's so important for you and me to be able to make our own decisions and i'm not saying intermediaries will uh be totally gone but avery and tom should be able to decide when we want to use an intermediary and when we just want to uh do business uh directly absolutely tom thank you so much for joining us in the show today i know you're joining us at vcon which is gary vaynerchuk's first ever conference for the friends token holders so we're so excited to see what vcon thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us sharing your viewpoints i'm incredibly interesting and we're really grateful to you for for being with us here today thank you avery look forward to seeing you in minneapolis thanks

thank you madam chairman chief good to see you again thanks for your recent visit to North Dakota just like to follow up on that first question goes to the environmental assessment and the allotment plant for the grazers and both cases they wanted changes made you know proactively can you give me a status report on how you're coming with that yeah senator I you follow up with that meeting them our folks our staff are going to continue are going to continue to work with the the grazing Association members to be able to address their concerns and i think i want to thank you for hosting that meeting because i also think it helped to clarify a few issues to help us to be able to move forward and address their concerns so you feel you will be able to working with your state director be able to make adjustments that that should work for the grazing associations and the ranchers I was optimistic after listening that you know from the work they're done by the University that i think would provide a slightly different approach that one that i think it will work for both the ranchers and also address our needs so that was the thing i left with that meeting is that a a little different approach it was being proposed there that could help i think really once and for all kind of settled this one issue that we've had there no I appreciate that the other thing I'd like to emphasize is working with NDSU range scientists particularly doctors out of it I think that not only are they very knowledgeable and they focus on the science but they also have a lot of credibility with the ranchers in the area and so I'd emphasize you work closely with NDSU and their range scientists and particularly on the three and a half inch visual obstruction reading I think they can really help get to a solution that the ranchers feel is common sense and workable yeah and that's that's the issue that the University and the doctor he has come up with a different approach to really determine which areas actually have the capability to produce that that's double height and I think from the discussions we had there at your meeting and a little bit of follow-up discussion I i left there I'm being more optimistic than I been for a while that hey this is a better approach at the universities coming up with for us to be able to to answer that question about which areas are capable or not and it seems like that's really been the issue the ranchers can manage your livestock you know be able to produce the stubble height we need we just need to be able to understand which areas are actually capable and which ones are not and I think once we can come to agreement on that I'm optimistic that we can put this issue behind us and move forward the in order to continue the dakota prairie grasslands demonstration project do you know what does that require legislation or is that something you can do without legislation we can continue to work under that demonstration project we had at this point we don't need any additional book legislation that's important that we continue it and then let me switch to the fire piece I know you're getting a lot of question on fires but it looks like we're dryer this year we certainly are drier this year starting out and we have been the last several particularly in the West so address from it your approach to the grasslands in terms of steps you're taking to be prepared for fires this season obviously you're very focused on the force but the grasslands have fire issue as well yeah well the grasslands are part of the National Forest so it's it's for when I talk about the National Forest I'm always including you know the grasslands so what we're doing there in the state is what we're doing across the country is to be working with our co-operators with volunteer fire departments so that we're ready to go when the fire season which in your case has already started if I recall that the day I was up there just a couple of days before we'd already had several fires in your state that people were explaining to me they just never see this level fire behavior occurring so early in the year so those are the things to to make sure that we have the resources we need that people are ready and that if there's anything that we need to address that we can take care of ahead of time and in your state like many states it's those volunteer fire departments that are a big part of our initial attack resources and they're responsible for being able to get there quickly and be able to suppress so many of the fires and so it's like in your state and the rest of the country it takes all of us working together the federal government the state counties and local fire to be able to deal with this and then address the controlled burn issue for a minute to obviously particularly sensitive this year because it's dry and you know we really want you working with the people on the ground not just the landowners but obviously volunteer fire departments and and everyone else so touch on controlled burn for just a minute is that you're staying away from it this year because it's Trier you know what's your plan well definitely in and when we have those conditions that we have up there we often are not going to get in prescription begin with but um we're only going to be doing prescribed burns where we have you know kind of the agreement needs support from the grazing associations where and in part of your state it's a little bit wetter that Association is very supportive of more fire other parts that are drier we don't have that that at least that agreement at this point so we're not we going to be using a lot of prescribed fire in those areas until we have the right conditions and the level of agreements so that everyone's together on what's the value of this and make sure that we're factoring in the risk to avoid the situation we had a couple years ago thanks again chief appreciated

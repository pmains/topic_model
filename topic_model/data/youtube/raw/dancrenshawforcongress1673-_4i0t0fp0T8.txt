okay now we're going to have our forum for congressional district 2 to replace the retiring tempo and we are going to use the same format as in the first corner each candidate will have three minutes for an opening statement there will be a series of questions unfortunately don't getting prize for batting practice basketballs like I had for the judges and then there will be two minutes each for closing at the you all right and so we will begin opening statements with mr. Roberts the right ping-pong ball - that one that is the debate coach in that you always want to know your tongue signals how are you folks it is fabulous to be home in the middle of my house district and to be here with you thank you for taking the time to come out tonight many of you have heard my story before I grew up in Amarillo Texas I was raised by my grandparents the day after I was born my dad left for boot camp at Fort Hood and my grandparents took me home and they raised me by entire life I have vivid memories of seeing my grandmother come home in the morning as I awoke as my granddad left after she had worked the graveyard shift in levi-strauss we didn't have a lot of money but I tell you what we had I had absolute love and absolute support through my life they were hard workers and they taught me how to work hard and they taught me the importance of integrity and commitment I began working when I was fourteen years of age with my mentor who's still my mentor today I delivered prescription drugs in a very small retail drugstore and I saved enough to put my way through Texas Tech University where I received a business degree and was the first sweet 16 first my family to ever graduate from college I went on and have spent the last thirty years in business taking small entrepreneurial businesses and growing them nationwide creating quality jobs Holly and I have had blessing of living and racing our boys in this community for the past 16 years and have been involved very deeply in our church teaching I serve as a deacon as well as nonprofit organizations our community as well as in the chamber and that's a huge blessing that being a part of this community in 2015 with our wonderful State Rivers and Patricia Harless decided to retire I felt like it was my responsibility and Colleen to step up and to serve and so individuals our kids have the same opportunity I did growing up and it's been a blessing to serve in the Texas House with fabulous folks like Valerie and Mike I'm very proud of my accomplishments last session I passed five bills that Governor Abbott signed into law one being a bill to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome regulations on small businesses and among individuals additionally I have offered and voted for bills that are important to us as conservatives to ban sanctuary cities to protect our families to eliminate partial birth abortions to protect our own board we did something that's unique we balanced a budget with four billion dollars less revenue something the federal government hasn't done I would be honored to take my proven record and my proven conservatives leadership and my knowledge and love for this community to Washington to serve you and let me just say this I respect dan greatly and I appreciate his selfless service and it is an honor to be running and this run off with him so thank you and not on the opening statement from mr. krenshaw good evening it's great to be here with you all truly an honor a lot of you have hurt my story I grew up in Katy Texas told my father around his career in the oil and gas industry we lived in war-torn countries like Colombia where I learned Spanish and learned how great of a country this really is I learned Texas values from my mother at a young age before she died of cancer she taught me integrity respect tell me that God and the foundation of the church what makes our country so strong she taught me integrity I think most importantly she taught me what it means to never quit on those who love me I joined the SEAL Teams in 2006 at a 10-year career and over the course of that career deployed to places like Iraq and Afghanistan on my third deployment I was nearly killed and blinded by an IAD blast I didn't quit I didn't go on disability I deployed two more times back to the Middle East and then to Korea when I couldn't deploy anymore in order to serve my country I got an education I got my master's degree in public administration from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government I'm truly qualified with the right experience in the right education to make federal policy there's a few lessons I learned in the SEAL Teams that I'd like to share with you first one service this symbol that I wear on my lapel is the same one we wear on our uniforms it's the only symbol in American government where the Eagles head is bowed not upright it's about because we know the importance of servitude to the American people second lesson always take care of your people and the SEAL Teams leaders eat laughs you make sure your men eat first we take care of our teammates before we tend to our own wounds Congress should be no different you take care of your people Texans know a little bit about that and we demonstrated our third plan preparation being hungry for more knowledge and be ready to take that next mountaintop and that next mission so what's our mission here I think we've got a few I'll just name a couple of them flood control policy in this area right now we're still waiting on a third reservoir to be built we're talking about doing three year-long studies it'll be up to us in Congress to make sure that money gets there make sure that local and state politicians that didn't do their job before doing it now and then we get this done one of my first acts will be to make sure that there's a waiver for procedural requirements for the Army Corps of Engineers so that happens immediately without delay because it can border security we're on the front lines that needs to happen now and third ensuring that Texans and conservative values have a future that we put leaders in place that will be that will bring more people to the party he'll inspire the younger generation and bring them to our side and that's what I plan on doing I hope to have your support thank you all [Music] [Applause] all right now we should have time for about seven questions and so we will start off the first one but who knows and if there's a fistfight I'm getting out of here the other one that the toughest part about this job get the stand your look stone face and then they both stand right in front of it I realized I don't have a poker face so just don't look at me look at what they're talking all right the first question will begin with mr. krenshaw is most Republicans agreed that spending in Washington DC is out of control at the same time Texas has received part of a ninety billion dollar spending bills aid in the recovery from Harvey and there may be billions more to come how would you curb government spending and still treat ce2 flood victims fairly well that 90 billion first of all it's necessary you have to spend money on what's actually necessary and I think here we know that it's necessary only about thirteen point three billion of that is actually coming to Texas out of that nine million it may not be enough we may have to do more at the local and state level to build to raise funds for what we actually need here and for the projects that we need here for disaster relief it's not just recovery it's investing in our future but the question was how do we reduce spending we have to focus on mandatory spending that's the actual driver of debt discretionary spending is what we always fight about because it's appropriated annually what's not appropriated annually is mandatory spending that Social Security it's Medicare it's Medicaid we have to make some more choices we have to talk about things like raising the retirement age we have to move to personal retirement accounts for Social Security so that we can actually have a solvent system before 2030 for when it's actually going to go insolvent that's right around the corner that's what we need to do it wasn't sure actually how long I had some I just wrecked it up but it's as simple as that and that takes courage it takes leaders who aren't afraid to touch the so-called third rail of politics which is entitlement spending that's what we have to do and I know that our leadership is talking about it right now well I'm ready for it 2019 that's exactly what we're going to be doing we're going to be tackling the hard stuff it's not the simple appropriations that we do every year it's mandatory spending so please put me up there so we can fight for that by the way we're supposed to in the way Texans are used to doing which is a balanced budget thank you the question is most Republicans agree that spending in Washington DC is out of control at the same time Texas has received part of a ninety billion dollar spending bill to aid in Harvey recovery and there may be more coming how would you curb government spending and still treat cd2 flood victims fairly let's look at two separate issues one budget out-of-control to disaster recovery and flood medication first of all let me say this I feel this is a strength that I bring to Congress because of my experience I currently serve on Appropriations I serve on the subcommittee for budget transparency and reform we had to balance a budget because that is the one mandate Texas Constitution demands on the Texas Legislature is the passive balanced budget we did it with four billion dollars less revenue this year I served on the subcommittee for healthcare where approximately eighty million dollars of the largest portion of the budget is represented in those dollars the way you balance the budget guess what you did you make difficult decisions you make very difficult decisions but you make those decisions because you know it's for the betterment we say it's out of control well every day we had 1.3 trillion dollars to our national debt we start by giving read of the deep state the federal bureaucracy that is real that is wasting toddlers that has absolutely no value now let's talk about Harvey I serve on the subcommittee appropriation subcommittee for disaster recovery and relief we have to demand from a congressionals perspective accountability on those dollars I've actually put in a release out right now we have five hundred million dollars in aid that the federal government has given us in the first Ronge the second tranche will be additional five hundred million we haven't utilized one of those dollars yet federal government needs to demand that the state is transparent and that those dollars are used accordingly I will fight for our district and I will fight for our needs but at the same time there has to be accountability with your dollars thank you all right I'll point out a couple of things one since we have a CD to make here a little while back a lot of these questions have input from the audience for first time the question don't push more but we also have some questions up here from the audience but we'll try to get to and second certainly mr. krenshaw point just as we give you two minutes doesn't mean you have to take all of it so but you know they're running for cover so you can imagine alright our next our next question will begin with mr. Roberts is on foreign policy some people feel that the US has the moral responsibility to exert leadership and foreign policy to help spread democracy others feel the US has no business trying to serve as the world's police force what is your philosophy of the role of the US and world affairs ooh that's a great one except range I think we do have a oil in there the best of United States as being a superpower we have a moral imperative to ensure that human rights are upheld but we have a moral imperative to ensure that we adequately fund our military that we have the adequate number of personnel that we have the adequate resources and we equipped these young men and women when we send them in harm's way I believe the way we achieve diplomacy is through strength and we leverage that strength in areas that rogue regimes are suppressing human rights I feel like we have that obligation but at the same time we have an obligation at home as well we have an obligation to protect our citizens and that means everything from border security to immigration reform putting America first we are a superpower we are a leader I think President Trump is doing a fabulous job in repositioning us in that regard because as Churchill indicated if you've seen the darkest hour be relentless be relentless there are some regimes diplomacy will not work okay I don't think we can close a blind eye to areas that are being suppressed and where there's extreme human rights violations so I think we need to equip our military we need to engage and Wars with intent to win all right mr. krenshaw again the question is some people reveal the US has the moral responsibility to create leadership in the foreign policy to help spread democracy others feel that the US has no business trying to service the world's police force what is your philosophy of the role of the u.s. in world affairs I'm glad we agree that it is it is a moral imperative a u.s. leadership is paramount of security both here and abroad global security is American security that doesn't mean that we get mired in endless nation-building sometimes we don't want that balance so well then Iraq we were doing well but unfortunately sometimes we think in four year increments by the administration pulled us out what do we get because there was an American power vacuum that can't ever happen you have to put people like me in harm's way to protect the American people here because the world is small and it's shrinking one thing I like to point out is that Texans really represent to the rest of America what it means to be that shining light on the hill that's what I love about the second District because we care about things like patriotism and freedom and the red white and blue and we demonstrate that and America as a whole has to demonstrate that same thing to the rest of the world that are interesting talk today by the founder of flag it's a it's an organization that teaches that teaches patriotism essentially and American values to young people you know in elementary school middle school high school he brought up something interesting imagine a world at that America North Korea probably just invaded South Korea China would invade Taiwan build more islands and in the Pacific Russia would have its way probably made more countries Middle East would go to war for Saudi Arabia Iran possibly nuclear by now Africa warlords would be tearing through it even more soon than they are now imagine the world without America it's a scary place that's why we're the leaders of this world thank you look at these these are really meeting uestions I wouldn't want me as a last year Congress repealed Obama cares individual mandate but left many other provisions of the law in place so we have a two-part question like the whole Hospital fund what role if any does the federal government have in ensuring that health care is available and affordable and what the provisions of Obamacare would you repeal which ones would you keep in place we'll start with a friendship by the way I'll repeat these questions at any time if you want me to work you all it's a start I mean the mandate is truly anti-american you cannot force people to purchase something they don't want to purchase I understand the logic behind it economically speaking but it didn't work I understand the logic behind Obamacare it didn't work that's what we're seeing that we're seeing premiums rise at rates faster than ever before there was a recent study on this actually they're measuring time for 2014 when Obamacare is implemented and from 2014 until now the rates of premium increases are exponentially higher the whole thing has to be repealed we have to stop kidding ourselves into believing and the federal government is so omniscient and so good at what it does they can actually manage health care it is the most complex industry we have it has to be taken down to the local level it has - it doesn't mean that we do it perfectly at the local level we have to do a better job of primary care I've ticked I've talked to a lot of doctors about this in Texas Medical Center they acknowledge that we're the best in the world pretty much across the board but we fail sometimes in primary care we have to have a more competitive industry there we have to look at things like telemedicine and subscription services these things already exist concierge services where you can pay doctors just a certain amount of money for months cheap a hundred two hundred dollars and they will be on call for you and they will manage your care flip the power back in the hands of doctors the ones you trust it's really that simple and it's listening it's listening so the first thing I will do is create a committee of experts once I already know from the Texas Medical Center guys like David blot and the healthcare industry so though we find the exact right solutions but keep the federal government out of it because as much as we would love the idea that we can fix something we have to be humble and understand the limits of the human condition you cannot do it thank you [Applause] last year Congress repealed Obamacare's individual mandate but left many of the other provisions of a law in place what role if any does the federal government have in ensuring that health care is available and affordable and what provisions of Obamacare would you appeal at which would you leave in place Fitz okay a little first questions first what would we keep him Obamacare absolutely nothing individual mandates I think the way to get rid of it is because it's so politically sensationalized if you mentioned repeal Obamacare the dims go nuts if you do what we did that President Trump did in the tax cut bill you begin dismantling the piece by piece by taking care of or way the individual mandates then you eventually get rid of it now let's talk about the federal government role the federal government should not have a role in health care the federal government should have a role in the delivery of the health care I serve on the asami Appropriations health care subcommittee Texas rightfully did not participate in the exchange program we advocated and received 1115 waiver this if they're coming you give us the money and we will manage it we capitate 90% of the health care cost of Medicaid which means we pass the risk on to the private sector because the private sector does it best and we create competition now the only comparison between Dan and I compared we'll be on policy it will be my votes and my proven what I voted for I'll be damned in terms of what he says in campaigns on website success so I want to point out a couple of things that are somewhat contradictory to what Dan might have said he first took fall in his website said when we force insurance to cover routine visits or treatment the cost of those treatments naturally skyrocket and premiums follow as a result health care is overused well we need to advocate for preventive care because otherwise we raise the cost of health care overall another thing you know big interest in tanta to speak to this is high for limited government here Dan mentions the VA moving towards Medicare prescription drug and acknowledges the VA being socialized medicine so that's compare and contrast thank you and I in order to be fair if someone's going to directly question somebody we are going to give me a chance to respond and they're closing a may end up having to add some time if necessary because I'm sure mr. French I had a two-minute closing prepared so as with the with the judges Fiesta and we asked some policy questions but we also has a question about sort of how they plan to do things what kind of judge they plan to be and we have a question like that for our congressional candidates the question will begin with mr. Roberts is this new members of Congress have to decide early what path they want to pursue in their congressional career whether they want to try to climb the committee ladder and eventually become a chairman or whether they want to try to climb the leadership ladder and with her speaker or whatever and gain influence that way what I what courts do you plan to pursue and if leadership how can you use that to help the district and if a committee which committee and why yes would be the answer develop I go as I did the Texas House with one purpose one purpose only that is to represent the second congressional district and the issues that are important to you and to be your voice and to achieve results I was asked when I went to the Texas House which team are you gonna be on and I said I'm gonna be on one team I'm gonna be on Texas House District one 2016 because that's who I represent what I will do the first day before were sworn in I will go to speaker AIA I would go to his chief of staff I will work around to the various committee chairmen of committees I have interest in such as energy and confidence I will give them my background and I would say I am here to work look me in coach I did that the Texas House as a freshman I was appointed typically get two standing committees I was appointed to appropriations committee I was appointed to the subcommittee of the health care subcommittee a bunch of transparency reform county affairs the port Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee I was elected by my peers in this district to represent our area on the Republican policy caucus I'm going to work and the way the process I believe will work is would you show that you're a hard worker you will get chairmanships you will through being able to build consensus you will be recognized leadership abilities and that's what I've shown in the past and I plan on doing the same thing to best represent this congressional district thank you all right mr. Crenshaw again the question is new members of Congress have to decide early what path they want to pursue in their congressional career whether they want to try to climb the committee ladder and eventually become a chairman or whether they want to climb the leadership ladder and gain influence that way that matter whether they want to just get one of his speeches and do nothing what course do you plan to stay in leadership how can you use that to help the district if a committee which committee you hope to chair and why primary consideration here is how to help the people the second district where can do that from well I laid out a few missions that we have border security and split control policy homeland security committee seems like a pretty good place to be calls border security oversees FEMA transportation committee oversees yummy Corps of Engineers these are the places you have to put pressure on in order to help people right now it's not about making a name for myself it's about what I can do for you showing leadership is more than just a vote it's more than just some selfish sense of authority it's that leadership and it's passion and it's inspiration it's connecting with people it's building relationships on Capitol Hill so that you can move the ball forward I'm the only one with any experience working across federal agencies and there's some of the scariest many environments imaginable working with the State Department working with foreign governments intelligence community law enforcement agencies the military of course I'm the only one who understands that only one who has a master's degree in policy when we talk about health care how what we're supposed to do to fix that and take somebody with a master's degree in policy and understanding of pure economics for you to know that when you overly increase the roles on health insurance sometimes you get overuse and because I've studied these things I can point you to the studies in Oregon where this is proven but when they put too many people on Medicaid it gets overused and the health outcomes do not improve and premiums skyrocket any answers the question that's why it's on my website because I care about policy because I'm educated in it and I know we have to do the face thank you the next question is what is your position on daca and whether people who were brought here illegally as children should get to stay and should they have a path to citizenship I've never had this question that's a joke we have it every single time okay the only way we can talk about legal status or the so-called dreamers is when we have border security we end chain migration we add sanctuary cities could protects us on this one come on this blog for Texas [Music] [Applause] California you're next and when we talked about legal status we're not talking about some expedited path to citizenship that is a very important distinction and there's a reason for that it's not just because Rama Rao's is American we said so it's because it gets in front of the legal immigrants the good people who are coming into this country the right way but my stepmother she's right here that there's been a travesty many of our ancestors who came here legally any of those still waiting in line there is a process and that's what we abide by just because someone is angry just because they're rioting in the streets doesn't mean they're right doesn't mean they have the right policy as conservatives we know that we don't necessarily give in to emotion and anger we're the party of good governance and common sense sometimes that gets us some heat that's all right we can take it and I'm the kind of guy who can thank you and I miss province the question is what is your position on Daka and whether people who were brought here illegally as children should get to stay and should they have a practice citizenship yeah let's look at immigration in general and Dan and I are in agreement on a number of things as relates to this first of all let's talk about the immigration how many of you think let's just use common and by the way I'm a common-sense pragmatic look at real issues come up with the real solution got it okay I'm not the brightest ball but I can pretty well figured most things out so I come over illegally let's say we go to Russia Russia and I'm there because I drew this lucky ticket all the brooch soup I want the rest of my life and I get to bring my family with me it doesn't matter they were mass murderers but because I have this ticket everybody gets to come does that seem logical to you no not at all we have to deal with the issues we have to stop the infiltration of illegal migration absolutely especially with the issues we're seeing this day and age let's talk about doctor we have a large Hispanic district ministry a champion force Baptist our Hispanic Minister came over it took him 13 years to go through the process to finally become a legalized citizen okay every person that I've met that has gone through that process I asked the question because I figured being base gotta be sympathetic veil on should we provide these kids with legal citizenship status you know what they say absolutely no we came over we worked to get through it they should as well and I agree with you all right mr. Roberts under what circumstances would you support sending the US Armed Forces into combat overseas under what circumstances first of all I would turn to very tactical individuals who have spent their life and surface and this is one thing you learn in politics in bait that sort of like insurance they tell you they're an expert never field adventurous the life of them okay public law sees complex you have to put individuals around you with experience and extreme expertise dan would be fabulous in the Department of Defense in the State Department because I have faith that he would get some things done so you have to be able to look at both sides and when they present why we need to engage ok you have to do a risk/reward what is it that we're trying to achieve what's our goal will the mission accomplished it if so how are we resource adequately are we providing do we have the Allies strength I would listen to these folks who this is what they do this is how they spent their life and their dedicated service and at the end of the day when a decision is made you have to be behind that decision in a hundred percent support so I would support our military and those who are in leadership when they have done a full due diligence and as unified recommendation now when we send our young men and women in harm's way we go for one purpose and one purpose only that is to win them and that is to win because if it's not and and Dan can speak to this I don't take anything lightly when I am making decisions that affect other's lives and it's a high bar and it's a heavy responsibility so if we're going to do it we're going to make sure that we're in it to win it under what circumstances would you support sending the US Armed Forces into combat overseas it's a general questions they're gonna get it fairly generally it's a few things first nobody knows or or better than item sad applause that happy love but Miss Connecticut I've lost a lot of friends have been to a lot of funerals I'm only 34 but we're not victims not at all we would do it again in a heartbeat and it's our duty to live because of the men we've lost overseas and the woman we've lost overseas now if it isn't right about everything you said it is not a decision for experts the military to make what they tell you as a civilian leader is how they would accomplish the mission that you set out for them it is a political decisions when you send men and women overseas it is a hundred percent a political decision I know because I've been in the military those aren't the discussions that we have we can advise on how we would do it how many people we would lose what our chances are but in the end it's the decision that comes from here and it's a heavy one so under what conditions well is there a threat to United States for starters is there a threat to our allies these are strategic questions we ask as policymakers you have to know that going into this there's one policy area that you cannot research now you can't rely on the Heritage Foundation to tell you what the thing to the Cato Institute it is national security its defense its intelligence its Foreign Affairs you need experience in these things I'm the only one with the experience as I've worked across all these agencies I've lived abroad I've worked in multiple embassies I've created strategic plans the kinds we're talking about implementing that's the kind of experience we need in Congress to hit the ground running and that's why I'm running these questions actually looking at Harless I'm good at thinking oh great yet another member with better hair than me the next question is don't get any easier folks can the federal budget ever be balanced and if so how I'm gonna get the men a little technical we've already talked about budgeting a little bit so I'll say again how important it is to tackle mandatory spending and we can talk about discretionary all day long discretionary spending by the way it's the budget that's actually appropriated annually it funds every department in the government and yeah you can cut some things from that even the military by the way you know the military doesn't ask for that 700 billion dollar price tag the Congress gives it to them and they have their reasons there are ways to cut spending we can change the way we do pledging we can stop doing continuing resolutions for the Department of they can actually plan ahead and have a have a date a realistic and common sense contracting acquisitions mechanisms in place that would save money and would be better prepared to face our enemies abroad we have to tackle mandatory spending that is the true driver of our debt I said 20 trillion dollars it's not growing a trillion today I heard that before that's not correct but it isn't about over 20 trillion dollars right now and our deficits by 2020 might be a trillion a year that's scary we have to touch that third rail of politics now do we have the balance in perfectly no let me get let me get actually technical with you if you reduce the deficit as a percentage of GDP lower than the growth as a percentage of GDP we will eventually get to zero percentage takes a while we eventually get to 0% debt as a percentage of GDP that's a healthy economy that's what we need to do we need to focus on pro-growth policies thank you Trump for doing that I'm not so sure about these tariffs right now because they're not good for this district but pro-growth is the way to go we need that so that our growth as a percentage of GDP is higher than our deficit as a percentage of GDP that's the road to a healthy economy [Applause] mr. Roberts the question is can the federal budget ever be balanced and it's so patently well we do it in the great state of Texas absolutely it can be and there's four different areas I wanna address hopefully we'll get to at least couple of them first the deep state how many of you watch Hannity in here about the deep state and the federal bureaucracy fred's it is real I was speaking to a member of the Trump administration last week I said okay a key priority of mine is to tackle the budget deficit and to move us towards a balanced budget I voted for article 5 legislation as past legislative session where we passed a bill as did professor Schofield voted for it that required the federal government to do two things balance a budget and term limits which I support both the way you do first of all ways we do have to go in and with my business experience I've dealt with this we have to break the back of the unions the federal government bureaucracy is being run by unions did you know that those that are over agencies that are political appointments cannot fire federal employees they have to relocate them or hope they retire that is why you see them staying forever they do not leave they filed grievances that is where the waste is we have to break the back of the bureaucracy second of all we have to deal with the 60% that being the non-discretionary budget we have to look and we have to cut entitlements we have to look and we have to see which programs are not achieving their stated goals and you eliminate those programs we need to look at zero based budgeting how many a best take your punchin every year in escalated 5% nobody does they have to justify their dollars just not fantasy sports people all right the question is are you pro-life and if so what does that mean to you and why are you throw life great question thanks frenzy I am pro-life and have a proven record my life stance really Semin aids more than the public policy but it's personal because you hurt my life story being raised by my grandparents I have been this past session based upon my work I received an A rating from the Texas Right to Life I received the faith and family award from the Texas values and I'm endorsed by Texas Alliance for life I voted for every piece of pro-life legislation I missed one amendment about us in the bathroom what pro-life means to me is it's from the womb to the tomb okay life begins at conception and we protect that life okay once it's born we have a responsibility I passed a faith-based foster care bill this year to give kids a chance in single family homes or homes where their parents have left them we have a responsibility to put them in a place that they can be a contribution okay that they can have life but also we have responsibility at the end of life did you know before this legislative session and the bill that we passed into law that a Medical Ethics Board could unilaterally make a decision to and your life yeah guess what Valerie can they do it now no they cannot do it now life is not you have to look at the whole person there's a lot of public policy that you can look at both sides in debate and I've told there's one thing I will never ever ever ever compromise on and that is the life issue I will never ever vote against a bill or for a bill that does not protect life and I have a proven record to support that branch now the question is are you pro-life and if so what does that mean to you and why I'm absolutely pro-life what it means to me we agree we agree on this completely what it means to me is that life does start at conception and that should be protected we need to have legal protection over what the human life cycle is knowing that it begins at conception the real issue here is in that way whether we all agree or not I'm a pro-life the issue is how are we going to draw more young people into the party given our stance as pro-life it that's the existential question we have as Republicans so we're not wavering on this because we're the party of freedom and were the party of morality we need to learn how to debate with the left on this when they claim that they're just trying to protect a woman's choice to do it to ones with their body well I agree you should be able to do whatever you want with your body but scientifically speaking show me the Medical Journal where a fetus is part of your body what's the body part called it's a human being it's a human being we don't have to make religious arguments about this we can make scientific ones you can make moral ones we can make humanistic arguments I don't know that we're doing a good job of it maybe they'll still disagree maybe at least we can bring into an honest place where the disagreement is where we value a human life what part of the life cycle we value that that maybe we can at least agree to disagree but let's bring them to an honest point no more platitudes no more euphemisms for abortion that's the fight that we have that's the battle of the cultures that we have Mississippi by the way just passed a bill 15 weeks is there a lemon best in the nation you know Europe is in 12 weeks that's an abomination America is too far left on this issue we can't allow that so I think you know where I stand thank you all right and we will have one final question before each candidate has a two-minute closing statement and the question will request mr. French oh you go first they're going to get hurt Eustis just in time all right what country or organization do you believe is the biggest threat to US national security and what would you recommend Congress do about it good question you had an organization in there that is an important part is it depends on what type of threat we're talking about are we talking about I label threats a sort of blood and treasure let's talk about blood terrorism attacks right now in Austin we don't know the source of these terrorist attacks we know they're somewhat sophisticated tripwires and such on packages doesn't require as much knowledge as you might think some people are thinking Isaac's military or she's ex-military it's usually angles be honest not necessarily people who live in dirt and Afghanistan make those bums they'll do things like but photosensitive paper on an IEDs to which you dig it up it blows up in your face it blinds you that's not what happened to me I just got blown up by another bomb but this stuff isn't that hard there's a lone wolf terrorist attacks they're hard to see coming it's hard to identify the motive we don't know the motive right now going on in Austin that's a huge threat because it's not easy to prevent we talk about the Russians that's a threat as well do I think they're going to bomb this with nuclear weapons no because we have mutually assured destruction they're wasting money right now on increasing the technology at that nuclear arsenal it's a waste of their time they're doing it for their internal politics but they're interfering in our elections and we've known I don't think they actually succeeded we know that as well that's in the reports that just came out but they're trying Chinese stealing our intellectual property this goes to the treasure unfair trade practices that's a threat to national security a huge threat to national security we need to focus on our cyber defenses in a big way ways that we're not doing enough of coordinating a public/private relationships a private business and that they're protected as well gotta protect bloody treasure in America thank you mr. Roberts the question is what country or organization do you believe is the biggest threat to US national security and what would you recommend Congress to do about it today it looks like Kamaraj analytics and Facebook is right up there you know Dan alluded to it and this guy is gonna know them okay but what we see is like what we saw today what we see in Austin it's the enemy we don't know about and can't see that to me seems the most dangerous it is the me toos is the individuals that go on the internet and learn how to make a bomb and then in order to achieve some reward based upon their fate they create havoc in our nation and those are the ones that are difficult with all the great intelligence that you may have okay those are hard to detect and they're hard to detain in the heart of control from a more substantive of who we know I think it has to be an ISI as congressman though this question about a month ago that's a congressman because he serves on the Armed Services cetera who's that great threat and he said hands down his North Korea hand status North Korea he said they aren't moving towards nuclear arsenal they just have figured out how to carry it and they are one of those little Kim is that's just unpredictable he says the key to that though is China and we're beginning to make progress with China because China supplies North Korea's the largest supplier of energy to them we need to continue sanctions we need to continue mandatory pressure and we need to continue building our alliance with out lies to have them put similar pressure on and I greet Dan cyberterrorism security is a very real a very huge issue all right way back to gentleman's time has expired I went before we go to the closing statements and we'll start with mr. Roberts and MO mr. krenshaw just a reminder next month Tuesday April 17 right here in this room you're going to have the Harris County Republican Party Chairman Paul Simpson and the Honorable stand standard our County Clerk come in and give you a summary of the primary election and kind of let us know where we are going forward for those of you who are new to the club or not members of the club but we'd love to have you back for that and for all future events and membership in the years only what $30 25 can it be a bigger bargain what is the matter with you 35 for 35 for an entire family of course Mike I was one of six kids of that we'd get you're pretty good with that word but you know please join the club and and help participate and again remember we're going to need all of y'all in November and now they're going to proceed to the closing statements we will begin with mr. Roberts both candidates what two minutes at least I want to thank you again for being here I know it's been long but I think I can speak on Dan's behalf how nice it is to get to talk about policy where we can actually engage in discussions and interact with you okay because at the end of the day it is engaged folks like you that are absolutely critical I'll tell you our biggest concern and the primary was folks that might not look up from the TV to do what you do to become informed so thank you thank you for the time this election really comes down to more than Dan versus Kevin dan is a great guy I respect a nice guy Holly tells me every once in a while I'm a nice guy okay I think it comes down to this it comes down to in the general election which Republican do we want to send out of the primary that we believe has the best experience proven record ability to go straight ahead on and take on the Democrats in a battle and talk policy talk experience because I tell you why this guy they protected him they put a bubble around him he's not in a runoff and they're going to try the Pennsylvania strategy have run straight down the middle and I say bring it on my business experience my proven record of conservatives leader in my community involvement and desire to be the people's congressional representative for the second District I believe is a reason that qualifies sportin me for this I hope to earn your vote in your support and I'd be honored to represent you in Washington [Music] and now the closing statement for mr. Crenshaw this seat in the US House of Representatives it's more than just one vote it's more than just a voice lightly asking Washington to listen to us in the second District you deserve a lion for your cause you deserve a vision for the conservative movement I don't think that vision is all that complicated for the party of freedom of good governance morality or the guardians of the American identity was that me well I think there's some threats that we face those didn't used to just be conservative values used to be agreed upon but now the left with their notions of false compassion and divisive identity politics and ever-growing governments say and how you live your life the greatest threat proposed by the left is the undercutting of American values and history and tradition this idea that America is inherently flawed the only way to remedy that is socialism and open borders well I think they're wrong I think we need leaders to stand up to them we need to do it with good governance and the right policies the policies we know are right fixing our health care the right education positive we're focused on programs like vocational training and apprenticeship that actually prepare our youth for the next step finally securing our border finally fixing our debt limited government where you put the power at the local level and where the guardian's American identity what does that mean it means freedom patriotism standing up for the red white and blue being proud to be an American again not this idea that it's some material place some lands not connected by culture or history it is and it's a story that began in 1776 and became the ideals that we know and love today and that's what we're about the second District that's the kind of voice we deserve in Washington so we can tell the rest of the country what we already know thank you and hope for your vote man [Applause] think about let's come trash what happened in Russia where if you just got himself re-elected without any opposition and still had to cheat and stuff the ballot order came here in the United States predicted Texas where these two gentlemen running to served on one of the highest offices in land came out here on a Tuesday night to see you

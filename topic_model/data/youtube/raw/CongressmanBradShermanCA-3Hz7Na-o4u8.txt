we're holding these hearings this hearing is at least a year maybe two years late and I'm glad to see that when three and a half million consumers are adversely affected I believe that the financial services committee will take that seriously mr. Sloan I'm but this is not a trick question because I told you in my office that I would ask it you've heard consumers you've talked about remediation but now it's time for you to be in the vanguard of consumer protection one way you could do that is to endorse carolyn Melones bill on overdraft protection this will make sure that overdrafts are reasonable and proportional that you do not reorder transactions and that no other bank reorders transactions in order to increase the amount of fees that there's notification at ATMs etc I asked your senior staff to look at the bill to advise you can you be on the right side of history and endorse that bill now I think we're already on the right side of history because when you look at the changes I'm not asking or what your practices are mr. Sloan because even your practices only affect your bank you have a powerful lobbying organization in this city will that organization be on the right side of history again I can I can tell you what we do I'm asking what your lobbyists will do not what you're banking computers will do we don't have lobbyists they're lobbying on overdraft protection well your lobbyists don't lobby on bills affecting all of your customers and you're in the bank relationship with them why do you pay them congressman what if what I'd like to do is describe the the industry-leading changes that we know because it's my time and I asked you about whether you'd support the bill and you're trying to filibuster by talking about your practices somebody else may ask you that question will your lobbying organization which you have here to lobby on bills relevant to your bank nothing could be more relevant support this legislation congressman I have not spoken to our industry trade groups about that bill but I will speak to them about it oh so you'll talk about it behind closed doors I'd like to talk okay I've got to go on to the next sir I need to go on to the next question you told the gentleman from his gentlelady from Missouri that you're done full remediation it occurs to me that some people had a Brewers FICO score and didn't get a house they just didn't qualify now that house is worth several hundred thousand dollars more than that when they were denied credit now if somebody's in that circumstance sure you'll pay for a mediator but will you enforce the arbitration provision or will you let them go to court if they want to go to court they don't need to go to court I don't say if they want to go to court you know the courts were established by the US Constitution and these other system with disputes are fine for those people who want them will you force those people at arbitration if they decide that's not what they want congressman in the situation of the retail sales practices mistakes that we made our customers aren't don't need to go to court because I don't owe you so you're smart they're dumb you have their interests at heart they have lawyers they want to go to court and you're telling them they are stupid for wanting to go to court let's say they want to go to court will you force them out of court by using the arbitration provisions congressman I don't think our customers are stupid in fact well then what some of your customers want to go to court are those customers stupid or do or are you going to use your clever arbitration provisions applicable to an account they never signed up for in order to keep them out of court if that's what they decide they want congressmen are remediation for customers that were impacted by retail sales practices exist extensive and comprehensive and you refuse to let people go to court and you use your arbitration provision for the account they did sign up for to keep them out of court with regard to the account they didn't sign up for and then you come before Congress and say oh but that's wonderful for the consumer the consumer must be wrong if they want to go to court I didn't say that congressman what I what I've been trying to you let them go to court if that's what they want yes or no we settled a 140 I'm asking for a yes or no not a filibuster that's the Senate side yes but how here yes or no congressman I've answered your question in terms no you haven't it in a I've asked you yes sir no and you haven't given me an answer congressman in certain circumstances we enforce our arbitration provisions of customer agreements in the he's even for the accounts they didn't sign up for that congressman in the in the case of sales practices as I mentioned we've had an extensive remediation effort every customer that's come in to see us we've resolved their issue mr. Sherman obviously mr. Sloan is not going to answer your question we're going to move on mr. Posey the gentleman from Florida is recognized for five minutes

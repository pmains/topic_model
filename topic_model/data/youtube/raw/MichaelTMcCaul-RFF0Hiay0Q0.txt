thank you very much mr. chairman representative Davis asked the governor a good question he asked him you know where would the resources come from it would be additional or would be and his answer was and you heard it was that the resources and money can come from quote those used underused somewhere else those used up those underused somewhere else now you're the four agencies that the somewhere else would come from can you tell me quickly and given the time constraints can you tell me where they're underused somewhere else the resources start with you Adam well thank you for the question sir I really can't pull it out right now where I can think of a place where our resources are underused that we could deploy to Puerto Rico what I can tell you is that where we are applying our resources is as close to the shipment point down in the transit zone as is possible we believe that our strategy of intercepting the cocaine destined for for Hispaniola which creates secondary flow over to the island of Puerto Rico is best intercepted where it's coming out of the gate where we can get it in bulk before it gets to the mainland where it's partial dup into smaller packages and becomes a real problem that the governor's wrestling with right now sir let me say I could us a tell us where in your department that under used somewhere else is for the record sir I have I cannot tell you where we got anything under used I would say the same but i would say that in order to try to address this threat we have surged at least seven people since january to the san juan area and to assist the puerto rico police department in identifying violent gang members and seizing weapons from the street obviously this is a temporary situation but we do have several at least 10 to 14 people that in the pipeline identified to come on to be hired on a permanent basis and we're just waiting for approval of the Puerto Rico trust fund budget for FY 13 and 14 to make that a reality in terms of Customs and Border Patrol could you tell me where the underutilized somewhere else is good after good late morning ranking member kidding we don't have any underutilized look location under resource locations over resources locations at this point our workload staffing model governs how we deploy our resources and that's based on both the volume and a risk of each port of entry nationally and we have in Puerto Rico a significant volume of passengers and trade coming through and also threats as described by the governor and in Resident Commissioner Pierluisi so we're over three could I ask mr. kostelnik there's the underused somewhere else in your department oh so ours would be the same are we lay our down nationally as israel's privatisations and adjust those based on mission need so i would suggest given the answers of our panel there's no some there's no under you somewhere else and the answer might be more allocation of overall resources and that's the answer that's the only answer i'm left with and we reduce those things in budgets so there's my conclusion i wanted to follow up on that I'll yield back the rest of

about recent instances of campaign trail controversy they all involve Democratic candidates taking issue or so it seems with their opponents military service Chris Gallagher live in our West Coast newsroom with more trace and Megan the reason the veterans groups are angry is because the candidates who are criticizing their opponents military service never served in the military themselves the most glaring comment came from Arkansas Democratic Senator Mark Cryer prior saying this about his Republican opponent Congressman Tom cotton watch I think that's part of this sense of entitlement that he gives off is that um like I served my country therefore let me to the Senate that's not how it works in Arkansas but cotton believes serving his country enhances his credentials and is now countering prior statement by using his former drill instructor in an ad watch this drill sergeant Norton taught me how to be a soldier with accountability humility and putting the unit for yourself that training stuff they better have in Alaska a group backing Democratic Senator Mark Begich ran an ad accusing Republican Dan Sullivan of not being a real Alaskan listen documents show that while Sullivan pocketed a Maryland tax credit for residents living there voting in Alaska claiming to be one of us what the ad left out is it Sullivan lived in maryland to work in national security after nine eleven he was also a marine called to active duty three times including as late as last year the National Republican Senatorial Committee was not about to let that comment pass so they made an ad using a comment from a local Alaska news anchor watch this Sullivan and his family moved to Alaska in 97 in 2004 he was recalled to active military duty really you're gonna begrudge the guy for that I don't think so finally in the Maryland governor's race the Democratic Attorney General went after his opponents saying that serving as a lawyer in the Iraq war was not a real job Megan

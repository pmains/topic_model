joining us now live to discuss is democratic senator alex padilla of california senator thanks for joining us so you signed on to that letter with your colleague senator warren here's a here's a horrifying quote from it quote airlines have also increased flight over bookings causing passengers to be in the voluntarily denied boarding nearly three times as often as the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2018 unions are sounding the alarm that airlines are selling tickets for flights they know they will not be able to staff unquote that's crazy how soon do you think this can improve for consumers uh jake well i hope uh it's much sooner rather than later you know as we're talking about what is within an airline's control the weather isn't we had a lot of flight delays yesterday especially on the eastern seaboard because of weather but if they're claiming that staffing shortages is a reason for these disruptions these delays these cancellations why offer the flights to begin with and mislead consumers that they'll be able to either do that business travel or take that vacation they've been waiting uh years for that's a perfect example of the type of behavior we're trying to address so i asked secretary boudej about this on state of the union on sunday and he said that things have improved a lot since memorial day weekend when it got real really ugly take a listen look at cancellation rates for the last couple of travel weekends they've been around uh one and a half percent which is getting closer to normal it's of course never going to be zero uh with weather and things like that but it should never be as high as it was uh during the memorial day travel weekend and we're going to continue to push them and of course prepared to work collaboratively whenever there's a chance to do things that smooth out operations in our national airspace are you satisfied with that answer uh look i i think all the more reason to keep the pressure on look at the memorial day travel numbers we can look at the fourth of july travel numbers we have labor day coming up soon this is still summer sort of the peak season for vacation travelers before kids go back to school including my own uh and so we got to keep the pressure on if the numbers are coming down we got to keep them moving in that direction but just to to to level that here jake 122 000 flights canceled year to date that's more than all of 2021 combined so uh again we got to keep the pressure on so just yes or no is the byte administration being tough enough on the airlines uh well i think they're taking action which is good and it's our job to remind them of other tools in their toolbox including you know these fines i don't think uh compensation for travelers that are bumped from their flights or where flights are canceled should necessarily be negotiated in a case by case basis who's first to the customer service gate or who's first to call the 1-800 number air passengers have rights and that should be automatic when they're inconvenienced like that all right i'm going to take that as a no let me ask you as we just reported a new data point shows consumer confidence falling for the third month in a row now there are steps that president biden could take today to lower prices such as getting rid of the trump tariffs on china but the president refuses to take these actions why not so uh well we're going to keep pressing the white house to do what they can and we need to focus in congress to do what we can that's why i think we're on the verge of finally allowing medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices to bring those health care costs for working families across the country good news you covered a few minutes ago gas prices seem to be on the way down but let's revisit child care costs and other significant costs that working families are uh having to deal with you know we're debating inflation the impacts all i know is paychecks aren't going as as far as they used to and i say that not just as a senator i say that as a father and a husband so speaking of things the the the dollar not being struck you know the inability of individuals to stretch their dollars the the fed is going to meet tomorrow uh and will likely raise interest rates again uh we learned today that overall home prices are up nearly 20 nationwide from just one years ago one year ago you know this because housing prices in california are already among the nation's highest so your constituents need bold action on all of these issues inflation housing prices etc at what point did democratic officeholders start publicly demanding more from president biden has in his administration look i think we're always going to be pressing the administration we also need to ask more of the voters let's keep this in mind when we go vote in november we know democrats have a plan to bring down prescription drug prices uh we know that we can do a whole lot with by taxing the most wealthy and multinational corporations and reinvesting in our own economy in our own workforce including manufacturing we're on the verge of passing that's a semiconductor competition bill here in congress but we have plans on reducing child care plans on reducing cost of housing and if republicans aren't going to play ball with us and do what's right for working families and let's keep that in mind when we go vote in november so we've seen these record-breaking temperatures around the country in recent days which are a real threat to workers exposed to this heat during the work day you're pushing osha the occupational safety and health administration to pass new protections for workers it can take years for that agency to craft new rules i'm not sure if we have the the film uh the the video of you uh working in the field but i know you did that recently um there it is there's a picture of you i think you're picking parsley in this along with united farm workers of america what pressure are you putting on osha to craft new rules and to do so quickly or pressing osha to move as quickly as they possibly can in advancing legislation to not give them a choice in moving faster look i'm proud to come from california we have adopted heat standards for workers whether it's in agriculture whether it's in construction whether it's you know truck drivers or warehouse workers who are exposed to extreme heat you know nearly 400 workers have lost their lives in the last decade because of extreme heat it's long overdue to have a federal standard to save lives because guess what you've been covering the news the heat waves not just the united states but uh throughout europe and beyond it's our planet's only getting hotter which means workers that are exposed to extreme heat uh that that dynamic that challenge is only going to increase yeah which you experience firsthand i see democratic senator alex padilla california thanks so much for your time today appreciate it coming up next donald trump's big return to watch

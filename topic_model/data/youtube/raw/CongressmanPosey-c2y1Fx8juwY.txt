Thank You mr. chairman thank you for holding this meeting it's perhaps the most important one you've held this year and I appreciate the witnesses to be here and talking about their real peril to debt unfortunately any time we discuss the debt we always talk about it and bean counter terms or esoteric platitudes and you wonder why the public doesn't understand it is because it's never been put in practical terms that they could that they can cope with their grab with if we think about a trillion dollars you know we're 20 trillion dollars in debt and significantly more probably for the unfunded future liabilities we know that it was twenty nine thousand seven hundred and one years ago before Christ that equates to one trillion dollars if we put it in seconds so the only way I think the average person can look at this debt is if we knock nine zeros off of it and equate the debt in our country to a family with roughly very roughly here $40,000 a year in comes spending twenty five thousand dollars a year on rent they can't live off the difference and so we have a family there's $40,000 a year about with two hundred and ten thousand dollars on their MasterCard depending upon which actuary you look at four hundred funded liabilities for Social Security Medicare Medicaid interest on the debt and veterans benefits that have already been earned eight hundred to a million dollars and it looks pretty hopeless and anybody that talks about the country being bankrupt is skewered this is I don't know if you can see it from here this is a fifty trillion dollar bill in Zimbabwe currency my office gave it to me for Christmas it's basically worthless except that has Ron Paul signature on it that makes it priceless to me but but I'm in 1980s Zimbabwe dollars worth the same as one of our dollars and and anybody in Zimbabwe that maybe had five million dollars in the bank thought they were pretty secure but at the time they gave me this currency it costs ten million dollars is ababa courtesy to buy a loaf of bread and so I think and I've asked a number of economists which you write a paper on how this affects the everyday American the hyperinflation that we're invariably going to suffer if we continue to accumulate the debt that we are like they have done in Tucson by way and many other countries that I'm sure you're familiar with we don't have time to discuss all of them and they all just say well you know hyperinflation is really bad money give me but but they don't win of the real pain of it and the video the the Chairman showed beforehand shows the picture of it it it leads eventually to hunger and violence as we're seeing some in South America now and so I would hope that somebody could with with the knowledge and ability could articulate this in a way that the average American could understand the average American family if they had two million dollars in the bank now they'd think they'd be good to go their retirement would be secure but if we have the hyperinflation that's invariably coming if it gives it bad as in by way they're they're two million dollars in the bank wouldn't buy twenty percent of a loaf of bread and that you know that's not something that is beyond the realm of possibility and I oftentimes see adversaries I think we actually need to spend more money and and we know the only people that come through these challenges well are the uber wealthy the middle class and the poor get crushed every time this happens doober wealthy make out because there becomes some bargains in the marketplace that they're able to take advantage of and so you know there are clearly people in this country in high positions that would actually like to see this happen we'd like to see Americans suffer this because they would gain personally I'd like to have in other countries where they've destroyed economies and it also helps their social agenda so I I would like to ask each of you what you think is the most dire prediction of the hyperinflation or the continuing to spend without increasing productivity that we have I I think you've said it exactly right which is the consequences will be that when the crisis hits there will be reactions in policy at the federal level higher taxes slashes in spending that will exacerbate the economic out downfall that will be concentrated largely on the least well-off in the United States and so you know when you think about you know how awful to say to do so security reform compared to what well compared to that those people will be much better off thank you

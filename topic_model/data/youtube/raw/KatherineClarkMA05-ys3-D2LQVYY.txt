whether it's stories of the tuskegee airmen legendary navajo code talkers women who were instrumental to victory in d-day these stories are often untold and i'd love to start with your story because you have such an impressive one what was it about west point and serving your country um that appealed to you as a young man you know i grew up in a home where my father did instill in me and my siblings a sense of service a service to others so as as i was growing up and thinking about how am i going to serve um i i decided that i could serve others by serving our country in uniform not only is it noble service but it can also be pretty exciting too during my trip to fort hood i was impressed with the new command and how they wanted to re-establish trust of of the soldiers at that post but i also was struck by the fact that it was predominantly uh white males in charge i think that's still true across our armed forces and across our intelligence community why do you think that is still the case and what do you think we can do to help um all americans be able to see themselves in in leadership in our military yeah i think it's a real problem because notwithstanding what i said earlier that i think we have the greatest fighting force on the pla in the history of this planet we could even be better if we were much more diverse and inclusive so what we know is that 43 of the uh men and women in our armed forces are from black and brown communities communities of color 43 that so when you step back the military looks quite representative but if not over representative of the diversity of our nation but when you look at the 61 most senior generals and admirals these are your four-star generals and admirals among the 61 there's only one woman uh general jacqueline von ovo's from the air force a very capable and skilled air force officer uh and there are only two african-american uh uh four-star generals general garrett from the army uh and uh um general brown who's the new air force uh chief and um you know that's just unacceptable and i think the reason why you have that you see that both in the military you see it throughout the intelligence community and national security organizations is because while they're pretty good on recruitment they don't do a good job at retention and promotion and so some of the things that need to happen and in the house version of the national defense authorization act what we as democrats have been focusing on are giving the the organization and commanders greater tools the issue came up about the name of fort hood and we should rename it and i was surprised how few knew that it was named after uh a confederate uh you know war soldier and so i know that you have been so active in this area of removing confederate symbols and names from our bases and joined by ruben gallego and veronica escobar in this work um but how do you see that this is so essential to our commitment for inclusion the military times just did a survey and when they surveyed members of the military who by the way more of them self-identify as republicans uh than they do democrats and many self-identifies independents but in a survey when asked the question do you support removing the names from military installations of confederate generals like hood and rucker 49 supported the removal only 37 no let's keep it the same and then when you asked another question uh do you support removing all sort of uh symbols and images of the confederacy like the you know the um confederate battle flag people put it as a sticker a bumper sticker on their car or maybe they hang it in there in their barracks room 69 of the members of the military support um are removing all of those symbols so there is a growing awareness and when and when soldiers and sailors and airmen and marine understand that hey that name is associated with confederacy they say no we don't want that and why don't they want it because they understand that the confederacy stood for upholding slavery the institution of slavery of of of uh and confederate generals were essentially traitors they didn't fight on the side of the union to keep us together they vote fought on the on the on the side of the confederacy uh to divide this nation uh to uphold uh slavery and when you don't remove those names it has a real impact on soldier morale i asked general milley in a hearing before the full house armed services committee he said certainly we should remove uh confederate symbols certainly we should rename these installations because they represent um a time a dark time in our history and if you don't do that you will have a negative impact on the morale and the readiness of our force on a soldier showing up at fort bragg knowing they're driving through the gates uh uh under the archway uh um that is named after a person who wanted to uphold the institution of slavery that that could be demoralizing and it is for so many service members

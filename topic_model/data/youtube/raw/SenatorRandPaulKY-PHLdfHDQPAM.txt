what a democrat incitement to violence no democrat will ask whether maxine waters incited violence when she literally told her supporters and i quote that if you see a member of the trump administration at a restaurant at a department store at a gas station or any place you create a crowd and you push back on them is that not incitement senator rand paul blasting democratic hypocrisy on the issue of inciting violence as the left pushes impeachment on the same charge even some democrats now admit the likelihood of a conviction slim after 45 republican senators backed a measure to dismiss the trial watch i think yesterday's vote in which 45 republican members of the senate voted that in their view proceeding with an impeachment trial of a former president is unconstitutional is a strong indication that it will be an uphill uphill climb for president trump to be convicted and in any way sanctioned as a result of this republican senator rand paul of kentucky joins me now senator thank you for coming on we very much appreciate it you got a bit of an endorsement there from your democratic colleague chris coons there so it does look like an uphill battle and yet on we go yeah impeachment's dead on arrival it'll just now be all theater but it really is a double standard when you think about it kamala harris has offered to pay people's bail who tried to burn down the courthouse and were rioting in the cities she offered to pay the bail is that inciting people to violence if you're willing to pay people to get out of jail after they've already committed violence should kamala harris be impeached so no the answer is no we would never do that because we're reasonable people the democrats are wanting to teach the president because they're deranged with hatred and bitterness but the president never said anything close to what kamala harris did she the president never said anything close to what bernie sanders did and saying well the republican plan is you get sick and die well that incited one of his followers to almost kill steve scalise wound four or five others and nearly have a massacre of 20 congressmen because he was incited by intemperate words of democrats but none of us would have said they should have been impeached and none of us said that kamala harris is responsible for the violence or that bernie sanders is responsible for the violence because we don't think that that is a reasonable thing to say but every one of them said about trump so just remember it's a double standard and i want to stay on impeachment but i also want to quickly get your thoughts on the violence happening the past several days in portland and seattle that again the media has largely and politicians have largely ignored very quickly yeah you know i think if you ask the people there i think they're tired of the violence and ultimately i think they're going to get rid of a lot of these politicians a lot of them have either resigned or are not running for re-election so i think the people out there are tired of the violence but i haven't heard any of the democrats condemning the violence they've been calling it the summer of love so yeah it is a double standard but i'm not going to sit around and take it nicely and just say oh we need to really thoroughly examine the president's speech well i'll examine the president's speech when we can examine kamala harris's comments on getting bail for people who are burning down cities senator yeah your name came up it's come up several times in the past several days it came up on msnbc joe scarborough going after conservatives and you in particular listen forget forget you're out of your mind and you're not a conservative that's how conservatives do not talk this is what the republicans in the senate want you to forget this is what rand paul wants you to forget this is what rand paul wants you to forget your response if anybody's forgotten they're a conservative it's joe scarborough i actually stood up and opposed the president's position on the electoral college i did vote to seat the electors i thought the argument was wrong i made that argument but the thing is is joe scarborough is so unhinged now and so much a hater of all republicans and things conservative that he doesn't even listen to the issues i've made very reasonable arguments against many of the president's positions on a series of very important issues scarborough has no clue because he's become deranged and surrounded himself with sycophants so he has no idea what's going on and all he does is call names but if he were fair-minded he would look at some of the comments democrats have made when cory booker said get up in their face you know is that not an incitement to violence maxine waters the mayor of seattle saying it's the summer of love as they burn our city down so no they're not fair-minded people but not one time have we said that you should impeach cory booker or that you should impeach kamala harris or impeach bernie sanders because we're we're much more fair-minded people and i thought i'll let the public decide who's right on that yeah let me just lastly play this sound bite from megan mccain and you've got about 15 seconds to wrap it up i believe president trump should be impeached i believe we have to take a stand and have a fine line about what is acceptable for a president to do or not he incited a riot people got violent people died but i cannot defend people who are are against impeachment defend yourself very quickly senator well i think we ought to look at the facts apparently the violence happened while the president was giving the speech to other people apparently people plotted about this violence weeks in advance on facebook which was the primary place that they plotted this but the other thing is is she needs to look at democrats language and use the same standard so if she wants to impeach the president she should also impeach maxine waters bernie sanders and cory booker kentucky senator rand paul thank you for coming on sir thank you

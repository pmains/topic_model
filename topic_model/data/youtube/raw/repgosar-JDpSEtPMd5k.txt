I recognize the gentleman from Arizona for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman before I get to my phone to my questions I I'm sad to see my colleagues aren't over here or on the other side of the aisle because I think it would be nice to see the application of us growing the tied foundation in the same place that you are that would be a wonderful conversation I think so but thank you very much mr. chairman for the question you know for the topper tunity this is a serious issue in which the executive branch has abused its powers for political gain my constituents in Arizona are mortified and angry Congress must ensure that the investigation into the targeting these groups is being conducted in a thorough timely and appropriate fashion so I'm going to ask some questions very quickly to each of the witnesses but I have a few to get through so if you can keep it concise I think you'll be pretty self-explanatory when the witnesses agree then that the administration and the enforcement of the law should be done impartial II and without regard to political affiliation absolutely the Constitution requires it I agree yes sir so real justice should be blind do the witnesses recall President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder expressing their supposed outrage that the IRS would target organizations that do not share their political views yes yes May 15th do you happen to share in their outrage oh absolutely so do I and so I did find it a terribly ironic that the president and the Attorney General expressed such an apparent outrage over this type of behavior only led to assign the task to an investigator that is biased towards the administration yes miss Barbara Baz Luhrmann one of the lead investigators donated nearly seven thousand dollars to the president and the Democratic National Committee and why I believe in everyone's right it's everyone's right to pull it to donate political donations I do not believe that she is the best fit to lead in this investigation and could potentially embarrass her party or the man she wanted to be president some might say the Department of Justice agrees that miss bosserman leading the investigation is inappropriate the committee asked the DOJ to allow Miss bosserman to attend the hearing today and the answer and the answered question was they refused outright DOJ a fish had the nerve to claim that making this boss sermon available to the Oversight Committee was tantamount to the targeting of a federal employee the use of the word targeting was not incidental the DOJ was explicitly attempting to draw similarities between the IRS targeting of conservative groups to the House Oversight Committee targeting federal employees to make such an assertion is to imply that the oversight inquiries are inherently partisan and therefore the administration can and should refuse to provide witnesses to answer questions when called upon so I ask you witnesses would you agree with that assessment yes that they were targeting yes yes they're targeting but they targeted certainly targeted many many of our clients and day but they're also trying to utilize it like that we in this committee are actually targeting federal employees I mean you can see a very strong they've they've twisted statute they've twisted the term it's actually what they're doing is conflating two issues one is the IRS engaged in a systematic targeting acknowledged systematic targeting the selection of the Department of Justice attorney to head the investigation they're trying to turn the targeting because we raise the concern of bias which of course as a defense counsel in our particular case or is the plaintiff in a lawsuit and there's a federal investigation of course we're going to bring that up so they're trying to turn what is an obligation of a lawyer to not have the appearance of impropriety and they're trying to turn that as individuals on this committee targeting this lawyer which has never been anybody's yeah so let's let me switch gears from it because you just took me right to where I wanted to be did the witness says happen to know whether it is legal or illegal for the IRS employer for an IRS employee to target groups based on political affiliation or ideology it's they they acknowledge I mean congressman as you know the IRS this is not a case where we're trying to figure out what the IRS did they have said affirmatively we targeted by name we created it be on the lookout list and they said we were wrong that was incorrect and quote we apologized that's what Lois Lerner said well but then according to Steve Miller the former Commissioner at IRS he absolutely said it's absolutely not illegal yeah well those very very comments yeah well the I argued a case of the Supreme Court of United States actually dealing with viewpoint discrimination and all nine justices said it was illegal yeah well that's that's why we we have to to rephrase the bureaucracy and the bureaucrats into can in good behavior I actually put a bill called the IRS anti Abuse Act which would make and codify political affiliation or ideology as a particularly protected class in the IRS the Internal Revenue Code code it also expressly prohibits an employee from being threatened to audit an individual or group due to arbitrary capricious or politically motivated reasons is it your recommendation that such provisions should become law I think so I think right now the instant IRS is institutionally incapable of self correcting so legislative oversight is necessary and Congressman I would like to add that I just received a text a moment ago in the recess from a person who said I built a website for our local tea party group and now I've been audited by the IRS I've heard stories from all from people all over the country about having for the first time in their lives become somewhat politically active or active in advocacy activities and suddenly they've been audited or their business has been audited and I just have to think that this cannot be coincidental and somebody needs to be doing the statistical analysis of those who have been selected for audit over the past four years absolutely I want to close real quickly certain indulgence I would close by noting again that the IRS commissioner has now approved sixty two point five million dollars in bonuses to the IRS employees for their work in 2013 to boost their morale how absurd I would say that those millions might be best used at the IRS to booth the ethical training and boost awareness of the United States Constitution thank you sir yield back

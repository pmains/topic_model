hi everyone I'm congresswoman Cindy axe nee representing Iowa's 3rd congressional district today I sent a bipartisan letter to the Department of Health and Human Services late in October we learned that a vital cancer drug for children been Christine would have shortages starting in November the reason was due to a nonspecific manufacturing issue according to the drug company and that answer isn't good enough we need to understand why these shortages happen and what needs to be done to prevent shortages in the future and that's what my letter does then Christine is essential to pediatric cancer treatments and without it children's lives are at risk then Christine is the backbone of almost every pediatric cancer therapy that we have I've heard from parents in Iowa with children fighting for their lives who don't know if treatments will be delayed or stopped Lindsay from Shenandoah has a two-year-old daughter with leukemia she was diagnosed in 2018 and isn't scheduled to finish her cancer treatments until 2020 and Lindsay is terrified that her daughter won't be able to finish her cancer treatments Nita is a grandmother from Casey whose grandson is just five years old and is also battling leukemia any lapse in medication during treatment puts the effectiveness of his treatments at risk and puts his life at risk as a mom of two boys I was horrified when I learned this was happening and that's why I asked other parents in Congress to sign on to my bipartisan letter to get answers getting to the bottom of shortages of life-saving cancer treatments for children is certainly an issue Democrats and Republicans can agree on so together with 12 of my bipartisan colleagues we sent that letter today because when it comes to protecting our children I know parents will put partisanship aside and do what's right I'm seeking answers for parents like Lindsay in Iowa and across the country and I'm working on making sure this doesn't happen again

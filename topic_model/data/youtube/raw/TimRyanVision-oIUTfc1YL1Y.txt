where's our Ohio crew I wish you weren't here you know I I grew up just outside the Youngstown Ohio and uh towards the end of my grandfather's like they my grandparents lived about two blocks from us and towards the end of my grandfather's life he was a steelworker for 40 years and he couldn't get around as well as he used to so he wanted to go to grocery shopping now the Ohio guys don't know this but I don't know how other people go grocery shopping but in Ohio and in Youngstown it's like an art form so my grandfather needed me to take them around and so we had to go to one grocery store for the cheese then we had to go all the way the other side of town we had to go get the meat on the other side of town because it was a little cheaper we had to go to the bakery to get the bread we had to go to the gas station because I'll never forget there was a 30-pack of Miller highlight on sale for nine bucks in the old gold cans you know you remembered of gold cans so we went all the way around and I was a little younger so I was starting to get frustrated because this is now a three-hour operation and we had to make one more stop and I said okay grandpa we'll go to this grocery store right here and he said no we can't go they said grandpa I mean come on it's it's right here we got to go and he said we can't go there the banks failed taxpayer will pick up the tab right pensions fail workers gotta suck it up tighten your belts pull yourself up by your bootstraps right is unacceptable in the United States of America and it's unacceptable for you and it's unacceptable for workers in this country and we will continue to fight this thing until we get you the money that you deserve that you burned that you paid for your the usher at church you coach the little league team you've done everything right you've done everything right and we're here because if we can't stand up for the people who have done everything right then what the hell are we doing here in the United States of America so we're here for you we're going to fight for you this is not going down without a fight and we're gonna make sure you get every single dime we can possibly get you for you or your kids for your grandkids because that's what it means to be an American we take care of each other in the United States of America

and the two sides come together joining us now house majority leader steny hoyer uh leader hoyer thank you very much for being with us 600 extra dollars people have been getting for months that expires this week we just saw the republican plan and for the time being they want to cut that back to 200. um can you meet in the middle well we'll see uh but it is typical of the republican response to the american people and saying you're on your own obviously to have a draconian 400 cut immediately is going to make it very very difficult for american families to meet their rent to pay for food to pay their living expenses it is it is not acceptable that the two and a half months after we passed the heroes act the republicans would still be dissembling still not able to reach agreement still not coming forward with sufficient assistance to meet this extraordinary pandemic and crisis that america and the american people are confronting it mirrors of course the trump's failure to respond in an effective way to this pandemic failure to apply the resources that are necessary to get us back to health and get us back to business and get us back to school the incredible mismanagement of this pandemic and the incredible negligence of the united states senate and the republican party to respond in a timely fashion is mirrored in this proposal it is insufficient it will let down the american people and it will damage the economy one of the things that republicans some republicans say is that 600 dollars serves as a disincentive to go back to work it is more in some cases than they say that people were making at the beginning so what do you say to that and i think that's an argument that is is has some validity to it and we ought to deal with that and there is a way to deal with that but not this way not cold turkey not here you have it now you don't the american people uh we're relying on that that we've got 30 million americans who've lost their jobs highest unemployment that we've had in decades the republican response is inadequate and frankly it's incomprehensible that the states and local governments and cities and tribal uh governments and territories that have been hemorrhaging revenue hemorrhaging revenue because of the pandemic are turned left out totally in the cold they hire our firefighters they hire our police they hire our uh sanitation workers they hire our teachers and all they're going to be left with is an option to lay off people who are critically important to the american people in responding to this pandemic let me just ask no it's not adequate i just want to make sure i'm hearing you correctly it does seem like you might be willing to come off some from six hundred dollars not to two hundred dollars but you're not demanding six hundred dollars or bust look it's not 600 robust you know you don't speaker pelosi said the other day which i thought was a great line we don't have red lines we have values and we're going into these negotiations with values to say that 600 or nothing no that's not where we are okay we're prepared to discuss this but we're also not prepared however to let down the american people let down the states the cities the local governments who hire people who are meeting this pandemics crisis including health personnel we're not willing to walk away from the american people which we think is what this bill does and in my opinion this bill is a mcconnell fig leaf it is a pretense of response rather than a substantive response uh less uh they would have acted much more quickly if they really wanted to deal with this problem but two and a half minutes by nothing happened i want to ask you a matter of parochial interest as a maryland representative and maryland resident has to do with baseball the miami marlins now with 14 players and coaches who have tested positive scheduled to play this week in baltimore as soon as wednesday is it your opinion that it would be safe to host the marlins at camden yards look i'll let the medical personnel decide that question i'm not expert enough to do that but clearly you got to be concerned major league baseball has to be concerned the players need to be concerned you come back and within just a few weeks of coming back 14 people on one team are tested positive for coronavirus that's a worry but i'll leave that decision as to what needs to happen to the medical and scientific personnel it gets to the issue of how early or the push to open maybe before an entity a state a city is ready and i was struck yesterday by the president of the united states yesterday in the midst of growing case numbers and whatnot saying this listen i really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they're not opening and we'll see what happens with them your reaction i i think it's typical of president trump's responses a shifting responsibility b evidencing no plan no concept of how we can defeat this pandemic no ability to lead this country it is tragic that a time of great crisis we have a president who has no plan who has no sense of what the right thing is to do and is dividing america rather than bringing it together to confront this virus now you're up at the capitol right now i want to show our audience i don't know that you can see it a live picture right now of the capitol and that is of course the late representative john lewis there we see it right now this is a live picture there were deeply moving services yesterday inside the capitol and i know this is a personal loss for you this is someone who was a friend of yours for decades uh yes and i i don't know if i heard this correctly did you walk with him across the edmond bridge 15 times that's correct uh some of those times hand in hand with my friend my beloved friend john lewis one i have i've said the day after his death i said there was a hole in the heart of america a sense of great loss of a leader who brought to us a vision of love and togetherness and a beloved community who brought every day of his life a positive attitude to make america better and have it live out its ideals of equality and justice and fairness to all and we've experienced a great loss and yes you're correct yesterday's ceremony was short at john's request he was a humble human being he was a great presence a great person as i say christ-like in so many ways but very humble self-effacing not necessarily wanting the attention on him but on the on the vision that he had for a beloved community and a commitment to making america live out its ideals we have sustained a great loss in america a great loss in the congress in the united states he was called the conscience of the congress he was the conscience of the country at 23 speaking to all of america about in 1983 coming together 63 excuse me coming together and treating people not based upon the color of their skin as martin luther king said but on their character and on that conduct john lewis was a great great great american and a great human being and i know he was deeply important to you personally and also to your family a great story about meeting members of your family yes uh i took my granddaughters and i took a great granddaughter with me on the faith and politics and at a program a pilgrimage to montgomery to birmingham and to selma on an annual basis and we went to mississippi as well and we i traveled with john lewis to south africa and was in nelson mandela's jail cell on robin's island with john lewis what an extraordinary moment that was two extraordinary human beings nelson mandela and john lewis leaders on behalf of the best that is within us leader hoyer uh we are deeply sorry for your loss and we thank you so much for being with us this morning but one thing i think we can all say is we are all better for having had john lewis walk on this earth um so thank you and and the people in my church would say amen i appreciate you being with us i want to leave every

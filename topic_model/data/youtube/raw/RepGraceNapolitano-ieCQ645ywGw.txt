mrs. Napolitano Thank You mr. chair and thank you ranking member DeFazio there was a hearing in Los Angeles with Jeremiah and Senator boxer not too long ago on transportation we very much appreciate that we must produce a very robust transportation highway trust bill it is a major economic recovery tool creats jaws provides congestion relief is the goods to market and pits people to work faster all committee members have agreed to 100 550 billion last year it's supported by the chamber by business by unions by highway and transit officials it would increase safety and public transit reduce congestion and reduce the freight impact on communities especially mine strongly support the inclusion of metropolitan mobility program that should address major bottlenecks in urban corridors especially an i5 in my district to santana freeway one of the most congested freeway in the United States with 25,000 trucks per day and of course I Alameda quarter East the 54 great separation crossings that cost delays through the eastern her Los Angeles and slows delivery two on top on time delivery to the rest of the nation we must include a program a deal with urban congestion ask as well as Freight improvement program the dedicate source of funding to address the effects of freight movement on communities and improve that mobility it the woman from the port's Los Angeles and Long Beach do I impact my district and its burden with traffic delays on the free reason they grade crossings the air quality for a diesel spewing engines the noise from the west and the royal cards are safety concerns on roadways and of course partly the road rage we must provide funding for grade separations and cleaner truck program to mitigate problems caused by Freight especially in those areas that have high concentration of these movements there are 54 crossings and as I said in my area and only a not even half were funded must increase funding for transit keep the cars off the road especially a mass transit buses and cars built get held up on freeways just like everybody else but mass transit would be very very much an improvement in Los Angeles and when it must provide some incentives one of the things that we talked about of the grants the TPA improvement of the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act the lowest interest bonds such as Build America Bonds the in that area I'm looking for information on how we can provide any of the transit companies looking for assistance from federal government how to produce a private-public partnership so that they may be able to move faster on these projects and the bill should streamline the environmental review program California is the only state to participate in the surface transportation projects delivery pilot program author writes and safety new it gives taste stringent environmental review standards and the ability to easily certify the NEPA in sequel once they have obtained their states environmental certification program very successful in streamlining the environmental review is speeding up project delivery for highway projects and we need to expand this program to transit and other transportation projects they should not have to do the work twice mr. Chairman I ask unanimous consent to include materials submitted by Caltrans director Cindy McKim and Los Angeles metropolitan transit authority director art Leahy with their public policy recommendations for the bill thank you both and I yield back the balance of my time

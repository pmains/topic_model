mr speaker let me uh thank the gentlelady from illinois uh it's a very very timely topic as we've seen what has transpired in our nation over the past several weeks it is incredible to me how fast this issue has moved over the past month but it always seems that it takes an horrific act in this country for us to wake up and realize that maybe something isn't right nine people at church study on a wednesday night not knowing their fate gunned down in cold blood by someone who actually said you know they were so nice to me i almost didn't do it but i had to last week in south carolina there was a monumental step in removing the confederate flag for from his state's capital where it had shamefully flown for 54 years but here in our nation's capital last week the republicans tried to go back to the future house republicans had to pull a vote on a spending bill because some of their members opposed a measure that would ban confederate flags from national cemeteries and when the democratic leader nancy pelosi presented an opportunity for republicans to do the right thing and immediately remove the confederate flag from the capitol grounds they punted south carolina the birthplace of the confederacy had the courage to do what the house or house republicans did not remove that dreaded symbol it is a symbol of incomprehensible hate a hate that manifested itself in a massacre since that unfortunate day one month ago we as a nation have been forced to look inward at who we are and who we want to be out of this immense grief of that dark day in charleston came a resounding call throughout our nations throughout our nation to remove the confederate flag and other symbols of racism and racial supremacy for many the removal of these symbols is a logical step in the trajectory of our nation a necessary action on the path towards a more perfect union for others calls to remove these symbols of hate are seen as attacks on the southern identity heritage and culture but arguing that the confederate flag is a symbol of southern pride celebrates a single homogeneous culture it means listening to only some voices at the expense of others it means ignoring the african-american experience throughout our nation's history from the dark period of slavery to the civil rights movement to the present day according to a report by the equal justice initiative 3 959 african americans in 12 states were killed by the terror of lynching between 1877 and 1950. 3959 americans lynched if we are going to refer to the past in debate over the confederate flag certainly we need to take all of this into account the confederate flag has always stood for racial supremacy and bigotry and if we are to realize our nation's promise of justice and full equality we cannot embrace this symbol eradicating symbols of hatred violence cruel oppression steeped in the racism is a critical step to confronting prejudice in our society now we have all heard complaints that this debate does not matter that removing confederate flags and other symbols of hatred is a distraction from the larger problem facing our nation such as rampant gun violence i agree that significantly more must be done to address racism and persist persistent inequality in our nation i agree that we need meaningful gun reform from expanding background checks to reducing unchecked online ammunition purchases i agree that we need to create jobs reduce wealth disparities and expand educational opportunities but symbols matter legitimize public opinion and in doing so entrench attitudes and beliefs at the same time they create a meaning shape actions and connect us to one another and just as a symbol can connect us they can tear us apart and mr speaker as i go to my seat as i was talking to my staff the other day about this and how much we were happy to see that flag lowered the symbol is gone but the sentiment remains and with that mr speaker i yield back

Thank You chairman Adler and Thank You chairwoman bass for bringing us together and for bringing forward this powerful piece of legislation at a time when our country desperately needs it I thank all of our witnesses today I pray that our words and our actions will be worthy of this moment if anybody has a doubt as to systemic racism in this country as to inequality based on race in this country you can look no further than between me and my friend and colleague mrs. Macbeth I'm the mother of three white sons I've never had to have the talk you were the mother of beautiful Jordan Davis you had to have the talk if you doubt there is races and look no further than the inequality of our life experience and I'm born with you my sincere sympathy to miss Underwood Jacobs and her family for the loss of her brother and mr. Floyd it is heartbreaking it is soul-crushing what we witnessed two and a half weeks ago as the depraved murder of your brother my sympathy is with you but more my words and my actions will be with you the world is watching MS Gupta I'd like to talk first about the issue of the national registry there's been some conversation about it and I remember the horror of Tamir Rice's murder in 2014 the anger that we all felt the dismay of a police officer who killed a beautiful little boy that police officer had been deemed an emotionally unstable and unfit for duty by the police department he had worked at before joining the Cleveland Police he never disclosed that information in his application the complete Cleveland Police never reviewed his previous personnel file before hiring him we must expect agents of government entrusted with the awesome response ability of protecting and serving but also capable of using brutal and deadly force to be hired under rigorous standards do we know how pervasive this problem is of not knowing the background of police officers as they are hired there are some registries that associations regional associations have created but there is no national registry of the sort that is being proposed in this really important legislation this is why it is high time that this provision and the Justice in policing Act be passed it's time to have a national registry that has this kind of information that could save lives and frankly also promote community trusts but this this national registry would have misconduct complaints it would have discipline termination records it would have records of certification it contains conditioning for for money for funds on from so that agencies actually have to put in inputs before they can access federal money but it is high time for this to happen I was talking this week with my own Attorney General Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania about the issue of a national registry he too supports that but I do know that he has also as Attorney General worked with and announced that he wishes to establish and have the legislature in Pennsylvania establish a state registry I think it's important that my home state is considering that should the tracking of disciplinary and performance records of law enforcement be left to the states alone is that sufficient or does it mean that we should do both if you just have a patchwork of states that do this and it's good that states are standing up because right now is a moment where people are demanding change and so states are beginning to take action but you will end up with a patchwork that will not be sufficient to actually achieve the bottom-line goal of having a registry that would be national that people move around they look at jobs and other jurisdictions and so it isn't enough to have this patchwork it's time for Congress to act and create a national kind of rubric for those absolutely and mr. Floyd I'd like to end with you to thank you for your strength for being here today we can't imagine the exhaustion the fatigue the grief but we are here with you in the world supports you I hope that offers you some consolation and your brother will be remembered worldwide for a very very very long time to come as your niece and his daughter said my daddy changed the world and he has and I'm confident he will but I'd like to give you an opportunity to tell us not about his death but about his life what did you know and love about your big brother what should we know about his life he was a role model for me and a lot of guys coming out the neighborhood because he was the first one to get a scholarship we all wanted scholarships and he was the first one because it was just hard we had to get either academic scholarship or you would get one playing sports but hey I got him a scholarship and it made everybody else feel like they can get one too he was a talented athlete yes I think he was a coach to people wasn't he yes ma'am he was a coach it's just just so much about him talking with a serious zero I don't know if y'all know him but anyway he talked to a lot of kids he went to a lot of different places met a lot of people he went to China played with a yamin against y'all me he did a lot of different things and he come back and he shared information with us and it's just it was excited to see him every time because he showed us so much just a big gentle giant and I took us to a lot of places we want our land went down there and watched basketball games he had a lot of friends as athletes and we just you know we just fived and he showed us that is other places in life besides being in the neighborhood

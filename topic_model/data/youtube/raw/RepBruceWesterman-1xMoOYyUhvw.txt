I thank the gentleman from Alabama mr. chairman there are currently 92 federal programs many of them duplicate programs in a poorly coordinated effort to fight poverty unfortunately this approach is built on the premise that compassion is best measured by how much we spend not by how many people we lift out of poverty over the last decade mandatory means-tested spending has increased 7.3 percent annually I want to emphasize that 7.3 percent annually consequently spending for these programs more than doubled from 369 billion in 2006 to projected 744 billion in expenditures by the end of this year mr. chairman we currently spend nearly thirty percent more per year on the war on poverty than we spend on our military according to the Congressional Budget Office mandatory means-tested spending is projected to increase by four point three percent over the next decade growing from 744 billion this year to 101.1 three trillion by 2026 as staggering as these numbers are they do not discretionary spending or expenditures by state and local governments mr. chairman over the past 50 years of poverty rate has held steady at 14 point eight percent in 2014 it was 14 point seven percent in 1966 we declared war on poverty and we lost because our strategy was flawed here's what we should do we've got to enact policies that create an environment for opportunity and we have to expect able-bodied adults receiving welfare to work or enroll in workforce training in exchange for receiving benefits work especially full time work is always the best way to avoid poverty a job is still the best social program and it always will be I support a better strategy to take on poverty as outlined in this budget regular resolution I oppose the old tired and ineffective model throwing more money at a broken system I oppose this amendment because it is an old tired idea and it's ineffective and I yield back to the gentleman from Alabama

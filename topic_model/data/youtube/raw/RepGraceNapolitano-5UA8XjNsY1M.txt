Thank You mr. Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all members have five legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my special order without objection Mr Speaker I bring to the floor a topic very near and dear to my heart and I rise today to recognize the entire month of May as Mental Health Awareness Month I co-chaired the Congressional mental health caucus along with my Republican colleague mr. John cackled from New York and we work to educate members of Congress and their staff on the work still needed to expand mental health access and protections and also to reduce the ever-present stigma the topic of mental health and Congress has and is building momentum in a spurring action to increase deliver mental health services something I have worked to do for over two decades this work alone our House mental health caucus has grown 47 members of Congress to 92 however mental health still affects millions of Americans of all ages genders races and remains were fully underfunded and misunderstood suicide currently plagues our veteran community roughly 20 veterans per day per day take their own lives according to the VA a 2005 to 2016 Department vendor's Affairs suicide data report found that the veterans suicide rate is 1.5 times greater than the non veteran population with over 6,000 veterans dying by suicide each year in the Hispanic community my own community approximately 1 in 10 individuals with mental illness use mental health services from a general health provider while only 1 in 20 receive such services from a mental health specialist machismo and other cultural tendencies are preventing our loved ones from being open and honest about what might be troubling them there is the stigma ranks high we must continue to let our loved ones know that there absolutely zero I reiterate zero shame in asking for help and that seeking support is a sign of strength we also have seen that one in four latina adolescent children I'd say children because they're still children report contemplating suicide a rate higher than any other demographic the increasing diversity of our country underlines both the need and the importance of assessing culturally and linguistically appropriate services 2018 election focused on healthcare and the future of affordable care a CA one of ACA s most critical success was increasing mental health service and delivery insurance companies for decades denied the United coverage for patients needing mental health services we inserted provisions to end this appalling service and make mental health an essential part of basic coverage including screenings and other preventive services together we made sure that no American is discriminated against when seeking mental health care and that mental health and substance abuse disorders are covered equal to physical illness like diabetes asthma and high blood pressure and other illnesses as we head into 2019 these reforms and the ACA must be strengthened so more Americans seek life-saving care they need we must also continue to look at what is being done locally to support access to mental health services in 2001 Pacific clinics a provider nonprofit and I started a school based mental health program with half a million seed money from sansa substance abuse and mental health the program began in three middle school and white high school the schools were very reluctant at first because of the stigma connected to it and Figg fear of being labeled crazy schools we kept pushing forward and the program has now grown to 35 schools with a waiting list this program serves the model for HR 1109 mental health services for students Act which would provide 200 million for one hundred school based mental health programs nationwide senator Tina Smith of Minnesota has also introduced a Senate companion Senate bill 1122 and we are very great for her for her support I we knew that if we started early with children we could help them succeed and save lives but stigma remains a big barrier preventing many parents from getting their children the care they need we all need to continue sharing the message that it's always okay to seek help if we address issues early we can help students and their families succeed in and out of the classroom in Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in the County Department of Mental Health they have been instrumental in the success of this program the department mental health from LA County took on funding the program when Samsa funding ended in 2009 success seeing the success of the program supervisor Barger and Janice Hahn in January 2019 directed the Department of Mental Health to identify funding and to develop countywide plan to provide school-based mental health services County white means to 14 million people in April 2019 the Board of Supervisors formally adopted a plan to provide funding for pilot sites to hire additional mental health professionals and to develop a mental health first aid pilot program that would educate students beyond stigma reduction and educating loved ones of warning signs and symptoms we need to ensure that we have a reliable workforce to be able to deliver life-saving services to all in need regardless of their zip code there is a national shortage of trained mental health professionals in the California future workforce Commission has stated that without dramatic policy changes California will have 41 percent fewer psychiatrists 11% fewer psychologists marriage and family therapists clinical counselors and social workers then if needed by 2030 recognizing this I along with my colleague mr. Kashkari introduced HR 24 31 mental health professionals workforce short loan repayment Act of 2019 my mental health co-chair is wonderful in this sense and I thank you for that the bill would expand the mental health workforce by providing loan reimbursement to mental health professionals who commit to working in underserved areas our work continues but it can't be limited to this Congress or any other Congress I encourage all to get involved educate yourselves and share resources with friends and family if you see somebody that has fallen on hard times reach out help them out and if needed refer them to mental health service provider together we can continue to build a movement and eventually live in a world where there is no stigma or it is very much reduced mr. chair I now yield to my friend mr.

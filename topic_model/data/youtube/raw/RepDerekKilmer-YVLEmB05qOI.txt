Thank You mr. speaker earlier this week the Pacific Northwest at America lost a true legend Billy Frank jr. the chairman of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission made his mark on so many people and so many issues Billy Frank's legacy on civil rights issues on ensuring America lives up to its tribal treaty obligations and protecting our natural resources has touched generations past and present when Billy spoke you listened we saw that firsthand just two weeks ago when he commanded a room at a tribal summit in my district that included tribal leaders and federal officials and the Secretary of the Interior after recent meeting with Billy I was walking to my car with member of my staff midway there I said just hold on for a second he asked me what was up and I said can we just take a minute and appreciate the fact that we got to spend a few hours with an absolute icon I will treasure those hours the entire time I spent with Billy and the extraordinary work that he did for our region there's a Native American proverb that says we should make decisions with an eye toward how they will affect our children seven generations into the future Billy Frank was the embodiment of that ethos and he will be missed Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back

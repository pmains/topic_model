now is texas congressman tony gonzalez he represents over 800 miles of the u.s mexico border and congressman it's great to see you this morning thanks very much for being here good morning maria so what do you think is is joe biden's administration going to reinstate romanian mexico i know that a court federal judge has told them they have to reinstate this plan but when i speak with my border sources on the ground at the u.s mexico border they tell me he doesn't want to do it we're not going to do it we're not expecting him to do it they think he's going to continue to blow off the law what do you think i think it's good news that the binding administration is finally looking at the trump remaining mexico policy that worked i think that's a good step in the right direction this is also about house leadership house republican leadership under kevin mccarthy and steve scalise the house republicans have pushed hard on this remaining mexico policy but we can't stop now you know we got to make sure that they do roll it out you know we've had over 100 uh members of our caucus go to the border you yourself were at the border to see it firsthand we need to bring democrats to the border to see it as well the remaining mexico policy is only the start of many policies that worked under the trump administration that need to get reinstated yeah so it sounds like you think that the administration will in fact do this they will reinstate this trump era policy i do think they do i think they'll do it because they have to do it you know just in del rio i was on the a call yesterday with the del rio border patrol sector chief and uh and he told me that they're having a thousand apprehensions a day so while we're not seeing the tens of thousand haitians under the bridge like we did nothing has changed so they are going to have to do something the remaining mexico policy is a good start well it's an extraordinary situation myself and my team have now been to el paso mcallen and del rio we went to the border three times and every time we went we saw it getting worse and worse congressman you are introducing a bill that would help reimburse farmers for damage done to their property from illegal migrants i spoke with ranchers during my trip to the border back in october and i heard firsthand their emotional experience with migrants on their property watch this i want to get your reaction how do you protect yourself i have to carry a gun all the time is there anything you want to say to president biden right now and here we understand that there's people coming in that that want a better life but there's a better way to do it than the way that that it's happening down here and and we shouldn't be afraid in our own homes we live in the united states of america congressman i don't know if you saw this but this is a couple that i spoke with on their ranch a big guy he starts crying in the middle of the interview telling me that he can't even throw out the garbage without holding his pistol they are getting damage done to their property every uh you know most days during the week and it's all the got aways these are not people who are apprehended these are people who got away they get to uh to strangers ranches and they just do what they want on the ranchers until they get a getaway car to go into houston and beyond yeah john paul yeah john paul schuster uh that gentleman in in your your clip is a is a farmer and rancher there in that area and and sadly farmers and ranchers have just been had have had to take the bulk of this crisis you know they're seeing water lines getting cut that have to get replaced fences destroyed not to mention the safety part of it you know having to carry a gun around just because you don't feel safe in your own home i'm excited you know my my colleague stephanie bice from oklahoma and i introduced this piece of legislation you know ralph norman from from south carolina is leading up the uh the border the the border um task force border patrol our border security task force so we're going to be rolling out more uh legislative solutions the bottom line is the house republicans have led on this issue and we will continue to lead on this issue because everyday people like john paul shuster everyday ranchers and farmers need help and you've seen it firsthand by the way congressman i i was told i spoke with one of my border sources yesterday and he told me that there are 400 000 new people in houston because that's their first stop they they get a getaway car uh because they get these ads advertising on tick tock and other social media sites looking for a getaway car they get the getaway car and that person drives them to houston and the biggest business in houston right now are fake documents they're just having huge money making opportunities making fake documents for these illegals is houston feeling very different to you right now have you been to houston recently it it is and you know what it is and it's not only houston it's dallas san antonio as well uh el paso has also been sucked up into this this chaos uh what you're seeing is the the cartel has expanded beyond its borders and is now going to uh these uh urban areas and they're recruiting folks to to help with the human smuggling you know you were in your validity when you made that trip just just passed about or just uh southeast valley is a little town called de genis uh when i was out there a couple of weeks ago kind of making my way through i stopped at a gas station to get gas and there was a person next to me with tattoos up and down all over his face and his body and this is a small little town in texas this guy clearly was not from there that's what these towns are having to deal with every day and it's scary i know that's one of the telltale signs of some of the cartel members they have tattoos all over their face and all of their bodies is a generalization it really is but at the same time we know that that is uh indicative of of the cartels and the biggest cartel that's operating right now in that area i believe is the gulf cartel anyway we've got a lot to say about this tony gonzalez thanks very much for your efforts and

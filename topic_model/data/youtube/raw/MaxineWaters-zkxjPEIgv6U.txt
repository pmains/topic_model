Earth's let me say to mr. Jones I am just so sorry about the loss of your son I thank you for being here today and to mr. Brown I'm pleased that you survived but I'm so sorry about what you have had to go through and what you're still going through wit and mr. stone and all of the families I'm just terribly pained about the loss of all of the personnel in the harm that has been caused in what I think will be the greatest ecological and geological disaster in the history of this country I wanted to spend some time with you mr. uncle aid to talk about the history of the black oyster forum is down a fisherman down there but I want to pass over that for a moment because BP is here today represented by mr. Willis saying all the right things about what all they're prepared to do and all the responsibility that they're going to accept but I I can't trust that I can't trust that because of the history of a BP that we have learned about since this disaster has taken place over the past two decades BP subsidiaries have been convicted three times of environmental crimes in Alaska and Texas including two felonies it remains on probation for two of them it has also received the biggest fine for willful work safety violations in the US history and is the subject of a wide range of safety investigations including one in Washington state that resulted in a relative minor 69,000 alla fine but 13 serious safety violations at his cherry point refinery near ferndale Washington as a matter of fact a review of BP's history shows a pattern of ethically questionable and illegal behavior that goes back four decades bp's best-known disaster took place in 2005 when an explosion at its refinery in texas city near Galveston killed 15 workers injured 180 people and forced thousands of nearby residents to remain sheltered in their homes an investigation of the explosion by the u.s. Chemical Society and hazard Investigation Board blame BP for the explosion and offered a scathing assessment of the company it found organizational and safety deficiencies at all levels of the BP Corporation and said management failures could be traced from Texas to London it goes on and on and on the company eventually pleaded guilty to a felony violation of the Clean Air Act and was fined fifty million dollars and sentenced to three years probation the Occupational Health and Safety Administration assess BP the largest fine and OSHA history 87 million after inspectors found 270 safety violations that had been previously cited but not fixed and 439 new violations BP is appealing that vine but bp's legal and ethical problems go back much further so we don't trust you we don't trust what you say we're watching what you do and I want to tell you that some of us are dedicated to the proposition that we're going to see that the people and communities that have been harmed get compensated and get compensated generously and that we're prepared to do whatever we have to do to make sure that that happens and i want to tell you further as this disaster has occurred when you first set up your claims offices and you're here to talk about claims mr. willis and you're talking about what you did you didn't have a claims office that was in the minority community and in this village that mr. uncle a comes from here today they had to fight for that and we also know that there was some attempt to have people sign settlements rather than claims so we don't trust you and I want you to know that in addition to the lack of trust that we have we have people that we've had to organize who have organized themselves to come here today to be of assistance to mr. ankle aid in this testimony we had to we Minister Edwards you know he has to get all involved in this mr. ankle a son-in-law had to stop what he's doing get all involved in this young turn is out of New Orleans that we've been working with because we had the same kind of situations where the small people were not being taken care of after Katrina that have been working with this situation and they do it as volunteers you aren't paying for any of that as a matter of fact did you ask mr. callate how he got here today Halliburton BP any of you rich corporate guys do you know who paid their way here today how they got here and the people that accompany them would you ask them after this committee and would you hearing and would you offer to be of assistance to them so that these these these people special miss ankle aide who is lost ninety percent of his income all of it would you assist him and reimbursing him but the money that he's had to get pay out of this pocket and all of those that accompanied him we have to tell you that we want to see better efforts and better work if you want us to believe you when you come here why do we have to keep struggling and fighting is it true amazon kool aid that you all had to go and fight because you had to travel 300 miles to get to the claims office yes Caillou ah smallest yes that is true we had no claims we had anything and it's something that I think BP still doesn't understand you know food stamps and welfare is fine for elderly people that are home that cannot support themselves that's living off a five hundred dollars a month these fishermen work hard they have boats that values in excess of 100 some thousand dollars they have oyster beds their work bet it and everything I don't feel I should have to go up to a food stamp office to get food stamps to support my family for something that was out of my control I had no doing with this was some other someone else to put me out of business and and and and I say you know we live in a country and I love dearly I'm a veteran and I know anywhere if we did harm to any country or any citizen in another country we would have to pay the United States government would take care of that family just as we have done in the past and and what I'm saying is no I'm sorry we are proud people food stamps and welfare belongs with people that cannot feed or work and take care of themselves we are proud people mr. Willis I just reviewed your claims process and I understand that people are calling in they ask for certain information and they don't send the claims adjuster out they ask two people to come in then to the claims office and you're basically giving five grand or to twenty five hundred dollars but what about is that some kind of temporary holding compensation until there isn't an assessment on of the total damage that has been done to the individuals how does that work okay I'm happy to answer your question representative waters and I wanted to start by just saying that in Louisiana alone of the claims we've paid over sixty percent of the monies that have been paid out to date over sixty percent of the 35 or so million that 37 million dollars has been paid in Louisiana we've paid a toast tell me how the claims process where all the claim process works we have three ways that the claims process can be accessed it can either be accessed through our 1-800 number which is 1 800 4400 858 that numbers availing four hours a day seven days a week people can go online and file a claim at ww BP calm forward slash claims or they can walk into one of our claims offices as I mentioned in my testimony we have a total of twenty-four claims offices open to date nine of those in Louisiana we have one in Venice we had one and point to a hash I know where they are how do they work the way they work is you go into an office and if you're a boat captain or a fisherman you bring in a tax return if you don't have a tax return you can bring in payroll check stub for a month you can bring in deposit slips you can bring in boat tickets or shrimp tickets or fish tickets anything that shows how much money you make for a month what we've tried to do is not put a cumbersome process in place when I got involved in this and I'm when you bring in all your documentation and it's agreed upon how much money can you recieve you will be fully compensated for your losses but what we've done representative waters in order to expedite the process this was a process that was initially going to take 40 45 days to get a check into someone's hand we can do it in 48 hours now and what we've done is bias the process towards getting run into people quickly five thousand dollars for boat captains $25 for deckhands will pay though you have this amount that you give it's a temporary and expedited process and then the rest will come along absolutely and in what length of time it's going to come along as we as we continue to evaluate the process you're not going out to do the adjustments how do you figure out whether or not these claims are authentic we will be going out to do the adjustments but what what I'm going to do that before you get the rest of the money from it's an ongoing process what I was most concerned about what BP has been most concerned about is getting money into the hands of the people who are hurting and been hurt by this oil spill sooner rather than later yeah but see here's here's one of the problems you can call your number and they will ask you for your social security number they will ask you for a few other things they will give you a claims number then they will ask you to come into the office you'll get the 5,000 or 25 but if you've got problems you're 18 on 800 number 1 800 573 249 it's not a 24-hour number and this is where we run into problems you run into problems because people are trying to follow up to find out when the rest of their money is going to come what are the documentation they have to have what do they have to do but this is where you're going to have problems why isn't that a 24-hour number also it is the number for the claims line 1 805 738 2498 am 28 p.m. not 24 hour numbers on follow-up number that number is not a 24 and why don't you make it a 24 hour and I will definitely do that well let me just a make sense feminist I wrap up with the road home program from your beloved state your Louisiana there's still people who have not been compensated the system bogs down and it literally ignores small people all people who don't have money to go get lawyers to fight the bureaucracy and that's what we want to avoid some of us are far away from Louisiana but we care so much about these issues we're coming we're going to follow up on it just as I walk through your claims process I'm going to knock on the doors of the claims adjusters I'm going to come I'm going to follow up to make sure that these people are compensated these small fishermen these black fishermen these are sufficient we've been doing this for years and third and fourth generations they got to be treated fairly and we want to make sure of that Transocean I'm suspicious of you too you have dodged paying your US corporate taxes by locating in headquarters in Switzerland you know you can't be trusted and aside from that I want the Honorable Jim hood to tell me about what have you filed are you trying to limit liability in the way that they have found mr. hood Transocean filed in houston texas and action to try to pull in as many people as they possibly could be filed a consolidation action before another federal judge in Houston Texas to try to consolidate as many as possible we states and that includes Florida some of the Republican colleagues will recall bill mccollum was a member of this honorable body as an attorney general and Florida running for governor there and I assure you that every one of my colleagues won't have our case is heard in our state courts and not be pulled off by some of their actions before some judge in Houston Texas so we've asked thats there be some amendments to some legislation to prevent that those are procedural amendments they're not some ex post facto problem we believe that it would relieve the state's having to fight for 20 years as did people that were victims of the exxon valdez spill thank you so much mr. chairman i appreciate the extra time that you have given me but that this gentleman has a legitimate concern in that amendment that he's asking for and as chairman i will take your leadership on that but we gotta watch Transocean okay thank you

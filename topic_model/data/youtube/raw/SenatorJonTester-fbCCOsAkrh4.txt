senator tester thank you miss Chairman I want to thank you for being here today mark appreciate your coming in I hope this isn't the last time we see you in front of committee I know this is approaching five hours so it's been a little tenuous some mental gymnastics for all of us and I just want to thank you for for being here Facebook is an American company and with that I believe you've got a responsibility to protect American liberties central to our privacy Facebook allowed a foreign company to steal private information they allowed a foreign company to steal private information from tens of millions of Americans largely without any knowledge of their own who and how we choose to share our opinions is question of personal freedom who we share our likes and dislikes with is a question of personal freedom this is a troubling episode that completely shatters that Liberty so that you understand the magnitude of this Montanans deeply concerned they are deeply concerned with this breach of privacy and Trust so you've been at this for nearly five hours today so besides taking reactive steps you know I want you to be as concise as you possibly can what are you doing to make sure what Cambridge oolitic analytic it did never happens again Thank You senator there are three important steps that we're taking here for Cambridge analytic ifirst of all we need to finish resolving this by doing a full audit of their systems to make sure that they delete all the data that that they have and so we can fully understand what happened there are two sets of steps that we're taking to make sure that this doesn't happen again the most important is restricting the amount of access to information that developers will have going forward the good news here is that back in 2014 we actually had already made a large change to restrict access on the platform that would have prevented this issue of Cambridge analytic a--from happening again today clearly we did not do that soon enough if we done it a couple of years earlier than we probably would be sitting here today but this isn't a chain that we had to take now in 2018 it's largely a change that we made back in 2014 there are other parts of the platform that we also similarly can lock down now to make sure that other issues that might have been exploited in the future won't be able to and we've taken a number of those steps and I've outlined those in my written statement as well appreciate that and you feel confident that the actions you've taken thus far where there was ones back in 2014 or the one that you just talked about about locking down the other parts will adequately protect the folks who use Facebook senator I believe so all those security is never a solved problem so all I need you talked about a full audit of the Cambridge analytical systems can you do a full audit if that information is stored somewhere of some other country senator if right now we're waiting on the audit because the UK government is doing a government investigation of them and I do believe that the government will have the ability to get into the systems even if we can't if information is stored in the UK but what if it's destroyed some other country what if the information is stored in some other country can is an audit even possible well senator we believe a bunch of the information that we will be able to audit I think you raised an important question and if we have issues then we if we are not able to do an audit to our satisfaction we are going to take legal action to enable us to do that and if and also I know that the UK and US government's are also involved in working on this as well I don't I don't really I'm telling you I have faith in the US government I really actually have faith in the UK to I there are been claims that this information is being stored in Russia I don't care it could be stored anywhere in the world I don't know how you get access to that information I'm not as smart as you are about tech information and so the question really becomes and I got to move on but the question is I don't see how you can perform a full audit if they've got stuff stored somewhere else that we can't get access to that's all maybe you have other ideas on how to do that well I think we'll know once we get in there whether we feel like we can find to get everything just real quickly senator Schatz asked a question earlier about about data and who owns the data I want to dig into it a little bit more you said and I think multiple times during this hearing that I own the data on Facebook if it's my data yes and and I'm going to tell you that I think that that sounds really good to me but in practice let's think about this for a second you're making about 50 billion bucks a year on the data I'm not making any money on it it feels like you own the data and in fact I would say that the the data that was that was breached through Cambridge analytic which impacted it correct me if these numbers are wrong some 80 million Americans my guess is a few if any knew that that information was being breached if I own that data I know it's being breached so could you give me some sort of idea on how you can really honestly say it's it's my data when quite frankly they may have goods on me I don't I don't want him to have any information on me senator when I say it I own it I can stop it yes so senator when I say it's your data what we mean is that you have control over how it's used on Facebook you clearly need to give Facebook a license to use it within our system or else or else the service doesn't work yeah I know in this license and brought have been brought up many times a day and I'm going to be quiet in just one second mr. chairman but the fact is is the license is very thick maybe intentionally so so people get tired of reading it don't want to look mark I appreciate you being here I look forward to having another here Thank You senator young it's

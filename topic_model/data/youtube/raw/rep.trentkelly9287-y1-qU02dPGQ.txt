madam Speaker is we remember the first Thanksgiving when settlers broke bread with their Native American allies and shared fruits of their harvest I rise today to thank our nation's farmers as Thanksgiving approaches and we prepare to enjoy the holiday meal with our families I would be remiss if I did not take time to thank the Americans whose labor allows us to put food on our tables along with our military our farmers are the hardest-working most skilled and patriotic citizens in our country they rise before dawn and work long after dust to ensure our nation can feed and clothe the world our urges body depth owed his commitment to our farmers by passing the United States Mexico Canada trade agreement and ensure American agriculture remains the strongest and most competitive in the world I hope my colleagues will join me today in giving thanks to America's farmers during this Thanksgiving season with that I yield back madam Speaker

these are amazingly tough times for the United States Postal Service a business way down costs rising and a budget crunch that has left officials considering some truly drastic measures Lisa Sylvester's once again here she's joining us with more on this crisis that's going on right here in the United States what's what's it all about yeah that's right well if there is in fact a congressional hearing tomorrow on how to save the US Postal Service the agency which does not rely on taxpayer funding is in dire straits it's on the verge of defaulting on a five billion dollar payment it's supposed to make to its retiree health fund the Postmaster General says he knows how to close the budget gap but he needs Congress's approval the US Postal Service is projecting a nine billion dollar deficit for this fiscal year the agency is asking Congress to take immediate action beginning with lifting a mandate that requires the postal service to make billions in surplus payments to a retiree health fund without the legislative change the Postal Service will go into default we sat down with Postmaster General Patrick Donohue who explained what this will mean on September 30th if we do not have relief from that fund we will not be able to make a payment of 5.5 billion dollars of the federal government we will pay our employees and we will pay our suppliers because we're going to continue to deliver mail but for how long the reality is email and electronic bill payments have taken a heavy toll on the postal service to close its budget gap the Postmaster General also is seeking congressional permission to end saturday delivery to close 3,700 postal locations to let go of a hundred twenty thousand employees and restructure workers health benefits there is strong pushback from the Postal Workers Union whose contract includes a no layoffs clause and ensures generous health care benefits the American Postal Workers Union calls the cost-cutting proposals a reckless assault on the postal service and postal employees Senator Tom Carper chairman of the subcommittee overseeing the Postal Service says something has to be done we do not think the Postal Service could literally closer up bouncing up against their 15 line of credit limit and if we do nothing then they'll of packing run out of money if Congress changed the 2006 law that requires the Postal Service to fully pre-fund the retirees health fund that would take off some of the immediate financial pressure the Postmaster General says his agency is the only government entity required to fund retiree health benefits 75 years out but getting Democrats or Republicans in Congress to agree especially with a looming deadline of sep tember 30th is not very easy the Postmaster General and the head of the Postal Workers Union they are going to be among those testifying at tomorrow's hearing well they're gonna have to do something there's no doubt about that Lisa thanks very much

congresswoman may say listen we've come a long way from the original 2.2 trillion dollar price tag which obviously was some sort of a feeler uh but it's so intriguing to me because it feels like republicans are warming up to this bipartisan effort and it's the democrats who seem to really be pushing back what are your thoughts absolutely when i heard nancy pelosi's remarks just now on your program her saying that democrats are not in lockstep that they're not all in one just last week the house had its markup its committee hearing on transportation infrastructure where republicans were not allowed to pass any bipartisan or nonpartisan amendments to the infrastructure bill so i have huge disagreement with the speaker on this right now but i am encouraged i do feel encouraged by senate the senate that's uh got republicans and democrats coming together they've come up with a plan for 973 billion dollars in spending and most of it looks like potentially is on infrastructure not art and sculptures and landscaping or high-speed rail in nancy pelosi's backyard but real infrastructure projects and that's what the american people want need and deserve yeah i think right now our infrastructure gets a d-minus from the american association of civil engineers so you're right everyone wants it every politician talks about it everyone promises it and it always seems like low-hanging fruit except when you attach a lot of things that maybe are designed to re-reimagine america so uh this bill that this this this what you consider more than if it is pure infrastructure which we all want really more of an investment than spending and if that's the case how do you ultimately pay for it because i know that republicans are going to stand firm on no new taxes absolutely and there is a way to pay for it there are trillions of dollars in unspent covered relief funds i talk to states and counties every single day that have more money than they know what to do with the money is out there so if we take that money let's say one trillion dollars in coded relief money that has not been spent we can do enormous good with that in an infrastructure package and that's the way you can do it without the largest tax hike in american history that's the way to go so in the last week we've gotten uh reports on inflation in this country they're shattering records so people are concerned even at 1.9 trillion that went through earlier this year helping to goose up inflation everyone's feeling it and a lot of people according to mama for over 70 percent of people are concerned about it how do you juxtapose that to any more spending any spending at all coming out of dc these these huge projects well we're and we look at inflation right now we're approaching levels that haven't been seen since world war ii groceries are going up over 21 percent gasoline fuel lumber is 381 percent up the cost to build a house costs 30 more today than it did six months to a year ago it is a problem inflation is taxation on the american people but spending is not just a democrat problem republicans and democrats have been at fault for this for decades it's gotten significantly worse in covid19 our debt is 28 trillion and counting the deficit is three trillion or more and we've got to hold each other accountable and without members holding strong in the house or the senate i don't know how we get it done but we've got to stop this how do you isn't the problem though because i think a lot of people really come to washington dc you're new you're still fresh and eager and you know you've made these promises but it feels like once they get there the lore of staying forever takes over and every any good intention they may have had is influenced by that so it's all knowledge becomes bringing home the bacon bringing home the bridge to nowhere and that's how you get reelected how do you resist something like that well it takes people with character it's not only that it's also staying in power the more money you have the more power that you have and i see it every single day you see people you know they're intoxicated with power and you see new members sometimes like they're being uh they're they're a deer in headlights sometimes and they don't know what to do and then they go back on their promises it's really important to the american people now more than ever when it comes to fiscal policy that we put our money where our mouth is that we live by the rules that we enact on everybody else and so if congress is going to have the highest tax hike on corporations and small businesses well guess what congress should be taxed just the same and if that were the case they wouldn't do it yeah and by the way that 28 trillion and counting we're going to hit the cliff we don't know where it is but we are going to hit it at this rate i want to switch topics for a moment the supreme court siding with the catholic foster agency 9-0 that was the decision against the city of philadelphia now the city had tried to ban the agency because it excluded same-sex couples what do you make of the decision well the first amendment of religious liberties should be protected in this country and there are many plentiful foster homes and foster services around the country that uh have varying opinions that are not religious based and so i think it's really important that we do protect religious liberty in this country we protect the first amendment and allow folks to go through the proper agencies to do those adoptions or to foster children it's important to have those protections in place for everybody

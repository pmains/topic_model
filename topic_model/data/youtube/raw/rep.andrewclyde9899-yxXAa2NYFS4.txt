telling about all these flight delays and everything else trying to get back to normal I I have Congressman Andrew Clyde the Democrat Republican I should say George he's going to kill me for saying that um but he is one of these was going to look very closely no doubt at these delays and the problem here and the issues with the FAA so if you don't mind sir I'd like to get into that first with you um because this is going to require some oversight it's going to require some new questions how we got in this position what do you know now and what do you want to see well Neil thanks for being on or let having me on I'll tell you we are concerned as to the real cause of what's happened here with the FAA and the flight delays um you know is this a Cyber attack uh is it not if it is uh you know we really need to look at heart offenses here and then you know what's the White House know in um in the transportation secretary as well uh and what are they not telling us I think that's really important here but the number one thing though is to get the airplanes back up in the air you know and I think that's happening I I hear to a man or woman on this issue Congressman that we're just not technologically where I guess by extension technically up to speed that we have many Antiquated systems now I know in that infrastructure package it was money allocated to uh the FAA and the airline industry itself to sort of get up to speed but we know in the case of Southwest Airlines that hasn't happened still early I know all the Jackson haven't been cast and the money's spent or committed but it is worrisome I agree it certainly is worrisome we need to have a a very safe no-tem system that ensures that aircraft are flying across the country as they should be in the passengers are safely getting from their origin to their destination and it's not acceptable what happened today but we're going to figure out what the issue is through the oversight committee and we're going to try and make sure that this never happens again now in the meantime speaking of oversight a lot of people want to investigate these classified documents found at Joe Biden's University what was his sort of home for these documents but not thought to be classified but um they the White House is insisting this is nothing like the Donald Trump Mar-A-Lago document situation what do you think well I'll agree it's nothing like the the Donald Trump situation because President Biden wasn't president at this time he was vice president he did not have the authority to declassify documents as Donald Trump had as president and you have to wonder this Penn Biden Center opened in 2018 uh and how long have these documents been there these are classified documents that were found in the closet of at the time Vice President Biden's private office so we've got a real issue here I think that the National Archives is going to have to provide information as to what's been going on between the current Biden Administration and them regarding these documents what did they know when did they know it when did the president know it and did the president know that these documents were there which I think he would have to know it's his personal office and his closet so I mean do you call you think this requires hearings how do you want to handle it oh I think it does require hearings it certainly requires investigation but you also have to look at number one not only the double standard but you have to look at the the possibility of the president being compromised the Penn Biden Center receives significant donations over 15 million dollars Anonymous donations from China so you have to wonder what did they get for those donations uh what kind of influence are they are they leveraging on President Biden those are all things that the oversight committee needs to look into got it Congressman you have your hands full congratulations again we'll see how things go in this busy New Year for you Andrew Clyde of Georgia

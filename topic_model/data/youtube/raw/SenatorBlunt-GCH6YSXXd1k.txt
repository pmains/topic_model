I think on that topic we will be putting together a bill when we come back so a month from now we should be in the final stages of getting that bill together we'll have more information than we have right now I've already asked my appropriating subcommittee that does the health and education and labor appropriating to begin to put a package together that will ensure we have more testing that we have continued to work on therapeutics and we have the money we need to move forward with the vaccine I think dr. Barroso said a couple of times in meetings he and I were in and so is the the others appear behind me that the most important thing we do to resume normal seats to get people back to school you're not going to do that particularly in a residential setting without millions of tests that people can take dozens of times that's very practical it's very possible we're going to hear in this Thursday with dr. Collins from NIH and the head of Barda the investing group and dr. Redfield from CDC to talk about how those rapid efforts moving forward will still produce safe tests safe therapeutics and maybe most importantly a safe vaccine and our willingness to move forward before we know that all of these are going to make it to the final stage of approval so that when we do have a final approval we have that particular vaccine already ready to get out and one of the things I'm going to talk to dr. Redfield about Thursday is after developing the vaccine the next thing that may be almost equally important is a plan to get that vaccine out quickly and fairly in a way that people will think the whole country is adequately and appropriately served by it we'll be doing that Thursday will be lots of other things this week and while we're home to collect the information we need to have that next kovat package in mind when we get back here and I think the timing is gonna be just about right for us to know what we need to know for a package that moves us into August September and October

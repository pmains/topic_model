to a member who i think she may represent more officers than any other district and she is always there for them congresswoman mala takas thank you leader and thank you to everyone who has gathered here today to honor our police officers i see not only a constituent of mine but i also see the president of the new york police department sergeants benevolent association vinnie valalong is in the back thank you for being here sadly in new york we have already seen eight police officers shot in our city that is already surpassing the numbers of 2021. so it is a crisis what we're facing in our city and unfortunately there are a number of policies that have been put in place that have led to what i believe the emboldening of criminals and i'm here today to not just remember our two fallen ones that we've lost in january we started off the year very wrong and we lost police officer maura and rivera but also to highlight what happened this week when a career criminal who had been arrested nine times was released back onto the street and shot a police officer thankfully that individual is dead but the police officer is alive the reality is is the laws that are being put in place in some of our states and our cities have led to crime skyrocketing in new york city we're seeing nearly every category rising since the 2020 bail law took effect then you saw the new york city council defund the police one billion dollars you're seeing a parole board appointed by our governor that has released over 16 cop killers in the last few years and you're also seeing a cop killer invited by one of our state universities to come speak so i know i speak on behalf of my colleagues from new york particularly those who are here and see claudia tenney and john cacco this is not just a plea for our local and state officials to make changes to protect our police to give them the resources they need to do their job to keep us safe but also to keep themselves safe so they return home to their families but it's also a warning to all the other municipalities and states that are looking to do the things that new york has done so let's be supportive about law enforcement that's why we're here today and we hope everyone will join us in making sure that our law enforcement have the resources and the tools that they need to do their job each and every day thank you [Applause]

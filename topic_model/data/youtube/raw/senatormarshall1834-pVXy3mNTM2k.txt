joining us now kansas republican senator and dr roger marshall rep okay senators good to have you on so we have also this fight politicization of antibody treatments republican senator tommy tuberville sent a letter to the hhs hhs secretary javier bisera saying what standards are you using to ration monoclonal antibody treatments to the states they were previously giving it on an as needed basis where the surges were what's your take on this story well liz it certainly looks like they're trying to prioritize moving that antibody treatment away from red states to to blue states uh we i don't understand where they're coming from the system was not broken it was working well this is the first time the administration has ever mentioned anything except vaccines as an alternative to taking care of this virus so one more one more crisis being created by this president so what happens now is the states have to go they have to get their state health department to turn to hhs and ask them for doses and then hhs doles it out we've got seven states including alabama florida and texas uh notably republican states we're told these new protocols would cut their supply the white house press secretary is saying this is about equitable distribution how do we know that more supply is going to the blue states they might does the blue states need them you know liz i'm not sure what they're doing when they mention equity uh they they're you you have to look really closely to what they're doing so i i don't i can't follow their math at all um certainly the we had a much worse outbreak in the southern part of the united states a month ago and now as that as this delta variant spreads across the nation they're going to need more of them further north so this is just this is the way this virus is acted from day one it attacks little areas and starts spreading those are the ones that need these antibodies you know senator um senator tommy tuberville's office said his office talked to drug suppliers they say there's no supply shortage uh shortages there he's worried about political bias and a lack of clarity and we have to also note that taxpayers are funding all of these treatments too so when you look at this where is your concern that this could turn political well i think it already has turned political uh when there's basically the president's taking on governors and the hhs getting involved in the distribution of this drug again this was a a a solution in search of a problem everything was working fine i was not hearing of any complaints from doctors or emergency rooms having access to this until the president and hhs got in the middle of this one okay so he you know the senators uh senator tuberville is saying he's worried about undue political pressure put on the states to comply with whatever additional covenant-related mandates that the white house deems appropriate i mean so what you know you when you look forward to this when you see more bureaucracy inside antibody monoclonal treatments when texas and florida is trying to ramp it up you know there's also this you know pushed by the white house saying get vaccinated there's a lot of unvaccinated people in the south is there anything that you're hearing about this when it comes to rationing of these antibody monoclonal drug treatments in terms of saying you know what we're not going to give it to you we're going to ask you to get your people vaccinated liz i i think that whenever there's mandates coming out especially a vaccine mandate you're going to just get lots of pushback we did a couple of town halls this past weekend i've never heard people more upset and more determined and on the other hand we have the opportunity for a booster shot for seniors which would save more lives than grade school high school kids wearing seven masks at the same time so the booster vaccine would be very helpful these antibody treatments are very helpful the this administration has never talked about natural immunity they've never talked about building up your own immunity they never talk about these treatments that are out there that work as well we've made great progress in this right now the white house should be focusing on getting those booster shots for seniors and drive down the mortality senator roger marshall it's good to see you come back soon coming up later the

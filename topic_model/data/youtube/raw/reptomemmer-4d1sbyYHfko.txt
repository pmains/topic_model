thank you chairwoman waters uh and thank you mrs lang for your testimony and your time today i'm going to try to be efficient with my time so i'd appreciate uh as concise responses as you could provide to my questions currently stable coins represent just five percent of the digital asset industry's total value it's a relatively small fraction but they stable coins are facilitating more than 75 percent of trading in the entire digital asset ecosystem quite significant clearly stable coins offer economic benefits that cannot be ignored stable coin transfers have nearly instant settlement and settlement can be confirmed by both parties on a public blockchain these characteristics lead many to view stable coins as less risky than the heavily regulated payment rails of our current banking system yet the president's working group report on stable coins focused almost solely on their perceived risks the report doesn't even provide a definition for stable coin but it does i it doesn't hesitate to assert that the risks of stable coins are so broad and across and cross jurisdictional lines that only insured depository institutions or banks should be allowed to issue them as you mentioned my colleague mr heizinga previously in this hearing you believe stable coins could be both a bank-like product as well as an investment-like product which is why you believe they should only be issued by banks i firmly contend that a stablecoin is a payment instrument and is a fundamentally different asset than an investment product if we base the evaluation of this report in this hearing today on a narrowly tailored definition of stablecoin i think we might come to see that a bank-like regulatory framework would improperly regulate the asset class and inadvertently capture potential future financial products that are vastly different than what you you and i think of as a stable coin for instance under this report a tokenized money market fund which clearly would be a security could fall under the same stablecoin umbrella as a fiat back payment token that is fully redeemable for cash how is it that such vastly different financial products could be both defined as stable coins and the only institutional players that would be able to offer these vastly different products are banks the reason i elevate this concern is because legislating and regulating in this space should not be done under such broad definitional scope and doing so would severely limit future market growth it's not unlikely that tokenized money market funds backed by government debt or commercial paper might seek to come to market in the future these potential future financial products could ostensibly lower the costs of participation in the asset class while offering conservative returns to investors ms liang do you think the same run risks and prudential risks would attach to stable coins backed purely by us government debt or highly rated commercial paper um i believe you're raising some important issues about how quickly the technology is evolving and what the future of digital assets will be that that was a very specific question how about this do you think u.s government debt that underpins u.s government money markets fund market money market funds is risky i do not there is no credit risk there can be convertibility risks if they are risky or they aren't there's no credit risk okay so but there can be liquidity risk just in the being able to execute the transaction i have left mrs liang i want to thank you uh tokenized money market funds backed by government debt or highly rated commercial paper clearly would not impose prudential risks significant enough to reserve the issuance of all tokenized money market funds to banks this is important to highlight because there is a void in the market between stable coins and security tokens and a tokenized money market fund could provide an attractive low-cost financial product with conservative returns for this reason i'm working on a non-partisan legislation that would allow tokenized money market funds to come to market here's the bottom line banks should not be the only institutions in the ecosystems in the ecosystem with dibs to issue the potential array of financial products that the president's working group report simply lumps together and ties as a stable coin thank you i yield back the remainder of my time

welcome back to the show I'm joined now by congressman and House Homeland Security chair Michael McCaul thanks so much for being with us thanks for having a lot going on with you right now and here basically to discuss this legislation to create a digital security commission what can you tell us about this I mean obviously it's timely but I know you that you've been working on it for quite a while and what exactly would this entail well the idea for it that came about about a year ago I was talking to the director of the FBI Secretary of Homeland Security about the terrorists ability to use Indian encrypted apps to communicate since that time we saw the garland attacks where that was used and also the Paris attacks where they used at an app called telegram to essentially communicate in what they call dark space so this dark space phenomenon is really the genesis for the the Commission idea in terms of how can we deal with this issue if we can't see those communications in advance even if we have a court order then how can we stop a pair of style attack in the United States we saw just recently yesterday Isis with the video I declared its intention to carry an appearance style attack in the United States so we think the Commission is urgent it's necessary the apple iphone case happened to subsequent to this but it just raises the complexity and relevancy for this idea what exactly would the Commission look like from whatever had sixteen members on it and just kind of who that would be made up of and I know that this has gotten bipartisan support so far right Senator Mark Warner is on Senate Intel is a tech entrepreneur has joined with me introducing just drafted very similar to the 911 Commission we believe that this digital security issue is so complex and so relevant that to get the best and brightest minds together to advise the Congress on what action we need to take and it would be comprised of stakeholders from both the tech sector so high-tech privacy advocates from two federal law enforcement state and local law enforcement and the intelligence community all sitting down at the table to provide solutions to the Congress do you think you know I know that there have been some privacy groups that have had some concerns just about privacy and whether this would cater to law enforcement what would you tell them to get on board and to you know calm those fears well each each stakeholder has an equal representation at the table so you know when I talk to law enforcement they have the same concerned about privacy sitting at the table but the fact of the matter is they need to sit at the table together to work out these problems right now they're talking past each other this will force them to sit down and mandate a consensus and a resolution and potential legislative solution so it's gotten broad-based support as you said from both tech community from law enforcement the intelligence community has been supportive and a lot of outside groups as well so we we feel very optimistic you mentioned the Apple FBI fight over access to data on that locks phone from one of the shooters from San Bernardino do you think Apple should have to cooperate it's a very complicated issue on one hand and I was a federal prosecutor you have the FBI with a court order dead terrorist phone that has evidence on it that could lead to potentially another suspect and so it's a very serious issue when you talk to Apple they will tell you that they designed this device so that it could be broken into it secures people's private data both health care and financial another data so that it can't be opened up and the only way it can be opened up is that they develop special codes to hack into their own device and expose and create a vulnerability in their product that will have ramifications globally and then their concern about countries like China then taking these codes and breaking into phones over there so it demonstrates the complexity of the issue and I think why this commission is so necessary in so relevant uh you know do you do you try to fast-track this kind of how do you move forward especially in an election year and trying to get this passed quickly well I think the good news is because are getting the broad-based support both in both chambers of Congress and both parties and from all the stakeholders and then we anticipate under the Secretary of Homeland Security is expressed his support as well so I think this may be one of those rare moments where we can actually get something done on a very important issue starting with a bipartisan people trying to get it in place so maybe there will be some hope there I also wanted to talk to you about your book failures of imagination the deadliest threats to our homeland and how to fort them title kind of explains it but what can people read here and what did what did you try to get across in this book well is based on the 911 Commission's findings that 911 was really caused by a failure of imagination I'd be able to see the fact that airplanes can be turned into cruise missiles against our interest and so what I try to do is have an honest dialogue with the American people about the real threats we face as a nation we create fictional scenarios and what I can serve you the deadliest threats and then a fact-based almost like textbook on counterterrorism but world that I live in and then a policy a piece on how we can stop these threats from happening in the future both Islamist terror base to cybersecurity chapter 2 mr. Putin and his a gray Jeff taking all the top threats I see globally and putting them into but people say what keeps you up at night this is kind of all those books that everything keeps me up at night it's not exactly a bedtime story but but I do think it's a public service value to the reader and all the proceeds go to wounded warriors and their children do you you know think that a lot of people in your community have read this and have taken to heart some of the things that you're trying to address they have it was number one on amazon bestseller under national security i know a lot of policymakers have read the book numbers Congress people in the intelligence community in law enforcement so i think it's a you know it's it's an interesting read and the the fictional scenarios I think get the attention of the reader as to what could happen if we don't change our policies and some of the rhetoric just while I have you here wanted to talk just about the campaign trail some of that's dealt with national security somewhat immigration and some people have said that it's frightening to some extent of what some of the candidates have said do you think that America would be less safe with Donald Trump as president look you know whoever the nominee is any of these candidates I think they're going to need advisors on national security which I consider be the number one issue facing the nation my book was a counter-narrative to the administration's false narrative if you will about the threat level because I think a lot higher than what has been telegraphed and so whoever it is is going to need really top national security advisors on how to deal as commander-in-chief whoever is going to be is going to be in charge in the military in charge of the intelligence community apparatus and homeland security in a very dangerous world that's becoming more more dangerous in my estimate so yeah just the rhetoric help things I I think in some ways this hyper beams that part of the world and helps Isis with their recruiting so I we always have to be careful that what we say because they are watching they're listening to us congressman Michael McCaul thanks so much for being with us a back and talk more about this commission as proceeds we appreciate it we will be right back you

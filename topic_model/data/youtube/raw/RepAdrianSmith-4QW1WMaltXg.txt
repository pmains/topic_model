thank you uh mr brady and thank you to our guests i can't think of a two uh are a better duo than uh senator graham and mr kudlow thank you for joining us here today uh this is such a timely topic uh but uh the discussion that i think we're about to have is just is absolutely key for the future of our country uh you know just for emphasis i know that kevin just mentioned several of these but let's just go over for emphasis uh some of the major points of the tcja tax cuts and jobs act uh you know that lowered their rates and a large gave a larger standard deduction to help so many american families lowering effectively lowering the the tax burden for so many american families section 199a to bring parity to the tax treatment of small businesses compared to large corporations uh a competitive competitive corporate tax rate i mean this is something uh that even president obama recognized is that we needed to be more competitive to put an end to the inversions that were happening on a regular basis overwhelmingly regular basis especially compared to the time since we passed the tcja a repatriation has been very effective to get companies to pay taxes on their profits that were parked overseas and so so much of this as you know led to some some good solid economic growth not not a sugar high for our economy but steady growth that added to wages added to economic growth added to i think a prosperous future for so many americans obviously the pandemic got in got in the way of that in large part i'm just glad we were on strong footing before the pandemic i can't even imagine if we went from an obama economy straight into the pandemic what's what it would have uh what it would have been like but i'm i'm so concerned about the democrats proposal of president biden's proposal to increase taxes you know their so-called american jobs plan uh it certainly makes it clear that their goal of tax increases isn't even about maximizing revenue it's it's to pay for for government programs you know they want to do what they can to increase revenue i think although some of their policies will actually decrease decrease revenue but it would seem that their goal is to explicitly remove capital from from corporations and small businesses so that they can redistribu redistribute all of these funds to groups that they that they favor politically i think we need to be very careful of something like that because i i think it backfires i think it will cause shrinkage in our economy and certainly uh less opportunity for the future uh but look look at capital gains alone to double the rate to almost 40 percent now we know that that creates lockout that it will actually generate less revenue very reasonable people across the political spectrum uh would agree that uh doubling that rate will actually lead to less revenue from uh from capital gains so i i just think that we want to avoid these terrible policies that have been proposed uh obviously i represent an agriculture district but i know it impacts districts across america and this repealing of the of the stepped up basis there's uh there are studies that show that it would generate about a hundred thousand job losses uh because of this uh money grab by the federal government and i i i'm discouraged that the democrats seem to be opposed to family-owned businesses that for some reason the the structure of a family-owned business they they think is not right and yet i i would hope that and i think folks across america would agree that we want to keep these businesses whether it's in agriculture whether it's in real estate or other industries across our economy that it's a good idea to keep businesses in families especially when multiple generations have worked so hard and already pay taxes and so many other forms to keep that business going and create opportunities for for their own uh employees uh future so thank you again uh to our panelists and for everyone joining today it's certainly a timely discussion on a very timely topic thank you back

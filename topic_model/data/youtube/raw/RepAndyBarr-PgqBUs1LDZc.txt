chairman and as my friend mr meeks focused on urban banking deserts let me uh ask a few questions about rural banking deserts and in particular the decline in de novo charters since the financial crisis de nobo formation has slowed significantly there were 181 charters granted in 2007 but between 2010 and 2019 fewer than 10 new banks on average opened per year more than half of the counties in the united states saw net declines in the number of bank branches between 2012 and 2017 these declines in bank branches disproportionately hit rural communities the negative financial impacts on rural counties of bank branch closures closures are perpetuated by continuing difficulties due to burdensome regulations and other roadblocks of de novo community bank formation these trends leave residents of rural counties without access to much needed financial services and also have negative downstream impacts on those communities i'm trying to remedy that by introducing today the promoting access to capital and under banked communities act which would encourage formation of new banks in locations where bank branches are scarce it would give de novo banks more time to meet capital requirements and ease other regulatory burdens on new community financial institutions mr brooks i i share in mr luke meyer's praise of your service at the occ enjoyed working with you can you uh tell us what some of the biggest roadblocks are to de novo bank formation well um thank you congressman barr i very much have appreciated our relationship and your mentorship and guidance so thanks for the opportunity i would just begin by saying as in many things um process in government is everything and so when i first arrived at the occ and looked at the bank chartering process uh the process flow involved in doing that involved something like 58 steps i'm making that number up it was a huge number of steps where multiple committees had to review charter applications more than one time and that was just one of the three agencies that charters banks so i think part of the problem is that we have to streamline the process by making clear how one gets a de novo charter and making clear what the timeline expectations are for getting those things approved even just inside of the charter of the occ the second thing i would say to this committee is we have an incredibly complicated process where three different agencies have full discretion over whether to approve or not approve banks because once you have a national bank charter approved at the fcc you still need deposit insurance approval and nowadays the federal reserve is exercising extraordinary oversight over whether something has been approved by those two agencies should be allowed to become a fed member that's why it took varro bank nearly three years from initial approach to charter grant and we can't have the kind of system we have in the 80s and 90s if we're going to take three years to charter every um bank so i share your concern that finding ways to shortcut that process not in not in the sense of shortcutting important substantive requirements but shortcutting bureaucratic red tape which takes an enormous amount of time for a good purpose is really important the other thing i would tell you is in rural communities you know fintechs are the main source of credit in certain respects if you want to get a mortgage for sales kentucky you're not going to get it at a local branch what you're going to do is find it on lending tree and that's why it's more important that those companies be encouraged and regulated so that they can deliver those services more effectively in places banks don't have branches well that that's good feedback i will note uh a recent study from the fdic that citizens in rural communities are more likely than people in urban or suburban areas to visit bank branches um obviously you you mentioned uh some online opportunities of course rural broadband is a is a challenge for uh mobile banking um i've introduced bills to combat both of these issues but the problems have been exacerbated by the pandemic is there anything else we can do to increase access to the banking system for rural populations so i would say congressman that um consistent with the bill that you're introducing today we need to have a concept kind of like a cra type of concept where if you are serving an underbanked community there needs to be a fast track to approval and i think you and i have talked before about the fact that there are there are rural communities in kentucky and mississippi and other parts of the south where the nearest bank branch is 75 miles away so the only way you're going to allow those things those local community leaders to form new branches is if there is a fast track option and we should see that as community reinvestment real quick mr brooks in my final few seconds can you address professor johnson's analysis that a non-depository national bank is an oxymoron yeah yeah look i mean i mean in the in the national bank act uh deposit taking is a power of a bank not a requirement it is a requirement in the bank holding company act but it is a power not a requirement in the national bank act my time has expired i appreciate the answers and i yield back

let's bring in louisiana senator john kennedy good morning to you senator good morning good morning so everyone's been asking when is she going to go to the border it's been 76 days since she was appointed as the border czar yet she's yet to go to the border and lester holt prester on it what do you think about her answer she said we have been and then he pressed and said no you really haven't been well i think most americans can can see what's going on here the bible administration believes in open borders they may say otherwise but most of the members of the bible administration that i've talked to believe that vetting people at the border is racist they they uh they don't they support legal illegal and legal immigration most americans support illegal immigration but they don't support illegal immigration but i think the reason the vice president went to uh to guatemala and and met with president uh jamatay is to offer him billions and billions of american taxpayer dollars to try to make his country better and with no disrespect but that's like giving um it's like giving whiskey and car keys to a teenager um president jamatay is an authoritarian uh he presides over a corrupt administration they're probably going to steal the money corruption is rampant the drug cartels work or run things and frankly president yamate wants his people to come to america because they come here they get through illegally they get a job and they send money back home which helps the gdp of guatemala now you don't have to be einstein's cousin to figure all this out senator i her answer was so inappropriate and so inadequate i think it needs to be underlined she said i didn't go to europe either and then giggles and then says we've been to the border no you haven't i mean it's it's as if she didn't pre-think it it reminds me when she was a candidate and failed so precipitously but in the big picture she they can't be happy with what's happening 170 000 people coming across the border military base is being converted other structures being put up money is coming pouring out in one way it's a simple answer to say they want open borders but i think it's more complex than that are they just incompetent no i don't i i thought at first they were but but i'm convinced now that they believe in open borders and in in some uh part it's because some members of the administration just just think they're sympathetic they want they think anybody wants to come to america should be able to others take a more cynical view it's about votes and power uh it's dangerous i can tell you that we have people from all over the world not just nicaragua and guatemala and el salvador we have people from all over the world trying to make their way to mexico so they can come in the united states of america and we don't have the slightest idea who they are what they're going to do when they get here and that's uh that's not a very prudent way to run an immigration system i don't know anybody else in the world who does it that way except the united states of america

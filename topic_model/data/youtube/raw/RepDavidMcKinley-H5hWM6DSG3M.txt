and uh pair is now pleased to recognize mr mckinley for five minutes uh thank you madam chairman um and uh dr wilinski um speaking speaking of the misinformation being disseminated that kathryn mcmorris rogers brought up earlier my twitter account has been lit up during this hearing by people posting that trump president trump killed 500 000 americans so dr linski would you agree with that statement is that is that an accurate statement that trump killed 500 000 people uh thank you for that question representative i um came into this office in 2020 and on january 20th um and came into this administration on it's a yes or no uh dr wolinski is it did he did he or did he not kill 500 000 people i think the effect of this pandemic is multifactorial sure oh i can see whether this one's gonna go uh so dr fauci uh if i could turn to you since she's not gonna answer the question uh well on the campaign trail we heard time and time again from that then candid biden that the president's words have consequences then on monday the national review reported that president biden proclaimed that americans should wear masks until everyone is vaccinated now i'm not aware of any care professional expecting that 100 percent of the population will be vaccinated so dr patsy do you agree that that americans should wear masks you agree with the president that americans should wear masks until 100 are vaccinated you know i'm sorry congressman mckinley i i did not hear that statement uh and i pretty much follow what the president says i don't i didn't hear him say that everyone should wear masks until a hundred percent of people are vaccinated uh until everyone everyone is like he didn't say a hundred percent he said kill everyone well everyone is a hundred percent that's what i thought so too so i'll tell you what uh doctor i'll send you a copy of that uh it was on several news outlets uh about that but it first came it first broke on national review uh let's go back to try to get a straight answer from dr waleski uh dr winsky regrettably 288 children have died from covet according to the cdc and that's a tragedy by any measure but that number actually mirrors the annual deaths due to seasonal flu with children so at the beginning of the pandemic we closed schools and we understand that we didn't know the effect covey could have on children and teachers but now we know so the data suggests the spread of the virus is minimal in schools they use safety precautions even in communities with high disease prevalence and teachers are being vaccinated so college students can go in spring break and bars and restaurants can open up in full capacity but children can't go back to school and pilgrim and people cannot attend church services doctors communities and states are looking to the cdc for guidelines will the cdc be updating their school reopening guidance this week this week regarding giving the new data available uh thank you very much for the question we recognize the challenges of having children home i want to articulate that you know respiratory viruses frequently travel in schools and i think we we had we were cautious when we had a respiratory virus and we were worried like influenza that this virus might behave in the same way um we published operational guidance um to get children back in fact it was intended to have schools lean in to get their the schools that were closed open and we very specifically said that schools that are doing well should not close and so um now we have emerging science that looks at the three feet versus six foot rule thank you so are you going to be so i've got one last question that i don't need to be filibustered on dr fauci uh last summer while the pandemic was raging we also had social unrest unfortunately happening in the country thousands of people understandably were gathering to protest racial injustice the media and some public health that heralded these protests in fact twelve hundred people and twelve hundred public health professionals signed an open letter arguing that protests against systemic racism must be supported even at the cost of spreading the virus dr jennifer nuzzo of john hopkins said stated publicly quote public health risk of not protesting exceed the harms of the virus dr falci do you agree with that statement my stance has always been that we should abide by the public health measures that we talk about all the time which is avoiding congregate settings wearing a mask washing your hands so you would think that they maybe weren't justified i'm not gonna get it i'm not gonna get into the justification or not of who demonstrates about what i'm just gonna give you the public health measures that we talk about all the time and not get into the background or basis of a demonstration or not thank you thank you

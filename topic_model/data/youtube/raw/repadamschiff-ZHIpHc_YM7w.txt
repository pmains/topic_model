D BELIEVING THAT HIS OATH OF OFFICE CONFERRED ON HIM AT THE TITLE OF SENATOR AND A SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY. JOINING US NOW IS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA, HE IS CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. A MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6TH SELECT COMMITTEE AND WAS A LEAD IMPEACHMENT MANAGER FOR THE FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF DONALD TRUMP. CHAIRMAN XU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR SURE YOUR PATIENTS WITH THAT HISTORY LESSON. IT JUST STRIKES ME ON A DAY LIKE TODAY WHICH IS A HISTORIC DAY, AS YOU KNOW, IT IS A HISTORIC DAY. SUBPOENAING MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE LIKE THIS. TO SEE THE WAY IT USED TO BE AND TO SEE THE WAY ENFORCEMENT OF ETHICS, ENFORCEMENT OF WHAT -- KINDS OF THINGS ARE TRYING TO ENFORCE. WE'RE A COMPLETELY BIPARTISAN EFFORT IN THE HOUSE IN THE SENATE. >> I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU DID AND I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT FOOTAGE BEFORE. IT REALLY IS BREATHTAKING TO CONSIDER HOW FAR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS GONE FROM THOSE DAYS. MITCH MCCONNELL WHO COULD GIVE A SPEECH LIKE THAT AND THEN MORE RECENTLY, CALL IN A PERSONAL FAVOR WITH HIS REPUBLICAN MEMBERS, URGING THEM TO VOTE AGAINST A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION TO LOOK INTO THE FIRST VIOLENT ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL TO STOP THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. SO THERE YOU HAVE THEM, WARNING HIS COLLEAGUES, THAT WAS THEN TOWARD DO THE RIGHT THINGS, TO DO THE ETHICAL THING. SAYING THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THE ETHICAL THING. AND TODAY WHAT IS HE DOING. ? HE CALLS IN SHIFTS TO STOP AN INVESTIGATION TO JANUARY 6TH BUT ALSO ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION OF JUST HOW FAR THE GOP HAS GONE FROM THOSE DAYS WHERE ETHICS INTO MATTER, KEVIN MCCARTHY CALL RECENTLY LYING ABOUT WHAT HE WAS SAYING ON JANUARY 6TH. THAT'S NOT A SCANDAL. THE SCANDAL IS THAT IF HE WOULDN'T LIE HE COULDN'T OCCUPY REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP. YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO LIE ABOUT SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY AS WHETHER THE LAST ELECTION WAS LEGITIMATE, IF YOU WANT TO BE PART OF GOP LEADERSHIP NOW. THAT'S HOW MUCH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS CHANGED EITHER DONALD TRUMP. >> I WANT TO LISTEN TO JUST A FEW SECONDS OF KEVIN MCCARTHY ON THIS TAPE THAT WAS RECENTLY RELEASED. JUST TO SHOW THE KIND OF EVIDENCE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT. LET'S LISTEN TO THIS. >> THE ONLY DISCUSSION I WOULD HAVE WITH HIM IS THAT I THINK THIS WILL PASS. AND THEY WOULD BE RECOMMENDATION YOU SHOULD RESIGN. I MEAN THAT WOULD BE MY TAKE. BUT I DON'T THINK HE WOULD TAKE IT. BUT I DON'T KNOW. >> I SUPPOSE ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS FROM THAT TO GET MCCARTHY COULD BE, WHY SHOULD THE PRESIDENT, WHY SHOULD DONALD TRUMP HAVE RESIGNED AT THAT TIME? BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT EVIDENCE LIKE THAT, WE HAVE TO ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT WHAT KEVIN MCCARTHY DID THAT DAY, WHAT HE SAID THAT DAY. WHAT'S MORE ARE YOU TRYING TO OBTAIN FROM KEVIN MCCARTHY THROUGH TESTIMONY? >> WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DO KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS. BUT MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW, MUCH OF WHAT WE KNOW, WE ARE HERE SECONDHAND. AND OF COURSE, NO ONE WOULD BE BETTER POSITION TO TESTIFY ABOUT CONVERSATIONS THAT HE HAD WITH DONALD TRUMP THAN KEVIN MCCARTHY. AND INDEED, HE'S MAKING REFERENCE THERE TO WHAT HE WOULD TELL THE PRESIDENT. WHAT'S IN FACT DID HE SAY OVER THE PHONE WITH THE PRESIDENT? WHAT WAS THE PRESIDENT SAYING TO HIM ON JANUARY 6TH, WE ARE HEARING FROM OTHER MEMBERS AS WE DID EARLIER FROM -- BUTLER THAT THE PRESIDENT IRRITATED WITH MCCARTHY WHEN MCCARTHY WAS BEGGING TO CALL IT OFF SAID THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTACKING THE CAPITOL APPARENTLY CARE MORE ABOUT THE ELECTION THAN HE DOES. OR WORSE TO THAT EFFECT. SO THERE IS A LOT WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK MCCARTHY. THESE OTHER MEMBERS WE SUBPOENA TODAY, SOME ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED OR WERE INVOLVED IN SEEKING PARDONS. WHY DO THEY THINK PARTIES WOULD BE NECESSARY? OR WERE INVOLVED IN AN EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION THAT THEY -- JUDGE OF CALIFORNIA RECENTLY PROCLAIMED WAS LIKELY A IN CRIMINAL ACT VIOLATED MULTIPLE LAWS. SO THESE WITNESSES, CLEARLY CLEARLY RELEVANT INFORMATION. IF THEIR OATH OF OFFICE MEANS ANYTHING TO THEM, IT MEANS CELL -- SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY. >> I THINK WE BOTH KNOW SEEING HERE THAT OUR AUDIENCE LISTENING TO US RIGHT NOW DOES NOT EXPECT ANYONE WHO RECEIVE THE SUBPOENAS TODAY TO COMPLY WITH THEM. IS THERE ANY REASON THAT YOU HAVE A GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THAT THAN OUR AUDIENCE DOES? >> I WOULD NEVER WANT TO KISS -- YOUR AUDIENCE, LAWRENCE. BUT PART OF THE REASONS WHY AS YOU ARE POINTING OUT, THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SO IMPRESSIVE. IT'S NOT JUST THAT WE'RE DOING AN INVESTIGATION OF ALL ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL THAT IS OBVIOUSLY COMPLETELY UNPRECEDENTED IN TERMS OF STOPPING AN ELECTION RESULT. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN WE'VE ASKED MEMBERS TO COME IN, WE HAVE -- EVEN AS RECENTLY AS A RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION AND IT AT A TIME WHEN I BELIEVE IT WAS SHARED BY REPUBLICANS -- WE HAD A DEMOCRAT IN REPUBLICAN WITH RELEVANT INFORMATION. WE ASKED THEM TO COME IN. THEY BOTH DID. TO BE INTERVIEWED BY OUR COMMITTEE. THEY DIDN'T REQUIRE SUBPOENA, THEY DIDN'T TRY TO FIGHT IT. AND SO, WHAT'S UNPRECEDENTED HERE IS YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS POTENTIALLY INVOLVED IN A PLOT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. BUT ALSO IF THEY DO REFUSE, ALREADY TO REFUSE LEGAL PROCESS. THEY'RE WILLING TO BREAK THE LA

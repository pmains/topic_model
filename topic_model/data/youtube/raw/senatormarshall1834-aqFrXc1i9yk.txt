it is deadline day for federal workers to receive their final coveted vaccine dose in order to meet the bind administration's deadline of being fully vaccinated by november 22nd but while that's happening a federal appeals court put on hold the president's vaccine mandate for workers of large u.s companies so let's bring in kansas republican senator roger marshall he's a member of the senate committee on health education labor and pensions he's also one of the few physicians in the senate senator thank you so much for your time jackie great to be with you so senator you've signed on to this effort to overturn the bite administration's uh rule for uh this vaccine mandate your opposition falling under the congressional review act so what is your reaction to this latest ruling from the court well i think it's good news from the appeals court in louisiana and this is exactly why it's so important who we elect to to be our president so they can nominate conservative supreme court justices or as federal court judges in this case so it's good news i believe the federal government has until 5 pm today to give us their response and then we'll see where we go with this day but it's a great first step at the end of the day this is going to end up at the supreme court and we need the supreme court to do their job to protect our god-given constitutional rights and that we need them to protect our future and to limit the powers of the federal government so one of the big arguments that you make is that people with natural immunity should be able to turn down the vaccine and not be penalized for that but this bind administration order does allow for unvaccinated private sector workers noting private sector because it's not the same with the federal mandate uh to instead undergo weekly testing if they forego the vaccine is is that not enough of an allowance well it's certainly i don't think it is i'm telling you i could not get from my seats at the chiefs game last night to the hot dog stand without five or six people grabbing me and saying my gosh this federal mandate vaccine mandate is going to kill our company just the implementing of it will be a challenge if you could imagine you've got truck drivers all over the nation and certainly those folks that felt like that were heroes just a year and a half ago now they're being treated like uh you know they've got the scarlet letter on on their uh forehead right so we think it's very unfair and the uh the testing just is not a good fix for us but most importantly i think most americans and i think most people i'm not a constitutional lawyer i'm a physician but i've still read the constitution we think that this is a gross violation of our constitutional rights well and you're vaccinated yourself i know and you've spoken about that so is your um is your opposition more logistical then and then also do you have any concern that uh the efforts that you're making would undermine confidence in the vaccine uh among people who haven't received it when when you've received it yourself right so certainly i i support the vaccine but i do not support the vaccine mandates this virus impacts different people differently i've taken care of thousands of women with viruses and i've seen those viruses have different reactions on each one of those women this virus very dependent on what your age is your underlying health care condition and even the side effects from this virus seem to be very age dependent as well so it's more way more than logistics i think mostly that this is an unconstitutional mandate that violates our personal rights i'm doing everything that i can as a senator to stop it whether it's the the congressional review act or the legislation we're trying to use uh to stop the cr we're willing to stop the funding of the federal government if they want to go forward with this mandate so what do you believe the role of the federal government should be then in trying to encourage people to uh to get vaccinated without necessarily imposing some of these requirements that you think are more constricting especially considering that the you know the federal government has required vaccines for uh hundreds of years in some capacities when the administration often touts george washington requiring vaccination against smallpox in 1777. that's something that that they put out often so what's your take on what the government should be doing at this point yeah so i believe in the sanctity of the patient position relationship so the federal government should be given doctors and patients the data that they need to know they need to know what are the side effects from this particular vaccine it is a new vaccine there are reasons that people have legitimate concerns certainly we do not understand the long-term side effects of this particular vaccine and this new technology i think the worst thing the federal government could try to do though is is to shut this down people's throat this would be like trying to force us to take a new medicine as as well so i think the role the federal government is to uh give us good good science to follow the science you know and certainly in this case i think if they even would ign acknowledge natural immunity i think that they would be more believable there's so much data out there that would suggest that natural immunity is better than vaccination immunity but they won't even acknowledge that and certainly we need the federal government to be more consistent in what they are telling us all right senator roger marshall really appreciate your time enjoyed the conversation hope to talk to you again soon thank you jackie

now joined by the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security Texas congressman mike mccall congressman thanks for taking the time in joining us this morning as always we sure appreciate your time you recently said in the washington times that you believe that the administration's effort to counter this violent extremism especially on on social media lacks sufficient focus and structure only for people in the DHS for are focused on countering the ISIS messages in social media yeah I mean we've been investigating this you know with the Boston incident the garland incident and that I'm favoring see more more of these kind of episode this is kind of what set what Isis is doing over the Internet is activating people in the United States with Twitter accounts and acne activating them to kill people when its military installations or police officers or whatever and there are only four people assigned to this task at the Department of Homeland Security and yet now i got point of fact on this one so appreciate that and that we have millions of dollars going towards climate change within murphy know and and there's no line item budget for countering this homegrown violent radical islamist extremism what it's astounding let me ask you this so the the USA Freedom Act has passed out of the house and the Senate of course passes it out and it's now going to the president that we're collecting the data of citizens here you know American citizens we seem to have a big old team of people to do that the NSA and we're collecting American citizens data but but we're not countering the voices of Isis on social media we only got four people on that yeah we have some people in the FBI and I'm going to be meeting with on it and that a few minutes on now what they're doing about the threat to stop this and within homework Homeland Security get four people assigned to this you know this this is this to change and the focus needs to be on stopping these terror attacks inside the United States and that again the concern I have is we had to ramp up our security in our military installations just recently because of this this online internet friend coming out of Syria in other places in the world that were these recruiters are sending online called arms if you will but to take up arms against Americans and kill Americans and you know what happened yesterday in Boston right just the trend of what you're going to start to see I think I'm afraid and we're going to see more more in the future congressman hang on let me do a quick traffic and weather check when we come back let's talk a little bit about Boston what they wanted to do behead police officers also Pamela Pamela Geller was targeted in this I get your thoughts on that just a sec and we're back with the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security Texas congressman mike mccall joining us here this morning in congressman again thank you for your time so you you you look at the FBI had been watching this one guy for quite a while and then they had him under 24-hour surveillance and again I go back to this this USA Freedom Act that we desperately had to have and and everyone is so concerned by it was that you know did was it metadata collection a phone record collection that helped us find this guy was it just good old-fashioned police work because it's it seems like good old-fashioned police work to me well it's a ticketing some of the details of this matter on that open source but a lot of it was actually online that I communications that there it will pick up between these guys in Syria as I mentioned before hand the subject in boston and he also had a guy that he was on lining with who's trying to destroy all the computer records after the fact but yeah they're getting ready to behead the first target as you mention was Pamela Geller yet the Prophet Mohammed cartoon drawing contest leader right and they can't abandon that side they're going to start cutting the heads off of police policemen in Boston and they had a nice ceasing with that John jihad in Syria that a knife identical to his they were gonna use to cut off off the heads and so yeah the FBI did and homeland did a great job doing this one and just like garland they stopped him but you know how many more of these are we going to be able to stop for something happens it's seems like every week you know we're rolling somebody out either trying to go to Syria or someone who's activate online is getting ready to kill somebody say kill Americans we've been very lucky what's up what's the what's the solution we hear TSA is letting threw ninety-six percent of the red teams that have you know a fake bomb strapped to their backs oh that's certainly not stop at anybody I mean I we only got a couple of minutes what's the solution I got a freaking on that classified as well but that that that is like you know brilliant with all the money we spent to screen passengers and you know 95 96 percent well what's it what do you do with that don't you through yet through I mean he's right you throw more money at it I mean where do you start with this you know it's it's human error it's a technology issue you know some people say why do you even need this stuff but then you look at the threat environment where they're trying to still blow up airplanes and you know I don't want that on my head and so it's it you know it's it's not easy and what do you do about countering these violent extremism you got to put more focus in the priority in the administration to you know the best thing we could do is cut the head off a snake and that's in Syria if we can we could eradicate Isis in Iraq and Syria it having a strong foreign policy that eliminates of threat at its core so we don't have to deal with swatting flies over here the rather drain the swamp over there seems to me that's a pretty good idea but this administration is not willing to do that is that boots longer is that boots on the ground and more airstrikes you know you know like we need more I think you'll our Special Forces guys for to operate basis to take them out I've gotten rather use it what they call digitus force which would be you know the Sunnis that are there you me and you don't even touch murder you get the Iraqi National Army I was in Baghdad recently and the Iraqi National Army is totally incapable fighting Isis state they drop their arms and they run and so we're lying on the Iranians of all people you know the shim wishes to fight Isis and that that's a bad that's a real bad idea I think as well and so yeah I think we need more of a presence but you know don't take all the options off the table we need to train these guys better but we have a serious strategy and the rules of engagement for the air strikes I mean they saw these guys coming into Ramadi but they couldn't hit them because there s b0 collateral damage before they can fire one rocket at these guys congressman that's that's almost a how do you do that no so do you remember Air Force our air force our hands are tied by this president and this administration congressman we appreciate your time I know you got to get to a briefing and we sure appreciate your time this morning look forward to talking with you again and hopefully the next time we talk we'll have some some more positive things to discuss thanks come on free time that's true that's on that thanks for having these always you bet

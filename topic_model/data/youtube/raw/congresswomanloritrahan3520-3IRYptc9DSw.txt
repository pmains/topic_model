my name is nancy and i um reached out to congresswoman laurie jordan's office i reached out to lord john because i had i have a daughter out in california and i've heard that the supposed real id was going to be necessary for flying and i didn't want to be in a long line of people when other people made the same choice to take care of it recently retired so i had a little time to take care of it however i went into some calls and the problems that i felt shouldn't have happened so i reached out to the electronics office and i was like you're not going to really have time for this but i still felt anyone who ran into a lot of you shouldn't have to go through that much work to document themselves when clearly the documentation felt like it was complete from my perspective um i brought a copy of all the documents to vladimir who ended up working with me so vladimir offered to go with me the next trip to the register i was very amazed by how he responded to the registry folks there they had their notes that i've been in previously and i've never reached out before to anyone for support but i was amazed by the level of professionalism and respect i received as a citizen in needing help and getting the help and i was amazing you

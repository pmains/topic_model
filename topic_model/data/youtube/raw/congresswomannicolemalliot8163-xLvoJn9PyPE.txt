new york congresswoman house foreign affairs committee and house transportation and infrastructure committee member nicole maliatakas congresswoman in person it's such a pleasure to see great to be with you so the president has a plan yeah you know what um what's interesting is that this administration thinks that the american people are stupid that they don't know that it is the president's lack of leadership the disastrous appointments that he made early on the policies he put in place that stopped domestic energy production and have created inflation through as you mentioned earlier the 1.9 record spending on covid which by the way did nothing to stimulate the economy in fact it did make inflation worse and when you look at hundred twelve hundred dollars given with a to a family with one hand yet because of the printing of money in the inflation it's now costing american families fifty two hundred what did they actually gain in the end you give with one hand take with the other that's been the policy of this president he needs to ramp up domestic production as soon as possible and the most frustrating thing for the republicans is that you know democrats control everything in washington just like they do here in new york city and new york state we have solutions we've said let's streamline the permitting process let's ramp lift the president's ban on um an oil and gas production let's make sure that we are putting infrastructure investment into the pipelines to help this stuff move around the country and he doesn't want to do any of it gas prices have doubled in this since this president has entered office okay they try to blame vladimir putin but the reality is at least half of the increase was prior to this invasion yes russian invasion did exacerbate the issue but it did not cause the issue it was joe biden that caused the issue right this plays out over and over again it's the bite administration create a problem deny there's a problem and then blame anybody everybody somebody but themselves for that horrific problem and that's exactly how it's played out with not just the record gasoline and diesel prices but the overall inflation is that it's now it's you've even heard this from p buddhists well what are the republicans going to do about it well we we've introduced legislation to deal with it we want to ramp up domestic production so we are not relying on our adversaries we shouldn't be relying on russia or iran or venezuela and we could do it right here produce american jobs in in the process look for example this baby formula crisis what is a democratic answer to everything to throw more money at the problem they brought up a bill the other day to give the fda another 28 million dollars when we just increased the federal budget we gave them a one point 110 110 million dollar increase two months ago when the problem started and yet we still have fda people and agencies across the federal government that are working on pre prep you know covet levels covet staffing we need to get everybody back to work they have to stop you know sitting at home doing their jobs instead be at the forefront to resolve these problems and why did it take the president so long to get these manufacturers all at the table this could have been resolved streamlining the standards so we can we can also have importations in a crisis like this but getting that plant up and running it should have taken three months it's still not fully up and running right it's a testament to big government and bigger government is will will fill you and that increasing the funding of it and making it even larger makes it worse not better and one of the clearly one of one of the many uh crises in this country is crime and then we were talking about the national average for gasoline hitting a new all-time high today diesel prices hitting a new all-time high today but i also want to get to the new york city crime issue that shootings in may dipped but still remain double pre-pandemic levels in new york city and if you look at i mean i always have the the crime stats on my phone that i watch real um frequently so murder and shootings are down year to day but you still have burglary up 32 percent that grand larceny is up 50 petty larceny up transit crimes are up 54 so even though shootings are down overall crime is still skyrocketing here how does this how does this play out how does it get fixed well you know really what we need is the the politicians in albany the democrats that put in place that disastrous bail law that keeps releasing people back onto the streets we need to hold people accountable for their crimes the individual who shot that young goldman sachs individual on the subway he had 19 prior arrests so it's a combination of things it's you got to fix the bail law because nine out of 10 individuals caught with an illegal firearm or being released back onto the street fifty percent who actually shoot somebody are being released back onto the street here in new york city that's from the nypd uh detectives union they gave me those stats it's outrageous but it's not just those crimes you're seeing car thefts you're seeing robberies you're saying rape sex crimes they're they're all increasing as well as a result the other thing is we need better judges in our city look judges are either appointed by the mayor mayor de blasio did a disastrous job but they're also elected so the people need to pay attention to judicial races uh and last thing is uh we just need our mayor to put more pressure on the guys in albany to do their jobs and stop appointing horrible people to the parole board that are releasing people i and um do we liz peak is here liz jump in real quick i know that you're close friends with the congresswoman oh and nicole i'm so glad you're joining us this morning i think the new yorkers are desperate for better representation we're bet we're desperate for better laws law enforcement etc how do republicans make progress in against the democrat stranglehold in albany because we know what they're doing is been a catastrophe for this state yeah the bottom line is it's up to the people to realize that this is happening under one party democrat rule no republicans voted for the disastrous bail law no republicans in the city council voted to defund the police by one billion dollars is not a republican mayor who has appointed horrible judges that are releasing people back onto the street it's not a republican governor who appointed a parole board that is releasing dangerous people back into the streets murderers cop killers rapists all being released by this governor's parole board and i do think so chase boudin the district attorney in san francisco based on the polls will likely be recalled tomorrow he's the son of domestic terrorists from the weather underground and i think that that that's the beginning even the new york times is writing about the democrats are fighting amongst one another in san francisco but i think that this is it's a sign that it's moving in the right direction that the people regardless of who they vote for regardless of party when they have endured rampant crime and filth in the streets they stay enough and this is the enough and let's see if it happens here needs an one-party rule at the city state and federal level not everybody congresswoman nicole valiotaka it's great to see you thank you so much and you be safe be well and come back often me too thank you very much we'll be right back

della has a lot to be proud of as it turns out that every state has I'm sure a lot to be proud of but every other state has a national park in fact if you add up all the national parks and units of national parks across the country i think there's over 300 of them Delaware the first state the state the start of nation has no national park and it's not because we don't have have things that are significance for not just for our state but really for our country we have plenty first Swedes and Finn's came ashore in Delaware and so where was it 1637 sailed up the Delaware River the Dutch settled first type settlement is actually down in Lewes Delaware but that's I was an early early beachhead we have all kinds of things from underground railroad to Fort Delaware out in the middle of the Delaware River and gosh the DuPont company two hundred years ago setting up shop on the Brandywine River and creating those powder Mills but from one end of the state to the other we have a huge amount to to really to showcase in the show up the National Park Service realizes this and they've said they've worked with us now for a number of years actually started this in 2001 so this is so far an eight-year journey my hope is it'll be completed within the next next year and one of the one of the things that flows out of having a national park is to be listed on the National Park or website and go to the National Park website is my family did about six years ago we're getting ready to take our almost teenage sons and go off visit a state visit a national park and spend the summer and we started with the A's in the National Park website Alabama and all the way through the w's and we notice that 49 other states have national parks and units some of many national parks nobody no no listing for Delaware and there are literally millions of people who go to the National Park website every year not just in summer times but throughout the year sometimes they live in Delaware sometimes we live in surrounding states sometimes we live in America a lot of cases they live outside of our country and they're looking for a place to visit through when they come to to America we want to make sure that when they go to the National Park website they know there's a Delaware they know we have some great stuff that they'd like to see and to come and live not live in our state necessarily would stay in our state and I just visit for a day but spend days maybe weeks either I restaurants tanner hotels to get to know us and enjoy what is great about about delaware was really historically and culturally significant about our state the way that the National Park Service's is planning to set up a national park and receive a very unique National Park and I like to think of it as a bicycle wheel with a hub in the middle and the spokes that lead out from from the the hub to attractions that are already in existence and for example the hub National Park Service fell in love with a town of old New Castle they want the hob to be in really the presence for the National Park Service to be an old New Castle that's where the the National Park Service employees will be the they'll be there to talk to folks welcome people they'll be there to do this share with them ideas about places but they want to visit and if you will think of a ha bicycle hub in the middle and then the spokes leading out to attractions all over New Castle County Kent County and down as far as Sussex County people want to visit the riverfront go to the Russell Peterson Wildlife Refuge if you want to visit the Fort Delaware or fort dupont along the delaware river they want to visit that the any like fight where did the plant company actually get it stark and can we go to hagley and just really see all kinds of attractions in our state and they saw the idea it's folks laid out the attractions are already in existence they won't be owned by the federal government they'll remain in the ownership in which they're already as it turns out if you look at the economy of our state we're not as huge as dependent as we once were on manufacturing consolidation and manufacturing we're not that we're seeing a consolidation and financial services as well so how banks work i would have them but there's been a diminishment there we have biotech and we're glad that the biotech industry and pharmaceuticals are in our state but the tourism has become a major part of our economy significant part of our economy a lot of people come to the beaches they come to hagley and winter ter they come to to the riverfront they they come to dole to Dover Downs so but we want to make sure that there's another thing for them to come to intuit to visit and to help really coordinate the all the other attractions and that's where the National Park fits in it'll be a nice service to our tourism industry in our state bring more people to our state not just for a day visit but for for longer visits and Spence it's been awhile in Delaware

the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks another great episode with the best podcast ever and uh if you think that and i know you do because you downloaded this episode you download all the episodes but you probably haven't given the show five stars yet and i don't know why it's so easy and look i just like to have more stars i like to have more ratings i'm not really sure what it does for me i can't monetize this dang podcast so it doesn't really matter but i like asking you to do it so just please do it uh we got a great guest with us today john guydon john thanks for being on thanks for having me so john's a entrepreneur public speaker uh author um also documentarian yeah and um and the reason you're on today is because uh we met on a flight recently that's right and uh those the last flight i took before i went blind so that was yeah i don't know what you did to me but uh it was um we had such an interesting um conversation and i don't remember i think i remember how it started now um and i was i was a little confused at the time because i was like why is this a why does this matter and but but but you pointed something out and you pointed out that the the steward is so i'd been upgraded to to first class and you as well so we're both sitting together in in first class and i know everybody's like what you're supposed to you're not supposed to do anything nice because you're a representative whatever anyway like i'm so sick of hearing that um and and what you noticed was when the stewardess came to us she she took my order first and then yours and you're like you know why she did that and i was like i don't know um is it because i'm white and you're black like and you're like no it's because what you asked me what my status was and i said well i'm 1k it's the highest status because i fly so much i'm gold and you're gold and you're like they're trained to do that and that led down a whole new discussion and you actually and again i thought it was like i was like why are you bringing this up right now i don't i didn't get it and then you but you asked me to watch your ted talk uh you've done a ted talk and you bring up that same example so walk us through why that matters and because it's is it a silly example or is it is it meaningful and is it representative of of something deeper well it's actually very relevant and meaningful because all these types of things happen right and perspective is critical it's the one of the most important things about how you see something right your ability to see it that's vision but how you see it that's perspective how you're looking at a situation so in that example now that had happened to me a couple of years prior and i had no clue why it happened and it just so happens i was the only black person in first class i was the only black person you're the only flat black person there and you're the last one to get your order taken correct correct and and so one could go down that path and say here are the facts the facts are i'm the only person in first class fact true fact is i was served last in fact she they went out of their way to serve the other person because i'm in the aisle they're in the window so i saw how it worked and so when bad things happen what does your brain tell you the reason is for this and i think as a society we've gotten away from looking for all the plausible explanations for asking questions i asked the question i had the conversation with the person next to me he was wondering and his arms were crossed he's like how can you explain this without racism this is the challenge there's a white man i was sitting next to and he said how can you explain this without racism you're clearly you're the only black person here you got served last i said well let's find out i didn't know i had no clue but i said let's find out so then i asked i said hey just curious is there a reason is there a methodology you guys use to figure out who you serve and what order they said well yes and they explained that system and it's like that's representative of thousands and thousands of things that happen every single day where people may not and in a lot of cases if you listen to what's going on the media they don't look for other plausible explanations if it's if it's explainable with skin color we use skin color we're defaulting to race it is a very lazy and dangerous argument it is dangerous because it creates real resentment because if it is racism then there's truly nothing you can do about it so it also disempowers the individual to it to a great extent and maybe i don't know if everybody thinks about it that deeply but that's fundamentally what's happening that's that's where the resentment comes from because if it is race then there's really nothing you can do about it and you're just screwed forever um but it seems that there's political motivations i don't have political yeah definitely political motivations but almost societal motivations to make it about race um just think about the payoff right so first of all to your point there's there's actually two sides of this going on so it's more it's what's more damaging than saying hey you get a benefit because you're white saying that you don't because you're black or you or you that's that that is more damaging right to convince someone that that's the lens that they should be looking everything through but you know you mentioned something talking about you know if is it is it politically motivated is not politically motivated it's actually i think it in a lot of ways is financially motivated so you have lots of people that it's kind of like a doctor does a doctor make any money if nobody's sick and nobody needs help and nobody ever goes to the doctor no they it's not that a doctor is wishing people to be sick but it's just a fact of life people are sick all the time so because we've made an industry out of talking about race and fighting for you know advocating for things solely based on race if that gets better those jobs go away that opportunity goes away that that wealth goes away well this diversity and inclusion training critical race theory training anti-racism training is a multi-billion dollar industry but that's recent i mean that that's a recent phenomenon isn't it and so but but to your point the there is an incentive structurally culturally that has happened that i've pointed this out in my previous writings like why on earth would elizabeth warren lie about being a native american why would she lie about being fired when she was pregnant because victimhood pays and it does i mean to your point uh what it might pay in in terms of of societal hierarchy of status sure it might might pay financially in terms of this multi-billion dollar industry um it it might pay in in forms of of interpersonal leverage and argumentation against somebody uh and so and that gets to your ted talk i mean you the the name of your ted talk well hold on you it was changed what was the name of your ted talk that you wanted yeah so the the submitted title the intended title was why the race card has expired okay and when it was uploaded it i got a notification hey your ted talk is live i go to it and it says everyone has hardships like what is this i thought it was a clerical mistake or something so i reached out to the organizer hey my my title has changed she says well yeah they have the they have the right to do that i said okay i'm looking at all the documentation so typically they'll say you know we word smith a little bit because we thought it would be better for this reason or that reason they do have the legal right to change it right that's ted's right but there was no correspondence whatsoever hey i understand you want to change the title i even gave them a list of alternate titles yeah and i still did it right because because i want you know it was the spirit of the talk right i wanted people to say okay well what's this guy talking about and the whole thing's all played out plus i had a whole i had a game plan right book with the same title and the whole night and they just said hey your options are we can we can take the take the talk down or we can leave it as is that's it yeah but in any case so that's annoying it's kind of like um you know well it's a lame title it is lame and nobody knows what it means like it it's you'd get a lot more views with your title than you wanted everyone has hardships who wants to i don't want to watch that and also that's not a that's a it's a very lazy point to be making that's not the point you're making i mean it i understand how they came to that conclusion but the sort of lazy wave your hands look everybody goes through something yeah kind of but you know it wasn't in the spirit of the time yeah it's not not that i mean you're talking about leveraging people through race and so so walk us through your talk um and the highlights of it what all right so uh look first and foremost you know i encourage everybody to go watch the talk um if you have uh if you have young children that uh are are fans of santa claus i would hold off on watching the talk until you screen it first so yeah spoiler alert santa claus is not real and he says that in the talk but otherwise it is a very i think it is good for young children to watch it's it's it is the talk is is very pg i mean oh yes just to be clear it just also says scan a class isn't real i don't want to yeah i don't get a bunch of hate messages like you know thanks to your thanks to your talk like you ruined the magic i had one more good christmas yeah exactly no i don't oh well you know my wife ruined christmas for one of our kids and then i was like well great you can watch the talk now and so she watched it and loved it but uh yeah so basically it is it is if i some if i summed it all up it's i want to acknowledge that racism is real but i also want to say that the way we're using it right now right playing playing the race card and i specifically define playing the race card so there's no confusion of what i mean when i say playing the race card and the definition is when a an outcome or a discrepancy is explained solely by the color of your skin solely by race without without considering other options first just jumping right to that if that's if you say if if we walk down the street and you give me the cold shoulder it must be because it's a phrase if you give me the cold shoulder you're a racist you can't you know you're racist you you can't just be a jerk you can't just be this and that's it period what one example that's often talked about um but again mostly by white people like the guy sitting next to you on the plane right this is i don't know if it's mostly but it's it's um you know if we see if somebody sees you on the street they're more likely to cross the street or they're more likely to get nervous if if you're in a in a in a 7-eleven with them and you're more likely to be discriminated against by by either the teller or other customers and and i always wonder well doesn't it depend on a number of other factors like because look the way you're dressed right now uh with uh with a sports coat and a collared shirt i don't think it's possibly true that anybody would feel threatened by that now there might be some who are again truly racist people i guess who just like can't even be around anybody of a different race look i'm not these people exist for sure but um i i've actually never met them but i'm sure they exist but it depends on how you're dressed i mean like what if you're what if you're just completely differently what if you're dressed like i don't know hoodie over your head i mean what's what do you what do you say to that how do you even talk about that without getting in trouble these days i don't know that you can but it depends on a multitude of factors it depends on the multitude factors i say this all the time if i'm walking down a dark alley and i see me walking across you know walking across you know walking towards me i would cross the street and i'm me right it's just it's common sense if you see a if you see a pit bull it's 120 pounds you're a big dude so maybe that's also why yes right there's other factors of play i'm a big dude and but what if you saw what if you saw you wearing a suit well again it depends yeah where am i what time is it sure a lot of facts there's so many factors like are they i mean are you carrying groceries like yeah exactly what is what position am i in do i feel i mean i i think about that all the time right just defensible situation you know it's like being in krauts or at a restaurant all these factors play into things right i want to sit here i want to sit there there's so many factors that go in and this is what i'm talking about right it's like when we more than one thing can be true and oh and typically always is more than one thing can be true at the same time and so there's a lot of ands and people aren't thinking about the ans they're just picking the laziest the laziest most obvious thing saying it and we're done so tell me about the santa claus debacle and why why kids are not going to be mad at you so santa i mean look i when i was a kid i bought into the whole santa claus thing obviously like most kids like most kids i was so smart i didn't right no no i did yeah like for the first time devastating to learn santa claus wasn't real i swear i saw him i was uh well i have to tell you about uh the time i played santa claus i was really funny so i i bought into the whole thing right the whole narrative i was a little skeptical cause one year i asked my dad i said because we didn't have a fireplace and i said well we don't have a fireplace so how did santa get he says oh no and it's a slider you know it's a sliding door that's why we leave it cracked and stuff and he was talking to him later he's like i'm just making up yeah santa figures it out santa figures it out yeah so so i said okay great now fast forward i have a christmas and for me it was a great christmas i you know i but i saw a kid that i knew he told his mom to shut up that's like you for sure that's gonna put you on the naughty list if that doesn't put you on the naughty list what does super rude to his mom right i think he took a little swat at her told her to shut up at the grocery store i'm like this is he's for sure gonna get cold for christmas and when january comes around we come back from break everybody's talking about the gifts they get this kid he got the most gifts at any kid there it was overwhelming how many gifts that he got and i i was confused i'm like wait a minute i didn't get i i wanted some of the things that he got i didn't get it though so i'm like what did i do wrong and i'm thinking about this and you're young and you think okay well what are the outcomes you know so what what are the possible things well one is maybe maybe this guy's not real that's a that's a that's an option or maybe he is real and because i grew up in in southern california and i moved you know i was born in compton but then i moved to orange county and it was majority white neighborhood so i was the only black kid in my class again so as a so i'm thinking go maybe he doesn't like me because i don't look like the other kids maybe he doesn't like me because i'm different those are my choices either he's not real or he's racist what else can we come to and that's where the santa claus thing came from oh god yeah because santa claus you're right because when you think about it the the whole notion of santa claus is a pure meritocracy you know based on based on your standing on the naughty list is the kind of gifts you will get it is martin luther king's dream period right it's like it's not based on anything else it's like nice naughty the whole nine you're good you ask what you get for your dreams come true i'm like let's go this is a great system i'm all in that's that's an interesting story to how you decided and then uh analytically claim came to the to the conclusion that santa claus does not exist and um it's because there's no way he can be he could be racist well again that was it that was that was an option still still an option yeah i deferred to my dad oh okay i deferred to my dad i'm so grateful that he chose to kill the magic as opposed to how would you send me down to seven so send me down a path that's about right for killing the magic you know what i mean down this path of ridiculousness where i now look at everything through that same lens because it is dangerous and i even myself i i there was a point years ago where i where i was caught in the cycle and i'm sitting there man this is and it would literally drive you crazy and and so how did you get to houston super random literally traveling for business uh traveled here several times i've got some uh some old teammates that live here in the area but uh we travel here for business because you played football i did for for university of colorado okay yeah the buffs go buffs yeah and so i would travel here and whenever i traveled here i felt at home uh the southern hospitality when i when i when i experienced that i i knew i was like that's that's me that's that's who i am period so i went home and we were in colorado at the time and i told my wife i said hey i think we should live in houston yeah and she laughed and then we left then we looked at housing prices and she laughed a lot less yeah and then we started doing some research and we said okay let's take a trip and we took a trip and that was it yeah texas the place to be well okay since we brought out football though can we can we hit another sticky subject on all the sticky subjects annealing for the anthem and uh like my take on this is well obviously i don't like it um i don't like kneeling for the anthem and but but i think it needs to be unpacked a little bit further than that and i think my main if you think about the main problem with it because on the conservative side of the aisle we we sometimes jump to i think the wrong points and and the wrong points in this case is that it's disrespecting our military and our veterans people have died for the flag and i'm like i i don't see that to be honest um well it gets sticky because a military you know allegedly somebody in the military is the one who made the recommendation that he do that that is true yeah with kaepernick that is that is true now i don't know where that military guy was coming from on that that was a i think a stupid suggestion to give to kaepernick but but that is true and so intent matters um an intent matters when assessing anybody's behavior i think and and actions but the thing is is kaepernick in particular has contradicted himself many times on on why he's doing it um you know because because he has and in some ways said look i well he's never said he wants to disrespect the military so it's a bad point to make um from our side but he has said he's he he basically is doing it to disrespect it to gain attention my thing about it is is you're you're you're completely distracting from the issue that you say you care about and you're also setting no standards in place so you know if you can't answer the simple question at what point would you stand at what point is this flag worthy of your respect at what point is it worthy of your respect if you can't answer that then you're not really making a point you're you're making a point with no end in sight and that's frustrating and you've and nobody's talking about the issue you supposedly care about they're all talking about this debate about whether you respect the flag or not and this notion that kneeling is more respectful to the flag has always been the most absurd thing i've ever heard it's it's it's deliberate it's intended to make a skeptic a spectacle so that you pay attention to what they have to say anyway that's what i hate about that is you know what i hate about this whole thing is sports is supposed to be sports that that's one of those things where it doesn't matter what you believe what your religious background is what your political beliefs are you you come together and you know you come together and you rally around your team they rally around their team it's all in good fun and sports is sports it's the place that you outlet for that tribal warfare that humans need really really badly because we still have the same brains as the people who cheered to as they watched gladiators get ripped apart by lions same brain okay so we just we we've created rules we've created different stadiums and then we watch you guys just pummel the hell out of each other and it's awesome it was like yeah yeah go right that's we need it so we need to share it right and we need not ruin that and so i think that that's a you know i have the right to do this and it's like well if you worked at a if you worked at a company selling copiers and instead of being on the phone selling copiers or doing the all hands beating if you decided to to stand up for the venezuelan earthworms and that was your cause right what would your boss say to you would your boss say like no it's good yeah absolutely everybody do that let's get get some signs in here for the worthworms and all this like no i have a responsibility i mean i can i'm making a lot of phone calls i'm you know i can spread that word it's like are we are we paying you to talk about venezuelan earthworms are we paying you to sell copiers and yeah it just gets lost to the mix and it is it's dangerous for our culture when we can't share the things we always shared and we've politicized everything it's um common ground is very important yeah it is extremely important if you have no common ground then it's just this is just theater right even so just taking talking about pure politics right it's like do you think that that paul that politicians on the right and left have absolutely nothing in common are we really are we really is that really the narrative that we're selling that there's nothing there's nothing that they agree on there's nothing that can that can be and it's often often it is very little things very few things but but it's usually at least hey we like celebrating the fourth of july we like we like standing for our anthem we like watching sports teams we like laughing at the same movies you know that's where it came together is that common culture and it is the left it's not the right the left deliberately marched through those institutions and politicized them on purpose um to weaponize them for political motives and i don't think they care about the damage it does to the general psyche of the public it's it's very frustrating because i mean yeah we are very far apart look we just had a we were doing committee markup this uh this week and and republicans are just sick of doing it virtually we're just absolutely sick of it and democrats like no we need to it is just not safe enough and this tells me that oh my god like what when would it possibly be safe enough you're all vaccinated okay even if you weren't like the pandemic is it's such low numbers it's and the way we treat it now it's basically a variant of the flu you know there is no scientific basis for this fear that you're pedaling here and yet we can't meet in person to do to do the country's work on important it's really hard to do this stuff when you really need to have that back and forth it's hard to do it it's hard to even get what we're talking about over over these zoom calls and they're just like no we just i mean we just can't and it's like what the hell is wrong with you um it's it's really so and why is that risk assessment based purely on political lines and i guess the the point i'm making as it's related to what we're talking about is that every cultural question has become politicized there is no obvious reason why the the risk assessment with respect to the pandemic should fall on left or right political divides but it has really exclusively and i've done a lot of analysis on this to explain the psychology of it we don't i won't get into it right now but um it's it's just odd okay back to back to you though okay so in your ted talk you have a series of steps and it's basically analytical steps on how to think through these through these issues so what are those all right so whenever something happens right something happens bad happens even good happens you or just some sort of discrepancy right we're talking about a discrepancy and this is this was originally geared towards uh really just geared towards black people but i've had thousands of messages from women and other groups that say hey this works universally so that's kind of exciting yeah so the first so step one is to remove race from the equation so whatever happened right so it could be i you know whatever the same same thing with the same thing with getting served food and first class at the air at on the plane right it's like which is funny that that same thing happened the same thing happened that i talked about but anyway so yeah i got to get my status up so that let's take that example innocent enough example i get served last in first class being the only black person all facts first thing would be is to remove race from that sentence from that statement okay that's the first thing so you remove race then you replace it with data so step two is add data and you're looking for any plausible explanation any and all plausible explanations period maybe so let's talk about the the the first class plane situation maybe the person serving wasn't properly trained maybe the person serving you know maybe there's some sort of system in place that's you know this and then the other maybe they were paying attention maybe they are racist like who knows right but you're looking for all these different possible plausible explanations and so step two you make this huge list of all the possible explanations then if you if you exhaust that and you still can't find any other reason maybe maybe it's possible you might be dealing with racism but regardless you move to step three which is ask the question what can i do to improve my results right or improve my outcomes what can i do to improve my results and then step four is take action to me and to lots of others that i've taught this to it's one of the most empowering mindsets and strategies that you can bring to any situation yeah and and what's so it gets back to this notion of empowerment and disempowerment if if the fact is that it is racism and you don't even think about these other options you don't look at the data you don't you don't do step one or step two you can't control that and that you you lose control over your destiny very rapidly if indeed the number one reason that this this outcome this disparity is different um then you're screwed and however if if you acknowledge the which is what is almost always true i would imagine almost always true is that there's a variety of factors there well guess what you just got power back because now you can control these factors but i mean since you talk about this a lot you receive a lot of feedback on something like this um you know yeah and how often is it really just racism and and how and like when when people say i've experienced racism in my life i take them at their word um but but how but you might be more skeptical so what is what well it's well it's natural to be right because at the because it is it is a it's is there a poll that's out there right now where people are gonna honestly answer about all their different biases and things that they have in their head of course not so we're chasing a ghost it's this thing that you can never prove it can never definitively be proven unless somebody says you know what you're right this is absolutely this is the case so what we're doing is we're discounting regular stuff like i just don't like you or hey i don't you know what i mean yeah maybe he's a jerk right and you know it's discounting so many so many things it's like the networking example in my talk so so this is the the famous stat about about breath mints the connection between breath mints and racism so it is so we're at a networking event and you know business people meeting each other and things like that and i seen it was me and there was one other brother in the in the whole place right he comes up to me and i say hey what's going on and he goes don't even waste your time man these white people ain't treating us right i said what do you mean and he goes uh he goes man i and he was you could tell like a little bit of his anger but it was also hurt you could you could you could hear it and feel it and see it and he said um he said they're having a good time they're talking and everything and as soon as i go up and and try to get into the conversation as soon as i start talking all of a sudden they have to check an email or go to the bathroom and stuff and i'm just every group i'm going to i can see the same thing and he goes i'm not stupid i know what's going on and so the minute he started talking i knew exactly what the issue was super awkward but i said i figured i'm the only one in this room that can tell him this so i say hey listen it's not because you're black it's because of your breath it's crazy like your breath is offensively bad you know what i mean something it is bad i mean if you ever walk up to somebody literally in their breath yeah yeah it's hard it's hard to it's difficult yeah it is you can't focus you don't want to be around i don't want to i'm telling you right now i have a bias against if you have horrible breath and it's unfortunate maybe it's not your fault maybe you have halitosis or something i don't know yeah it doesn't matter your breath stinks i don't wanna be around so anyway so i told him this and i had some uh some some some breath mints and i gave it to him and uh he said thanks man i appreciate you this that the other end and i watched i watched his day got better his his networking got better because the groups he went to all of a sudden it wasn't it wasn't offensive you know saying it wasn't just this repulsive situation yeah and uh so then i made it i made a joke in the talk i said you know well maybe i won't even bear i'll let them watch it but uh you know there was a statistic in there now right i'll just say it you know breath mints reduce racism by up to 87 yeah or 83 right it's like it's and and how else do you um give us some more examples before we started recording you you because you do uh uh entrepreneurial coaching and um you had some interesting examples there too so walk us through that through that story that you were talking about oh you mean you mean the founders and funding yeah yeah so again other plausible explanations that's the theme here so folks when you hear the story you get caught up in in the in the other things but let's talk about other plausible explanations so i was coaching i was coaching some founders and there was this particular case it was a room full of founders but it was three black ceos three black founders all three different companies and and i try to create an environment where we can have candid conversations and we keep it real in the room and it's like look don't don't mess with me unless you want to be great right they know my intentions and so we have that relationship we can have really candid conversations which is the way things should be you should have those types of situations right no surface level stuff let's just get right to it so we're talking about funding and i'd raised millions of dollars in my career and and so i know how the game works and i've been through it and i'm black so the statistics though will tell you that pretty much i shouldn't get the funding because you know if you look at the numbers it's exceedingly difficult for at least one of the narratives is exceedingly difficult for black people to get funding and then the aggregate somebody can find stats that would indicate that's true oh yes same with same with health oh yeah we talked a little same with loans you know well that's what we're talking about but yeah so they so they said they said well for us it's even harder because black women so they were going on the stats right black women have even a tougher time so the automatic assumption and this is i think where the the cognitive dissonance comes in the automatic assumption is that because in the aggregate i can prove this it's true it therefore means i as an individual will have a harder time it's like saying it's like if i said having a half of a half a tank of gas increases your chances of getting into a car wreck you're like that sounds silly but hold on let's look at the aggregate data and again this is off this this right here is fake data i'm just using example but it's like all right we took we took uh a poll of all the car crashes and we looked at the gas tank and oh and 98 of them the gas tank was half was half full yeah and so there's a correlation but it's causation causation is is not obvious here so you have to unpack the data a lot more to infer causation exactly so okay so back to the three black female ceo so they said they're basically saying look we it's getting funding for us is very difficult we can't get it i said okay i said can we be real in the room i said of course i said okay you're not getting funding because you have no technical co-founder you're not getting funded because you have no traction yet and you're not getting funded because you're not very coachable i said these these have nothing to do with with discrimination yeah and i just i said look we could have that conversation at a later date but right now let's focus on being good enough for discrimination yeah yeah yeah make sure all the other boxes are checked performance and metrics um and if all else fails look it's possibility i mean it can't i won't discount the possibility and i guess in your experience that's my original question in your experience have you ever not been able to explain something and and and have you really encountered i mean real racism i mean because a lot of people in america that think that and want to believe that and again frankly if somebody tells me that they do it i i want to take them at their word for it i i have encountered real racism yeah absolutely i will tell you that it it it did not uh you know it definitely did not um stop me from you know stop me from living my life afterwards but absolutely i did yeah absolutely it's definitely out there um and and then the question from and i think maybe as apollos from a policy perspective from the cultural perspective is how do you root that out maybe you would see it would seem to me you can't what's that yeah yeah you one you can't define that yeah well it's like it's like how do you how do you how do you root out um how do you root out bad attitudes yeah good luck uh it is it's inherent some people are just like that and there's no amount of policy that will change that fact and so and and i think knowing that what i see oftentimes is the conversation about well it's systemic it's institutionalized and i say how you need to point me to the institution you need to point me to the rules that are in place perhaps that are causing this and of course they can't now we and what and then what maybe what people will defer to is well we used to have them and so there's there's a legacy here that then needs to be rooted out and it's like well how do you root it out before we've equalized things when they're like and then you get to the abram x kennedy notion of anti-racism which is you need modern discrimination in order to alleviate past discrimination and you need future discrimination in order to alleviate modern discrimination which he has yet to define so it's you're ghost hunting right because you there's no def what's the actual that because people say oh that's the actual definition of racism it's the definition of racism it's like hold on like let's let's literally break this down those parts and this is why in my talk i specifically specifically i i gave an i gave a definition for playing the race card because i didn't want anybody to say well he's saying this and what i mean by the race card is this no you can't do that i gave you a very specific definition and so whenever somebody gave me flack or gave me an issue or started talking crazy online and i stopped responding to a lot of them right but but i would it was kind of interesting to kind of ask hey what specifically what specifically in the talk did you disagree with what's what specific point do i make what specific thing did i say haven't gotten a straight answer yet it's all generalities and feelings yeah and i understand those and feelings are re i get it i get it feelings are real right but it's like facts don't care about your feelings but feelings don't care about your facts well we're going to impass yeah you know and and and these these conclusions cannot be derived solely from these feelings it's dangerous it's dan it's very dangerous for our society to play the race card because it is such a superficial and a lazy argument and i'll debate anyone any day any time about how lazy and how dangerous that playing the race card is because if it's the only plausible outcome that you came up with what you're doing is a couple of things one is you're convincing uh everybody who's listening to you if they're black that they are less than that they're a victim that is a very damaging mindset more damaging than what anybody can do to you externally internally the way that you feel about you is more important than how how somebody else feels about you that's number one and number two you're inviting when you say if i say hey man you're you're racist because you gave me the cold shoulders like no i gave you the cold shoulder because you did this or i gave you the cold shoulder because or whatever or maybe you're having a bad day you i'm inviting you to to break that whole thing down and give me all these other reasons and then where where are we going to get at that point it's combative the other thing that drives me nuts about this is it's very selective like that when looking for the disparities and outcomes it's very selective because there's a million other stats i could point out like the number of men who are suicidal versus women men versus women when it comes to incarceration rates so is the is the justice system discriminatory against men or are men just more violent you know it's uh now of course since that's not really an issue and nobody cares about men and you know versus women as far as hierarchies go nobody nobody makes that point but if we're going to use the logic exactly then apply it apply it uniformly then you have to come to that same crazy conclusion and that's so dangerous it's a pathology really and it's it feels recent i mean does it feel recent to you did it feel like the 90s were better with respect to this conversation what are your thoughts on that it's an interesting question i know we were both the same age and we were kind of growing up in the 90s and i grew up in houston uh very diverse communities and i just things just didn't feel like they were in your face so yeah in my in when it comes to i'll answer it this way when it comes to my life and my community the people that i spend my time with it hasn't changed because of the people that i surround myself with or we don't deal with with that nonsense but i think that from from a mainstream media perspective 100 it's changed i there are literally little interviews and examples of of people in the media that years ago had the same exact argument that some of us have today oh like don lemon easily yeah basically he's got some switch switches easily right and so it's just it's damaging it's one of those it's you know it's what i call the cobra effect it is uh tell us about the cobra effect something you talk about as well and were you writing a book on the cobra effect i am okay i am yeah it's coming out soon i'm not sure when this podcast will be released but it'll be out it'll be out this year so the cobra effect in new delhi india years ago there was an infestation of cobras and the government in their infinite wisdom said hey citizens of new delhi you bring us dead cobras we'll pay you i don't like collecting cans or whatever just more dangerous so all right i'll put you on the spot play the game what do you think happened as a result of that policy well i kind of already know the answer so um but but but let me i'll play the game so what would happen if i this first time i'm hearing this story uh well i'm sure people started hunting cobras and killing cobras right this is what the government wanted but you might also have an incentive to um to reproduce crowbris and then kill them and then turn them in because that's exactly you created a business that's exactly what happened so they started breeding cobras and so they started breeding cobras a couple years later the government's looking at their numbers and they're like wait a minute this is a lot going on we have the greatest cobra breeding yeah they were the industry in the world yeah they were catching more and more and more cobras it was not it was not you know it was doing the exact opposite that they thought it was going to do and so they killed the program it's a good program for like cans and water bottles and things like that not a good program for deadly animals exactly exactly so then when they killed the program they released the cobras back into the wild and net you had more cobras after the program than you did before and that's what's known as the cobra effect yeah so we can take that same thing and we can apply it to all sorts of stuff i mean something as seemingly innocent is feeding the ducks in the park feeding the ducks some bread yep most people have taken some bread feed the ducks it's kind of fun it's good you know it's cool for the kids but if you break down okay the intention is the intention evil for people to feed the ducks i doubt it right i think it's a pretty uh you know pretty just a just a pure intention to feed the ducks you know ducks like to eat i've got some bread they like the bread done that's the intention but the outcome is much much different so what happens when you feed the ducks is one there's a muscle the ducks have ducks are hunters there's a muscle that the ducks have that atrophies because they don't use it yeah so that atrophies and then they lose their ability to hunt two they reproduce more so they have more ducklings three they start to infight with each other so a lot of violence in you know within the ducks right they're fighting each other over this bread and over this food and then they become fully over time they become fully dependent on said bread it's amazing how everybody grows up with this maybe it's not taught to them though maybe no nobody unpacked this would make a great children's book unpack the story of why we don't feed the ducks and then apply that to the naive compassion that the left often engages in with respect to policy making it it's ignoring these these unintended consequences that is a fantastic idea that's fantastic idea my wife wrote a children's book i'm gonna give her the idea oh that was my idea all right you can have it write it right the market can handle two don't feed the duck books that's true that's true it's just i might use it more often frankly it's because it's a great analogy um well it's one of those neutral analogies right everybody knows it too like oh it does it does i do feel sorry for the ducks well it's like you talk about that with respect to the homelessness problem it's like yeah is it is it good to keep them dependent yeah you know well he's into that you got to ease into the cobra effect right that's why you start with the cobra example because it was in the past and it was kind of it's super interesting and it's most people have never heard that and they're like whoa you know i didn't expect that unless you grew up really poor the poor the people that grew up really poor that i talk to and i and i quiz them yeah they're like they get it yeah but they get it making money i was uh and then or violence like i was talking to anthony anderson uh on a project uh you know a project that we were working on and uh i talked about the cobra effect and i quizzed him and he was like he was like oh we're gonna start killing these people because if you got the cobras i'm gonna kill you take your car or something you're like you're from compton level yeah yeah it's like it's like i mean it should have been obvious from the beginning to be honest um but it's yeah it's a great it's a great example okay tell us about the documentary um that you wait you've already done it or you're working on it uh well depending on who you ask the answer is both you know the curse of a documentary is you know it's not done until you you know until you say it's done right so but uh for for about three years the dark dollar the dark dollar okay the dark dollar yes it's funny people rename it the black dollar often okay pretty funny just the interesting tidbit people like to change your titles yeah yes so uh yeah so the dark dollars so we spent a few years traveling the country and talking to all sorts of people from all sorts of walks of life and different things and the real question was you know what's the biggest problem facing black america but the real underpinnings was it was this intersection between race and wealth in america so because of the santa claus thing right because of the santa claus thing i said okay the facts supported two different narratives one narrative i could i could tell the story and people were like yeah santa claus is racist that you you could come to that conclusion like i'll give the benefit of the doubt that you could come to that conclusion if you went there or there's another one where you're like okay santa claus it's not real right this is true with a lot of stats so one example would be and i forget the exact statistic but people will always tell me hey you they're pointing at me they're saying hey you have x percent higher uh chance of going of going to prison like why why they said well because you're black so wait a minute it's not like it's a lottery right so dealing with this right so this is but this is one of those things that are unchallenged unchallenged things right so thomas sol does a really good job he does a really good job of this right he sends for the data it's there but people just don't seek it out so i actually hired a researcher and i said i need you to find data and i'm looking for a specific set of data i want you to find the financial data behind all racial statistics and so and so it's fascinating you can you can damn near you can damn near connect any racial disparity to financial and then but that that gets on the whole deep thing but so let's talk about let's talk about incarceration for a second all right john you've got a higher chance of going to prison because you're black i'm like me why me like why i live in a nice neighborhood you know cool i've been pulled over three times in the last three years i deserve three tickets i have zero tickets pretty big in black right so i'm so i'm like yeah anecdotally i don't get it so i send for the data and i discovered a couple of very interesting statistics number one was something that they call pre-incarceration income when you hear it you're like okay i get it it makes sense how much money you made before you went to prison the difference between white men and black men let's just leave women out because they barely go to prison white men and black man the difference in in pre-incarceration income is 400 a year it's virtually identical okay 192 196 that's it that's that's that's the statistic right much strong a much stronger indicator much more reasonable indicator as to your chances of going to prison somebody who who earns you know a 10th or a 20th of somebody in upper middle class has a higher chance of going to prison okay so that's one stat the second statistic is is is is one that that really hits home it's 90 of all men not black men not white men all incarcerated men 90 have one thing in common no father figure yeah fatherless homes that's that's so he is so that makes sense to me that is so talking about the system remove race add data right this is adding more data it's like huh that's that's that's the example it's adding data we're adding pre-incarceration income got it we're adding fatherlessness got it those things are things that make sense that's more content of character stuff more whatever is less than what you look like yeah really weird which the argument falls down on its face and we know this and we know it does we know it another thing i talked about in my ted talk is is timmy the difference between me growing up and timmy growing up and i said timmy has this this suburban set up i mean they had a two-story home i mean i lived in an apartment with no you know i got no fireplace right whatever right uh not a sob story right we're fine but but he's got this two-story home i've had dinners at his house they sit down family dinners talk about the world events the kids all went to ivy league school kind of you know what mit i mean where'd the scrub i think the scrub went to ucla and as a doctor i mean that's literally literally kind of their whole situation and uh so when you tell the story you're okay timmy you know talk about timmy and everything it's like what's the difference between me and timmy well depending on who you are what your ideologies are you might immediately go to race say well timmy's got white privilege tell me this but there's only one problem with that timmy's black right it's te mitope right more specifically and this is why we need to get outside of we need to dig deeper than just skin color because yes timitope and i are both black but i'm american black right i'm a black american tim tope his parents were born in nigeria they are part of the yoruba tribe and the he's born in the united states but his family his family structure his culture is much different we go to his house we take our shoes off we bow all these other things i mean literally i had a i got my report card it was a 3.3 or something like that my dad said good job you know great you know good job you know i'm saying good it's real i'm proud of you yeah barbecue that weekend while we're all good i was questioned at timmy tope's house about my grades and he was asking me what my problem was why my grades were so low and that he would you know he would have beaten me if i brought that home to him standards so how do you go from a barbecue to a beating different perspective yeah we're both black but they have this they have this saying in their culture it's uh ishea neogoon iche which stands for hard work is the antidote to poverty that's what they're what's ingrained into them and so living in the same system the same american system call it what you want the system okay if it's systemic let's go with that for a second let's say that is it is systemic like right now solely we're playing the race card here solely based on your skin color you have you have it exponentially harder solely based on that okay if that's the case you will have to explain to me why west indian blacks ghanaian blacks nigerian blacks and uh we're talking about people of of color which statement bugs the crap out of me but uh you know and then there's a few of the of of the asian communities i think whites are fifth maybe in family income and household income yeah in the us yeah and a white supremacist in a white supremacist uh uh system your fifth if i was white i'd be going to the white the white privilege you know council like yo i need my money back this is crazy yeah which is this is crap i would be so pissed like how are we fifth you know what i mean how do these folks come here and that we're doing this so you'll have to explain to me why why the outcomes are different in different communities based on same skin color and how do they start too it's not it's not as if they come here with a bunch of money in the bank and you know and have that kind of privilege right i will say that i will say that the privilege they they would have and you call it a privilege is their mindset yeah so they may come with nothing but that mindset i mean timitopia's father drove an ice cream truck ended up being a chemist for boeing right mom mom you know works in the healthcare industry like they're they're just it's it's they're just hungry yeah why didn't we get a house at that time like why and so you know and here's the crazy part so you look at that and they got a two-story house and you know kind of oh must be nice kind of situation well my parents my mom her her parents they they paid their house off in 1980. paid it off yeah so so what do we do about it though because i mean it's i think we've we've done a good job for for this episode kind of debunking a lot of the false notions but it doesn't change the fact that in the aggregate there there are problems and that are worth solving uh within the black community that that it's that we would all have the same goal of of trying to get to a place where those outcome disparities aren't so obvious and the question is how now we've identified some pretty obvious sources of the problems fatherless homes for instance that's a really hard problem to solve there's no government policy that just forces the fathers back into the homes and forces them to be good people um there's perhaps incentives that we could rearrange but that's only that's a small that's that's just around the edges when it comes to government incentives you know there's deeper cultural issues in the podcast a couple weeks ago we had dr johnson on um from here in houston the fifth ward and you know grew up with these issues his big thing is the the if you're going to focus on one solution it's it's got to be education and it's got to be education in the uh when in texas we call it cte career and technical education yes so you agree oh this is and he says that solves the fatherless home thing too because now that father instead of getting going to jail is just has a it doesn't have a college degree should never even bother with college but at least has a job a man without a purpose a man without a sense of self-worth is a dangerous man yeah that is always the case and so the disservice we've done to society as a whole is we've positioned college as higher education and we've positioned the trades as alternative education so we've created this stigma sometimes so if there's systemic racism in this country it might be the system of pushing people to four-year degrees yeah it's the notion it's a notion that your only chance to be successful in this country is to go to college that's absurd i am not saying that i'm not saying college is bad or anything like that but there are there are there are trades you can go you can go out and be a master plumber and you'll make more than the vast majority of college degrees in this country today right now today and not only is it not the only way to succeed it's it's it's an unlikely way to succeed there's a lot of rich white people who got their their feel-good liberal arts major and can't make any money or get hired i would never hire them right you know it depends on their major um it depends how they present themselves but it isn't even what we look at and i people need to know that it's when we look at resumes i mean your school might matter to even even working in a congressional office but really we're looking for experience and and what skills you bring to the table and there just really has to be a paradigm shift towards that i just look i know too many entrepreneurs to be fooled i know too many black entrepreneurs to be fooled that black people saying it an entire group of people like that is just ridiculous right but to say black people are incapable of doing these things it's not it's not the case it's not the case i think the biggest you know the biggest thing is the really question to ask is what do you believe you can accomplish because if your perspective is this big and these are your only options you're not even looking at these other things that you can do what a beautiful what a beautiful time to be where you don't have to go to college and have a degree at some fancy school to make six figures or to at least be in the top 10 15 percent of income earners in the united states you don't have to go to college you can you can be a plumber you can be electrician you can be a welder you can do all of these different things what an amazing you know what an amazing thing that there's that variety yeah yeah you can go learn ai and you can go you can go learn you can learn to code you can go do that you can be an entrepreneur you can go work for you work for a big corporation and work your way up the corporate ladder there's all these different things but let's not fool let's not fool an entire community or at least let that let that be known that you know that that's the case because it's just not true i think that the biggest thing is what stories are we telling and evangelizing as to society as a whole you can find plenty of plenty of narratives around going to college and graduating from college and getting a degree and getting a job it's like there's that where's the story about so i gotta that's why i gotta get in touch with mike rowe because he's he's he's big on on the trades right he's like how do you how do you evangelize that yeah as an option as well well he's doing a pretty good job of evangelizing that and i think there is a slowly but surely a cultural shift what dr johnson's point was was because i visit a lot of schools in my district my district is northern suburbs of houston um western suburbs of houston and a pretty strong cte program pretty impressive programs i've seen where it's it's real hard skills actually being taught and encouraged at the high school level which is really where you need to start but what he pointed out is that if you go to inner city houston that's not the case uh it's the programs just aren't as strong or they exist but parents are not choosing them that's like it's hard to explain that which one which one is it do they exist they're not being chosen yeah it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy right like if you had funding for a program and you were oh my goodness we can talk about the school the way the school if you if you want to if you want to identify a system that that disadvantages specific groups of people let's talk about school system but but in that case which one's true it's very important it is important i think i remember asking that and yet they do have access they do have access so there's but there's a for some reason they're not as popular uh i don't know i mean it's i mean maybe there could be better ones i i'd have to dive down into that issue a little bit more but you're right that is an important question and and um and either and they offer different solutions one solution would be well we need to make sure that the programs exist first of all and if they do exist but nobody's choosing them choosing to do them then we need to change our marketing strategy for them uh guidance counselors need to be encouraging this more teachers need to be taught about how important this is um they need they need to they need to have john come and speak to students i'm sure it should be would be great do you ever get to do that do they ever have you ever looked into that just speaking to students about these these kind of issues uh i have an occasion but i need to do a lot more of that typically i'll go speak to companies and and that type of thing or sales organizations connection between mindset and performance but uh it's i mean you're right it's important to talk about those things and i think that's what can be done in part is to not only talk about them but whenever the lazy or dangerous arguments there we're gonna have to get more folks to get up there and and combat that and it's super uncomfortable to do it and it's it's one of those things that who wants that who wants to go do that right it's like all right all right i gotta throw my you know i gotta throw my hat in the ring because if you don't then you're going to sit by and watch this thing disintegrate yeah and so it's it's it's time to it's time to have those conversations and so you know that's uh that's really what's most important well we appreciate you doing it and fascinating discussion love it encourage everybody to uh watch the dark dollar when it comes out is it out not out it's it's it's uh it's on its way out just go to the if you go to the web if you go

U KNOW INCREASES IN PEOPLE'S PAY IS NOT KEEPING UP WITH INFLATION. I'M JOINED NOW BY REPUBLICAN SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR TIM SCOTT. GOOD EVENING, SIR. HEY, GREAT. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR. FIRST, LET ME TALK ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S TRIP TO THE MIDDLE EAST, A SUCCESS OR NOT, OR SOMETHING IN BETWEEN. IT REALLY IS JUST A FAILURE LITERALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S DOING IN THE MIDDLE EAST, PRIMARILY LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING MORE OIL HOME WHEN IN FACT WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE AND WHAT IT SHOULD BE DOING. IS EXCAVATING ENERGY HERE AT HOME. WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO SUPPLY OUR FOLKS WITH THE ENERGY THAT WE ALL NEED. AND INSTEAD WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE GAS WAS A DOLLAR 99 A GALLON IN DECEMBER 2020. NOW IT'S OVER $4 A GALLON AND THIS PRESIDENT REFUSES TO LET OUR FOLKS HERE AT HOME DOMESTICALLY DRILL FOR THE ENERGY WE NEED. THAT TO ME MAKES HIS ENTIRE TRIP, ESPECIALLY HIS MEETING WITH MBS A FAILURE. IF I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BE A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT IF HE WANTS DRILLING MORE OIL, WHY THERE AND NOT HERE? IN OUR ENVIRONMENT, IF YOU MEAN IT MEANS JOBS HERE. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPPOSED TO MORE DRILLING. BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO SUPPORT IT, WHY NOT HERE? GREATER. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THANK GOD I'M NOT A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS AS A SPOKESPERSON FOR SOUTH CAROLINIANS. WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU MORE DOMESTICALLY CREATED JOBS AROUND OUR ENERGY FUTURE. WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE STARTING AND SEEING SIX OR 700,000 BARRELS OF OIL COMING TO THIS COUNTRY. EVERYTHING DAY. WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT REGULATORY CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY THAT WOULD ALLOW OUR ENERGY ASSETS TO BE PLACED IN THE GROUND AND SEEING ENERGY COMING UP, LITERALLY THE SIGN ANY OF THOSE SIGNS WILL GIVE MORE CONFIDENCE TO THE MARKET PLACE, AND IT WOULD CAUSE TO REDUCE BECAUSE WHEN, YOU KNOW. PRESIDENT BIDEN AGENDA DOMESTIC AGENDA LARGELY, WAS THIS BUILD BACK BETTER. IT GOT KILLED. I THINK LAST FEBRUARY, THE FIRST ONE, WE GOT THE SLIM DOWN BILL THAT NOW HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ARE IS BEING CONSIDERED ON CAPITOL HILL, BUT CENTER MENTIONED DEMOCRAT IS NOT GETTING ON BOARD . HE DOESN'T LIKE THE TAXES IN IT AND SOME OTHER PARTS OF IT. IS BUILT BACK BETTER NOW DEAD OR CAN IT GET RESCUED TO THINK BY THE DEMOCRATS? REGRET TO. I PREFER TO CALL IT BUILD BACK BROKER BECAUSE THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THEY MUST NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES INFLATION WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ADDING MORE FUEL TO THE FIRE OR MORE MONEY TO THE ECONOMY, YOU'RE LITERALLY TALKING ABOUT INCREASING INFLATION WHEN YOU INCREASE ATTACK ON OUR CORPORATIONS ON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. YOUR PROFIT, AND YOU'RE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF JOBS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. SO THANK GOODNESS THE CRUSHING BLOW DEALT BY JOE MANCHIN IS A SIGH OF RELIEF FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF. WITH THE BBB BEING THE O A DEAD ON ARRIVAL. YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING. I SORT OF WONDER WHAT KIND OF RECEPTION THAT SENATOR MANSIONS GETTING AMONG THE DEMOCRATS ON CAPITOL HILL BECAUSE HE DOES GUT THE BIDEN AGENDA GOING INTO MIDTERM , SO WE'VE GOT THE PROBLEM INFLATION. WE HAD PROBLEM WITH HIGH GAS TAX HIGH GAS PRICES. NATION BUILD BACK BETTER IS NOW LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO HE GOES INTO THE MIDTERMS. BUT DO YOU DO YOU SEE MENTION EVER IN THE SENATE? AND WHAT KIND OF RECEPTION IS YOU GETTING FROM HIS FELLOW DEMOCRATS. GRETA I SEE JOE ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS. WHEN WE'RE IN THE SENATE. WE GET ALONG VERY WELL. THEY SHOULD BE PATTING HIM ON THE BACK AND QUIETLY WHISPERING INTO HIS EARS . THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THESE MIDTERMS SORT OF IT BEING A BLOODBATH, SO TO SPEAK, MAKING IT BETTER FOR US BECAUSE IF THE DEMOCRATS WANTED BECAME LAW, WE WOULD HAVE HIGHER INFLATION, NOT 9.1% HIGHEST IN 40 YEARS, BUT I WOULD BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE OVER 10% INFLATION ABOUT THIS. JOE TWO YEARS AGO UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, MILK WAS $3.60 A GALLON WE WENT TO THE STORE RECENTLY. IT'S ALMOST $5 A GALLON TODAY. THE TRUTH IS THAT WITH MORE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEING SPENT IN THIS ECONOMY, IT ONLY INCREASES INFLATION AND LIKE YOU SAID ON THE WAY IN WAGES ARE NOT KEEPING UP. YOU'VE HAD A NET LOSS OF SPENDING POWER, EVEN THOUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN AWAY $4 TRILLION WELL, YOU'VE RECENTLY SAID I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ADMINISTRATION IS DISCONNECTED FROM EVERYDAY AMERICANS. AND I MIGHT THINK THAT THAT SORT OF POLITICAL TALK BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATES ARE SO PROFOUNDLY LOW AND PEOPLE, SO MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT COUNTRY IS HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. BUT WHAT WHAT? WHERE IS THE DISCONNECT ME? WHAT? WHO IS THE LISTENING TO WHAT DOESN'T HE DOING? LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WHY? I THINK HE'S SO DISCONNECTED FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SOMETIMES WITH THE WHITE HOUSE SEEMS TO SUGGEST. PLEASE BELIEVE WHAT WE ARE WHAT WE ARE SAYING. NOT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH YOUR OWN EYES, THEY SAID AFGHANISTAN IT WAS A GREAT WITHDRAWAL. WHAT WE SAW WAS THE DEATH OF 13. AMERICAN SOLDIERS AND THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS STRANDED IN AFGHANISTAN. THEY TELL US THAT THE BORDER IS CLOSED, BUT WHAT WE SEE IS ALMOST 2.5 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CROSSING OUR BORDER IN 12 MONTHS. SO EVERY TIME THEY TELL US BY THE WAY THAT INFLATION IS GOOD FOR THE POOR FOR WORKING CLASS PEOPLE BECAUSE THEIR WAGES ARE GOING UP, BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE WAGES HAVE GONE UP, INFLATION OUTPACES WAGE INCREASES, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU HAVE YOU HAD A LOSS OF SPENDING POWER. SO THESE ARE THREE CLEAR EXAMPLES ON WHY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SHAKING THEIR HEADS MYSTIFIED BY WHAT THIS PRESIDENT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING. AND IF YOU'RE EATING AT ANY RESTAURANT IN THIS COUNTRY, JUST ASK THE WAITRESS AT THE TABLE. HOW HOW'S IT GOING? HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SPEND EIGHT HOURS OF WORK JUST TO PUT ONE FUL

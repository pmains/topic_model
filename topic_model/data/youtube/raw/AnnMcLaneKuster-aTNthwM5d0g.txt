my parents raised me to believe in bedrock American values liberty equality opportunity so today it is so disappointing to see Republicans in Congress and in the State House turning their backs on these values in order to appeal to the Tea Party fringe we need her and we need her in Congress I mean we don't need what we have now in closet we need change but we also need that change in Congress it's insane what is going on I believe in less government interference in people's personal lives including whom to marry when and whether to have children and how to raise kind and compassionate children I came into the customer campaign a little bit towards the end of the last one and she got so close and as i was telling this guy right over here hey hey ho ho Charlie bass has got to go and auntie Custer's the one to take him out the fact is we don't have a congressman representing us in Washington some oil and gas company down in Texas does but he isn't representing the people of the state of their hand sugar so we're standing up for creating good jobs in our communities ensuring affordable health care for all investing in renewable energy and demanding fairness from Wall Street and finally I am standing up for a government that supports the decency the responsibility and the generosity of the people in this room and in living rooms all across this district it's essentially we replaced three retired Charlie bass he along with the rest of the Republican cronies in Congress is doing nothing good for the country let alone for the people in New Hampshire and I think candy will do good things for both New Hampshire and the country

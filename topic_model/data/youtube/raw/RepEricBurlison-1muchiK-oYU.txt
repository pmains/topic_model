hi I'm representative Eric girls we had a short week of session the Missouri House due to the intense weather and snow we quickly accomplished what we could on Monday in early Tuesday and then we adjourn so those people who needed to get home could brave the roads and get to their families unfortunately for me it was too late to safely make the trip back to Springfield most community committee hearings have been canceled health insurance committee of which I serve as the vice chair was not canceled and while the winter sky was dumping tons of snow across the state burying us in the Capitol building I was in committee listening to testimony about the impacts of Obamacare and the impending federal regulations and mandates that are dumping tons of regulatory burden on Missouri taxpayers and that is why we begin our work next week I'll be filing a bill to create the healthcare compact the healthcare compact is an agreement among states that returns responsibility and authority for the health care system to the states it gets Congress out of the business of controlling the health care industry and it empowers States to create their own health care systems right now Congress is taking your tax dollars and then using your money to force Missouri and other states into its will and that's just wrong the health care compact will keep tax money inside the state of Missouri rather than sending it to the federal government this will give Missouri and participating states greater freedom and more flexibility the health care compact is simple it provides a legal framework states can use to create their own health care systems it essentially provides a permanent waiver to each member state to do what is best for their citizens the combination of secure funding stream and maximum flexibility for state legislators will create the conditions for multiple solutions to emerge across the United States rather than to rely upon the monopoly of the federal bureaucracy each state will be able to compete to find what is right and best for their constituents and for their needs Arizona Montana and North Dakota have already filed legislation to join us in this compact and legislators at many other states including Texas Florida Virginia Tennessee and others are planning to do so as well such a strong group of states joining together will send a very powerful message to the federal government if you have any questions about this healthcare compact or any other issues that my office can address please contact me my email address is Eric Burleson at how smug of you can also call my office at our local number which is for 175 nine seven three six three five thank you very much

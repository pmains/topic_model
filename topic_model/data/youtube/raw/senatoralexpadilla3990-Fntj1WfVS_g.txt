uh I know uh clock is thinking we have votes open uh but there are a couple of more questions I want to raise and have responses for the record I'll try to be uh uh brief the lack of Access to Health Care in rural communities is a serious emergency a coordinate data tracked by the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill 182 rural hospitals have closed since 2005 leaving residents in those areas no options but to foregoat receiving health care or to travel long distances to see a doctor uh Dr Allure and your Testament you mentioned that the Veterans Affairs hospital where you work is located in Marion Illinois a town with a population of about 17 000. you also mentioned that your hospital serves veterans from a number of States including Missouri Kentucky and Indiana can you briefly describe what health care disparities you've witnessed in your work and how those disparities impact individuals living in rural areas in particular thank you chairman Padilla um our veterans come from two hours two and a half hours away going past emergency rooms and hospitals to receive Care at the VA it's such a cherished institution once we get the veterans we take care of what we can take care of there it's a small Hospital the shortage in the community glares at us once we try to transfer uh veterans to places they need VA spares no effort energy or experts expense in getting uh care to the veterans and uh like you did before hospitals are closed um whoever is in the community whoever is coming to a hospital for a problem is at an advanced stage because they don't have access to primary care and that's a huge problem um the pediatrician I was talking about who is established a huge practice there he is having to recruit out of his expertise so that he can provide care so he's recruiting psychologists he's recruiting dental assistants so that that shortage is compensated the disparities are projected to even get worse as aging Physicians retire so um the outcomes are already poor we have to act now so that we can arrest that Decline and secure the rural areas thank you and uh if if you don't mind like to ask a slightly more personal question Dr Allure you've mentioned that moving a substantial distance away from work in order to put your daughter's needs first you share that in the testimony you submitted you also mentioned the trials and tribulations that you and your wife have faced navigating our complex immigration laws but yet despite all that you remain committed and steadfast in your passion for your work the work that you do serving our nation's veterans uh so thank you again for the work that you do in your service and I just want to hear from you uh what would obtaining a green card mean for you and your family um thank you uh chairman uh Padilla one word I would say is stability um we've been part uh we've been working in the community we've been living in the community but we are not really part of the community we don't belong there because we are still temporary immigrant workers stability to my family to my children especially my daughter who will age out if I don't get a green card in six years stability to my patients travel is a problem being on a Visa if I leave the country and if I can't come in there is a gap that has been the case with many immigrant physicians in our organization freedom from simple day-to-day restrictions like not able to drive right now there is a physician in East Tennessee a real rural country a gastroenterologist is not able to drive because of it is a problem he's decided to relocate his children and wife are already gone he says he cannot take calls because he can't go to the hospital if there is a bleeder in the hospital um there is a liver transplant program director in Iowa City right now who is not seeing patients because his immigration process is screwed up he's not doing anything since Monday his patients are waiting all these restrictions and problems we Face are actually they reflect on the uh patients their effect on the communities one day of work I can't do is care delayed for many patients thank you thank you Mr

thank you very much hello everybody good afternoon dear Jeremy ben-ami that was the voice of God just before I I mean and the leadership and the members of J Street thank you for giving me this opportunity to be with you at such an inspiring conference to be among the thousands of brave women and men of all ages and they see money many young young I can see many young faces around every year to defend your values and principles to give a voice for the mainstream American Jewish community I was one of the first Palestinian officials to speak at J Street in its early stage of establishment [Applause] it feels like yesterday then I said that nothing nothing is more missing than a motivated and principled organization that gives a voice and the call of action to the silent majority of the American Jewish community to the many who believe in peace and who keep the hope for a better tomorrow I am inspired to see your conference today to follow the evolution of your organization becoming the mainstream American Jewish organization defending peace to witness your growth your growth both in numbers and impact your voice has become loud and clear and your contribution to the u.s. political landscape is widely recognized my friends you were river outnumbered and that's why I said what I said this he were never outnumbered all those who believe in a different tomorrow all those who carry hope all those who believe in the goodness of the humankind are always never outnumbered but you were out organized and today and today as I said then many years ago you give us hope and confidence about the future [Applause] because the future is not shaped by those who merely witness it the future is shaped by those who offer it and I I see many of you here who have taken a decision not to only witness the future but to author the future for all of us thank you very much and it is an opportunity to commend you to commend J Street to commend the relentless work your dedication your investment your boating our board all that came your way it is an occasion to commend you and I repeat what I said many years ago you have partners in us the people of Palestine and the leadership of Palestine so my friends we Palestinians remain steadfast in our vision of peace and self-determination two states on the 1967 borders the state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital an open city for all the three Abrahamic faiths [Applause] and the just solution to the issue of refugees and the State of Israel yes refugees do deserve an applaud they have rights they have rights they have dreams they are not a burden they are an asset there are human being they deserve your applause refugees deserve your award for years they have been bedevil Palestinian refugees including myself have been a force of God everywhere they go look at them in the in the Gulf states look at them wherever they go they are an asset and their rights can always be respected but here I would also say that that vision would have to include a State of Israel with final and secured internationally recognized borders and with neighborly relations with us Andrey my friends we still firmly believe that this is the best way forward and let me say this the two-state solution was never a palestinian demand was never about absolute justice the two-state solution was a palestinian concession painful but essential for investing in the cause of peace [Applause] and investing in the cause of fees is not by words but by deeds and we have done our share we have record we have done our share and we will continue doing our share peace is too precious to noble to long waited for we have done our dues and we will continue doing audience number one we have recognized the State of Israel on 78% of historic Palestine that recognition came from the legitimate leadership of the Palestinian people from Yasser Arafat and the PNC voting in the most national democratic way for peace and for recognizing the State of Israel and we take nor shame and recognizing the two-state solution we take nor shame and recognizing our neighbors we may take a bit of this a bit of shame on not achieving the end game but investing in peace is something that we always and will always do we signed the Oslo Accords in 1993 because we believe that we have to engage in a process that would see the end of Israel's occupation that would see the establishment of a sovereign state of Palestine and we did not wait for that to come we engaged in building the state bottom up from the ground building our institutions that the international community have said that already it's at the level of sovereign independent middle-income countries we are so proud of our institutions of our policemen of our ability to provide for our people in the spheres of health education despite the most adverse circumstances and we work during this years with the Arab world to offer Israel the Arab Peace Initiative 22 Arab countries 22 Arab countries and with them the rest of the Islamic world 57 countries to offer Israel normalization as an outcome of peace we worked with our brothers in the Arab world and sisters because we want to provide an incentive for peace but we will not allow this to be a substitute for peace normalization is an outcome of peace not a substitute for peace and my friends we have no time to mince our words it has become bluntly clear that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is only interested in a win all lose all formula and despite all this for all these years we did not let go of our vision of our commitment of our investments for peace our response during all these difficult years was to face up the challenges by adopting non-violence including popular peaceful struggle on the ground and reverting to internationalism internationalism the international law the international system the United Nations since 1988 when that declaration energies of declaring an independent state of Palestine abso facto recognizing the State of Israel and since then we have been unwavering rock-solid in our commitments we did not change a bet we do not allow difficult times to change our commitments our vision our sense of destination no we defended we solidify it we protected since then our asses have been absolutely known to the world but this is an occasion in front of you my friends to reaffirm our yeses the first yes yes to a dignified and just peace the second yes yes to a two-state solution on the 1967 borders [Applause] yes to internationalism and to international resolutions yes to non-violence yes to non-violence we will not allow we will not allow the curse of blood to stand between us no matter what our political differences is no matter how much the operation is no matter how many snipers there is around Gaza now we shall believe in the power of the people the masses the power of the non-violence number 5 yes to a to democratic and egalitarian States [Applause] it is not just any two states we are after these two sovereign states must give their citizens full equal rights no other consideration no other consideration but the rule of law not decreed not the color not the religion not how tall or how short not the language you speak or you the God you pray for but the fact that you are a citizen of that state yes to that yes to that no to racism no to discrimination and finally yes to a meaningful genuine credible peace process but friends hear me out here and it is important that I say on behalf of the people and leadership of Palestine what I am about to say now the leadership that has been struggling for over half a century bringing their people and bringing the international community to the consensus that peace can never prevail without justice we may have issues back home my friends and I take note of any voice here we may have issues but don't waste our time or lose sight of the fact that Palestinians can only themselves bring about the representation don't meddle and don't intervene and I'll go on on this because it's an important subject nothing we pride ourselves more in Palestine than our democratic process it has been interrupted for ten years painfully so it has interrupted because no one wants to convene elections without these elections being national we will not convene elections without East Jerusalem and we will not convene elections without Gaza we will only convene elections when elections are national and we are working towards that to be national now I want to say and ask ask the people of Palestine they will never ever accept any leader or leadership if they are not elected even when they are elected there are a lot of opposition so leave us alone our domestic situation is not easy but I tell you we cherish our ability to renew our democratic process now about how much our yeses are unwavering solid like a rock have always survived the test of time moments of despair like this one but so are our nose so are our nose so here is the first no here is the first no no to redefining what the two-state solution means no to that no to that big fat no no state - no state - no interim arrangements we've done that no lasting process we've done that we want lasting peace no state with provisional borders no state without East Jerusalem its capital and no state at the expense of two-thirds of the Palestinian people no state without resolving the issue of refugees and no state without Gaza and no state in Gaza and let me say the last no in this area no state no state with one Israeli soldier on its soil not one the second big known we have is no to the US administration decision on Jerusalem no to that no to that no beg no we rejected that announcement and decision then and we reject it now because that decision does not help the cause of peace because Jerusalem is the key to peace and because Jerusalem is the very heart of what you are not believing the two-state solution without Jerusalem there can never be a two-state solution that decision was not only counterproductive to peace but it did not do justice to the identity to the history to the reality of Jerusalem Jerusalem for millennia has been inclusive inclusive open tolerant diverse people of all faiths Jews Christians and Muslims left together coexisted the keys of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is hauled for hundreds of years with a Muslim family and Muslim families in the old days with candle the Jewish candle the Shabbat candle for the Jewish neighbors throughout the history of that city but today is an anomaly Jerusalem will always reject claims of exclusivity no one can have exclusive claims of Jerusalem and no one shall we we promise you we vow in front of you that once peace prevails once the state of Palestine is established once that estate has East Jerusalem its capital that city will not only recognize the Jewish connection to Jerusalem but we will celebrate the Jewish connection to Joseph all these unilateral decisions by the Israeli Prime Minister and by the US administration but particularly by the administration do not change the status of Jerusalem I assure you or the status of refugees after cutting aid to honor roll or change the status of the historic and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people they don't it doesn't the only status that changed since the announcement in Jerusalem the only status that changed is the status of the US as a mediator since 1988 we kept our promises our commitments and our relentless investments and efforts to achieve the two-state solution we stayed the course we stayed on the negotiating table for 26 years non-stop so those who say we walk away from negotiation come on grow up we have been over negotiating if you want the truth and during these 26 years my friends America could not bring itself to the level of an honest neutral mediator but we kept on we kept on you know why we kept on for 26 years because the us during all that time did not change its promises did not change its policy it remained committed to the two-state solution on the 1967 borders unfortunately no more by the 6th of December 2017 the US has reneged on its own promises has reneged on its long-held US policy and has violated international law but let us set the record clear here very clear there will be no deal there will be no deal no agreement short of fulfilling the international resolutions that we have long accepted there will be no deal that does not fulfill the very right righteous legitimate historic rights of people in all Divine's what happened was not taking Jerusalem of the table my friends but removing the table altogether removing the table all together since the start of the peace process in 1991 we have never and will never negotiate the principles please hear me out here not once from the Madrid to the Oslo to the roadmap to name it however we accepted to negotiate the principles the principles would be listed on page 1 of all these agreements we were there for 26 years to find ways with our Israeli neighbors and with the international community led by the u.s. to implement these principles no one no one has the right to undo these principles but however yet we will not succumb we will not succumb to the current reality and we will work with you and with the million of peace-loving people worldwide to protect our vision to maintain our commitments and to keep working towards a two-state solution our alternative to this unilateral acts is not unilateralism our alternative is multilateralism multilateralism we are calling for the ending of the exclusion of the international community our President Mahmoud Abbas expres nted in the Security Council only in February the Palestinian peace plan the PPP I hope you all going to also revisit that plan it's crucial in that plan he called for the convening of an international peace conference by mid of this year that international conference by the international community should provide a way forward for the two-state solution should provide a mechanism for implementing international resolutions my friends it is not only the absence of a state of Palestine that is keeping the grave injustice it's not just the absence of the state that is keeping the injustice but it is the presence of Israel's military occupation that sustains and deepens the morally the morally corrupted system of hegemony subjugation and segregation for those who believe in the two-state solution the goal must be one ending the military occupation ending the military occupation ending the military occupation for peace can no longer my friends afford ambiguity and there are few who are very ambiguous on purpose for justice can no longer be left to spend doctors and self-centered politicians and we have many of them these days peace is too noble too precious long waited for and the one thing that will make it nearer is the clarity of the undivided undivided values and principles and the clarity of our joint purpose and action what will produce peace my friends is us all of us standing united to read the Israelis the Palestinians the region and the rest of the world of the plague named military occupation [Applause] our people and I must go faster I'm about to finish but our people are being humiliated incarcerated terrorized and killed every day we cannot afford processing the peace process another hundred years as maybe the Israeli current government wants to we want it now it's urgent very urgent and we see that it's not all about the despair surround all of us but it's also about the hope and I'll give you a few examples of the hope that fills our hearts the first is that we also see the responsibility to us to as many Israelis that they see their children and grandchildren and they think of their future we see we see that despite there's uncertainty and the vicious attacks by the anti peace camp we still have the hope because of our people the Palestinian people the Palestinian people in boudreaux's in Berlin in a lean in Nabi Saleh in kavorka doom in Jerusalem in July in Gaza the last two weeks adopting mass non-violent means coming up with creative ways we see that power coming out when people are using prayer matrices to declare their rights and to defend their rights as happened in Jerusalem we take absolute note and we are heart warming of Palestinians Palestinians and by the way unfortunately accidents road accidents happen regularly in the West Bank and it does warm our hearts when Palestinian ordinary citizens rush to save the lives of Israelis who are involved in these traffic accidents because in the end it's our humanity that comes first before anything else [Applause] Bob Hope is the young American Jews like the brave souls in F not now F not now hope is the Israeli human rights group Beth Salem [Applause] hope is Israeli peace activists that immediately went to Gaza last week look these really soldiers face-to-face to hold them accountable for the lethal actions and targeted killing of Palestinian civilians that is hope for us hope is Tamar Sandberg is she here the Mohr's am bring calling on her government to investigate fully what happened in Gaza hope is rabbi Eric a Sherman who stood up to subtler extremists beating hem before continuing their job of beating the Palestinian farmers hope is the many many Israeli activists who stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us as we struggle to end the occupation it warms my heart to know we have allies like you and like them back their allies with such courage and conviction to stand up for what is right you are not dreamers but realists you are not dreamers but realists you understand too well that the best future is a future that shines just as bright for Palestinians as it does for Israelis [Applause] that's what I see in this room the hope for all sides to live together we also take hope from American leaders principled leaders representatives and I'm humbled that the man who will take this stage be after me as Senator Bernie Sanders [Applause] we noted his courageous brave defense not of Palestinians but of the American values he represents we noted his defense Sanders senator Sanders of the rights of people in Gaza and all over to protect the right for peaceful protest it is their right to protest peacefully and we take hope from the many many many American youth all over all over who are doing one thing they are no longer considering the American values to be undivided the values of freedom of justice of liberty of potential and prosperity we see them everywhere they are growing the public opinions are showing that the American public particularly youth give us hope and certainty I'd like to end here by saying this you in this room give us then give the cause of peace real real hope the hope that keeps us going despite all the above that hope will get us through these difficult times we promise you and towards a better future remember my friends the road is long and tiring it is it is us however that are winning it is us that are waiting because we are on the right side of history [Applause] we stay strong together and uphold our shared values for equality human rights and justice across all divides do not let the current circumstances discourage you you know better than anybody else that the best antidote to discouragement is action through action we create the future that we want my friends and I believe that we are much nearer to the future we want than those who are pulling us away from the future we want we are striving for a just peace and our striving for just peace starts with ending occupation together my friends let's keep the March thank you very much [Applause]

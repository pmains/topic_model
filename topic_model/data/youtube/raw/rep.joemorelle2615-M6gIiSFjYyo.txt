i feel like um i'm in the middle of a bad dream it's 2022 and the united states congress could be having a argument about whether or not there's a right to contraception this is the 21st century and the idea that the government of the united states or of the various states would somehow get in the middle of a question around family planning that is about as personal and intimate a decision that anyone could make and until just a few weeks ago i think everyone assumed was a constitutional right because the supreme court has repeatedly said it it's just hard to process i really feel like this debate might be more appropriate to 1870 than it is to 2022.

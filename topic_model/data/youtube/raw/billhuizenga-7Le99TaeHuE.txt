the my background is real estate as well as a few of the others that are here and and when I was in real estate back in the early 90s and into the late 90s FHA loans were extremely difficult to get they were very unusual and we're sort of that last resort because they did go to those that were underserved and I'm glad to hear your position I hope that's a clear position you have shared with the Senate who has pushed this increase on the FHA loan limits and I encourage you to continue to do that and talk with them as we're trying to readjust this I do have one quick question on page three of the report that you had given us talking about the underserved borrowers part of that you there's a note that 50 let me read fifty six percent of all first-time homebuyers in 2010 according to National Association Realtors were FHA buyers is that my reading and understanding it correct that is their estimate that's okay so do you believe that fifty percent of fifty-six percent of all first-time homebuyers are underserved buyers what I would say is that we have a dual mission as far as I understand Congress's creation of FHA in normal times to serve underserved borrowers but that in times of crisis where there's a lack of private capital for FHA to act as a counter-cyclical force and to be able to serve a broader group and I think that's in fact what's happened during this crisis and i think the the fact that it's fifty six percent of first-time buyers is to some degree a results of that lack of private capital so i would certainly expect and in fact would hope that that number would go down and return to a more normal level but that certainly is not a level that i believe is the right level over longer term and in normal time i would hope so as well and and the counter cyclical element role for FHA I think leads logically to the next question is should all of these first-time homebuyers these sub 700 credit score buyers I think that it was noted 580 was was a score that was was out there and should these people be in a position to be buying homes it would be happy to spend some time with you showing the performance data I think the fundamental question is if they're buying price home that can afford with a product that is going to be safe and sustainable and they demonstrate that they can be successful homeowners that's what we're looking at and and certainly the performance we've seen the improved performance tells us that by and large they can be successful home and I think that's a fear that a lot of us have in this current economy with the job situation as it is that that may be more risky which goes back to a number of questions about requirements for reserves and those kinds of things so you would you would I believe it was mr. Ackerman who had asked you a question and talked a little bit about bailout for FHA your exact quote was we don't need one thus far the page 13 what you're making the claim at the current underwriting and and premium structures have created an actual area actuarial a sound basis for growing capital at a rapid rate in the economy I for one am pleased that it sounds like it's going to be an easy pledge from all of us on this committee to say there won't be an FHA bailout I don't know if that is how sure you are of that but I guess I'm looking for some reassurance that that the FHA is not going to need that that government assistance because that is what a lot of the concern is that number of us I have on this committee and and it's my concern as well and we've been working very hard to do everything we can to make sure that we protect the taxpayer to be clear the new loans that we're making even under the most severe economic scenarios that the actuary looked at would remain profitable so fundamentally what we're talking about here is a risk if the economy and the housing market perform worse than expected in the actuarial that is the risk that could push FHA's capital reserve and I can't tell you here today that that's a zero risk yeah but but doesn't that sort of go counter to your argument about you know the FHA is needed for counter cyclical and if you guys are that rock solid why isn't the private sector stepping in some of us would suspect it might be some of the regulators that have been sort of clamping down on amounts of loans that banks are holding and those types of things but I think you're seeing sort of that pushmi-pullyu I asked back to to some my concern at least my time has expired it and well continue briefly I would say I think we agree that we need to encourage private capital to come back and the fact that our market share is now shrinking is evidence I believe that are the steps that we're taking on premiums and on underwriting are in fact moving in that direction thank you and with that miss waters from California for five minutes

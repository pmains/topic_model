Hello I'm Virginia Senator Mark Warner
today I'd like to talk to you about the coronavirus outbreak and what it means
for the Commonwealth. As folks may know Cronavirus has sickened more than
82,000 people around the world. Almost 3,000 people have died, mostly all in
China. In the United States there have been 60 confirmed cases none of which
are currently in the Commonwealth. However the Centers for Disease Control, 
CDC, has stated that the virus is expected to spread within the US on some level. My office has been in regular contact with officials on the ground in
Virginia. Our priority is to make sure they have the resources they need and are
fully prepared to respond to any potential cases of coronavirus in the
Commonwealth. In addition, I've been closely tracking the actions of the
Trump administration and working with federal officials to make sure they're
taking this threat seriously. Earlier this month I wrote to the
Administration asking them to redirect available public health funds to combat
this virus and to inform me and my fellow senators of any additional
resources they may need. This week, the Trump administration asked Congress for
2.5 billion dollars in order to contain the coronavirus and to try to prevent
it from spreading further in the United States. Now, I'm reviewing that request, but honestly, based upon the initial feedback of public health experts, I'm concerned
that the Administration's response the date may not be aggressive enough to
effectively combat the virus. I'm also concerned that we'll need a more robust
response, particularly in funding, if we're going to be fully prepared. I plan
to continue working with folks in the Commonwealth and at the federal level to
ensure the health and safety of all our fellow Virginians. In the meantime, I urge
all Virginians to heed the CDC advice including travel advisories and tips on how to keep your family safe for more information visit

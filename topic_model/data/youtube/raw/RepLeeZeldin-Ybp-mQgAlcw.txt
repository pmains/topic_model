sir Speaker I oppose UN Security Council resolution 2334 an anti-israel anti-jewish attempt on behalf of pro-palestinian nations to delegitimize Israel and ethnically cleanse East Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria the Jewish people the Israelis have long been willing to compromise large swathes of land in this region in pursuit of a two-state solution it has been the Palestinians who have time and again declined real offers on the table for their own state just think about this reality if the Israelis agreed right now to make all of the concessions this UN Security Council resolution calls for there would still not be peace a viable two-state solution isn't just about Israel recognizing the Palestinians right to exist it's also about the Palestinians recognizing Israel's right to exist as for me I stand for freedom and America should stand strong shoulder to shoulder with Israel President Obama little menorah this year at the White House he reflected on Hanukkah as a celebration of the Maccabees fighting for freedom the Maccabees who lived prayed and fought in the land that this resolution now calls a legal occupied territory it is an insult this resolution was passed just one day before the start of Hanukkah Israel is one of America's greatest allies and a beacon of freedom and liberty in a very dark region of the world the Obama administration by allowing his resolution to pass is attempting a dangerous shift in American foreign policy that cannot be allowed to stand I encourage all of my colleagues to support this resolution I thank chairman Royce for his leadership I yield back

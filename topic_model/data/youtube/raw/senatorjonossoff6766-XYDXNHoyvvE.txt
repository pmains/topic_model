thank you ms osborne columbus georgia relies heavily on a hub and spoke model of roots for its bus system and there's great interest in increasing the capacity of riders to get directly from one destination to another rather than having to return to central stops and central stations can you talk about how we could reduce ride times for the residents of columbus and support economic growth by expanding roots in columbus yeah um i i think that something that senator smith just mentioned out of the university of minnesota and what i've worked with from the university of wisconsin in measuring access to jobs and services can be very instructive in determining how routes might change and give people better uh crosstown connections and even circulator connections we carry a lot of great data in our smartphones about access to various destinations and it's probably time to deploy that to our transportation system and planning so that people can have the most efficient access to the things they need

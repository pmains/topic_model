subject now because this well caught some people by surprise sanctuary city officials pushing back on the Trump administration's latest crackdown effort now the Department of Justice is threatening to subpoena state and local officials who fail to provide evidence their jurisdictions have been cooperating with federal immigration authorities this move is prompting some city mayors to skip a White House meeting with the president yesterday the president went after their decision my administration is committed to protecting innocent Americans and the mayors who choose to boycott this event have put the needs of criminal illegal immigrants over law-abiding Americans and then those mayor said this on the very day where in principle they were telling us they wanted to have an honest dialogue this proves there was no intention to have an honest dialogue I came down here ready to have a serious meeting and what I got was a publicity stunt from the Trump administration I can't ever recall a situation where someone who professes to want to work with other people punches them in the face first and says now I'd like to talk to you and the idea that the president United States and the Justice Department would arrest any one of us for believing in our ideals and carrying out the law of our city is wrong fundamentally wrong okay let's just write this down we're talking about places inside of America that Harbor illegals go yes well it's the president Trump wanting to work with these local municipalities because he cares about our nation's rule of law he wants to strengthen our immigration policy he want and the American public wants to see a more effective consistent immigration policy and wants to work together now these local mayors they may totally they may be part of the resistance they may be protesting the president they may want him to fail they may been part of the group while the president's hand was on the Bible calling for his impeachment but go go to the meeting what's you know talk it out it's my B if why not just show up I mean you and I talked about this yeah I in general I do think people should go to meetings and they should sit down and talk and they should have dialogue I also think the White House sometimes gets itself into trouble by having these meetings on the books and then saying something the inflammatory before it's supposed to happen or changing the subject I mean they thought this was originally supposed to be about infrastructure which they all wanted to talk about and then all of a sudden there was this shot across the bow before the meeting I think sometimes White House is a shot across the big change that you're putting it they changed the terms right before the meeting in a really controversial Wes White House is gonna stick to where it said it would be on this particular issue about the issue Melissa so I just think I mean it is amazing to me that a city cannon or it can ignore federal law I mean that just the very basic version symbol at the bottom of this is amazing to me I mean I've said it before but I will never forget the time I was in the back of a New York City cab and you had mayor de Blasio used our tax dollars to put together a PSA where it's saying on the television he's touting how he is going to ignore federal law not cooperate with ice and not turn over criminals that he has in his possession who are already in custody and are wanted on other warrants and he thinks that this is something to brag about and use tax dollars to make an ad about and it's just you can't ignore a federal law I know I can't I mean it's interesting about this is congressman is this actually is not the furthering of turnover who you have this is can you just let us know that you're complying with the law yeah and if you look at the numbers that have come out of Ison's President Trump has come in almost a hundred percent of the people who end up getting deported are people who either were they were removed from the country and they came back or they committed another serious offense these aren't you know all the people who are getting removed it's not that they are you know getting a traffic ticket right in front of the studio here and then they get deported you need to work together because it's almost a hundred percent and ice has made a point of it in their press releases that we had sex crimes ms-13 human trafficking drug trafficking these are serious issues that the federal government wants to tackle and it turns out that that you do have crimes getting committed but people who aren't here legally Wow and what if people are scared to come to the police and report crimes because of their status that's also not a good thing so we'll see

[Music] former Navy SEAL dan Crenshaw served our country for ten years including multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan losing his right eye during his third deployment and yet he's still not done serving now he's running for Congress in Texas and just defeated state representative Kevin Roberts for the Republicans spot on the ballot 7030 this is a new op ed declares vote veteran to get the job done so is this part of a new an important trend let's ask GOP congressional candidate in Texas and retired Navy lieutenant commander Dan Crenshaw sir first of all congratulations on your on your win thank you you what you you got two that runoff because you were a distant second before that people more money was spent by other candidates from outside groups four other candidates what was different about the race you ran that led to that vote which is 70/30 is not a small margin of victory now well you know what our campaign really caught fire and it caught fire because we were able to inspire others you know I like to use Reagan's quote the greatest leaders are not the ones that do the greatest things they're the ones who get the people to do the greatest things and with just one supporter after another that they really drove our campaign to the finish line and it was such an amazing thing to see it was such an amazing thing to see so many people get inspired and I think that just comes from being authentic running an honest campaign don't necessarily tell voters what they want to hear but just be clear with them be honest with them and you say our country needs leaders not politicians you authentic what did you tell people that they didn't want to hear that still drew them toward your campaign you know we talked about hard issues we talked about entitlement reform we talked about the real world out there you know the real reason that we have troops overseas and why that matter is when we're trying to protect Americans here at home these are not easy things these aren't your typical political talking points but voters can take them voters are smart so you're saying the premise that a voter is smart as opposed to being dumb and being need to be told what to do or that they'll just abide by a campaign ad because they saw it you're a you were able to cut through that with us an authenticity putting the flag first people are yearning for that absolutely that and a lot of hard work you know a veteran candidates are disciplined we're fast learners and we can also adapt to new facts on the ground without getting too emotional I mean that's just staying mission focused I think is important when you're running at a campaign like this going up against hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars in this case dan did you think you could win we we always thought we could win now I'll tell you what we always got told right away hey thank you for your service when this doesn't work out we hope you still stick with it and my wife and I saw that we're like oh no how about we just win or why would we get into this why would we put ourselves through this if we didn't intend to win and and that's exactly what we did and we're really we're really proud of the way we ran this campaign of course it's not over we still need help going into November we can't fall asleep at the wheel well sometimes the political class even if they do appreciate it can be patronizing hey kid nice try thanks for your service we'll see you in ten years when you're ready to be a congressman you blew right through that part of that is understanding what service means this is Memorial Day weekend we remember those who gave everything as a vet we spent so many tours on the battlefield talk to me what what Memorial Day means to you I'm glad you asked Memorial Day I mean it is about celebration you know across America right now the the it's festive or barbecue and we're fireworks there's we're hanging out with our family but here's the thing Memorial Day to a different class of people means a different thing and that's the warrior class that's that's the men and women who have been overseas in combat and it's their families who hold down the home front you know into them here's all they asks they ask that you do not forget to remember and that is so important and here's another thing I think we should be asking of people remember why these men and women fell in the first place then they fell so that we could live so that we could continue serving our country and serve our community I think that's what they asked and Crenshaw perfect way to summarize appreciate your time

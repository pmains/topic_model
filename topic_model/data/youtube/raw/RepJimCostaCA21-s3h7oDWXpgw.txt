good morning everyone and I want to thank all of you for being here this morning the Subcommittee on livestock and foreign agriculture will now come to order this morning's subject matter is the implementation of the farm bill international food and assistance and development programs an effort that our country has been engaged in for decades and a program that I believe as our programs I should say plural real merit and in in in so many different ways you know addresses the the basic needs of humanitarian assistance around the world and really as the richest nation in the world I think puts America in responding to the needs that are so many out there and really shows as attempting to put a very best foot forward we went up here from the testimony this morning from our two witnesses on the implementation of last year's bipartisan reauthorization of the farm bill as a relates to international assistance and the development programs that were part and parcel that reauthorization last year 80 million people around the world required food assistance that we participated I suspect the numbers greater than that over a hundred and fifty million children under the age of five are stunted it's believed as a result of malnutrition by various international studies more than 11 million people alone who have been displaced in Syria and Yemen that are living in refugee camps we know have been suffering for years as a result of that civil war and clearly we and the European Union and others are doing what we can but I suspect more needs to address that certainly what I've spoken to the king of Jordan and others they talk about the great impact that those refugee camps have had according to the United Nations the risk of hunger and malnutrition could increase by up to 20% by the middle of this century as a result of climate change and increased population and let me give you a little perspective on that about three years ago the planet clicked 7 billion people now to give you some perspective over 200 years ago we had 1.7 billion so in two hundred years we've gone from about 1.7 billion people to 3 years ago over 7 billion people and it's estimated by the middle of this century there will be an additional two billion people throughout the world that's 2 billion more people that need nutrition and need a reliable source of nutrition that goes beyond subsistence so that's the challenge out there and obviously as the chair and members of this subcommittee participate I also have the good fortune to be on the Foreign Relations Committee and we look to see how we can it mitigate and solve these programs through a combined of the best of bipartisan leadership that we have in our country and so that bipartisan leadership goes back decades the mcgovern-dole food for education obviously whereby senators Dole and Senators McGovern that provided progress and and food for peace to build a more prosperous world that provides assistance from American people and when you look about that efforts going back in the 1980s to today and fast forward last year we provided almost four billion dollars in assistance from the United States in a host of these different programs four billion dollars that's significant in in the fiscal year 2018 the mcgovern-dole food for education program reached over 4 million of the most vulnerable women infants and children and food for progress provided nearly 70,000 people to improve their technologies for food for peace and entitled title two programs served over 35 million beneficiaries and a paraphrase a great comment the President Reagan indicated it's as opposed to providing food which is always so necessary if you teach people hot up who's using a fishing analogy but if you teach people how to grow food then they can be subsistent on their own and that's what these programs attempt to do to enhance our national security obviously put our best foot forward and that increases global security stability resiliency and cooperation other efforts like the farmer-to-farmer program the borlaug program and the cochran fellowship help expand technical skills across agricultural value chains in the developing world I've seen that firsthand in India and it really is a program in which the Indians take great deal of pride in and support and it's obviously changed India's ability to provide food for themselves through these efforts we are promoting international partnerships that are critical in this day and age harmonizing standards that lead to I think mutually beneficial trading relationships because when we have the same standard of food quality and food safety obviously we can engage in greater trade through these efforts we are promoting international efforts that I think reflect Congress's bipartisan support so we will request from this administration that these programs continue to bring together a diverse set of important domestic stakeholders and these are stakeholders are American farmers ranchers dairy men and women who provide that food who produced that food nobody does it better than the American farmer and in providing that that support we improved livelihoods and we build partnerships throughout the breadbasket of America and at the same time we address disasters that occur for a combination of reasons around the world so it's in that role that this subcommittee will ensure and we want to hear this morning how these programs changes from the 2018 farm bill are fully implemented I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and I in consultation with the ranking member pursuant to rule 111 e-excuse me I want to make sure that members of the subcommittee aware that other members of the full committee may join us today and I'll defer to the ranking member for his comments at this time

now to a story you'll see only on fox 11 the halls of capitol hill in washington are full this week of people with important perspective on foster care it's a dream come true alexandra vaughn is overjoyed to be sitting next to karen bass shadowing the congresswoman on capitol hill after a tough road in the foster care system it was a lot to take on xandra started in foster care at age six she lived in multiple homes and even spent time in juvenile hall the whole time when you're focused on trying to survive and trying to get basic needs met and all these different things you're not really focusing on oh let me go to college after a young person turns 18 or 21 we cut them off of services the average student in foster care goes to three to five high schools forty percent experience homelessness by age nineteen twenty five percent are involved in the criminal justice system by age twenty and just three percent graduate college when we as the government intervene in a family and say that this child is in danger of abuse or neglect then the government becomes the parent alexandra is one of 40 current or former foster youth chosen from around the country to shadow their member of congress and put a face on the foster care system congresswoman bass started this program a decade ago and it is bipartisan having the young people here on the hill raises the level of attention and it's one of the few issues that democrats and republicans come together on bass says she would start something similar if elected la mayor you better believe we will have young people shadowing members of the city council and department heads in l.a county 50 of the homeless were once involved in foster care dealing with this problem is a key strategic way of addressing one category of people who we pass through the streets every day in those tents alexandra says the solution can be simple all they need is one person to care that's it for exandra that one person was a counselor at moreno valley college she told me there is so much power in your voice alexandra is now 29 looking to advocate for foster youth professionally she's already a leader okay but what i envision for her in the future is that she'll be sitting in that chair instead of me the shadow program continues on the hill tomorrow congressman bass is working to make sure it remains in congress once she departs congress because she's leaving obviously to run for l.a marin obviously nobody's advocated for foster use more than you it's great to see this a lot of champions out there and she truly is one of them has been for a very very long time alexander way to go i love it

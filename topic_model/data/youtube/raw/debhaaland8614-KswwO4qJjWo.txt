hi I'm Deb Holland today's Labor Day and my thoughts are with my grandma who taught me what hard work is all about I'm thinking about my parents who both served this country in the military the bakery where I worked throughout high school and the small business I own my thoughts are with my daughter Selma and hoping I've done enough to demonstrate these values and lessons so she understands the value of hard work this Labor Day I'm grateful for labor unions and everything they have done for our country like the 40-hour work week the weekend and ensuring workers have fair wages benefits and the right to organize and bargain every day we should be standing up for and standing by workers throughout New Mexico and throughout our country this Labor Day I'm also thinking about how much work we still have to do workers deserve paid sick leave women are still waiting for equal pay for equal work we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage and we must defend unions because they are responsible for building our middle class today is Labor Day so make sure to thank a worker take a break tomorrow we'll get back to work and we'll keep fighting for New Mexico and for our country [Music]

[Why are you in riot gear?] [I don't see no riot here] [Move back, move back], So I hope that that everybody has thought
of taking the time to think about why you're here, and not only why you're here but what are you willing to loose. Are you willing to risk an arrest are you
willing to have your name smeared? [Touch one, touch all] your reputation questioned Lose your job, lose your home. What are you willing to risk? I remember being 14 and being harassed by police This thing is real so we'll keep on going into every single municipality we have to in St. Louis County and in St. Louis City until
we get what we need, and that's freedom and justice for all Let me tell you we don't love this. We don't wanna go up and down into the streets
and block stuff and all of that We don't want to. We want to hang with our families and
do the things we're supposed to be doing. Some of us are running for office we got less than 30 days to make a difference but were here we're here right now

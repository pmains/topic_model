Thank You mr. chairman Speaker I rise today to oppose this bill so-called reins Act and to urge my colleagues to act now on behalf of jobs for America's workers and jobs are the lifeblood of our economic growth and that of the middle class which is the backbone of our democracy mr. mr. chairman for the more than 330 days the Republican majority has failed to put forward a clear jobs agenda choosing instead to choose to propose initiatives that undermine job creation and only benefit don't interest today as we approach the end of this year Republicans have again refused to vote to expand the payroll tax cut for the middle class and unemployment benefits for those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own they risk the economic security really of all of us certainly the 99% but we're all in this together as our presidents president has said Democrats have been clear we must not go home for the holidays without extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance benefits we shouldn't be leaving hardworking Americans high and dry over this holiday season without doing their work this challenge poses the question why are we here Republicans have chosen to be here for massive tax tax cuts for people making over a million dollars a year not having a million dollars making over a million dollars a year 300,000 Americans Democrats are here for the 160 million Americans facing tax cut uncertainty because of Republican inaction but Democrats are here for everybody for all Americans because we all benefit from a strong middle class with demand inject it into our economy to create jobs indeed if we fail to act now on the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance consider the consequences of that reduced demand to our economy at least 600,000 jobs will be lost don't take it from me respected independent economies economists have stated that over 6 million out-of-work Americans would lose assist in the beginning of next year now consider if we do act and act we must putting more than 15-hundred dollars in the pockets of the typical middle-class family and every dollar invested in unemployment insurance yields a return of more than one dollar and fifty cents in economic growth what's important about that is what it does to inject demand into the economy money in the pockets of hardworking Americans that's what we want this Congress to pass instead of being so completely wedded to the idea that if we give tax cuts to the top one percent there will be a trickle-down effect it hasn't happened as we approach the end of this year Congress has a responsibility to address America's top priority jobs creation and economic growth it's time for us to put the interest of working people ahead of the special interest we must act now to reignite the American Dream and build ladders of success for anyone willing to work hard and play by the rules to remove obstacles of participation for those who wish to do that we must spur our economy put people to work and strengthen our middle class no we should not go home for the holidays without passing the middle income tax the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance and SGR there are other issues that need to be addressed that affect America's great middle class mr. chairman christmas is coming the booths is getting fat please to put a dollar in a workers hand I urge my colleagues to vote no on this reins act and to get to work to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance for the American people only then will we increase demand on me create jobs promote economic growth and put money into the pockets of 160 million Americans think of the difference that will make instead of putting forth legislation that has no impact on our economic growth is not in furtherance of job creation is not in furtherance of strengthening the middle class which is the backbone of our democracy we can't go home without the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits for all Americans who need them who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own with that mr.

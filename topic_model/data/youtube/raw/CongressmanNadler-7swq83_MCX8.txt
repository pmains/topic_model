Thank You mr. Speaker I rise in strong support of HR 401 oh the congressional subpoena compliance and Enforcement Act of 2017 my support of this legislation is tied to my view of our committees responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch nearly a century ago in McGrane versus Doherty the United States Supreme Court framed that responsibility this way quote a legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions in which the legislation is intended to affect or change and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information which is not infrequently true recourse must be had to others who do possess it unquote in other words it is our responsibility to ask for the information we require to do our jobs effectively and the Constitution empowers us to enforce those requests if we are at first denied we should be very clear on this point Congress does not require a statute in order to enforce the subpoenas in federal court we notice of course because in 2008 the House Judiciary Committee went to court to defend that authority and ruling in favor of the committee the court held that the Bush administration's claim of absolute immunity from our process quote is entirely unsupported by existing case law unquote in effect both government officials and private individuals have a legal obligation to comply with a duly issued congressional subpoena whether or not the bill before us today is enacted into law still this legislation is useful as a means to codify certain practices and to expedite enforcement of subpoenas in federal court it also puts the house on equal footing with the Senate which has had a statute in place since 1978 allowing that body to enforce at least some of its subpoenas in federal court I want to thank chairman Goodlatte for working with us to make sure that we strike the right balance this bill both protects our existing Authority and mitigates many concerns about abuse of subpoena power by a runaway committee I also want to thank mr. Issa the gentleman from California for his leadership on this issue we often disagree about the issues we should prioritize for oversight but I suspect that we stand together on the importance of oversight both to our committee and to the Congress as a whole I ask that my colleagues support them I thank the speaker and I reserve the balance of

mr. president the Senate is on course to consider profoundly misguided legislation this proposal is known as the Marketplace Fairness Act but it is anything but fair the Marketplace Fairness Act is unprecedented in its reach to discriminate against the Internet employers and states with modest or no sales taxes as the Internet economy has evolved through innovation and as it expanded because of the value that the innovation enabled traditional brick-and-mortar businesses are seeking to compete through legislation big retailers effectively seeking a legislative bailout have allied themselves with state governments who see the Marketplace Fairness Act as an opportunity to obtain new tax revenue without enduring the political consequence of enforcing their own tax laws in their own jurisdictions it's always easier to put the burden of collecting taxes on the people who can't vote for you isn't that right mr. president the Marketplace Fairness Act is going to hobble the Internet economy and constrain online commerce it is in my view a recipe for economic stagnation it would rain in the Internet economy that's helped lead our country out of the recession that began in 2008 what this proposal does is give each state the ability to require online businesses outside of their states to enforce their tax laws it enables the state of Indiana or the state of South Dakota to require online businesses located in New Hampshire to collect sales taxes on their behalf let me repeat that mr. president the Marketplace Fairness Act could require New Hampshire a state that has determined not to have a sales tax New Hampshire businesses to collect sales taxes for goods or services provided to consumers in Indiana or South Dakota and then send money to those states the proposal in effect unleashes all the nation's tax collectors on small internet businesses internet entrepreneurs who have neither the ability to enforce the terms of the Marketplace Fairness Act nor the political influence in this city to be able to shape the legislation the Marketplace Fairness Act takes the net down a dangerous path because its passage would endorse the notion that Internet entities should be required to enforce laws outside of their home jurisdiction foreign countries have long pressed the notion that the internet should be seated to their control let me repeat that mr. president has been an objective of a whole number of our global competitors over the years trying to in effect get control over the Internet there's no difference in New York telling Oregon internet firms to enforce New York laws in China telling American firms to enforce China's censorship practices as it is already many countries are seeking to actually put the United Nations in charge as the Internet's regular regulator in chief and this bill to a great extent endorses that world view today the Senate is being asked to consider schemes to allow states and localities to essentially essentially nationalize their taxes but tomorrow the Senate may be asked to consider similar schemes and forth laws and regulations about content for example and other issues that are so important to the powerful and the well-connected the president that the Marketplace Fairness Act establishes takes the internet the American economy and our society down a dark path it's a path towards the future where governments can impose their values and their regulatory regimes on internet businesses anywhere it is a future in which the sovereignty of the country and the sovereignty of our states is significantly eroded beyond these issues the proponents of the legislation are spawning myths about the bill that just aren't true one myth is that the Marketplace Fairness Act levels the playing field they're going to argue mr. president that the Marketplace Fairness Act levels the playing field between bricks and mortar firms and internet companies for purposes of collecting and remitting sales taxes but the facts are the facts mr. president and they indicate otherwise furthermore even a Best Buy knows that the consumer resides in Washington DC because best buy provides the consumer with a credit card or rewards card that's associated with the Washington DC address best buy is still allowed to assume that the television will be consumed in Virginia the Marketplace Fairness Act in my view is a targeted strike against the internet and a targeted strike against the digital economy another myth that's being put forward is that this myth that the mfa isn't about new taxes that the proposal is about enforcing taxes that are already owed but the fact of the matter is the taxes that would be collected as a result of the Marketplace Fairness acts passage have generally not been collected so these are going to be regarded mr. president there going to be regarded as new taxes this is money that's going to come out of the pockets of American families that has not come out of their pockets before collecting sales and use taxes for goods or services that were acquired in another state has long been a low priority for state and local governments because these taxes go uncollected and unenforced the establish the establishment of an unprecedented regime to collect them so the first time is going to require American consumers to pay more sales taxes and pay more use taxes furthermore the creation of this new trans state enforcement ski we'll create significant new incentives for states to establish new sales taxes and new use taxes and also to increase the tax rates that exist now for these a particular items ultimately the Marketplace Fairness Act is going to require consumers to pay an additional 22 billion dollars in sales taxes they have never had to pay before in fact unless the US pursues the types of international arrangements to govern the Internet economy the types of arrangements sought by China and a host of other states foreign internet retailers will only continue to have the competitive advantage that the market faith Marketplace Fairness Act would artificially provide them that mr. president is not what the American economy needs that's not what's going to promote online innovation and value I hope my colleagues will oppose this Marketplace Fairness Act it is premature it is more than anything else mr. president it is coercive it is coercive now we're going to hear about how simple this is back when we started writing the first bills about technology in the net as president we said the key principle is do no harm this is going to do harm just this past weekend die was in a southern oregon where we have many small retailers we have one in Grants Pass Oregon Fire Mountain gem it's an exciting new business online but its up against very tough international competition and what I fear is unless there is a thoughtful effort along the lines of what chairman Baucus is trying to do in the Finance Committee to think this through this bill in a global economy will give foreign retailers a significant leg up you're going to have people on the northern border of the United States or the southern border of the United States they're going to say I want to do business in the United States I'm a patriotic American but there are more than 8000 taxing jurisdictions in America and if we force our businesses are online retailers like the ones that I represent in Southern Oregon to spend their time and their money trying to comply with scores and scores of tax regimes that are thousands of miles away it's going to be very tough for them to compete with foreign retailers this violates the basic principle that we began a decade ago mr. president with respect to technology and that is do no harm do no harm to the cause of innovation ensure that we have fairness bricks and clicks together which is I think the future of the American economy this bill violates that basic principle of Technology Policy it will do no harm and I urge my colleagues to oppose it and it's premature consideration by the full Senate the president I yield the floor

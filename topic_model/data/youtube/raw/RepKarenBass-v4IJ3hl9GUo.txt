time [Music] so precious it's yours [Music] [Music] i never want to waste your time [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is mine [Music] [Laughter] [Music] oh [Music] she said love me like you pray i'll be gone for so long [Music] hello everyone and welcome to the virtual reception for the 2022 37th congressional district art competition my name is jacqueline hamilton i'm district director for congresswoman karen bass and i run her los angeles office i'm so pleased to have you join us today every year uh we have hosted the congressional art competition and for most i've been with the congresswoman for almost nine years and for most of that time i've had the privilege of running this program and it always brings me joy every year hundreds of youth and their families have joined us over the years actually we're probably up to over a thousand now um it was always held in some place interesting for the reception it was always hung in a way that we treated the art respectfully regardless of the level of skill of the artist whether this was their first art class and first time submitting or they were very accomplished and had had multiple years of visual art teaching we always wanted them to know that their work was welcomed and respected by us and uh we still want to do that even though we have to do it virtually we had to suspend in-person shows for two years during the covent surge for obvious reasons and then this year when we were collecting everyone's work we were in the middle of the covid omnicron surge so we had to collect their work virtually which meant that we were not able to mount this last show as an in-person show so we hope that this virtual show will also let the students know how very much we appreciate them and their artwork and that they'll continue to engage in the public and let us see their beautiful work whatever happens for karen bass in the future she will not be a member of congress next year and so this is the last time i'm hosting this competition and she as well so those young artists who are still in high school next year can look to a new member's office to submit their work every member of congress pretty much participates in the congressional art competition so we're still doing our best to serve the talented artists who entrust us with their work and we're really pleased you could join us today right now i'd like to introduce the chair of our art committee lisa vasquez in addition to her day job she runs an educational organization called cooking with gabby which serves as fiscal sponsor for the art competition and for most of the time that i've been running the art comp she has also been uh chair or co-chair of this committee and made a huge difference in the resources we were able to bring to bear on this competition so without further ado i'd like to introduce lisa vasquez for a welcome and to introduce the congresswoman oh thank you jacqueline and hello everyone welcome and hello everyone i'd like to welcome all of you also to this year's art competition um my name is you know is lisa vazquez and i absolutely love supporting creative young artists and people who and that is really the biggest reason i agree to chair the art competition um for congressman member bass i hope this virtual reception will tell all of our students um and those who support them that we see you that we value you and that we want you to connect with your elected officials like karen bass who make important decisions on their behalf on your behalf every day when students participate in programs like this one it not only gives them a chance to improve their resume and to get some experience but it also gives them an opportunity to win some cash prizes and to know what's going on and it's important for our students to know what's going on in their communities and in and and it's also important for the congress member to know what's going on and it allows her an opportunity to know what's happening on the ground um in her district um as as you may know she has been um in congress for nearly 12 years and has held multiple leadership positions including um former chair of the congressional black caucus she also co-founded uh the uh congressional caucus on foster youth uh she chairs the foreign affairs committee our co-chairs the foreign uh as she chairs the foreign foreign affairs committee on africa and she is the lead or author on the george floyd justice and policing bill i could not be prouder to call her my congress member my representative our representative and so with that it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you congressman karen bass hello everyone i have enjoyed the chance to see the work of talented young artists every year that i've had the privilege of serving in congress this year though is a little bittersweet as it's my last year in congress and therefore it's my last art competition every year i am surprised by the breadth and depth of the work submitted to my office and this year we had over 156 entries representing 16 high schools and 19 teachers i do miss viewing the art in person and meeting all of you as we have done so many times in the years past since the art was collected virtually during the height of the surge we could not put on a show in a gallery but i know that you will enjoy seeing the work today even on your screens and i hope you will visit my website with the links to view all of the pieces in your own time so i want to begin by thanking my district director jacqueline hamilton who took over the art competition for my district eight years ago with the help of her husband david valentine a dedicated artist and arts educator she broadened the contest's reach and together they formed an art competition committee made up of working artists and community leaders who support the competition and form our judging panel i want to thank all of the art committee members but especially lisa vasquez who co-chaired the committee with david for years and continues leading it today every year jacqueline and david and any staff and volunteers they could wrangle each year made sure that the student art was treated with the respect for the art show and many students saw their work treated professionally for the first time by entering our contests but i am sad to say that we lost david during the pandemic but today we remember him by naming the first prize in his honor the david valentine memorial art competition prize i'm pleased to award this prize to this year's winner miss remy sakahara who you will meet shortly her artwork really was so important you will also meet last year's winner of the david valentine memorial prize amelia common her artwork spoke to me because it displays a young person with a backpack on her back that is also like her house she travels back and forth between her two parents homes and sometimes feel like she lives out of her backpack this reminded me of the work i do with foster youth who often feel this way you may find themselves shuttling between placements and their own possessions are what they can carry amelia joined us for last year's virtual reception but she didn't get to attend a large reception in dc due to the pandemic but nevertheless we got her to dc anyway so that she could see her art displayed in the halls of the capitol you will get to share that experience with her shortly i now leave you in jacqueline's capable hands and i'll see you at the end hello everyone welcome back and thank you congresswoman we really appreciate your support through all of these years um i wanted to take the opportunity to show you a little bit of that david valentine's work he was my husband for 30 years and we miss him terribly every time we come to the art competition now we'll think of him and i wanted to give you a chance to see some of the things that he produced over his lifetime as a working artist so we'll do a brief um one minute slideshow of some of his work in just [Music] david was executive director of an organization called la guest artist series which means working artists into classrooms high school classrooms in order to show students art students what their options might mean for making art is for self-expression and moving into a career as art as well [Music] we used a wide variety of media including collage and painting and computer graphics [Music] thank you all very much i i hope you'll take a chance maybe google david valentine artist and take a look at some of the rest of his work which is still up on the web i'm very very pleased now to um be talking about um the uh amelia cameron who congresswoman bass mentioned um we did get a chance to do a virtual art competition last year but then when she went to the capitol um we were able to take a video and edit that down into something really nice to be able to talk about her work and you'll be able to see the same thing for this year's winner remi tukahira very shortly but let's roll right into sharing amelia cammon's experience in the u.s capitol the first prize of the competition is a trip to the u.s capitol to see your artwork hung in the tunnels underneath where everyone travels millions of people travel throughout those tunnels to get back and forth from the capitol building itself to the congressional offices where uh different members of congress have their staffs and uh the art has been hung there for over 50 years now and each year they put the art up usually in the middle of the summer and they take it down in the spring when they're ready to hang up the next year's artwork so amelia was able to and remy both were able to see their work in the capitol [Music] well i've entered a few years but i realized that the past years that i had entered i didn't enter something that was very personal or meaningful to me as i've grown in my art i've realized it's just very important to share your life story and your personal stuff with others because they can relate and it's it's really important to be vulnerable and others can connect with you and it's just really special the piece that i entered in this competition is called my backpack and it's inspired by my life experiences and experience with parental divorce and how that shaped my experiences in school specifically with my backpack and it just has always felt like i carry my life around because it's really heavy full of my personal items my clothes books my favorite things and it's just always been like a physical burden and an emotional burden as well but i just wanted to share that with others [Music] i think it's just meaningful and important to create art that's personal to you and share that with others and especially like at a younger age because it's more of a brave thing to do and like i don't see it too often and i think there should be more of that [Music] this is so amazing i never could have imagined that i would have been here today i'm so surprised but it's like it's such an honor and i just want to say thank you so much to representative karen bass i just love that we have the resources to be able to honor the artwork that way let me tell you a little bit about how we structure the congressional art competition each member of congress has the ability to decide how they want to honor the artists in their district some have uh elaborate dinners and some just display the winner in the capitol others do a variety of things to honor their artists um we have a structure in the program so that we take in all of the artwork and we sort through it we want everyone to know that they we've seen their artwork everyone gets a certificate of participation and on that certificate of participation it lets you know how far along you got in the judging so if we were happy to see your artwork but we were done looking at you you you are a participant if you made it to the second round of judging you're a semi-finalist and if you went before the art competition committee uh and the official judges then you were a finalist and then obviously we have the honorable mentions who are winners and they'll get a twenty five dollar uh gift card cash prize and we have first second third and fourth place winners so uh we also do our best to make sure that those pieces get seen and you'll see those uh everyone's artwork at the end of the competition um we are moving now to uh a spot to show the honorable mentions and the fourth third second and first place winners i'd like to really congratulate them all you'll be able to read their names and um rebecca tyman who you'll hear from in just a minute after this is going to narrate us through it so rebecca please take it away i'm very proud to present to you the 2022 uh california's 37th congressional district art competition winners honorable mention goes to sila aaron in 11th grade from new west charter school would look

valentine memorial prize winner goes to remy sukahira 9th grader at new west charter high school for her drawing of her grandmother grandma sukahira congratulations to everybody thank you very much rebecca and congratulations to all of our art winners we had uh first second third fourth place and nine honorable mentions we really felt we needed to to honor um and so our next thing that we're going to be able to show you today is uh the video that we were able to shoot for remy sukahira's visit now this year that we did succeed congress succeeded in having the live reception so i was really glad that she and her family were able to experience that uh remy went with her mom and her dad and normally speaking and again this year finally what happens is there's too many kids 435 members of congress have uh winners is too many people with their guests to be able to do them all at once so they split the alphabet and uh normally speaking alabama through michigan uh will go one day of the week and then a few days later they'll have minnesota through wyoming and remy wasn't able to attend the first one because she was traveling uh with the school trip but she was able to go to out of the alphabet the second one and it happened that day amazingly that they're the supreme court was handing down some very important decisions so she also got to see democracy in action and got to see people out protesting it was an interesting day for her to be her she and her family to be in the capital i had the privilege for the very first time in all of the years that i've done this of attending the art reception the big art reception in dc myself i've always run and curated the reception that we have here in los angeles but i hadn't seen what they do for the you know all of the different kids from all across the country obviously i've been able to be in the tunnels quite a few times and every year i always look forward to the opportunity to go and see uh what the kids have posted who's done what from where it's an amazing array and in just a minute i'll post the link to the congressional institute which also has you can look at all of the historical entrance winners from every congressional district across the country i'll post that in the chat so people will be able to go and see who else won from where what their work like looked like and i hope you'll enjoy that as well i've also posted in the chat the flickr link so that you can look at all of the pieces submitted to our art competition at your leisure and there will be a link on our website as well the bass.house.gov website i want to take a brief opportunity to say how very important it is for us to stay connected to you as our constituents it's important that young people understand that they don't have to vote in order to be influential if you have something you really care about you have other people in your life who do vote and if you've informed yourself about something you can help them be informed about it as well in addition the fact that you either think the member who represents you whether it's at the city county state or federal level the fact that you think they don't agree with you does not mean they don't need to hear from you they need to know that you disagree and the fact that they agree with you or you think they do also doesn't mean you shouldn't call them because i'll guarantee the people who disagree do call so it was it's just really important to stay in touch with your members uh your elected representatives at every level of government i know that when karen bass uh she tells a story about when she was first elected to the state legislature she was was elected with a ground spell of community support but then she got up there expecting that people were going to continue to tell her what was most important to them and she had to turn around and organize her own constituents to keep in touch so it's really really important you have a city council member you have a supervisor at the county level you have an assembly member and a senator at the state level and then you have a member in congress currently it's karen bass and you also have two senators as well as the president so it's really important for you to stay in touch with all of those people um now i'd like to turn take this opportunity to introduce the video that we were able to shoot with ramitsukahira and her family about her visit to the congressional uh the big congressional reception and her ability to see her artwork uh there in the tunnels underneath the capitol where there's also a nifty subway that she got to ride so you'll see that as well [Music] i decided to enter this art competition because my art teacher at school brought it up so i decided to submit my work of my grandma my artwork is a graphite drawing that i made of my grandma t and the reason i drew it of her is because she's one of the biggest inspirations in my life and one of my heroes when she was a little kid she was in put into the internment camps with her family and she had to go through many hardships and to be where she is now being able to still smile have such a positive attitude and be such a bright person it's just an inspiration to me and she's my hero being able to meet all these important people and see where everything comes from and having my representation and having my drawing of my grandma being up at the capitol it means a lot being able to be here is just such an honor in the future i want to of course make sure art is part of every day of my life i still don't know what kind of job i want to go into but i want to make sure that even if it's just a hobby i want to make sure that i'm still doing art and making things that i love [Music] thank you remy and thank you to her family for really i had the pleasure of shepherding them through the capitol building and it was a really wonderful experience they're lovely people i always enjoy meeting every year's winner and their family if they have one to come with i'd like to point out that you don't always have to have a family to go we have uh selected former foster youth or current foster youth in the past um we've selected people who one year we had a young man who was at just amount of homelessness so it's important to remember you have opportunities and some of them can open doors for you i'd really like to thank our art committee right now and take the chance to let them know how very much i appreciate working with them over the years most of them have served on the art committee for much more than one year and have uh raised money so we could give out cash prizes and in some cases support the travel of a winner who would not otherwise be able to take the trip and also who have helped us with getting through the judging there are a variety of professional artists and arts educators uh you've already met lisa vazquez our committee chair executive director of fiscal sponsored cooking with gabby for the prizes and travel support provided to our winners i'd like to thank faith mitchell and presley burroughs long time supporters of the art competition rhonda brown working artist and long time art teacher at crenshaw high school and i'm hoping she'll be able to return to teaching art shortly she's been teaching other things for a while i'd like to thank the talented art sims owner of 1124 design studio he's the artist behind among other things movie posters for many spike lee movies and the marvel movie black panther it's wonderful to have working artists making a living make being creative on our committee zack seidel who is our communications director for congress member karen bass is also an artist himself a trained artist and i really appreciated his participation and then finally i want to thank rebecca tyneman she's a member of our committee without whom we wouldn't have been able to build quite such a strong program she's also the education manager for a wonderful organization here in los angeles called reiman arts it's named for herb ryman one of disney's nine old men who made a lot of the backgrounds for many of your favorite legacy disney movies classic disney movies she has worked for the non-profit reiman arts for nearly 15 years and i'm looking forward to having her talk about what reiman arts is and the opportunity that might exist there for some of the students who are here or your friends if you know of other people who ought to be able to um uh take advantage of some art extra arts training you don't have to want to be a professional artist in order to take advantage of the reiman arts program but it's a wonderful way to develop your skills and also make some great friends so rebecca please take it away hello everybody i'm so happy to be here it's always been such a pleasure for me to be able to be part of this um competition annually um i'm going to share in the chat information about talked about so it'll be there for you but um thank you so much jacqueline and i want to make sure everyone knows that the congressional art competition is open to all high school students living in the 37th congressional district but not everyone has access to visual training at school and the reiman arts program offers intensive out-of-school training for high school students any high school student can apply we have classes on saturdays cal state fullerton campus and on sundays at the otis college of art and design campus and i just put in the um chat our website and also my personal email if anyone is interested up to applying many of our um winners for the congressional district art awards have um been from ryman arts program and other great art programs and actually as i was watching remy's video i saw in the background one of the other artworks on the wall i recognize it from our program so from another congressional district um so it was great to see so it's no coincidence that many of the student artists here today participate also participate in reiman arts um and i want to say how proud i am of all the artists who have applied it's wonderful to see you um see your work i know it's really hard to put yourself out there you're all so busy and to add one more thing like applying to a contest um is just really impressive and that um what it takes to go through that to apply for something i just really applaud every single student who participated this year i'm really proud of you and i hope you keep applying for things keep making art keep putting your art out there um because the more you do the more you'll gain from it the more all of us came from because we're all the better for having seen your work and seeing the roots of your labor so congratulations everyone now back to jacqueline hamilton and thank you very much we look forward to the rest of the program i really can't encourage you strongly enough to check out reiman arts it's free to participants so if you haven't been able to afford art classes elsewhere this might be just the thing that you're looking for and again i really appreciate rebecca and her all of her partnership over the years we're going to wind up this virtual art reception with a slideshow of all of the amazing art that was submitted by this year's talented artists i want to say to all of the

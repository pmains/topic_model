  YOU? >> THE ACTION OF ROSEN THERE,  TWO HOURS. ADAM SHIFF WHO LED TUESDAY'S  HEARING IS HERE. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.  >> TWO MORE HEARINGS THIS COMING WEEKS, DELAYED TWO WEEKS. CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE BIT  MORE? WHAT MORE HAS COME IN AND ON  WHAT SPECIFIC AREAS HASÑi MORE  INFORMATION COME IN THAT YOU  FEEL YOU NEED MORE TIME? >> THE NEXT COUPLE OF HEARINGS  WILL COVER THE RUN-UP TO JANUARY 6th, THE MARSHALING OF THIS MOB  THAT APPEARED ON THE MALL THAT  DAY AND ATTACKED THE CAPITOL AND THE FINAL HEARING WILL COVER  WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS DOING AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT HE WAS  NOT DOING AS WE WERE BEING  ATTACKED.  >> IN THOSE HOURS, NOT JANUARY  6th t(ñrITSELF.  >> EXACTLY. BASICALLY, THE PRESIDENT'S  FLAGRANT DERELICTION OF DUTY  WHILE THE CAPITOL WAS BEING  ATTACKED AND THIS WILL GIVE US  MORE TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE TWO HEARINGS. A LOT OF WORK, AS YOU MIGHT  IMAGINE, GOES INTO EACH AND  EVERY ONE OF THESE HEARINGS AND  LEARN MORE INFORMATION ALL THE  TIME THAT WE WANT TO  INCORPORATE, SO THIS WILL GIVE  US MORE BREATHING SPACE TO DO  THAT.  >> YOU'VE SPENT A COUPLE OF  HOURS WITH A DOCUMENTARY  FILMMAKER, GOT ALL OF THE VIDEO  INFORMATION. DOES IT ADD ANY FACT THAT YOU  DID NOT KNOW? >> YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO CHARACTERIZE BECAUSE WE HAVE  INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES  THAT THE PUBLIC HASN'T SEEN YET, BUT ITÑi CERTAINLY ADDS TO THE  FOOTAGE OF THAT DAY. SOME NEW PERSPECTIVES THAT WE  HAVEN'T HAD, AT LEAST CAPTURED  ON FILM. I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO FAR  AHEAD. PART OF WHAT MADE THE HEARINGS  SUCCESSFUL IS THEY'RE A  COMBINATION OF WHAT'S ALREADY  KNOWN AND THINGS THAT THE PUBLIC HASN'T KNOWN YET, AND MOST  IMPORTANT, WE DO TRY TO TIE IT  ALL TOGETHER AND SHOW THE PUBLIC WHERE IT ALL FITS ITS PIECES.  >> LOOK, ONE OF THE, IF THERE'S  A SEARCH FOR A SMOKING GUN HERE, IT IS TO FIND EVIDENCE THAT  DONALD TRUMP KNEW HE LOST BUT  WENT ABOUT THIS ANYWAY. HAVE YOU FOUND SPECIFIC EVIDENCE THAT HE KNEW HE LOST AND THAT  THIS BELIEF DEFENSE IS ONE THAT  IS JUST NOT GOING TO WORK? >> I THINK WE CONTINUE TO SEE  POWERFUL EVIDENCE OF THAT, AND  JUST THIS WEEK AND EVERY NOW AND THEN, YOU SEE SOMETHING THATçó  TELLS YOU A MICROCOSM OF WHAT  IT'S ALL ABOUT. IN THE LAST HEARING, THE  PRESIDENT SAYING TO TOP JUSTICE  OFFICIALS, JUST SAY IT WAS  CORRUPT AND LEAVE THE REST TO ME AND REPUBLICANS AND REPUBLICANS. THAT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY THE  PRESIDENT AFTER MAKING ALL THESE FRUITLESS CLAIMS OF FRAUD AND  BEING TOLD, THAT'S NOT TRUE,  THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T CARE. WHAT HE WANTED THEM TO DO IS  JUST SAY IT WAS CORRUPT AND  JEFFREY CLARK, THIS ú;■UNQUALIF  ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYER THAT HE WAS GOING TO PUT AT THE TOP OF THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, DRAFTED A  LETTER TO GEORGIA, FALSELY  CLAIMING OF THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT BELIEVED THERE WAS  FRAUD TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION  AND CALLED THE LEGISLATURE BACK  INTO SESSION. THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTOOD THAT  ALL OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  LEADERSHIP THOUGHT IT WAS  COMPLETELY BOGUS AND HE WAS  PREPARED TO GO ALONG WITH IT,  EXCEPT FOR THE THREAT OF MASS  RESIGNATION.  >> THAT MEETING, JANUARY 3rd,  TWO HOURS FROM THE  CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, IS IT  WHEN THAT FAILS, SHOULD WE THEN  SEE THE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN ON  PENCE THAT BASICALLY BEGINS 48  HOURS BEFORE JANUARY 6th? IT INTENSIFIES. DOES THAT NO-GO INTENSIFY THIS? IS THAT THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE  THERE, THE CONCLUSION WE SHOULD  DROP? >> I THINK YOU SEE THE PRESSURE  CONTINUE TO BUILD AND BUILD AND  BUILD. THESE LINES OF EFFORT THAT WERE  FAILING, WE'RE NEVER COMPLETELY  WALKED AWAY FROM. THE PRESSURE ON THE STATE  LEGISLATURES CONTINUED RIGHT UP  TO THE 6th, THE EFFORT TO GET  THE STATE ELECTORS COUNTED BY  THE VICE PRESIDENT, THE FIRST  CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE VICE  PRESIDENT. ALL OF THAT CONTINUED BUT ON THE 6th, THE LAST DITCH EFFORT WAS  TO GET THAT CROWD TO STOP WHAT  WAS HAPPENING IN THE BUILDING,  AND WE SEE THEN THAT JANUARY 6th WAS NOT A DAY IN ISOLATION. IT WAS THE CULMINATION OF  SEVERAL EFFORTS TO OVERTURN THE  ELECTION. >> A COUPLE OF THINGS, THIS  WEEK, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE  CERTAINLY LET THE PUBLIC KNOW IT WAS DOING A LOT MORE ON JANUARY  6th THAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. I THINK THERE WERE SUBPOENAS  SERVED ON AT LEAST NINE PEOPLE  IN FOUR STATES, A SEARCH WARRANT WAS EXECUTED ON A HOME OF  JEFFREY CLARK. YOU'VE BEEN CRITICAL IN THE PAST OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. YOU FELT AS IF MAYBE THERE WERE  BEING A LITTLE PASSIVE, DO YOU  STILL HAVE THAT CRITICISM OR DO  YOU LOOK AT THEIR ACTIONS THIS  WEEK AND DOES THAT REASSURE YOU? >> IT CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT  THERE'S A GREATER SENSE OF  URGENCY THAN I'VE SEEN BEFORE. AT THE SAME TIME, I HAVE YET TO  SEE ANY INDICATION THAT THE  FORMER PRESIDENTÑi HIMSELF IS  UNDER INVESTIGATION, AND I  CONCUR WITH WHAT JUDGE CARTER ON CALIFORNIA SAID THAT THERE'S  SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO BELIEVE  HE VIOLATED MULTIPLE FEDERAL  LAWS, AND YOU CAN'T HOLD ANYONE  IMMUNE. YOU CAN'T SAY, THERE'S A  DIFFERENT STANDARD, DIFFERENT  RULE OF LAW FOR FORMER  PRESIDENTS, PARTICULARLY, WHEN  YOU TOOK THE POSITION WHILE IN  OFFICE THAT THEY WERE INDICTED. >> THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED RIGHT  NOW AND INDICTMENT OF A FORMER  PRESIDENT COULD THROW GASOLINE  ON THE FIRE, CHOOSING NOT TO  HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE COULD ALSO  THROW GASOLINE ON THE FIRE. NO GOOD OUTCOMES HERE. WHAT'S THE WORST OUTCOME ON THAT FRONT? DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY BE REALLY  STRUGGLING WITH THIS DECISION? >> I THINK IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION, BUT I DON'T THINK,  THAT IS, TO PROSECUTE. NOT A DIFFICULT DECISION TO  INVESTIGATE WHEN THERE'S  EVIDENCE BEFORE YOU. AND I THINK THE WORST CASE  SCENARIO IS NOT THAT DONALD  TRUMP RUNS AND WINS, BUT THAT HE RUNS AND LOSES AND THEY OVERTURN THEIR ELECTION BECAUSE THERE'S  NO DETERRENT, BECAUSE THERE'S NO EFFORT TO PUSH BACK. >> WHAT IF YOU PROSECUTE AND HE  GETS OFF? >> THAT'S ALWAYS A RISK, BUT THE FACT IS THAT IF YOU FALL THE  EVIDENCE WHERE IT LEADS AND A  DUTY TO PROSECUTE AND THE  DECISION NOT TO INVESTIGATE OR  NOT TO PROSECUTE BECOMES A  POLITICAL DECISION THAT THI

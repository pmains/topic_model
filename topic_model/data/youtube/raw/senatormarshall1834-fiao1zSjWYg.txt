Senator Marshall thank you madam chair I want to start by echoing ranking member Burr's comments concerned that for all practical purposes this committee is going to spend a trillion dollars over the next 10 years and there's been no input from the minority I was sent here to save Medicare and I'm afraid what I'm seeing could destroy Medicare that already Medicare is on its way to a to a financial crisis I'm concerned that when we expand Medicare it's going to dilute it for those senior citizens that we have already I want to turn now and and talk about unemployment and vaccine mandates as you all know we had record unemployment through the coveted epidemic uh partially mainly because the government shutdown and Kansas like many states just did horrible trying to filter through the unemployment issues our office got more calls and complaints about about trying to access the unemployment program than any other issue it dominated our phones and our emails for over a year probably the biggest fraud we're going to see from the trillions of dollars we've appropriated for covid will be unemployment fraud Kansas is estimated to have 700 million dollars of fraud I'm going to guess the Nationwide it'll be 70 billion dollars 70 billion dollars that could have went uh towards hard-working Americans who needed the help on top of this now the White House has issued a vaccine mandate which is going to so many people are going to lose their jobs and going to go back to unemployment now my phone again blowing up from small businesses from big businesses they're telling me maybe 30 to 50 percent of their line workers the blue collar workers are not vaccinated they don't plan on getting vaccinated this is a personal choice they've made this vaccine mandate is a slap in the face of so many people that ran to the battle the nurses the doctors the ambulance drivers our police officers they developed natural immunity because there was no vaccine the natural immunity well proven to be better than vaccines but the CDC and this white house will not acknowledge natural immunity so you can see that we're on the path and more record numbers of people becoming unemployed because of Joe Biden's vaccine mandate so my question obviously is for Mr Rodriguez you have little of any experience dealing with unemployment how will will this experience and we see unemployment rates Spike again here in the next several months due to this vaccine mandate what is your plan to help Kansas and other states be able to handle the problem better Senator thank you for your question um and thank you for the the concern you have for your for your constituents uh during very difficult times uh you know the the president and the administration are so committed uh to making sure and reducing the number of unvaccinated Americans decreasing hospitalization um making sure and and it's primarily because they're trying to protect life but also because it allows us to make sure schools can remain open uh that's not my question yeah I think look I'm in favor of the vaccine I've been vaccinated my parents vaccinated I hope they get the booster shot this week but there's a group of people no matter how much you pontificate no matter how much Dr fauci pontificates it's not going to get the vaccine there's going to be a spike in unemployment what are you going to do to help prevent this fraud from reoccurring and help kansans get their unemployment insurance in a timely fashion absolutely and as as you know absolutely the the the strength of uh the unemployment system uh is not where it needs to be still uh prior to the pandemic uh we know uh that there were long-standing challenges so what's your Solutions we don't need to describe the problem again I've described the problem what are your solutions to the problem if confirmed uh my goal would be to carefully monitor the 53 unemployment systems and make sure the right people are getting the right benefits on time uh it would be to support the administration's ongoing efforts to provide assistance to States um I described you know a little earlier uh particularly with security and identity verification issues um but also to help States streamline their systems a lot of these systems are outdated uh in some states they were outdated when they you know came online we're talking about 1980s technology in some states and also to enforce the laws regarding unemployment um you know to make sure that they're fairly administering the programs I share your commitment to making sure that these systems work we hope that uh we we don't have uh another crisis but the Administration has been committed and you see it in the president's budget proposal to making sure that we the the 21st century unemployment system also has mechanisms to automatically ramp up and currently our systems are not able to do that but they should be able to it's an administration's priority and they've also said that they want to adjust the funding mechanisms to make sure that uh that our unemployment systems are more Nimble when it comes to Staffing and resources Etc so if confirmed I'd be honored to work with you in making sure that our our systems are strong secure and accessible thank you I yield back

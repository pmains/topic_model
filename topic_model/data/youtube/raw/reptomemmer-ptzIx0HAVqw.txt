hello everyone I'm Tom emmer today I'd like to take a moment to recognize National rural Health day this is a day when we recognize the unique challenges that our rural communities face when seeking Health Care over the past few years we've seen rural hospitals and health care clinics close at a staggering Pace this has left too many Americans questioning where to turn in the event of a medical crisis we have long been working to address this care Gap in Congress I've been a long time advocate of the benefits that Telehealth can provide where doctors and nurse practitioners can provide over-the-phone assistance to patients in need virtual visits give rural residents the convenience and confidence of an in-person doctor's office visit from the comfort of their homes and it can even provide prescriptions in certain situations our rural residents also suffer from higher rates of suicide and mental health challenges when compared to Americans in other areas for that reason we've worked hard to provide increased resources for mental health care in our rural communities our stress act which provides farmers and Rural communities with additional Mental Health Resources was included in the 2018 Farm Bill earlier this year I sent a letter to my colleagues in the house a letter urging Strategic investment in rural Mental Health to our rural communities know that you are not forgotten a national rural Health day we recommit to ensuring our rural constituents have the Health Care Resources they deserve and they need to lead happy and healthy lives

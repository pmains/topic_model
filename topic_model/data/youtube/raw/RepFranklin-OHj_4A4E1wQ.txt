thank you mr chairman general walters to follow up on representative walt's questions uh i'm still a little confused about the messaging on what we're doing in poland a week ago the national security advisor said we were doing no training then president biden said we were and then yesterday a senior administration official said that u.s troops help ukrainian forces in poland load weapons the west gives them as they do so they provide verbal instruction on how to use the weaponry like anti-aircraft missiles but don't don't lead ukrainian forces through physical drills very mixed messaging it's confusing to to all of us did anyone in the white house coordinate any of those statements with you as the as a supreme allied commander in europe no congressman uh not asking you to elaborate in this setting specifically what we may or may not be doing with ukrainian soldiers i'll defer that to a classified session what is your military advice on publicly talking specifically about how we train the ukrainians i think can you can you quantify that quest i'm having a hard time grasping what the question is well i'm should we be talking publicly about what we're doing specifically on the ground tactically with with our allies uh not publicly congressman thanks so general uh i think we've witnessed a change in defensive tactics uh during this invasion of ukraine that few really expected how we've all seen decimated russian armor columns and the takedown of relatively sophisticated fighters by cheap and plentiful weapons i know there'll be a lot for tacticians to chew on in our war colleges when the war ends but it already looks clear that the 20th century tactics of mass land warfare aren't as effective today as they were when eastern europe was last invaded during world war ii do you think the ukrainian strategy of low-cost high-volume kinetic weapons is a feasible strategy for future conflicts against competitor nations congressman i'm not familiar with all the parameters of the so-called ukrainian strategy but but but i will tell you that one of the things that makes a huge difference is is what's in the heart of the citizens and their support for the military activities and i think after this is all said and done when we go back and take a look at what transpired that is one of the areas that has made a big difference certainly up to this point and and we still have a long ways to go well clearly and we've all been just amazed at the the tenacity of the ukrainian fighters and i think there's a lot to be said for the training that we've conducted uh side by side with those allies uh not just the ukrainians and and and also uh the high impact of of relatively low cost things like uh drones stingers javelins you know it doesn't matter how many tanks you have if they can be taken out pretty simply with low-tech weapons do you think the calculus of investing in high value high tech long build time systems will or should shift in the dod to favor more nimble and expendable systems congressman i think that's going to be one of the areas that we have to take a deep look at and and that mixed with uh capabilities that are less elegant need to be factored into this discussion and we have to be willing to listen very closely about what we've learned and then we'll make adjustments roger that uh finally last question do you see the possibility of amending our current offensive and defensive strategies with the lessons we've learned we're learning in ukraine and if so what might those look like and i know it's early to be making those kinds of assessments i think we have to always be willing to adapt to change and and listen to every possible input in every part of of any conflict and and this is one of the areas that no matter how insignificant we think some issue may be we've got to pay attention to it and i i think if we're a good learning organization which the department certainly is we'll take all that into account as we press forward but yes we have to learn from what unfolded in this particular conflict we still have a long ways to go though thank you general now you're back

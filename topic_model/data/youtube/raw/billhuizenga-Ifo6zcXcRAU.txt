Thank You mr. Speaker I appreciate the opportunity and I rise today to in celebration of the first 100 years of the Charles a Conklin American Legion Post 28 in Grand Haven Michigan but before I talked more extensively about post 28 I do want to acknowledge this past week that that very auspicious ceremony and anniversary that was recognized of d-day and I joined the bipartisan group led by the Speaker of the House and the minority leader to the beaches of Normandy and to to talk with those family members those veterans who served there on those beaches was an incredibly moving thing especially for me the son of a disabled World War two veteran who nearly perished in a b24 crash in southern Italy and to just recognize and remember the sacrifices that not only those men that stormed the beaches but their families endured in the years after that and I want to just highlight some of the connections that we have had in West Michigan to those efforts and whether it was the City of Grand Haven which is where post 28 eight lies that upon the sinking of a merchant marine ship the Coast Guard Cutter the Escanaba raised public funds locally to literally build another Escanaba ship one that has continued that very special tie with Grand Haven and with those those members of the VFW post 28 the silversides a submarine that saw action in the South Pacific the LST that resides in Muskegon that took 31 trips 31 trips back and forth during that d-day invasion over those days that history that we have is rich and the history that that post 28 has is a history that comes of World War one something that we had just celebrated the Armistice of in last November the hundredth year anniversary and my namesake bill Huizenga had the privilege of fighting in that conflict and in that war as well and I have in my mind this connection that that all of those men at that time you know over a hundred years ago that they were coming together as a community and they were going off to fight for their country and for a hundred years now this particular American Legion Post 28 has selflessly admirably and honorably served the Grand Haven community with a special focus on veterans and their families and on June 12th of 1919 how this came about was 35 local veterans returning from this great war gathered at the Grand Haven Armory and signed a petition become chartered as the Grand Haven American Legion Post 28 they chose as their namesake Charles a Conklin who was Grand havens first fallen soldier of that war to end all wars while shortly after graduating high school Charles joined the National Guard as a machine gunner and was part of the prestigious 42nd rainbow division after ferocious fighting on the German front line Charles was wounded and died on May 7 of 1918 he now rests in peace at Grand havens Lake Forest Cemetery where his courageous spirit continues to inspire local veterans and all of our citizens to carry on his legacy of duty service and valor well after witnessing the positive impacts across West Michigan more veterans and their families wanted to join post 28 and the post 28 family first expanded April 9 of 1920 when the Women's Auxiliary post the unit 28 organized and was chartered and then for over a century as they continued to grow the sons of the American Legion Squadron 28 was chartered in 1937 and again in 1990 finally the America Legion Squadron 28 was organized in 2007 completing the post 28 family the American Legion Post 28 steadfast commitment to serving veterans their families and the Grand Haven Community shines in every act of service that they perform the long list of charitable and educational programs including the annual poppy sale the boys state and girls state programs that they support the good fellows Committee for volunteerism food drives and their famous salmon dinner night at that grand havens annual salmon festival not to mention the thousands of diners that they serve at the post home on Harbor Drive in Grand Haven really has underscored their commitment to the community so mr. speaker on behalf of the second District of Michigan we want to thank the members of the Charles a Conklin American Legion Post 28 in Grand Haven for their service to our community over the past century and I look forward to working with them in the years to come and I yield back

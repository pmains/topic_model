hello everyone and thank you for tuning in to our panel discussion today on the urgent need for immigration reform i am honored to be joined here today by ava malone mira coalition patricia montez from centro presented margareth shepherd framingham city councilor jose palma massachusetts pps committee yvonne espinoza lawyers for civil rights and mayhem chinese cultural connection thank you all for joining me for this discussion about the challenges facing our immigration system and the need to ensure that america can remain a beacon of hope for people around the world a rich diversity cultures backgrounds and experiences make our nation stronger immigrants are the fabric of our community the backbone of our economy and are at the forefront of innovation but for years our immigration system has been broken it has been almost two decades since the last substantive immigration reform was signed into law and our challenges have only grown since then as immigrants and refugees continue to seek a better life in the united states we need to create long-term solutions that respect the dignity and rights of immigrants and keep the american dream alive house democrats working with president biden and his administration have let and led by the congressional hispanic asian and black caucuses are committed to using every tool we have to provide relief to as many people as possible already in his administration term president biden has revoked the trump order that aimed to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census fortified and preserved daca reversed the muslim ban ended the so-called national emergency that trump instituted to justify construction of the border wall established the family reunification task force and rebuild refugee resettlement program and much much more but our problems with immigration did not appear suddenly and they can't be fixed with just a stroke of the pen hundreds of years of imperialism interventionist foreign policy and climate change have driven migration patterns beyond our current immigration system's abilities that's why house democrats have prioritized immigration reform in our work for the people already we've passed the american dream and promise act which will provide a pathway to citizenship for three million daca recipients other eligible young immigrants and tps temporary protected status recipients for dreamers whose only home is america certainty in their citizenship status is critical for their long-term success and mental health we also passed the farmwork force modernization act to provide agricultural workers with a path to earn legal status while working in the u.s and to reform the temporary work visa program people who grow and harvest the food we eat every day shouldn't be forced to live in the shadows especially during this pandemic when farm workers have risked their own health every day to keep produce on our tables the least we can do is act to ensure they don't live in fear but not only do we need to get these bills through the senate we also must do more to address the family and employment-based immigration immigration systems which include improved processes for high-skilled immigrants easing backlogs and establishing labor exploitation protections the creation of a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million people living here without documentation reforms to our asylum and refugee systems and family reunification we know that immigration reform can't wait because it's about real people it's about our neighbors and friends and it impacts our communities children sent here alone for a better chance at success refugees seeking shelter from violence and war workers just looking to provide for their families behind the xenophobic rhetoric the fear and the headlines there are human beings suffering and waiting and wondering when they can live freely in the united states i have traveled to the border and i will never forget these experiences or the families that are looking to america for a better life it's our job to remember each of them as we write policies that will allow them to achieve the american dream so let's dive into the discussion with the expert panelists that we have on how we can make that dream a reality and first i'd like to introduce my friend ava malona ava has served as president and ceo of the massachusetts immigrant and refugee advocacy coalition since 2008 a native of albania who practiced civil and criminal law before becoming the youngest district judge ever appointed to tijuana's district court where she served from 1989 to 1992 after immigrating to the u.s she directed the refugee resettlement program in central massachusetts before joining meera in 1999 initially serving as director of policy and advocacy then as deputy director she became executive director in 2008 and today is recognized both nationally and internationally as an expert and a leader on immigration policy and immigrant and refugee integration eva i have been so fortunate to have your friendship and partnership over the years as we have fought for protections for daca and to be tps recipients i would love to hear from you your thoughts on the two immigration bills the house has just passed and why quick senate action is so important thank you ava for joining us here this morning thank you uh congresswoman good morning everyone it's a privilege to be with you congresswoman and my distinguished colleagues uh sharing the stage with you and to the viewers thank you so much for joining us in this amazing discussion congresswoman i also want to thank you for your incredible leadership uh in congress about these bills but also generally speaking and to the massachusetts delegation for making immigration reform a priority i am also a proud naturalized citizen that love america with all my heart and working on immigration reform and immigrant integration at mira is um it has been really a privilege as you know amira is the largest um advocacy immigrant advocacy uh institution in new england and has been around since 1987 when the last immigration reform bill passed under president reagan that provided the path for 3 million workers to obtain their citizenship and be very much part of the fabric and mira has been in the front lines for 34 years to really promote immigrant rights and immigrant integration it's extremely important that we see integration and immigration reform as a two-way process one by which the newcomers do everything that they can to economically linguistically civically politically and socially integrate into the life of our society but also the receiving society provides the path for them to uh to integrate and make it easier for them to be part of our fabric immigration reform as as congresswoman articulated so beautifully has been in the works for so many years for two decades and i think we are very close to really getting immigration reform done the house democrats and nine republicans stood up with the majority of the american people to pass the farmwork modernization act and the dream act and these are two extremely important bills that will give a path to dreamers you know over 3 million dreamers across the country who are our friends our co-workers uh very much part of the fabric the daca program for the last seven years was one of the most successful integration programs in the world i would say not just in the country so the moment has come that you know congress needs to act senate need to act immediately to get this issue resolved justice has been denied for too long and dreamers are americans in every sense of the way they just need the papers and there is bipartisan support uh the house showed the way how both parties can work together to do what's right for the country and what's right for dreamers um the same thing with the you know with the tps holders their stories are very similar to the dreamer story they are very much part of who we are and one thing that we learned from kovit as much as hard as it was and it still is there is no recovery without immigration reform there is no recovery without the path to citizenship for dreamers for tps holders and you know for the 11 million across the country it is time that really sent out acts quickly i remember congresswoman in another event that we were doing together uh prior to the elections there were over 200 bills in in mcconnell's desk at the time that you know that the house passed and those were blocked the rhetoric was beyond what one can handle and the conversation was about politics i think time has come for us to talk about policy and why is it so important to pass immigration reform and to have a 21st century immigration policy for our country that is pro-family it's pro-value it's for its pro-economy and really reflects the values who we are as a country that america was built with the help of immigrants and we are as strong as our um our people and you know one of the things that i think people can talk about and can change the narrative is that immigrant workers um are and were in the front lines and they were the ones who kept the economy going um and what they need is just the proper paper so they can have a peace of mind and better integrate in our society here in massachusetts uh 20 of the workforce it's made of immigrants and there are 71 000 900 undocumented essential workers who were in the front lines who are in the front lines um i want to reca i recall the the story of our friend nerva that was part of our business immigration coalition who stated that she was working three jobs in the health care industry and she is also studying healthcare management and nerva's story is the story of hundreds and thousands and millions of in massachusetts and and across the country so time has come that our dysfunctional immigration system get updated it needs the modernization of the 21st century and it addressed not just the area of dreamers and farm workers but also the 11 million uh that are eager to uh to be on a path to citizenship looking also into the family immigration business immigration asylum and also detention detention should not be the norm should be the exception and we are the greatest country on earth um we learned so much for kovi that if we want recovery and we want to survive this we are in this together and um you know immigrants also are an asset to our country they contribute 1 trillion in gdp and 340 billion in taxes every year there were immigrants also helped get the vaccine so let's think about you know america it's all of us together and let's keep the us moving forward and you know my hope is being you know an advocate for immigration reform i also see myself being as an advocate for democracy so the sooner we the sooner we provide the path to legalization for uh all american workers in the country the stronger our democracy will be uh this is a moment that we cannot wait any longer the american people need immigration reform and even the the the fox uh polling right after the election stated very clearly that 71 of the voters uh for president biden won immigration reform and over 65 percent of the voters who voted for the other uh candidate are for immigration reform so the bipartisan support is there the support of the american people is there and it's a matter of justice that has been delayed for far too long and our country needs action uh thank you for the opportunity congresswoman uh i look forward to working with you meera look forward to working with president biden and uh pushing and our uh wonderful senators uh of massachusetts as well as um through other you know coalition members were working in 37 states to really push a 21st century uh immigration policy for our country oh well thank you so much eva for all your work and leadership and vision and compassion we are thrilled to have you here and as always to to your partner now i'd like to introduce patricia montez patricia is the executive director of centro presente one of the longest standing immigrant-led immigrant rights organizations in massachusetts she has previously worked in public relations and communications in both government agencies and non-governmental organizations in honduras as well as in television production for over six years patricia is a recognized immigration rights leader and a tireless advocate for just economic and social policies including a just u.s immigration policy she has served as the board chair of the boston women's fund she's also been a member of the international human rights mission to mexico and central america which has documented the violations of human rights of immigrants in their travels from central america to the united states patricia we are so glad to have you with us we know your time is short this morning we would love to hear your perspective on the root causes of migration and how we need to consider this context as we approach immigration reform thank you again congratulations thank you so much for organizing this space and also for their leadership not just about immigration reform but protecting the human rights especially of women and girls that is extremely important for us um as you mentioned for centro presente is extremely important to talk about not just about the crisis that we're facing right now at the u.s and mexican border but also the crisis beyond the border the crisis that central american countries have been facing for a very long time our organization center presented organizing political advocacy in order to protect human rights of the central american population both of our members have been coming to the boston area from central america since the 80s when there were civic conflicts in countries like el salvador that were displacing people during the 80s and now unfortunately according to the u.n honduras guatemala and el salvador are the three of the most dangerous countries in the region so that's why a lot of people are coming to the u.s and mexican border i also want to let you know that for centro presente is a priority uh definitely the immigration reform and the other bills that are at the the house right now and hopefully they will pass in the senate thank you for your leadership the secure ad the dream and promise act are very important for centro presente since the beginning of temporary protective stps we have been doing a lot of work around that currently we have more than one thousand members of central presented that are covered by by tps but we also follow the leadership of our friend and colleague jose palma who is here and so glad that jose is here who is actually a person who is protected with dps and he's you know doing a lot of work at the national level in order to pass a permanent residency for people protected with tps another element that is extremely important for us and is another build that passed like a month ago is the honduran human rights and anti-corruption act that was introduced and the senate by eight senators including our two senators so we're very glad that our two senators are supporting this bill why as i said before for centro presente it is a priority to educate the young republic policy makers the media and other actors about the structural causes that force people to come to the united states in our opinion the crisis is beyond the border the crisis is taking place in honduras guatemala and el salvador so we're glad that the binding administration is taking in consideration the root causes of forced migration and they are thinking about sending funding to these three countries but it is very important for us to understand the the deep crisis and historical crisis that central american countries have been facing and that's why we're supporting the human rights honduran human rights and anti-corruption act because we believe that it's urgent to understand the situation in the region and also re-establish the rule of law in countries like honduras for example i want to emphasize the case the particular case of honduras because it's not just about extreme poverty extreme violence it's also the endemic level of corruption and impunity that these places are facing right now and dividing administration included that part in the and the immigration proposal so we're so glad that for the first time in decades this is the only administration that finally is talking about addressing the root causes of forced migration specifically about people that are coming from honduras guatemala and el salvador we want to work with you and the other members of the congress to make sure that the rule of law is respected in honduras that we are able to reduce corruption and impunity in these countries in order to make sure that if you send money to these countries that money is not going to be used to continue militarizing our societies that that money is going to be used to protect basic human rights of the honduran people of people of guatemala and el salvador and of course we also care about human rights of other migrants but we talk specifically about central americans because according to the u.n half a million people try to close the border every year forty hundred thousand of them are coming from honduras guatemala and el salvador right now we have five minors that are in detention one of them is a little girl who was abused in el salvador and she's pregnant her mother is desperate we have been supporting immigrants giving financial support and giving food because the covet situation but we also are doing a lot of work in order to raise awareness about why people come and we're going to continue doing it because that's our priority thank you so much and the final thing that i want to say before i leave is that like a week ago today the the brother of the honduran president was sentenced uh in la to life and preaching plus 30 years because his activity on his narco activity for almost 10 years more than 10 years so it's not just about extreme poverty corruption and impunity it's also narco activity in your consciousness origin so thank you so much for your leadership for organizing this space and for supporting us in order to make sure that not just human rights of migrants in the united states are being protected but also human rights in our own countries whose origin are being protected thank you congresswoman oh well thank you thank you for joining us and for being such a champion for human rights and giving us uh context and understanding of some of the the reasons and push for migration um out of out of central america and we're so grateful to have you with us today and for your work and now i'd like to introduce framingham's city councilor margaret shepherd in 2007 margaret made history as the first

ignorance hungry economic and health despaired and dead we are succeeding on this task because we fought together government and civil society 24 hours a day as we continue our way out of the pandemic we also need to make sure to overcome the factors that make our fight so difficult the lack of education science is not a political burner it's a knowledge that needs to be shared with everyone economic disparity poverty hunger no health care prevention crowded housing are called the fertilizer and we had plenty of that on the immigration community social disparity when you'd embrace our diversity we need to empower our community and you ask what's the next steps which is the immigration reform that we dream so much at local level i think we need to do the same as we did do

video but he is the co-founder of the massachusetts tps committee coordinator of the national tps alliance and one of the most prominent voices for temporary protected status holders in our country today born in el salvador to parents who lost everything in the civil war he came to the u.s in 1998 at just 22 years old hurricane mitch struck el salvador that year and a devastating earthquake followed in 2001. recognizing how unbearable conditions have become the u.s government granted tps to salvadorans jose and his wife now have four children all u.s citizens he graduated from north shore community college with distinction and got involved in advocacy through the student immigrant movement and centro presenting jose served as political and organizing director for neighbor to neighbor from 2013 to 2016. he was a paralegal at justice at work a legal firm specializing in workers rights and when the trump administration began to phase out tps he decided to take action jose thank you for joining us for your leadership in advocating for permanent protections for tps holders we would love to hear more about your work and what the impact will be for our neighbors right here in massachusetts when we reach final passage of the dream and promise act thank you for joining us live from d.c good morning and thank you congresswoman for the invitation i think for me it is a pleasure to be here today because a few different reasons one it reminds me when we worked together when i was a center presented moving the secure act for the first time in massachusetts against that crazy program that we all know uh it doesn't work but anyway i as you said i am from el salvador i am a tps recipient and i have been a i would say a lucky person i have been in very difficult moments and uh difficult decisions to make but also i think it has given me a strength to face the difficulties that comes eventually in life i grew up in el salvador in the middle of a civil war with my parents pretty much leaving the place where they were living with the only two kids they have at that moment because because of the civil war they were told you stay here and get involved in the war or leave everything behind and you can just take your kids my parents decided to take their own the two kids one of them was me i grew up with the dream of going to college and universities but the situation in el salvador didn't allow me seeing my three little sister going in the same direction with difficulties to achieve the dreams i eventually decided to look for that opportunity in the united states i came in 1998 i went directly to massachusetts somerville was my first place to live in massachusetts and since then i have done different type of jobs from cleaning and buildings in downtown boston by doing milk delivery across the state and also moving to new hampshire and also going to college and graduating with an associate degree of paralegal and at the same time raising a beautiful family of four are citizen kids one one of them is actually 20 another beautiful girl who's 15 and beautiful baby boy 5 and a 2 years old that is actually the motivation to do everything i can at this specific moment that we were told you have six months to leave the united states and go back to your country that was a decision that i would imagine any of you as a parent you will say i will do whatever i can whatever it takes to defend my kids future and to defend my family i believe as a tps recipient i have been following every rule which is every tps recipient across the country has been doing the same and and the reason is simple we have to renew tps every year and a half we have to go into background check and we have to go into different ways and how we have to be behaving very well in order to keep tps we also uh have been very happy and lucky that the tpa has allowed us to achieve some things like for some tps recipients opening their businesses for some of us going to college for many tps recipients buying homes uh and many other things i can highlight but i will tell you what we have done since the trump administration came uh and telling us that we were supposed to go back after 22 years living in my case in massachusetts we as a tps community got organized we started the group in massachusetts called massachusetts tps committee and at the same time as you was mentioning i was par a very in the structure of building a national network called the national tps alliance which actually right now is holding a 43 days hunger strike to show the society that moving to permanent residency for tps recipients daca recipients and pretty much everyone should have the opportunity to apply for permanent residence is urgent we are here uh raising awareness uh because we feel the urgency despite many victories in court that is still protecting us down to october 4th our life continuing limbo some of us are thinking who's going to continue paying our mortgage if we were to lose our immigration status and we were to be put in deportation procedure some of us are still wondering like will i be around to support my daughter where she's applying to college and that is my story but that's the story of 450 000 families across the country with 16 000 right there in massachusetts salvadorian hondurans nicaraguans haitians nepalese and i can go with the rest of the countries but i want to say something else i want to say that i am happy that the strategy is getting understood in congress because i believe we need a comprehensive immigration reform to protect everyone but it's also true that due to the political climate and and what's going on in congress if we were able to achieve something as smaller we can call it but four million people protected it's not that small and for sure it will guarantee to our immigrant community that the democratic party our leadership is serious about the conversation and are taking every steps possible to protect as many we can right now and for sure the commitment from everyone to continue organizing and working hard to protect everyone i will imagine for many people that today talk bad about new immigrants i am sure if they go back a few years behind history i am sure their parents came with the same dream as we are right now looking for a place where we can contribute to to do this country even better and for our kids to continue building this great nation as a country that can show humanity and they show the lead for others to learn how to treat everyone who's looking for support and also to contribute to make it even better which is what many of us are doing in this country so i am happy to be with you all because i think it's kind of like a reunion a within friends but also talking with others that are watching and sharing some real stories and showing some ways and how we can move forward to find some solutions so i'll be here for more questions jose thank you so much it is so appropriate that you are coming to us from freedom square in washington dc you are such a voice for uh freedom for tps holders and really for each and every one of us so thank you for joining us next we are joined this morning by ivan espinoza madrigal yvonne is the executive director of the lawyers for civil rights and organization founded at the request of john f kennedy in the 1960s at the height of the civil rights movement yvonne has filed and won dozens of life-changing and law-changing cases on a wide range of civil rights issues including immigrants rights and lgbt hiv equality the national lgbt bar association has recognized him as one of the best lgbt lawyers under 40 and the boston business journal included yvonne in its top 40 under 40 list in 2018. he has received the boston bar association's beacon award and the president's award and the university of pennsylvania's martin luther king award in social justice my goodness a summa laude and phi beta kappa graduate of the university of pennsylvania he received a juris a juris doctorate from nyu school of law yvonne serves on the board of the new england foundation for the arts and eastern bank yvonne we are delighted to have you with us here today we know attorneys have been on the front lines of fighting for immigrant communities please share with us some more about your work in changes you would like to see to ensure every individual has equal access to justice and fair treatment under law thank you for joining us congresswoman it is a pleasure to be here with you i want to take a moment to thank you for your leadership and for convening us i also want to take a moment to thank this distinguished panel for joining as you mentioned congresswoman we have been very busy particularly over the past few years holding back the worst accesses of the trump administration through the courthouse and so what we have done is repeatedly sued the federal government to stop the dismantlement of critical immigration programs that we have already heard during this conversation for example we sued to stop the dismantlement of temporary protected status which is the program that my friend and colleague jose palma just described in great detail a program that had existed for over two decades as you heard him over republican and democrat administrations alike and yet it was under trump that that program became dismantled for absolutely no good reason similarly we have been fighting to maintain other immigration protections and programs like the ferdinand force departure daca and many other programs that have been in existence for a long time and that have never been controversial now that we are with a more immigrant friendly administration uh with the biden harris administration we really have an opportunity to focus on more affirmative measures not just defending immigration programs but creating immigration protections and relief along the lines of what you congresswoman have been leading and describing as part of this conversation and so i want to thank you for that we are strong advocates for comprehensive immigration reform for making sure that all immigrants who are in the position that jose palma just described or who are dreamers and daca recipients that all these folks are able to find a appropriate way of moving forward and this is critical here we cannot have a conversation about stabilizing our families our communities and our economy if so many lives remain in immigration and legal limbo it is critical for us to provide a pathway forward to stabilize these families just over the last couple of um weeks we have also seen the importance of taking affirmative measures just as the trump administration was unwinding it extended deferred and forced departure to venezuelans bringing them into a form of immigration protection a similar approach should be taken with other countries not just with venezuela so that we can avoid the crisis at the border another important remedy here moving forward is to make sure that immigrants have an opportunity to apply for immigration protection and relief in their home countries so that they don't have to journey from honduras from el salvador from guatemala to the border with texas or arizona or california if we provided those opportunities which the biden administration said it is actively considering then we will avoid having people come in caravans this will help stabilize the southern border so there are many other measures that we really need to be thinking about and at lawyers for civil rights we are happy to work closely with many of the folks in this panel to make sure that we can provide free legal support to people of color immigrants and low-income people and help address the immigration crisis so thank you congresswoman for providing us with this opportunity for dialogue well thank you yvonne and uh we we can't even imagine what you're gonna do in your 40s with all those accolades for uh the work that you've already done we're so um thrilled to have you and grateful for your for your legal work and for your advocacy and last uh but certainly not least i'd like to welcome my friend may hung executive director of the chinese cultural connection in malden a native of taiwan may came to america to pursue higher education once in the united states she developed a fascination with american culture while also maintaining a deep appreciation of her own chinese heritage at the chinese cultural center she has worked to use chinese arts and culture as a conduit to inspire people from all backgrounds to come together to connect understand and appreciate each other may earned her bachelor's degree from bentley university and a master's in education and psychology from tufts university she has also studied taiji for many years with renowned world world-renowned masters which has informed her teaching at boston university may it is great to have you here with us today please tell us more about your work to promote intercultural exchange and how important those cultural connections are as we work to shift the narrative around immigration at this critical moment may i think you're on mute okay okay there you go okay excellent well i first of all i'd like to thank you for including me and i'm so honored and at the same time very inspired um by having listening to so many incredible advocates uh activists and have so much background and experience in advocating for the immigrants immigration policy and and everything else and i feel it's such an incredible uh topic to be discussed because you know american is really an immigrant country and we really strive with other immigrants and i feel that for the recent situation um it's just even more of a very uh incredible um conversation that we have to discuss but i want to first to also talk about what the organization would do so the organization actually started in 1985 that we actually was a cultural organization as i said that we are promoting cultural understanding through the arts and culture to the schools to the public libraries to museums and community centers but in 1999 that we were invited by former mayor howard richard howard to come to modern because the modern history increasing such an incredible huge asian population and and uh they wanted us to come to help them at the same time being years on the community so quickly we we become part of the fabric of the community and i within a couple years we created a program called east meets with east midwest cultural dialogue to help the immigrant population to understand and appreciate american culture and really to get connected and understand what's going on at the same time to be linked to the community but uh we also created a program for youth to help them to develop positive bicultural identity in the same time learning some skills about um you know how to help other people and and about values and and the importance of their social responsibility so with all this program really help the people to connect but recently with the discount dialogue that that all the asia and anti-asian sentiment also come about that reminds me of some uh recent years that i have some young people come to work with us or interning and they've been talking about they were being a third generation and i never really know understand what the third generation mean meaning that because of the model minority put them in a very corner they are actually not considered really fit into the amount of minority and and they feel so out of place so they they don't feel either they are chinese or americans or or anything so so many have a really a very negative impact in the on their psyches so they become really another issue so with today what this kind of situation i think has to do with that what should we really help the young people to understand that you know we are all immigrants we come here with our own strengths and allow us to do whatever they need to do without creating labels on each group and so that we don't create some kind of resentment towards each other because with this modern minority that creating more resentment towards uh by other groups thinking that there is a they are doing better so therefore uh few more anti-asian sentiments i think that's a wonder another possibility and i also feel that it is so important for the uh elected officials to really recognize the importance and strength and the power that the immigrant population has really contributed to this country and not really labeling them is a bad or whatever situation so each has the right ability to rise on their own course without being labeled in any particular circumstance and i really agree with all the previous speakers about how we should really work together and allow the immigrant policy to make it more comfortable more more easy for the immigrant to to to fulfill their dreams without that then this country has been weakened and i remember personally i've been through many types of immigration trying to get my visa and i feel like i was being treated like criminals why should i be you know anyone who has taken the interest i want to come to this country to pursue a dream they want to contribute to this country we should welcome them rather than treating them as criminals or they are here come to steal from anyone and so that kind of attitude is very important for for for the the people who are working with the immigrant and how we can embrace each other so that we can have a much more peaceful and harmonious society for all of us thank you so much and thank you mary and may thank you for your work here in malden with a reach far beyond and for putting together an incredible panel of your own on how we can all work uh to defeat anti-asian hate and violence and so grateful for all of you for being here so i'm going to start with sort of a a big question inspired by uh by may's uh uh final point as we continue to see the spread of hateful and dangerous rhetoric injected into the debate around immigration reform how can we work together to shift the narrative around immigration and make sure that this country lives up to its promise of welcoming immigrants and providing opportunity for all and if that wasn't a big enough question i'm going to add in especially in light of the pandemic how do you think we can support our immigrant communities particularly and we'll start with whoever would like to jump in this is yvonne maybe i can start because unfortunately i do have to drop off congress um and what i wanted to say is um the pandemic has really revealed uh long-standing inequities not just a long race and class lines but also along immigration lines many people have contacted lawyers for civil rights saying if i go to the hospital will that be used against me will immigration penalize me because i got covet or because i got the vaccine and so people are worried a lot of this comes from the trump administration saying that if you use any public services that you would become a public charge you mentioned congresswoman that president bind rescinded that policy but on the ground people still harbor that perception that fear and so that is contributing to people for example not taking advantage of benefits not taking advantage of testing or vaccination even and so i just want to put that out there in that immigrants are very scared right now and so i appreciate all of the work you've been doing to support the immigrant community congresswoman well thank you yvonne and thank you for joining us i know you have to run we truly appreciate your work and your and sharing your expertise ava do you have something to add yes so thank you um again the narrative is extremely important and as we talk about you know um the hate or as we talk about the the rhetoric we need to tell the story i mean our friend jose's story or may's story those are the stories that we need to focus on one of the things i remember when president obama was talking um at an event he said if you have a story to tell start with that so yes we talk in theory we talk about the rhetoric but lifting up what immigrants do lifting up the story that may and jose was talking about i think you know the numbers and the statistics are important um but those statistics and numbers have been around and the and the narrative is still not where it should be so lifting up the stories lifting up the spirits of our brothers and sisters who are very much part of who we are i think and being very disciplined about the language because language does matter so let's not repeat the hate that's not you know focus on what the negative rhetoric is but lift up the spirits lift up the stories um of jose and maine and many others who are very much part of of who we are and then seeing all immigrants and as as part of us not as us versus them so important one community jose yeah no thank you i think it's a great question uh and something i will probably add to what uh eva was mentioning and i think evan also was talking about is the real stories i think you know my experience comes from when i got organized 100 and focusing on organizing was in uh 2009 2010 at the moment that we were building the campaign for dream act and i remember we were we were learning about sharing stories and some of our leaders uh for some times they were saying you know stories are good but we need to talk to legislators about you know technicalities technicalities about how to move the legislation and why they should do it sometimes it's important but i think the stories i think we all agree now that these stories the opposition usually highlight one bad story that happened somewhere in the country i think there are millions of stories that will convince other people to see immigrants in a different way i think that there are millions of historians and i think that we all should work i will probably highlight that one of the reasons why the tps campaign has been kind of like successful is because tps recipients has been taking some risk and has been moving in front and saying to our supporters let's do this together as a tps recipient we are willing to take to take the lead help us right next to us not ahead not behind right next to each other i think that's kind of like why i will probably say this campaign right now has been getting uh successful because we have been working as a team and highlighting the importance i think that every story is important when there is a successful dreamer that is graduating from only high level universities there is also a successful mother and father who have been working two three jobs to get that youth successful in their academy i think we need to combine those type of stories the successful one the successful business owner but also the successful woman who's working and cleaning buildings but raising their family to be a really really good u.s citizen and very well prepared to continue building this country yeah you're absolutely right jose it's the power of those personal stories and margaret you certainly have a powerful personal story how have you seen your work change over the pandemic and and what would you like to see to help us change the narrative about immigrants in our communities one of the moments that was most touch for me was a day that i went to deliver food for someone who was infected and on the same household a young man came to pick up the food i was in my car so i called him he was my contact and i said you were not wearing masks you are not wearing gloves and you are the living food for someone who is infected he said i think i i have copied the truth i'm in fact the true we are all infected here but we can't go to the hospital because we don't have health insurance that was the worst and touchable moment for me so for me right now the fourth priority is to ensure vasin assess for our immigration immigrants and and low-income families that are having a very hard time to navigate the system second i think we need support local immigration organization there are providing support for the families especially full support we need to provide financial support for those organizations for them to be able to continue their work and third we need to know that by the government didn't forget us after the election until we achieve immigration reform that will take a little longer we need the government to act and take steps on things that do not require congress approval such all those backlogs on immigration how those process they are taking very long we need to speed that up that will bring a relief because every proof of petition ever approval process means that a family is gonna be able to have access to health care access to financial support from the government i think those three actions would help us to really overcome the most difficult problems right now thank you that is a clear and immediate need list thank you margaret and thank you uh for raising hunger it has been such um just a devastating story of this pandemic um across communities but especially in our immigrant community whereas both uh all of you have pointed out there's so much fear about asking for help uh and the health care and the food services that people need and deserve so may we are gonna end with you um i'd love it if you would comment on any of the the previous questions or in particular is there a way that the federal government can better uh coordinate with local organizations in order to better support our immigrant communities yes i i think that education continues to be key to educate people to learn more about cultural issues and from the very ground level when i'm from elementary school students to understand how inclusion is so important we rely on each other nowadays with this globalization we cannot live without one without another so therefore respecting and understanding each other is really such an important um um like ability to really navigate our whatever one we need to do so that's the key that start from we offer you know after school program that could be part of the the the uh dialogue or it could be uh interracial dialogue that is also important because the communities we also realize that the the the uh anti-asian movement or the sentiment is is really among many other people we all have a little kind of issues of misunderstanding with each other and i feel that that within groups within government uh to to the community to the nonprofit organization and also supporting us to have a a strong dialogue within each entire cultural organization where we can also get to understand each other and then support each other after all we all have a different strength and no one can do it at all and coming together as a collective effort then we can really really like maximize our potential and and to create the best most harmonious community that's what i always hope um so we can all agree to be a disagree but we share more in common than the differences and i believe that tiny bit of differences is how we enrich each other and if we if we can break through that we have a perfect america that's what i said i can't think of a better way to end this conversation than that and uh that's exactly it this uh by lifting up our immigrant communities we are really lifting each other up and and forming that more perfect union that we strive for thank you all for joining us for this conversation for your work and your partnership and friendship we look forward to continuing it as we continue our work to make sure that we are uplifting our immigrant communities and seeking justice and fairness and thank you all for being tremendous advocates

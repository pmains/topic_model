i'm going to make just a few points expanding on what senator kerry has said so well coming back to first principles everybody learns in the first year law school if a law is challenged it is presumed to be constitutional that is a heavy burden for anyone challenging the constitutionality of a law to overcome when in doubt uphold the law basic first principle of constitutional jurisprudence there is a lot of room for doubt here and there is a lot of clear precedent that requires this court to uphold this law in only two instances in modern history has the court struck down any federal law based on commerce clause challenge in both for example the gun case involving restrictions on guns close to school the laws were local and non-commercial local and non-commercial this law clearly affects the national economy it involves a fifth of the national economy the court would not only have to stretch it would have to abandon and completely overrule a lot of modern precedent which would do grave damage to this court in credibility and power the court commands no armies it has no money it depends for its power on its credibility and its reputation ultimately people obey it because it has that credibility and the court risks grave damage if it strikes down a statute of this magnitude and importance and stretches so dramatically and drastically to do it now the one thing i can tell you i think with pretty near certainty is the court hasn't made a decision there are at least three justices who haven't made up their minds i say that based not only on having argued cases before the court for them and having been a law clerk but also having talked to justices over the years they come away from these arguments questioning each other and themselves and you saw that in every day so far that they were still questioning still thinking and deliberating so i think all of the predictions are worth what you're paying for them they mean nothing at this point and the the questions i can tell you also as senator kerry said so well are in no way indicative of how they may decide in fact some justices actually ask questions that are contrary to where they may be going simply either to be inscrutable or to test the other side of the argument that's the whole purpose of oral argument and the final point i would make is the court has to be aware that americans don't want to go back to the days when insurance companies made the rules denied people coverage when young people could not stay on their parents policies until the age of 26. americans do not want to abandon all of the very specific profoundly important benefits that have already been achieved as a result of this law and their role in a limited constitutional system is to not to reach the hypotheticals they don't need to decide the broccoli hypotheticals what they need to do is decide this case they don't need to establish a limiting principle for the commerce clause their role is to decide these issues case by case not establish rules of law which is what is done in that building not the one in back of us and for the court to strike down this law would be to presume the powers of the congress and abandon its role as an impartial and deliberate decider of constitutional law and i don't believe the court will go there or should go there anyway

right now is pennsylvania congresswoman madeline dean a democratic member of the house judiciary and financial services committees she's also an impeachment manager in donald trump's upcoming senate trial let me ask you just to pick up quickly as i say hello to you my friend about marianna's last point there is it likely that an impeachment trial would last a month i mean we know the first one did the first one didn't have as many elements to it that were so out there in the in the public uh not as much to be revealed right you think this one would take a whole month well good afternoon i'm pleased to be with you again alex uh i don't know about the timing i am aware of course that we will be presenting the article of impeachment on monday it looks very clear that the senate has chosen by way of agreement that i respect to hold the trial for two weeks in order to give the president's team more time to prepare i will tell you that the impeachment managers on our side will be fully prepared at whatever time the trial begins i don't believe that the trial will take anywhere near what the last trial took as you say the evidence is so abundant and many of us lived it including many of these senators uh and um the evidence is overwhelming and damaging and how much will that make a difference this time around given the wealth of information out there to purse through that it's public it's been public out there for everybody to see not just impeachment managers not just senators uh that will be inside of the chamber that are going through this everybody has seen this and heard this how much will that make a difference i think it will make a great difference a very sad and tragic difference because what we're talking about in impeachment too for president trump is that he incited a riot he gathered a mob in order to have them come and attempt insurrection attempt a coup to keep him in power to overturn a free and fair election and that mob was unleashed on the capitol they came in hoping to hang vice president pence hunting down members of congress hoping to assassinate uh speaker pelosi uh also hunting down members of the media whom he called the enemy of the people this was as a result of five and a half years of lies by this president and of course the last four or five months of the big lie the lie that the election was somehow fraudulent or stolen from him he must be held accountable for what he did in the lead-up to it and of course what he failed to do after the insurrection well you are well aware that there are some republicans who are pushing back against impeachment let's take a listen to senator lindsey graham post presidential impeachments never occurred in the history of the country for a reason that it's unconstitutional it sets a bad precedent for the presidency and it continues to divide the nation what's your response to that sadly senator lindsey graham has lost all his credibility and simply repeating a lie doesn't make it so if he didn't learn that from this failed presidency i don't know when he will it is most definitely constitutional it's also by way of common sense otherwise if you say you can't impeach a president and disqualify him from future office we are saying or i should say senator graham is saying that a president at the end of his term can go on a crime spree because they can't do anything about it the constitution does not provide for that lindsey graham knows that he's just avoiding a very difficult vote for him and his conscience let's take a listen to what uh republican congressman van taylor said a bit earlier on msnbc here's that it's very clearly the first amendment of the constitution protects free speech and political speech and so he i think it would be enormously difficult uh to prosecute him successfully in a in a federal district court for for the crime of his speech uh so the question is was there a criminal intent have you seen anything have you heard anything that suggests donald trump's involvement in the riot went beyond his tweets and his public statements well i think the world witnessed what he has done uh in terms of inciting this riot and let's be really clear here what donald trump will be tried for in the senate is uh presidential crimes against the constitution this is not like any other case free speech the claim of free speech here does not apply uh just as there are limitations to free speech in the civil world and in the statutory world i can't scream fire in a crowded uh movie theater the president is in a wholly different place and what we see as a result of his prize and his lies that incited a base and incited a riot where five people wound up dead free speech does not apply here a very key distinction you're making there let's talk about the new york times reporting that trump plotted to fire his acting attorney general that being jeffrey rosen in the final days of his presidency and replace him with someone willing to pressure georgia officials to overturn its election results that floated replacement jeffrey clark has denied that he devised any plan to oust rosen but what does all this suggest about the lengths to which donald trump was willing to go to hold on to power well to your very point to the depths and desperation that this president this failed former president was willing to go and the only thing that stopped clark from succeeding with donald trump in getting rid of the acting attorney general was the threat of mass resignations and that didn't uh i think brighton in donald trump some thought of oh my goodness maybe i'm going too far what it brought to him was the reality that if there is a mass resignation in the department of justice it would overshadow his claims of fraud uh and so uh it's it's just further evidence of the depths and desperation and sadly of those who would help this failed president guess what he was trying to do he was desperately trying to hold on to power by trying to throw out millions of citizens votes it's a despicable low time in our country that's why i feel a solemn duty as an impeachment manager to take this case to the senate and to ask them for all of history will you indict will you convict this president and disqualify him from ever holding office again on another note capitol police as you know are investigating a report that one of your colleagues republican congressman andy harris tried to take a gun onto the house floor on thursday does that concern you and why are the recently installed metal detectors why are they so controversial for some republicans you know as i read that story i thought think of how we ask our children to in as they go into school in many schools to walk through magnetometers this is where we've become where we've gotten in this country and yet a lawmaker who was hunted down the day before is so prideful of i don't know what that he disrespects the capitol police who are only trying to keep us safe by trying to bring his gun to the floor i have a right to be safe in my workplace as to all of my colleagues and i also believe i have a responsibility to respect those who work there and want to keep us safe i think it was shameful behavior pennsylvania congresswoman madeline dean our friend thank you so much for joining us and do stay safe at work and otherwise

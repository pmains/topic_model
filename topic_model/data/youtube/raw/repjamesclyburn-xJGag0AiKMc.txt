last night when i was informed of the death of my longtime friend john lewis i said along for a moment thinking about what john meant to this country to this movement and to me as a person the country lost a hero last night the movement loss and icon and i lost a personal friend john and i first met back in october 1960. we were in atlanta for an organizing meeting of what became known as the student non-talent coordinating committee commonly known as snick that weekend was transformative to me john and i enjoyed almost 60 years of friendship we never thought back then that we would be successful enough in the movement to both end up serving in congress together yet for almost 27 years we did because he never lost faith when i became a majority whereby i often talk about how simple it was to to whip john lewis you always knew exactly how he was going to vote does not mean you would always be comfortable with his vote but you knew how he would vote because he knew john lewis john was one of those people who internalized non-violence many of us practice it but john lived it when i would run for leadership positions i would never go to john to second or even to nominate me i always meant to him to ask for his support but i never asked him to nominate or to second my nomination because i never wanted john lewis to be put in a position of not being able to say he was for everybody because he was he was that kind of person we're gonna miss john lewis but john lewis will be forever in our hearts in our minds and yes in our souls i'm doing this tape doing sunrise because i do believe that it's a sun set on john lewis's life last night the sun rises on a movement that will never die thank you john rest in peace my brother you

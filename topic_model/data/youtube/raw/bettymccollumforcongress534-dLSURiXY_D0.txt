Last year Republicans cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires, adding two trillion dollars to the national debt. Now they want seniors and Americans with disabilities to pay for their tax scam. Cutting Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to pay for tax cuts is just plain wrong. Instead, we should be working together in Congress to ensure all Americans can live with dignity, security, and respect. I'm Betty McCollum, and I approve of this message.

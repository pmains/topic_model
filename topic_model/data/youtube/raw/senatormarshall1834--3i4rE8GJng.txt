very closely to senator roger marshall right now the kansas republican senator good to have you senator um it's interesting the timeline they're looking at and that if everything goes their way they might be able to pull this off is it fair to say as chad was touching on albeit a remote possibility that these two huge packages are combined that every bit of republicans support certainly for the infrastructure only package would be lost neil we've got him on the run but first of all welcome back i want you to know we missed you every afternoon between 4 and 6 pm we try to get a workout in the gym we have you on one of our tvs and larry kudlow on the other and we missed you but look we we do have them on the on the run right i said months ago on this show that the democrats would be jammed by that small bipartisan infrastructure bill and that's exactly what's happening i think kirsten cinema and joe manchin are working circles around speaker pelosi it's like she's lost her fastball they're showing her how the hog eats the cabbage she's they jammed her on this one but i want your listeners need to know is that kirsten and joe are representing the states that they come from that arizonans and west virginians did not send kirsten or joe to washington dc to turn this uh economy into a big government socialism most most most americans still believe in this economic freedom and prosperity you know they're still likely to support the final measure which might be in the one and three quarter trillion range that's not exactly chicken feet no at the end of the day this is still big government socialism taking over our economy no one's really talked about the tax policy yet or what these tax policies look like going forward and still no matter what bottom line number they give you i'll still bet you a coke that we end up spending seven or ten trillion dollars over the next ten years we can do better than a coke senator but all right let me ask you this if we step way back if they get this through a lot of tax increases are going to go through raising the top rate albeit at a very very high level to about 45 you throw in medicare surcharges and like you're really talking about a 50 top rate at only the federal level i'm not even including state taxes and other taxes that will be that prohibitedly in some states over 60 percent um what do you think of that big government socialism right raising our taxes so they can redistribute income and again they could talk about an alternative minimum tax for c cores or raising that number consumers are going to going to bear 70 percent of that on their back i'm much more concerned about stepped-up basis about taxing capital gains as ordinary income taxing dividends as ordinary income at the end of the day grab your wallet they're coming after it right senator thank you very much thank you for the kind words as well sir senator roger marshall a beautiful state of of kansas

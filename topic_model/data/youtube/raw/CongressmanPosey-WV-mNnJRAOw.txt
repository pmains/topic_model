thank you madam chair for holding this hearing today on forecasting and communicating extreme weather I assure you it's very important to the citizens of Florida because it saves lives in 2004 and 2005 Florida was hit by a series of severe hurricanes about five of them I believe which caused damage in every single County all 68 counties were damaged most of them pretty pretty significantly the insurance companies obviously went ballistic almost immediately and doubled or tripled everybody's rates because the reinsurers did the same thing and we started getting copies of their gloom and doom forecast for the future that it would only get worse the next year and progressively and progressively aggressively and surely that in just a few years there would be no insurance left for anybody or there were no B no one who could afford the insurance and this state lawmakers who are concerned by that so they hired their own actuaries their own data study people and the result was even worse than the insurance companies said told us so it was pretty bad we received one unsolicited suggestion and an analysis from a fellow named Dilli retired forecaster with the National Weather Service any of you ever heard of him just shake your head if you have heard of him before and after he retired he started tracking severe weather as a hobby and and so rather than go review the statistical maps and timelines and and take a statistical approach to the whole thing he focused on way upper weather patterns and and mr. dilly told us he said I only go eight years out with my forecast but he said I think you guys are good to go for about eight years before you're gonna have another severe hurricane hit Florida and and you may have a little action in the southwest part of the state but it won't be severe most people laughed at this guy but history proved that he was right on the money and so I'd like to know if you're familiar with this type of analysis who does it or other thoughts that you might have on it and we might start with mrs. bostr√∂m well that is way out of my bailiwick but I'd like to UM something came to mind while you were talking and that was the predictions of earthquakes but you can sometimes be right about something even if the method that you're using isn't terribly good so um I would really need to know a lot more and otherwise conclude that this was a coincidence that he was correct yeah I was gonna say the same thing you know a bloke a broken clock is Right twice a twice I guess in a day and so he was right eight times and everybody else was wrong I'm sure I mean that's still a small in eight so what I tend to sort of look at when I look at these sort of because as meteorologists we hear all kinds of things about rodents they predict the weather and almanacs but I tend to go with the sort of peer-reviewed literature now I would certainly would love I would love to see his methodologies published and I think that's what the peer-review literature's for so if mr. dilly is listening out there I would invite him to sort of publish that methodology so it can be evaluated because he may be on to something I I would just suggest that I wouldn't want the National Weather Service and colleagues to sort of change their overarching principles and methods based on a sample of eight and not suggesting that just curious if anybody else heard of that you know what your thoughts about it or no do we also have your thoughts about it nobody else thinks it's worth investigating I don't know this fellow's method but we could talk about the reinsurance rates in in after 2005 if that's of interest the there is a you know the the reinsurance rates are influenced by a lot of things and it is true that that there's market forces so there's an emotional response either to an event that just happened or a sequence of no events so the rates go up a lot if there's a bunch of bad events and they go down if there haven't been any for a while in a way that probably fluctuates more than it should the risk is sort of a slowly changing thing but how often the risk is realized is is a different thing so you have car insurance you're not gonna crash your car every day the insurance is different a lot of different ways yeah but one they're all housed in the same offshore island and they all change the same rate charge the same rate and change the rates at the same time we'd call that monopoly if they're on the mainland thank you madam chair I see my times expired

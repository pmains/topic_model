we'll come to order I want to welcome everybody for attending I want to thank the witnesses first of all for your service to this country the issues were dealing with here to say are challenging to say the least I was at the opening ceremony with a senator carper opening up the st. Elizabeth's and comment I made there is it's pretty easy from the diaster to criticize take potshots to you know detail out what problems aren't being addressed as perfectly as we'd like to see but I am thoroughly convinced from all the contact I've had quote I'll say the honor and privilege since in working with the men and women of DHS I'm thoroughly convinced that the men and women are showing great deal of integrity dedication dignity and courage and tried to deal with this horrific situation and we'll talk a little bit more about that I would ask that my written opening statement be entered in the record this hearing and it's called the M Preston my Gration at the u.s. southern border the exploitation of migrants through smuggling trafficking and voluntary servitude really started a couple years ago with Senator Portman holding a hearing through his psi Subcommittee on example of involuntary servitude that an Ohio egg farm more recent news stories after the Robert Kraft massage parlor scandal New York Times the New York Times really really good investigative story just laying out the reality of these massage parlors and and often Asian women that had been smuggled trafficked in this nation they come into this country with 30 or 40 thousand dollar debt owed to their human traffickers and of course I paid off through prostitution disgusting reality Levasseur reality my most recent trip to McAllen I made a couple in the last a couple months with senator Hass and Senator Peters there are a couple things that got my antennae definitely twitching first of all we were briefed and we were told about the detection of the number of fraudulent families and we really don't know how large that is I've seen different things 13 25 33 % we just really don't know we were told about a three-year-old boy left in the hot corn field with just a non-working telephone number in his name supplied written and you know the telephone numbers written on his sand and we saw a picture of that senator house and Sandra Pierce and I when we went through the McCallum facility saw about an 18 month old little girl struggling to get away from mountain Oh 40 50 year-old man having just been briefed about fraudulent families I mean I don't know the truth there but it didn't look like that was the daughter of that man I could be wrong but I couldn't help but wonder what was gonna have that 18 month old girl if that wasn't his father if that wasn't her father at the border the last two trips I've made I've been surprised in talking to the people have just crossed you know women men with tender age children none of them are admitting to paying their human traffickers any money which is a concern for me when you also tack on the the evidence that we're seeing evidence of these family units showing up at stash houses now the process is again completely out of control overwhelmed people are turning themselves into Border Patrol Border Patrol is overwhelmed in their facilities I think something 19,000 people held at Border Patrol facilities that according to the now former director of CBP or border patrol the capacity is only 4,000 but trying to process people as quickly as possible the largest group done record now a thousand people coming in through El Paso and trying to process em completely Rafe I'll turn them over to ice there's a backlog there because ice doesn't have enough capacity facility hold it and then ice course trying to turn them for unaccompanied children over to HHS where there's not enough capacity or into non-government organizations to find family members help them buy tickets to get dispersed all over over America you think they'd be dispersed all over America but instead some of them are showing up some of these stash houses then of course in testimony we'll hear stories of those people probably about ready to be put into involuntary servitude but we have records of people being beaten videos taking that video sent back down to their home countries demanding payment once we got back from that trip story broken Wisconsin I'm gonna read you some excerpts from a story that's ran the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel On June 20th five people were indicted in late May in a Georgia based human trafficking scheme that federal authorities say illegally brought dozens of Mexican workers to work on Wisconsin farms the defendants through two companies they operated received yes Department of Labor approval to bring the Mexican nationals to the u.s. to work on Georgia farms through a program that allows employers to hire seasonal foreign workers that they can't find domestic workers cultivate and harvest crops thus the workers were in the country legally but according to the indictment the defendants illegally brought the employees to work on Wisconsin farms gave them false IDs and took away their passports so they couldn't leave the workers face threats are made to believe they would suffer serious harm if they left all but one of the workers identified his victims told authorities they had to pay recruiting freeze ranging from 200 to more than $600 to be placed on a list to come to work in the u.s. some say they also had to turn over titles to their properties in Mexico their families homes or land as collateral to get the job the workers said they were left without medical attention when they got sick and were forced to work more than 10 hour days without being allowed to take breaks other than lunch some workers said they weren't always provided why the water even on hot days they were told not to talk with anyone outside the company not to leave the Wisconsin motel without supervision or permission two workers said they were threatened with deportation if they left another feared not ever being able to return to work legally in the US if he was reported now again this is the exploitation of migrant workers in the country legally I have no ideas hopefully I was hoping this hearing would give us some sense of how prevalent this is I don't think we're gonna get that I think we'll hear some other examples maybe it's not that big a problem I have a sense it's a huge problem I just have a sense of the huge problem I think we should get our chart up here you've all seen this I've had turned a piece of paper the long way through May through 8 months of this fiscal year for more than 4,000 unaccompanied children or people coming in as families generally one one adult one child have crossed the border illegally and been apprehended and processed and basically dispersed if we're to maintain Mays rate that number would exceed $800,000 by the end of fiscal year in just four more months now I think we've seen a slight decline based on the weekly numbers it's getting hot Mexico seems to be doing more so hopefully we won't hit that 800,000 number but I don't see how anybody can take a look at this and not realize this is a huge problem that must be addressed and we're simply not addressing it not effectively I didn't have time to have a picture blown up but we've all seen it of Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez in a 23 month old daughter Valeria now as tragedies occur all over this country all over the world I don't want to see another picture like that on the US border I hope that picture alone will catalyze this Congress this Senate this committee to do something I called up senator Peters earlier this morning I said I had half a mind to canceling this hearing and instead just have a discussion between what I believe our US senators of good faith that is sat through 30 more hearings of this problem on the border and start coming to a consent to conclusions what can we agree on to actually start improving the situation what I have found in eight and a half years here in the United States Senate there's not much of a problem-solving capability not for the big ones not for the big problems this committees actually demonstrated pretty good capacity for solving smaller problems on a totally nonpartisan basis quite honestly I'm pretty proud of that we should all be proud of that our stands ought to be proud of that just last week in our markup we dressed the problem of government shutdowns in Senator Langford senator Hass and they'll send report and Senator Paul had other had other bills but we passed a bill to end government shutdown hopefully the rest of sin will pick that up hopefully the house will pass that and we'll never have to have another shutdown again this is a much more difficult problem we're dealing with here and so what I proposed to Senator Peters and again I appreciate the Senators we have here at the dais I'm also talking to the other senators staffs and I'm dead serious about this I want to set up our table down there like a market but it's not gonna be markup and in a very organized process of organized fashion I want to go through a problem solving process that's what we've been doing with all these hearings we've been gathering a lot of information we still need more information but I want to have an open and honest and genuine discussion about the scope of the problem the root causes of this problem and what we can do to start solving it continuous improvement we're not going to solve this overnight but we can make some improvement in the situation we have to start doing something Congress the men and women of DHS are doing what you can do with limited resources Congress has to act and it has to start with an honest and open discussion and conversation will go back and forth find the areas of agreement and I don't know how that ends up in an overall piece of legislation or elements that can be tacked on to peace legislation that would probably be under some other committees jurisdiction but we need to start doing something it is well past time and that picture that all Americans woke up this morning looking at again should be used as a catalyst for that kind of action so again one thing that we're gonna try and do and sander Peters has been great working with me on this but hopefully we can sign a letter in support of Operation safe return and a pilot program very small in scope but a program that is designed to rapidly and more accurately determine those families that clearly don't have a valid asylum claim and safely return them to the home country as a message to people in Central America don't indebt yourself to these human traffickers don't mortgage your home don't pay them a year's worth of salary because on a bipartisan basis we're not going to let that human traffickers exploit our broken system and then the next step would be to actually start fixing that system but I think the beauty of the pilot program operates the safe return is while it's being implemented we're gonna be tracking its effectiveness we're gonna find out how many people actually do have a Valis Island claim we'll be giving them interpreters they'll they will have access to counsel and that's something on a bipartisan basis we can send a strong signal and message that we want to fix this problem so again IV amber down a lot longer than I normally do an opening statement but if there was ever a moment where it requires that the nonpartisan effort of the members of this committee I would say it's now and so that's what I'm asking for for every sender every staff member in this committee let's come together let's have these discussions these will be multiple meetings number of hours but I'm asking for full involvement in a very open and genuine discussion with that Senator Peters

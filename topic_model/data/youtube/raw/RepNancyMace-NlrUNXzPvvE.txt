the gloves are off house minority leader kevin mccarthy pulling all five gop members from the january 6th committee after two of them were rejected by speaker nancy pelosi here to react south carolina congresswoman nancy mace good to see you this morning okay so here is what uh nancy pelosi says and this reads quote it had been our hope to establish a bipartisan independent national commission but there is no prospect for that commission at this time because of insufficient support from republican senators do you agree that there is no prospect for the commission as a result of support or lack thereof as she says from republican senators well you certainly can't have a bipartisan commission if you reject the republican members selected by the minority and that's what she did this week and so i totally fully support kevin mccarthy on this this is really just a sideshow to distract from the really bad policy that we've seen come out of nancy pelosi chuck schumer and the biden administration they've got a lot of problems whether it's defunding the police a bipartisan infrastructure package that they've killed subsequently or record spending at 3.5 trillion and inflation causing massive massive prices to go up for everybody across the country they've got a lot to hide from and she's going to use this commission to do just that it's going to be a political side show next week yeah to that end where does this investigation go from here and how does this stunt by nancy pelosi really erode the integrity of this investigation well the investigation continues there are actually 10 congressional committees that have full subpoena power and investigative ability to look into and investigate january 6 both in the u.s house and the u.s senate on top of that there are already four federal agencies also doing their own nonpartisan investigations that's the secret service the fbi the department of homeland security and the attorney general's office of the department of justice and so we've actually spent more resources and arrested more people on january 6 than we did throughout our investigation of 9 11. okay among many others in this country and beyond you would like to free britney spears to see that happen so much so that you've introduced new legislation to end abusive conservatory ships tell us about this right when britney spears had so much courage last month in june to come forward and publicly talk about the abuses that she's experienced within her conservatorship there are 1.3 million americans in conservatorships and there have been abuses long before brittany ever topped the charts but what she did was really shine a light on these abuses and so i'm joined by democrats and republicans on this bill it is bipartisan it's getting a lot of attention and traction within the house of representatives we just want to give britney spears and those in similar situations the ability to petition a judge or a court and request and get a public guardian rather than someone who manages their conservatorship who has a conflict of interest financial or otherwise let's pop up on the screen quickly what your bill would do provide 260 million dollars in state grants to hire case workers conservators ability to replace court-appointed private guardian with a public guardian and ability to replace conservators without having to prove wrongdoing 30 seconds to you this case seems to be a lot more than a celebrity novelty how pervasive is this problem throughout america it's across the country and i will tell you since filing this bill on tuesday i've heard from americans all across the country in every state whether it's themselves personally or someone in their family or they've had an experience with this everyone believes this is a good step in the right direction and it's narrow legislation i want it to continue to be bipartisan so it's very narrow and focused because in this case small parts can make a real real meaningful difference in somebody's life and it is so nice and refreshing to see something be so bipartisan so we do hope it stays that way that's for sure congresswoman nancy mace is always it's wonderful to see you have a great day thank you

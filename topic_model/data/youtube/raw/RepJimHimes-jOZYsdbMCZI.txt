hi i'm representative kim fawcett and you're joining me for an episode of fairfield in our town in our town is an opportunity really for all of us to get to know our community leaders just a little bit better and today our guest is our federal representative in washington d.c congressman jim hines congressman himes thank you so much for taking the time to join us today just thrilled thanks kim have a chance to talk with you as i mentioned before we started uh shooting one of the reasons i originally wanted to um do this show was to have the a forum where uh the residents of my community could get to know the leaders of our community and you have sort of an interesting story you worked private sector and then made this huge transition into politics and i was just wondering if we could start out just talking a little personal about your history and how did you come to decide to run for congress sure well as you point out about 12 years i worked for a bank in the private sector and i left that in 2002 to spend about four or five years working for a non-profit organization that did affordable housing uh in the northeast and so we would try to you know rebuild urban communities that had sort of fallen into disrepair and you know i decided to run for congress because um this was uh 2007 uh when i made that decision and you'll recall we were in the midst of the iraq war the afghanistani war we were sensing that we were headed towards an economic meltdown which of course in the end we did and i just thought you know gosh you know the government has been acting irresponsibly in the last uh four five six years and uh you know i got involved locally i was a member of the finance board in my town i live in costco so i was part of the finance board of the town of greenwich and got involved locally and you know just just kept kept sort of working locally and when an opportunity presented itself in in 2008 i just said you know i don't want to be at the end of my life and look back and say i never tried something big so i just i just decided to go for it i really really appreciate that because often people ask me why you know how i ran and i i say when i'm 80 and i'm sitting in the nursing home or 85 hopefully i make it to 85. i don't want to look back and say i wish i had tried that state rep thing i just wanted to be able to have at least tried and i'm now entering my fourth term and one of the things i've certainly noticed is an increasing partisanship and obviously congress is experiencing that as well and i guess i'm interested you know and i'm sure many people are interested to to learn more about your perspective from your experience being you know representing us down in washington dc how does the partisanship feel and and how do you feel like how did we get to the place where we are with the budget and the government shutdown yeah it's a great question you know you and i share similar constituencies and that most of our constituents don't want us to be that partisan you know we both represent probably roughly equal numbers of democrats and republicans and what's interesting is that that's actually a rarity these days seats that are contestable that are swing seats as they say and so you and i have i think kind of a unique perspective on this partisanship because our constituents don't really want us to go there that much um but but so what's so what's happening i mean the old-timers tell me that you know 50 years ago congress was a lot less partisan than it is today that you know a lot of people point to newt gingrich who said you know you don't move to dc you stay in your districts every weekend as soon as you're done voting you go home and you campaign and you know that created a world where people don't get to know each other all that well uh because they used to all live in washington and for better or for worse this has been going on for a while but then of course in 2008 when the economy melted down that caused a huge amount of rage and anger and sadness and despair in the american people if you think about what the american people saw and we saw it right here at home in our constituencies you know people saw the government the sec jpmorgan chase fannie mae freddie mac you name it uh fail them all of the institutions that they took for granted failed them and the retirement account was obliterated you know a lot of people were thrown out of their homes a lot of people lost their jobs and there was just an incredible rage um at the at the great recession and that affected our politics i mean it's not a coincidence that the tea party got formed uh in that period of time and that the occupy wall street movement came out of that era these were populist movements of the left and the right and you know you add in the fact that you have an african-american president who uh supports marriage equality who implemented uh universal health care for the first time in this country and what you have there is you have an opposition that is going to grow up against the guy that has a um an intensity that we haven't seen in a very long time and so you have the pro you have what happened in the last two weeks as we as we talked today you know a very small group you know 30 40 maybe 50 people on capitol hill who say you know what we'll default on our debt something this country has never done we will default on our debt with all the devastation that that would imply for the u.s and the global economy because we dislike the affordable care act that much it's sort of the you know the the absurd extreme of where a very polarized system gets you now the good news is of course you know i think that people look back on this shutdown and the devastation that was done in the polling numbers to the tea party into the republican party i think it's not le and by the way not just the republican party i mean americans just said the president the democratic party the republican party you know epoxy on all of your houses but of course the pain was born primarily by the more extreme wing of the republican party i think the good news is they're not going to run that play again and i'm not going to tell you that that means we're going to have you know perfectly happy negotiations i hope so but i don't think they'll run the shutdown default play again because it didn't work terribly well the first time i um i feel very fortunate to work in the connecticut general assembly because when i talk to colleagues around the country from other state legislatures i think some of this partisanship that you are experiencing is playing out but in connecticut you know we kind of pride ourselves people don't realize it but we have together republicans and democrats done two budgets over the past four years we've done a jobs bill that was very comprehensive and um we did gun reform all together and so the possibility to work together still exists and let yet it's so difficult and i'm wondering your sort of sense when you're in washington do you feel frustrated or do you feel hopeful um that the partisanship is something we can work through or is it here to stay um you know i sort of traced a lot of the extreme partisanship back to the anger and the emotions that grew up in the recession that started in late 2008 and of course as the economy improves and it's improved meaningfully in the last four years i mean we've seen you know short of eight million jobs added in the last four or five years economic growth has been positive um it needs to it needs to go a lot further obviously we want you know we want unemployment down a lot lower than it is today but is that as the economic fears and anxieties subside politics in washington will also subside you know and and people will be feeling less extreme they'll be dealing with fewer constituents who are outraged you know you and i deal with outrage constituents imagine in communities that are not as affluent as this one you know communities where there's a lot of poverty and whatnot you know that creates a lot of intensity and and i do think that as the economy improves the partisanship will start to drop away and hopefully that will open up room for us to do some things that we all know we need to do you know and we're eager to see congress do it in exactly the tradition that you talked about here in the state of connecticut i mean you know you guys got a bipartisan gun safety bill done which though it was very controversial look it didn't infringe anybody's second amendment rights you can still go out there so long as you're not a felon and buy a weapon if you want to um you know 90 percent of americans support background checks very it's not a crazy idea you know we want to check buy a gun but we want to make sure you're not a violent person even though 90 of americans support that of course it couldn't pass the congress and so hopefully you know as our politics become more calm space opens up for a budget negotiation for gun safety for immigration reform it's just it's going to take a little time so what's next for our budget process i know we've got a few months here you've bought some time but you know what's the goal in the next couple months now that government's back to work well you know yes uh you know now the bill that we passed that reopened the government you know created a committee which was designed to start those budget negotiations and you know that's good stuff that's what a government is supposed to be doing we're not supposed to be arguing about whether the government should be open or not we're supposed to be arguing over what should our budget look like and how should we pay for it and you know we've got that opportunity to in in the coming months and you know you know it's a big and complicated topic but put it this way you know clearly federal spending over time must continue to come down the question is how fast and in what areas so you know the sequester which people talk about these are the across the board cuts that kicked in months ago you know they're not very smart cuts and so as a consequence research for things like cancer drugs is being stopped in its tracks you know there are people who are going to suffer from cancer that won't get cured because of that so a much more tailored sense of where those cuts should be and in the long run you know the the deficit is actually declining at a rate faster than it has declined since world war ii uh the problem is less in this year or next year it is more ten years from now when the large areas of expenditure that the federal government does and a lot of americans don't know this but most of the spending the federal government does is through the medicare the social security and you throw in defense by the way defense and security you've got about three quarters of the dollar that the federal government spends so the reason i highlight that is because you know sometimes it's hard for democrats to say this but in the long run a fair and equitable reform of our medicare and social security systems and by fair and equitable i mean vulnerable people don't get hurt um that's really the best thing we could do to assure the long-term physical stability of the country so my hope is that we can make some progress in that area and then you know there's so much else we should be doing you know we talk about cut this and the budget that why do we talk about that we talk about that not because we all love doing budgets in and of themselves but because we want to have money to invest in the education of our kids because we want our kids to grow up to be well trained and start businesses and be great workers at places like ge and you know kayak.com down here in norwalk you know um so i'm really anxious to get to that point where we're talking about education and energy policy and comprehensive immigration reform which of course you and i hear about a fair amount and i also um i spent a lot of time talking with people about infrastructure investment in connecticut and frustrated because i don't see the federal government with a long-term infrastructure investment plan but i also have spent the past five years asking begging screaming yelling to the connecticut government that we really should have a long-term vision of what our transportation our energy our tele mass communication infrastructure is going to look like and i'm frustrated because people want cuts and i served on the budget committee i know we there are people doing hard work trying to find cuts but at the same time if we don't invest in our infrastructure and in the future of our country we're not actually lifting ourselves up for that 10 years out and you know i don't know if you have the opportunity for your work to work on sort of long-term infrastructure investment plans but you know all of it seems something that we could really engage and and talk about an area for common ground right i mean i don't care if you're a democrat or a republican or a socialist or a tea party or whatever you are you know talk to a business person talk to the business some uh groups here in fairfield county you and i both they are begging for a solution to the infrastructure and of course the housing as well yeah you know because you know so many of the businesses that are in stanford for example where you know you have very high cost real estate you know they can't attract people if they need to live an hour hour and 20 minutes up the up the highway and so you know unfortunately too often in our political world you know it's spend more spend less the answer of course is spend smart and nobody can tell me particularly living in this part of connecticut than investing in our train systems i mean would we would we have a week or something with no training right and uh you know that was falling on the heels of a train that that keeled over here in fairfield and you know i mean nobody can tell me that investing in our infrastructure trains and by the way electrical networks and data networks doesn't set us up for economic success and by the way if we don't do it it sets us up for economic failure right and there's actually really critical investment we can do in metro north we should talk if you haven't if you haven't if you haven't heard it from the business community and there's a lot of investment that we can make our trains um run faster and run more efficiently and change the entire economics of fairfield county so and run more like subways you know i mean those trains were built for a time when we were kids and everybody got on the you know 605 trained in new york right that today that's not what people do they go from here to greenwich they go from greenwich to stanford or bridgeport i mean now yeah the whole thing needs to be a little different than it was 50 years ago we would hope we're going in that direction um i would be remiss if we didn't have some time to talk about health care and health care reform and the affordable care act and obviously um this month october was the roll out of the affordable care act websites some of them are having some challenges of course been being reported in the news and um i thought you know it was really important to start out our conversation with healthcare talking a little bit about medicare because i know i'm still hearing from seniors in my district and just there's so many confusing messages out there about what specifically changed with medicare and how seniors currently under medicare plans are going to be impacted right good that's a great place to start because of course seniors pay very close attention yes you know the big users of healthcare but here's here's the thing for the medicare population healthcare reform is an unadulteratedly good thing you know um seniors uh and and by the way you know with the roll out of the exchanges of course seniors who are on medicare stay on medicare they don't need to worry about the exchanges some people have had great experiences with the exchanges some people haven't but seniors stay on medicare and now because of the affordable care act they're entitled to one no co-pay free physical a year something called the doughnut hole which seniors know about sometimes required seniors don't know about it but this is where once they spent you know once medicare covered like four thousand five thousand dollars with their drugs all of a sudden they were on the hook for a couple of thousand uh that doughnut hole is closing so seniors will go out of pocket a lot less than they used to uh because of the healthcare reform bill so for seniors um healthcare reform is really going to be a very positive thing what's the controversy then why do they feel like they're seeing going to see a reduction in services what's do you i mean do you have an explanation what the message is that's going to yeah absolutely and let me just be blunt about this there are very fair criticisms of the affordable care act i could give you a half dozen of them and things that should be changed and then the american people have been flat out lied to by the uh the unbending and unflinching uh opponents of of the healthcare reform so for example the vice presidential candidate of the united states of america sarah palin was retailing the notion that there would be death panels made up out of whole cloth so you know people hear death panels on fox news they're like my god they're setting up death panels that's going to cause a certain amount of consternation absolutely right you know the other side the the opponents of this have been saying it's a government takeover of health care the private insurance companies are getting millions of new customers hospitals are remaining in private hands doctors are remaining private nobody's going to work for the government and yet they hear government takeover of health care so the main reason people are nervous is because there has been an incredible propaganda campaign uh to just try to decimate in the eyes in the in the minds of the american public this uh this healthcare reform now let me say it again it's not that this healthcare reform is perfect there's plenty of things that should be improved about it but but an awful lot of people have been lied to for a very long time about things like death panels about things like you know this is going to be massive cuts to medicare um and and so there's a lot of fear out there yeah it's interesting because i um you know people have lost sight of the fact that we actually 10 years ago were in crisis because we needed health care reform and so many people were losing their homes and losing their life savings as they were dealing with trying to fight disease or health care issues it's the leading cause of bankruptcy for american families is stumbling on a an unexpected medical cost the leading cost of bankruptcy and so you know uh there are going to be bumps and there have been some fairly obvious bumps particularly not so much here in connecticut been the national roll out of the exchange is the online system has been as has been less than less than a smooth rollout but um look americans have already begun to experience a lot of the benefits there are people all over this country whose 22 year olds left college and couldn't get a job because it was rough economic times and because of the health care reform they were able to go until age 26 onto their parents plans one of the key things for uh for the healthcare reform is the fact that previously if you got you know heaven forbid you know cancer some very serious disease there came a point when the insurance company would say sorry million bucks this year you're done we cover no we cover no more of your uh bills and they can no longer do that by law it used to be impossible for people with diabetes or even people who had trouble in childbirth to get health insurance on the individual markets insurance companies are no longer allowed to turn you away if you have a pre-existing condition now the area we should talk about which is really is going to determine whether this thing is successful or not is whether we can over time bring down the overall costs of the health care system you know in the state of connecticut and at the federal level bringing down those health care costs in the long run is is absolutely essential and so the theory is that as more people go on to the exchanges and are purchasing private insurance the costs will come down and um do do you have faith or hope that that's the you know that economies of scale is going to play out and we are going to drive down the cost of insurance um you know that's one of the things that is designed to drive down the cost but the real cost drivers i mean you know you and i have both spent time in the private sector here you have a business where people get paid not for doing good stuff but for doing more stuff and by the way they're not paid by the individual who consumes the service if they're insured they're they're paid by insurance companies so here's a system that is designed to drive volume and that's what we've seen for decades now eight nine ten percent annual inflation in the healthcare system so where you can really move the needle is if you re-jigger the system so that doctors and hospitals are actually paid to keep people out of hospitals i mean that's sort of counter-intuitive yeah but you know one of the things that healthcare reforms did was um it said to hospitals look when mr smith who comes into the emergency room every three weeks with chest pains if he comes in after you've treated him in the emergency room two weeks later we're not going to reimburse you for that and what that does is now that sounds kind of harsh right but what that does is it says to the hospital don't just get mr smith stabilized and send him out the door mr smith is coming in every two weeks because he's got some problem maybe he's not taking his heart medication who knows what it is but deal with the problem keep mr smith from coming back to the emergency room so over time those kinds of reforms combined with by the way wellness right i mean we haven't talked about that yet but trying to trying to give incentives for people to be healthier that's how you're really going to keep the inflation and healthcare business down i don't know if in congress you did this but in the state government this year we all had to sign a wellness contract and we have to be participate in a preventative health care program and it's part of the state trying to reduce the cost of delivery of healthcare yeah um so there's some problems i mean i think it was inevitable that there was going to be rollout problems what now on the practical level can people do can they if they're having a hard time accessing the websites you know is there are there ways to access health insurance right now if they want to and and how can they do that can we contact your office i know they're contacting my office so i want to refer them to you yeah well you know so far here in connecticut uh the healthcare exchange is working pretty well so we've got access health access health connecticut yeah um you know they've signed up 2500 families in this state uh for actual insurance they've got about another eight nine thousand applications underway so it's working pretty well you can go onto their website by the way if you don't want to go onto their website you can call them up they've got an 800 number and you can call them up and maybe we can put up on screen what that number is but um uh you know people should call it's an opportunity to shop for health insurance most people are going to find particularly since most people are going to qualify for tax credits this is key thing it's not what's the premium it's what's the premium minus your tax credit and the tax credit goes up to four times the poverty level now what that means is for a family of four it's about ninety eight thousand dollars so if you've got a family of four and the family is making less than ninety eight thousand dollars you're going to get an instant tax credit to help you buy that premium start to buy that health insurance now what i can't sit here and do is tell you that everybody's health insurance is going to be cheaper than it was before that's that's just not accurate you know for years now health insurance premiums a big one up eight nine ten percent a year some people will experience those increases some people will experience decreases but the point is that um you'll be able to go on these exchanges and you know if you're comfortable online that's the place to start here in connecticut you know working pretty well but you can also do it in person with somebody you can do it on the phone um and check out what the avail what the offerings are and of course if you're covered most most people in connecticut are either covered through medicare or through their employer right right they work for a company their employer provides it those plans shouldn't change much uh if at all but people who are in the individual market are going to have access to this exchange and so far it's been working pretty well in connecticut and i think people don't realize that i believe it's 2015 the amount that an insurance premium can go up each year is capped so we won't see once it gets stabilized in 2015 does the affordable care act sort of control increases in premiums well you know the same state commissioner you know approval processes will obtain meaning you know any insurance company who wants to go for a race needs to go to the state insurance commissioner and ask for permission what you might be thinking of this was another good thing that came out of the health care reform the law now puts a limit on how much of each premium dollar that's the dollar that you and i send to blue cross blue shield or anthem how much of that can be spent on stuff that isn't health care on salaries on advertising on things that isn't health care an insurance company that spends more than 80 85 percent on anything other than healthcare has to write you a check and reimburse you uh for that difference and is there a is there something in place to sort of oversee them to make sure the insurance companies need to report these numbers to insurance commissioners and if they go over in terms of spending on advertising or executive salaries uh they are required by law and it gets monitored by the insurance commissioners of each state they are required by law to write checks to their premium to their customers so that'll be interesting when that kicks in in two thousand people have already gotten checked no this that part of it is already you know people have been getting these checks from their insurance companies and it's it's a pretty surprising moment in the lives of people who get these checks have any successes have you has your office uh helped anyone or had any ability to help people connect with sure do health insurance sure you know um where this is really particularly gratifying is um for people that have had pre-existing conditions and my god a lot of people are out there with pre-existing it could be something as simple as you know i've had a bum knee all my life or it could be something as simple as a young woman who had a very complicated pregnancy those are pre-existing conditions and and those people if they didn't have insurance to their employers there if it was affordable it was incredible sorry if it was available it would be incredibly expensive so some of the really gratifying stories are coming out of people who thought they would never get insurance on the on the private market and now are able to do so we're hearing across the board uh you know a lot of people getting insurance for the first time we're also hearing some people say hey look you know this this insurance plan is more expensive than my old one and the fact is that because the law put a floor on the quality of the plan meaning you know you can't sell plans that are of lower quality some people are paying a little more for their health insurance but they're also getting a better quality plan so you know again it's early days where the exchange has only been open for three weeks or so and i think you know two three months from now we'll have a better sense for how it's rolled out but and it's interesting you bring up the individuals with pre-existing conditions because one of my very first in the first few months i was walking door to door during my very first campaign i met a woman so this was eight nine years ago i met a woman who was about 50 and she had had some form of cancer i think it was stomach cancer but in her younger years i mean 15 years earlier but because of that experience with cancer which she had had surgery and treatment and was technically cured because she had been so many years cancer-free she could not purchase health insurance or i mean it was just so outrageously expensive she couldn't afford it and she and i talked for a long time and i remember this was all before the affordable care act and i remember thinking is there i mean is there an answer for her and now people like her they're just we'll be able to buy insurance yeah it's amazing you know the other thing that's kind of fun about this too is that person if you think about that person um you know let's imagine she did work for a company or an even younger person who had an experience with cancer working for a company if that person had a great idea to go out and start another company you think they're going to leave and leave their health insurance behind not a chance right because they know they're not going to get it right now because people will be able to purchase um health insurance in the individual market if they've got a great idea to go start a new business that is going to you know put 50 jobs here in fairfield they'll they'll do it right and they'll buy on the exchange exactly um you know now that the partisanship is hopefully behind us for a while and maybe congress is going to start to settle down with the budget the other big issue this nation and our constituents are just you know screaming for us to address is immigration and immigration reform and there's it's another one of these incredibly complex issues and yet if we do nothing we're really not moving forward as a nation and i'm wondering where you are or where do you think the opportunity presents in front of the congress to tackle immigration reform again you know immigration reform it's it's it's really frustrating because it's one of those really across the board wins if we could get something like what the senate passed and remember the senate passed a bill i think it was with 70 plus senators like i'm forgetting now but strong bipartisan support um it would uh help the fact that we've got 12 million people in this country living in the shadows undocumented people living in the shadows it would address the dreamer problem these are the young kids who get brought here at age two and they go to fairfield high school and only when they graduate do they discover that they're not american and therefore they can't do financial aid and it would be huge for the economy you know the congressional budget office has estimated that getting comprehensive immigration reform done would help fix our social security problem because now you have more people paying into social security and by the way it would be huge for business a a recent immigrant is much more likely to start a new business in the united states than somebody who's not a recent immigrant so this is one of those real win wins you know we got to get it right right we got to make sure that our borders are secure but the senate passed a really well-balanced bill not perfect but well balanced and unfortunately the house of representatives where we've got some of the you know more root and tea partiers who are just you know people like steve king who you know they're gonna they're gonna do comprehensive immigration reform over his you know over his grave um you know we we just we've been hung up but i'm hopeful now that you know we're kind of beyond the shutdown and hopefully tempers are calming that maybe we have an opportunity to do something that i think would be good really good for this area i mean you and i both see it in our constituencies you know whether it's dream act kids or the consequences of having significant illegal populations in our cities and whatnot you know we could really do a lot of good by getting comprehensive immigration reform done and when i i know when i read about uh immigration reform or when you see people talking about it on the news there's this phrase a path to citizenship and i'm wondering what the legisl in the legislative proposals that are out there right now what that path to citizenship looks like or and is it even possible because so many right wingers are absolutely opposed to a path to citizenship yeah so um you know most americans and this is the most controversial part of the comprehensive immigration reform most americans say hey we've got 12 million people in this country that are undocumented they're living in the shadows you know they're congregating on corners creating sort of as a you know a little bit of fear for people who are you know driving in those areas um they're afraid to go to the police if they get a crime committed against and they're afraid to go to hospitals if they get hurt i mean this is just not a good situation most people also acknowledge that we're not going to deport 12 million people i mean even if we had the resources to do that you know what would happen to the nation's restaurants and farms and you know some of these states that have put in place draconian anti-illegal immigrant laws are have their crops rotting on in the fields because there's no one to pick them anyway you know most americans get to the point where they say you know what so long as this person has been law abiding uh so long as they pay a significant penalty thousands of dollars because they broke our laws and we are a nation of laws so long as they're contributing by paying taxes and paying social security after a lengthy period of time in the payment of a penalty um they should be able to apply for a green card and what the senate bill does it says after 10 years after 10 years of being employed you've got to keep a job after paying your taxes paying social security and staying out of trouble with a lot you get to apply for a green card that's a pretty rigorous path now some people just say that come on in no it is far from come on in you know if you're if you're on that pathway and you lose your job you're in a lot of trouble you know you can fall off that pathway and and that strikes most americans as a fairly practical compromise now again there are those who say we just got to find them and deport them well that's just not practical i mean we could spend tens of billions of dollars and you know it would actually be pretty devastating for our economy because by and large these people are largely guilty of wanting to make a little money in the greatest economy in the world and they're working so anyway that's a controversial area but i think the way it's been structured in the senate most people would accept is a is a rigorous tough path but the one that results in a pretty good outcome i am really hopeful after talking to you that we're going to see congress uh shift into gear and maybe you know make some comprehensive changes on immigration reform i can't thank you enough for taking time to join us today our half hour is up um but it is such a pleasure to have a chance to talk with you and you know we're just we're so honored and um so pleased by the work that you're doing for us down in washington and i know you spend a lot of time away from your family and that can be tough but we really appreciate it and i hope you'll get to talk more with me in the comments absolutely look the congress could learn a lot from the assembly and the center of the state of connecticut so we've got to do more of this we have our partnership too but um hopefully we're doing some good um in washington and in your state house and uh thank you all for watching today and i i hope you'll join us next month at fairfield it's our town you

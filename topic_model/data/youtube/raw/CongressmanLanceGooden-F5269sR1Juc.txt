thank you madam Speaker this is the day the founding fathers fear when they granted Congress the power of impeachment where we have a political party so dead-set against the president that they will do anything to impeach him and they're about to get away with it simply because they have the votes but that's not how this process is supposed to work it's not meant to be dictated by a thin partisan majority nor is it meant to be used when an election is just around the corner and no one understands that better than our speaker who I have great respect for and I agree with the comments she made on March the 6th of just this year impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the nation and that's exactly what's happened and when we walk out of here tonight we all know how this results going to go the Democrats are voting for this now one republican is breaking this is not bipartisan the american people are disgusted with the United States House of Representatives and we bring shame upon this body today by moving forward this impeachment yield back

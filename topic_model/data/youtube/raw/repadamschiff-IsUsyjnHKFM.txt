>>> I CAN'T GO INTO ANY  PARTICULAR DOCUMENT OR OTHER  REQUESTS. I CAN TELL YOU THE PREMISE THAT  YOU MAKE WHICH IS NOBODY IS OFF  LIMITS HERE THAT OF ANY MEMBER  OF CONGRESS OR THE FORMER  ADMINISTRATION OR THE FORMER  PRESIDENT HIMSELF, IN WHATEVER  CAPACITY THAT HE WAS INVOLVED ON THIS ATTACK. WE'LL INVESTIGATE THOROUGHLY AND WE'LL PUT ALL OF THIS TOGETHER  IN A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT AND  LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW  WHO'S ENGAGED IN THIS ATTACK ON  OUR DEMOCRACY. IN THAT SENSE, I THINK YOU ARE  ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE CAN FOLLOW THE FACTS AND BE  COMPREHENSIVE AND NOBODY GETS A  PASS. >> RIGHT, AS YOU SAY THE CONCEPT IS NO PERSON ABOVE THE LAW,  SOMETHING THAT'S DISCUSSED A LOT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUBLIC  REPORT AT THE TOURS, IT IS NOT  CLASSIFIED. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY WERE  VALID OR DOES IT LOOK SUSPICIOUS TO YOU? >> IT SOUNDS SUSPICIOUS TO ME  AND YOU KNOW, LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO PRESUME WHAT WE'LL FIND IN  TERM OF THOSE TOURS AND  ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THEM. I HAVE A VAGUE RECOLLECTION ON  THAT DAY, WE HAVE SEEN A GROUP  OF PEOPLE NEAR ONE OF THE ENDS  OF THE SEGWAY THAT LEADS TO THE  CAPITOL AND I DON'T MEAN THE  METRO BUT I MEAN THE INTERNAL  SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE  MOVING IN THE CAPITOL. SO I WILL BE AS INTERESTED AS  ANYONE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF  THAT TO FIND OUT WE ARE MEMBERS  ORGANIZING TRUTHFUL AND WHAT  PURPOSE DO THEY KNOW, WERE THESE PEOPLE THERE SURVEILLING AND  TALKS ABOUT WHAT COULD BE DONE  ABOUT MEMBERS IN THOSE TIMES. .  >> THAT MAKES SENSE. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT, DO YOU  THINK THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT  THAT THE TRAGIC, DETERIORATION  OF THE SCENE, IS ACTUALLY PART  OF A VACUUM OF WITHDRAWAL OR  COULD THIS HAVE DONE BETTER AS A U.S. OPERATION? >> I DON'T THINK WE CAN ACCEPT  AS A PREMISE THE CHAOS WE SAW  EARLY ON WHICH HAS CONTINUED WAS INEVITABLE. THERE WERE GOING TO BE  DIFFICULTIES THAT WE DREW OUT. I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN  BETTER PLANNING INVOLVED IN THE  EVACUATION, IN THE DRAW DOWN. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE  INTELLIGENCE OVER THE LAST SIX  MONTHS WAS INCREASINGLY  PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE AFGHAN  GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ITSELF AND NOT READY TO REACH A  CONCLUSION, CERTAINLY NONE OF  THE INTELLIGENCE SUGGESTED IT  WOULD COLLAPSE OVER NIGHT WITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS THAT KABUL  WOULD FALL. TO AVOID THIS KIND OF DIFFICULTY WHERE WE WOULD HAVE THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE AT RISK OF  BEING STRANDED. >> BUT JUST TO PUT A FIND POINT, BASED ON WHAT YOU SEE AND  PUBLICLY AND NOT THE CLASSIFIED  STUFF. DO YOU VIEW IT WITH THE DECISION MAKING POLICY PROCESS BY  PRESIDENT BIDEN? >> WELL, I THINK THE DECISION  THE GET OUT IS THE RIGHT  DECISION. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH  PRESIDENT BIDEN THAT WE COULD BE THERE FIVE OR TEN OR 15 MORE  YEARS AT THE RISK OF OUR TROOPS  AND NOT HAVE A DIFFERENT  RESULTS. WE WOULD STILL SEE THE AFGHAN  GOVERNMENT COLLAPSE. THIS LOOKS LIKE A MILITARY  PLANNING FAILURE AS TO HOW WE  EVACUATE OUR PERSONNEL. THERE MAY BE MORE RESPONSIBILITY THAN THAT TO GO AROUND. IT SEEMS TO ME THE MILITARY  GENERALLY DRAWS A PLAN OF EVERY  CONTINGENCY AND HOW TO USE THE  BEST MILITARY OF THE WORLD TO  MOVE OUR PEOPLE AND OUR FRIENDS  WHO RISK THEIR LIVES WITH US  OUT. I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WE DIDN'T  HAVES A PLAN FOR A RAPID  COLLAPSE. SO, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO  AN EXTENSIVE LOOK. NOT JUST THE LAST TWO WEEKS BUT  THE LAST 20 YEARS AND WHY AFTER  ALL THAT TREASURE, WE SUCCEEDED  IN PROTECTING THE COUNTRY FROM  ANOTHER 9/11 BUT WE FAILED TO  STAND UP THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE AFGHANS WOULD FIGHT FOR. >> YEAH. >> ALL IMPORTANT POINTS AND YOU  ARE CLO

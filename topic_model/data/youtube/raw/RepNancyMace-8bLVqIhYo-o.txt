let's bring in congressman uh congresswoman nancy mace from the great state of south carolina she's a member of the house transportation and infrastructure uh committee um ms mace thanks for coming on so let's just do this let's have some fun climate action affordable housing police accountability packing the supremes and child care paid leave and caregiving what do you think in your judgment you sit on the committee now are those infrastructure no and what you're seeing is the far left redefine traditional infrastructure as human infrastructure i'm a single mom i care about kids and i care about school lunches but that should not be part of our infrastructure package and what we're seeing and when you dig even deeper about half of 50 of this 1.9 trillion dollar package really is the green new deal and sheep's clothing but if we were talking about skinny infrastructure if that were like a skinny margarita larry i think every single american would be on board with that do you remember when this is a little bit of history winston churchill uh during world war ii you know his his deputy was the labor minister clement atlee and winston called clement alley a sheep in sheep's clothing do you remember that line anyway i digress before my time but it was i know i was there but it was a great line a sheep and sheep's clothing but you're entirely right so um what do you think about this chris  senator chris coons trial balloon on the sunday talk show he's a great friend of bidens and he threw out the number 800 or something as did john cornyn now that would be a heck of a lot more acceptable would it not much more palatable for members on both sides of the aisle we were promised a bipartisan infrastructure bill so far that has not happened there are republicans and democrats up here on the hill who are working on an alternative package to what's being presented to us right now and that number would be under one trillion that's much more palatable for people especially if we can get right now and what's being presented only six six and a half percent would go to roads and bridges with traditional transportation only one percent going to airports less than one percent going to our ports and inland waterways we all know with covet 19 we have a severe supply chain issue right now in large part with our ports we have significant issues with infrastructure air traffic and control at our airports for example so if we can get back to traditional infrastructure as it's defined by every american in this country in a much more affordable format that would be great we cannot afford the largest tax hike in american history to pay for it either and that's got to be addressed as well you know you could throw in i don't think you'd object rural broadband not a hundred billion by the way it could be done for 20 or 30 billion you could throw in if there's lead pipe problems in the schools fine but you're not going to get to 3 trillion you could keep it under 1 trillion how about this toll roads user fees local bonding maybe private public partnerships ms mace would that work for you those kinds of pay fors potentially and i think states should also have the option of of having to be the ability to make those decisions for themselves as well and how they come up and match some of the funding they may receive in a in an infrastructure package but you know as you know washington doesn't have a revenue problem we have a spending problem we've had it for decades neither side is willing to address it and we've got to start doing it now we're hearing about seven trillion dollars in potential spending in the first six to nine months of this fiscal year alone that's untenable for every everyone in this country who works hard to raise their family work and retire in the greatest country in the world we can do better and we should i don't know if you heard our opening segment but it turns out a lot of this uh stimulus i call it stemi to boost consumer spending temporarily is really helping china's economy china's growing at 18 in the first quarter with a record uh export to the united states and the biggest trade deficit in history we're giving our consumers money and they're buying goods and gadgets from china i doubt if you or other members of congress or the senate really thought of it we're helping china on this right and we're also incentivizing unemployment with larger federal unemployment checks in this country i'm from the state of south carolina as you mentioned earlier unemployment is hovering just over four percent right now in the middle of a pandemic the only reason it's not lower than that is because we've incentivized people we've helped them stay home rather than go back to work and be productive more productive members of society and so we've got to allow people to to balance their health and safety with going back to work kids going back to school and and grow our economy on our own like that that's what we should be doing right now and tax cuts would actually benefit the economy we know previous to covet 19 we had the lowest unemployment rate for every american regardless of the color of your skin your gender orientation in this country and we can get back to that if we work smarter and not harder on this

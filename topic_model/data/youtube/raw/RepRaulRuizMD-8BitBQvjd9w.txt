we just toured Sunline transit and very impressed with the innovation the entrepreneurship the flexibility in using clean energy renewable sources there are leaders in innovative ways to provide energy that is clean for the environment and I'm proud to have worked and help them acquire 9.8 million dollar grant to create more hydrogen fuel buses which is something that we should look into throughout the nation I was really impressed with all the collections of items that is here at the Cabot Oil Museum it is a jewel of the desert I think people from Desert Hot Springs and residents throughout the Coachella Valley should be very proud and should be aware that this museum is very interesting and the role that he played and the role that this museum played for the city of Desert Hot Springs northern Palm Springs and throughout the desert if they're taking the time to highlight the great benefits and services your museum provides for the local community that's one of the exciting things about living here in the desert is that we have the resource to be the global leaders of renewable energy I don't want to think small I'm not here to to just get by I want to make sure that we create a vision and it's going to put us on the global map not only in the production of renewable energy but also in the manufacturing of these solar panels and wind turbines and we can do it with enough ingenuity with the nufs of local support and federal and state support we can be globe we can be exporters of our parts to other nations and to the rest of our country we have to be the benchmark leaders of what it is to provide solar for homes for businesses and for schools and public offices right here in the desert this is what I'm focused on in helping to decrease our reliance on foreign oil and to increase our energy independence and it's good for our economy it's good for our workers it's good for our desert and and also to highlight my renewable energy Jobs Act which would help train more people into the solar energy industry by providing on-the-job training grants extension of remarks are things that we put into the Congressional records so this is a copy of what we insert for the Congressional Record proceedings and debate of the 115 Congress first session House of Representatives July 27 on Thursday honoring Don Simpson for receiving a Silver Star Medal for his courageous service to our nation Garrett Haake Mr Speaker I rise to recognize an outstanding individual from my congressional district sergeant Don Simpson on Hemet California because of his

this is what I have no idea you can do that yeah my gosh just think that's me this is great his ship you know so different businesses they'll order stuff by the case about two years ago we decided to start looking into export and we really had no idea what we were doing we had no idea where to start we didn't know what legally had to happen what the rules between different countries were and what the easiest place to begin export was so we actually went to export.gov and we harnessed the power of of the United States federal government export.gov will also help you figure out financing through the small Small Business Administration through loans there if you need it and so how expensive was this to use export.gov it was essentially free so which is the best Merck freeze it's an agency that helps small businesses like yours to build not only their plan but to help develop the roadmap to start exporting your goods to other countries absolutely and if you don't know what you're doing it really is a minefield having someone to help you navigate the water the waters of trade is just you know it's an unbelievable asset and so talk about your product so our product is a line of nutritional supplements that was developed originally for military and law enforcement and our goal is to optimize human performance then the general public figured out that it was really really solid stuff so we started selling it to the general public and now we're expanding to eight countries which country so Canada China Malaysia Thailand Indonesia and Singapore thank you barriers that local small businesses face when they want to expand what networking is really important we'll start with the Coachella Valley and and anywhere you are you have to network with other local businesses in the Coachella Valley here we have the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership which is CDEP is out of Palm Springs they're a great resource and if you can network with an organization like that it's huge

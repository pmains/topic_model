to thank congressman O'Halloran for leading this Blue Dog special order on a very important issue affecting rural America the blue dogs obviously represent the breadth and width and diversity of our country but many of us represent rural areas and health care like for every American is a critical need a critical issue in 2010 before the Affordable Health Care became law and the district that I represent in California in the San Joaquin Valley 22 percent of my constituents had no health care insurance whatsoever and 17 percent were underinsured now the Affordable Health Care Act obviously has a number of areas or that we could provide much improvements if we could get bipartisan agreement but the fact that we have the ability to protect individuals from who have pre-existing conditions the fact that children can be on their parents health care insurance until 25 the things that have really expanded Medicaid and Medicare and what gets often overlooked is the eight billion dollars eight billion dollars that was provided in the Affordable Health Care Act for rural health care clinics across America now what has this mean in my district a district that represents some of the richest agricultural region in the entire country and the world well from 22% underinsured we've gone in nine years to ten percent underinsured we've cut the people who have no insurance by more than half and we've reduced the amount of level of those who are underinsured in addition clinics in my area car Moreno Livingston Golden Valley clinica Sierra to mention at least four or five have all expanded their rural health care clinics to provide more health care for people who live in rural areas from prenatal to elderly and everything in between in addition they've done innovative things like other clinics across America they've put healthcare clinics in schools in high schools and middle schools that has provided greater access to health care so we've made a difference we've improved the level of healthcare but the reality is this three decades and the number of hospitals and rural areas in our country has declined at a steep pace among the 50 rural hospitals in California more than a dozen have closed since early 2000 and it's also been devastating not only to the level of health care but to the residents who live in those communities hard-working people who contribute to our economy every day part of our our farm communities so I think it's important to note that for every thousand people in the place I live we have 0.9 physicians and anywhere else in California for every 2,000 for every thousand people there's 2.2 physicians twice as many physicians so while this is an important part of improving healthcare we need to also get medical schools and that's something that I've worked on I've worked on trying to get additional medical schools not only across the country but in the San Joaquin Valley we know that if you get a medical school there it provides an opportunity for for students who graduate from that medical school to to practice in the area in which they've graduated from we have we have proof of that we have residency programs that I've been very supportive with the California University of San Francisco si USF that has over 280 residents that are being trained in the valley right now and over half of those physicians over the last 40 years that have graduated from that residency program have stayed to practice in our Valley so a medical school is an important part of an overall strategy as Blue Dogs we want to continue to support expanded healthcare throughout our rural areas and this is something I believe Democrats and Republicans can come together in a bipartisan manner these are many ways in which we can work to ensure that rural America gets reliable affordable health care that they deserve like every other American and that's why Blue Dogs are speaking out on this issue today since taking office this administration sadly has made repeated efforts to eliminate the Affordable Health Care Act without putting anything in its place that makes no sense it makes no sense whatsoever just this week we voted on a continuing resolution to keep government open for the next six weeks we should have a real budget in place at this time and it's irresponsible ever ever as the President did early this year to shut down government but in this continuing resolution we have funding to ensure that our community health centers keep receiving the funding they need to stay open and serve their patients this year alone Congress has voted on 1010 different proposals to improve the health care and stabilize the Affordable Health Care Act for American families and they're over in the Senate right now sadly and senator Mitch McConnell refuses to bring these good measures up instead of taking action we could be lowering the cost of prescription drugs which affects all Americans whether you live in rural areas or urban areas and to ensure that we protect those who have pre-existing conditions pre-existing conditions of heart disease of cancer of diabetes and these bills sadly are collecting dust on the Majority Leader's desk so I want to close as a fifteen-year member of the Blue Dog Coalition our caucus that we stand together to try to improve health care for all Americans and for those of us who represent rural America like congressman Hal Halloran and myself and many others it's important to note that we must improve our health care system for the people who live in our rural areas it's time for the Senate to do their job pass these important bills and that we continue to work to try to expand access to health care in rural areas with our clinics to create medical schools in areas that are significantly underserved and while we continue to patiently ask the Senate to act I know the Blue Dogs will continue to advocate for policies that improve access to health care for all Americans and especially for those rural Americans who we represent I yield back the balance of my time

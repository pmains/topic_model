representative clay Higgins Republican of Louisiana he is the ranking member of the Homeland Security subcommittee on border security as well as the oversight and reform committee representative Higgins thanks for your time good morning sir yes I'm happy to be here well let me ask you this when you hear people talk about the actions of Governor DeSantis and Governor Abbott when it comes to that well what do you think it does for the conversation of immigration in the United States well the The Narrative across the citizenry is is responding to the massive illegal Crossing at our Southern border that we've been we've been enduring and suffering since uh since the modern Administration has been in power we we have communities across the country that are being heavily impacted in a very negative way and you know Governors have been left on their own to respond the the federal government has failed to secure our Sovereign international border with Mexico and the Mexican side of that border is 100 percent controlled by criminal cartels who traffic human beings and drugs so the bud Administration has essentially by policy and failure to to enforce existing laws has waived these illegals in and America has suffered because of it so the narrative is reflective of that and governors have to make decisions to to uh stabilize their own sovereign state they're doing exactly that if the ultimately the idea is to get the Border more secure what do you think these actions do towards that then specifically well the actions of the of of the governors the governors the governors don't have the authority to deport uh these illegal aliens back to their own country I'm quite sure they they wish that they did but the man you'd you'd you're speaking of or constitutionalist or Conservative Republican men so they're they're transporting as illegal immigrants who now have legal status within the country and they have a they have a destination of a record that they have provided to federal law enforcement and state law enforcement that works hand in glove with with the with the federal guys so they're they're sending them across the country close to where they want to go it's exactly what the bod Administration been doing for two years in the dead of night in the secret flights that you've heard of and read of and that America has spoken of so you know again the governors are responding to the reality that the federal government has failed to secure our International Sovereign border with Mexico and that is a federal role so it's a complete collapse of our sovereignty and and Texas is certainly suffering from it the governor is responding the entire nation has been impacted and governors have a right to to perform on behalf of their own Sovereign citizenry again you can have a conversation with our guests if you want to call 202-748-8000 for Democrats Republicans 202 separate 8001 and Independence 202 separate 8002 and text us at 202-748-8003 you're the ranking member of the Homeland Security subcommittee on border security yesterday on this program we had the chair of that committee representative net Berrigan she was asked about these actions of the governor I want to play a little bit of what she had to say about it and get your response to it well it's shameful it's shameful because they're luring these migrants under false pretenses so I'm glad to see that there's an investigation being opened up by you know the Texas Bear County officials to see what's happening if you take a look at the information that these migrants were given they were led to believe that they were going to go there to get housing that they were going to get services that they were even going to collect benefits which Asylum seekers in the United States do not get refugees to people who already have been granted Asylum will get but not Asylum Seekers and so it was very misleading and then just to leave them without giving the city officials or the governor a heads up was a real tragic situation the good that's come out of it is we've seen these communities welcome these migrants step up and say how can we help and that's what we need to do we need to make sure that we're developing a system Across the Nation that can take in these migrants that can give them that welcoming message and maybe that's something that looks like a national case management system and then also Pedro the other interesting thing to talk about and to see with who's being sent to different places we're talking about people who are coming from failing communist countries take a look at the number of migrants even those that were sent to Martha Vineyard it's people from Venezuela Nicaragua and Cuba right oppressive countries those countries aren't even taking migrants under deportation back from the United States so we've got to welcome them we've got to do better on investing in our system here and making sure that there is a better system because these political stunts it's a waste of taxpayer money and it's not the right way to do it so that were just some of her comments representative Higgins uh reaction to that the chairwoman and I have a friendly relationship we we serve on committee together and I respect her opinion and and she's she's very uh she's very erudite with her descriptions of what her position is but she's wrong of course Mr Bowden Administration it's just it's the Democrat agenda to lore illegal immigrants from across Mexico and Central America and through into South America that's the pipeline and the pipeline and receives illegal immigrants from across the world and it's the Biden Administration and and Democrats like the chairwoman that has have a lord these uh these citizens from other nation states to come to our nation illegally and the the to transport an illegal alien or a plain full or busload that's been happening for two years we've had we've had three and a half million documented uh illegal Crossings and another million and a half hardened criminals that that evade law enforcement those are my numbers official numbers nine hundred thousand but my numbers are more accurate the so you're talking about five million illegal aliens have crossed into our country in less than in in two years where do you think those people have gone of course they've been dispersed in into every square inch of America every state every County everywhere has has been impacted so you know Democrats are all about redistribution of wealth and they consider uh illegal aliens which they call migrants now they consider them to be a valuable asset to the country so you know why would they stand against the redistribution of valuable assets across the country one would think that'd be thanking the governor of Texas and Florida and regarding investigations is any American watching surprised that that this executive branch which has completely weaponized itself against conservatives across the country is anyone surprised that that conservative Governors will be investigated from from this executive branch that this doj this FBI of course as investigations happening but that's reflective of a very oppressive executive regime which has most certainly targeted regular American citizens from sea to shine and c and that's the shame but we're going to fix that in November

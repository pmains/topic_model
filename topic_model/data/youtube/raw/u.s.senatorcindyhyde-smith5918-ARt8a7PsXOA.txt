mr president senator from mississippi i joined my colleagues today highlighting the momentous occasion for not only my home state of mississippi but for our entire nation senator roger wicker and i could not be prouder of our state tomorrow the united states supreme court will hear oral arguments and dodds versus jackson women's health organization a challenge to a mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks this law the gestational age act was introduced by my friend mississippi state representative becky curry and was signed into law by mississippi governor phil bryant in 2018. this case presents a once in a generation opportunity for the court to reconsider decades of misguided abortion law that began with roe vs wade and has continued under planned parenthood versus casey there is no doubt that this case is the most significant pro-life legal opening in half a century and certainly in my lifetime i am very proud that my state of mississippi is in the center of this in the 48 years since the decision in roe versus wade 62 million unborn babies have lost their lives this is a terrible moral stain on our nation that we have a chance to reverse long last there are many reasons for the supreme court to reconsider its course for one medical technology has made significant advances especially with ultrasound technology making clear what those of us in the pro-life movement already knew that unborn children are human beings thanks in large part to the ultrasound technology we now know that by 15 weeks an unborn baby has a fully developed heart with a strong heartbeat responds to touch and can make facial expressions yawn hiccup and suck their thumbs for another the united states is a real outliner in the world when it comes to the abortion issue we are one of only seven countries that allow abortions on demand up until the moment of birth along with the likes of china and north korea the supreme court should uphold mississippi's law bringing our nation closer to the international consensus on human rights for the unborn as a legislator i am confident in saying it is time for our laws to reflect what the rest of the world has already figured out that life exists before birth and it needs to be protected the only difference in a fetus and a first grader is six years since the supreme court announced it would take up the dobbs case i have been earnestly praying for this case i've prayed for the members of the supreme court to be open to the legal and moral arguments against roe versus wade may god grant them the wisdom for the task and grace for the unborn i've also been praying for my friend mississippi attorney general lynn fitch our state solicitor general scott stewart and the many others in the ag's office who have worked tirelessly to represent our state so well in this case with the oral argument scheduled for tomorrow morning i pray that god would grant them all confidence and courage as well as the right words to say in the court most of all i've been praying for all the unborn children whose right to life hangs in the balance of this case throughout this time i've kept the words of first samuel 127 close to my heart for this child i have prayed and the lord hath given me my petition which i ask of him so today tonight and tomorrow morning i will be praying without ceasing i hope each of you will join me in prayer of this historic court decision that started in mississippi may the dobbs case restore the sanctity of life and reverse the moral stain of roe versus wade thank you mr president

so pretty much every single trump economic policy that produced a boom has been reversed by the biden gang that is producing a bust i don't like it one bit i'm powerless at least for the moment but we need some more commentary on this and joining us is our great friend senator kevin kramer of north dakota senator kramer thank you sir as always you know i just think if you go back and look i know there's a lot of speculation regarding this um outrageous uh raid in mar-a-lago and people are saying well biden at all costs does not want trump on the ballot in 2024. i'm not smart enough enough to know anything about all these legalisms and politics sure but here's what i think i do know senator kramer i know that the woke biden economic policy has tried to repeal the tax cuts the deregulation uh the fossil fuel spigot and even federal spending i mean they have reversed everything and look what it's gotten us that's i guess the bottom line is we've gone from boom to bust in what 18 or 20 months or even less than that with high inflation so like senator you know what if this newfangled big government socialism was going to work why hasn't it worked already sir well first of all there it hasn't worked in any country where it's been tried socialism has failed everywhere so why we want to try it is beyond me but you touched on something really important when you when you compare juxtapose the trump administration with this administration because in my mind the thing that donald trump had going for him in his 2016 election was he clearly understood that the federal government was the problem and he articulated that the size of the deep state the size of the bureaucracy what he underestimated was just how strong that bureaucracy really is and so while he was reducing regulations and while he was both through rule making process legislating as well as you know just guidance from the from the bureaucracy people were working against him at every turn and even at that he was able to accomplish a lot and what we saw was that the private sector and investment follows lower taxes fewer regulations and frankly even a better environment that's that's manifest itself just an attitude right and so now you have exactly the opposite and so this changes the investment mind it and it changes by the way the relationship with states um you know i wrote a 22-page essay for the harvard law and legislative review uh that just came out in june that talks about the the bureaucracy and the heavy hand of the bureaucracy and the the uh throwing out the states and it focuses on on cooperative federalism donald trump understood the value of states and state regulation and state oversight and uh that was that was a game changer in terms of unleashing ingenuity innovation and and our economy i mean i i always thought look i'm you know when i was a child i worked for ronald reagan and i always learned you know that government that governs least governs best now it just seems to me with team biden it's that government that governs most governs most for best or whatever the right adjective is going to be i mean you could have a clearer difference in philosophy i think president trump fell on the limited government side uh i know i think we probably spent too much but taxes and regulations and energy and so forth i i think he was good he's good law and our guy now it's my thought is if the bidens are so good at this where are the economic results so they roll back these policies they rail against trump uh every chance they get and so forth and so on so where's the prosperity where's the boom where's the low food prices where's the low gasoline prices you follow at some point common sense says show me the money show me the results i don't see them well the yeah you're exactly right the problem i believe is is in their hearts because they believe that there are too many people making too much money and that all we need to do is take more of their money away from them redistribute it to people who have less and somehow that's good for the economy all the way around and of course that has failed everywhere it's been tried but they're trying it again whether even this crazy idea of of forgiving student loan debts at ten thousand dollars larry if they took all of that money and just forced every student to take an economics 101 class or supply side economics class or study milton friedman under art laffer we would do so much more for the economy than than what they're trying to do the problem is their constituency is that very government that they're growing that they love that government they love the power of it they love the dependency of it they love the organization of it and and that's just a fundamental difference between us and them you know senator that's such an interesting point you just made so i don't think it's good public policy to forgive student loans i think you're asking 70 of the taxpayers to pay for 30 uh and that's those numbers have stood the test of time but you know what if you told me that the people with student loans have been studying through mild friedman and friedrich hayek and art laffer i might be willing to forgive those loans wouldn't that be something free markets if you could prove to me that you were taking a good course that taught those books those textbooks i don't know i mean i i'd probably forgive the loans what you think no i think that's a swell idea in fact i think everybody ought to buy dick army's memoirs and read that as well you need to find out what works best but we do have an economic illiteracy problem right in our own government i mean this is jennifer granholm the secretary of energy every time she talks i swear to god there's a professor somewhere in an economics department going what did i go you know what did i do wrong where did i go it's unbelievable what these people believe wait a second let me get um your solar panels are going to be 30 less so you're going to have a big cost saving the problem is they cost 15 they cost 15 or 20 000 wait your tesla may be less but you're still going to have to pawn up 75 or 80 grand if you can get your hands on one these are cost savings senator kramer how could you not as well as i've said you missed that as i've said many times if you give somebody a 7 500 tesla tax credit the price of a tesla goes up 7 500 it's basic 101 in fact ford just announced that they're going to do exactly that yeah so i don't i you know and gmt say it's sometimes you can't get through then gm2 and why wouldn't they it's the most natural incentive in the marketplace this is why the government should stay out of the marketplace and what happens is with with all of these ideas as they they compound so you you end up having a tax credit for one thing so some they're competing at the he has to have a tax credit and you just pile tax credits on top of tax credits and and this is why corporate america gets bigger and richer and the government gets bigger and poorer and the middle income rate wage owner is scratching is going my my paycheck's not going as far as it used to and you get 150 000 irs agents to sort through the tax credits on the tax credits i got to jump out senator kramer i love this idea if some if a student reads milton friedman and arthur laffer we're going to forgive their student loan senator kevin kramer great stuff

i rise today to offer a resolution i do not offer this resolution on my own behalf i offer it as a representative of the people of the united states to formalize the unspoken sentiments and concerns that abound in our nation right now any authority i have is given to me by the people and this is what we believe our nation is unique it is distinctive exceptional american exceptionalism is too often misunderstood to mean something that it is not it does not mean justification to dominate or condescend to other nations or indulges flattery to ourselves that we are better it does not mean that we are a chosen people or that circumstances give us privilege to circumvent law our nation is bound by the same universal moral principles that must bind and shape the behaviors of all civilized nations in this regard we are all the same as nations and yet we are different very different in a very important way it is not wealth or military power that makes us exceptional it is not our institutions nor the genius of our written constitution or our bill of rights not directly these are manifestations of something more fundamental and profound our ex exceptionalism is based on something else a singular belief a proposition you might call it a proposition underlying all legal and constitutional beliefs our assertions of human equality and unalienable rights life liberty and the right to pursue happiness the right to find meaning and purpose and value in our individual lives derives from a single assertion that life given to us by creator god is the moral basis of the unshakable bedrock of our republic that proposition the thing that makes us distinctive is that we believe a creator god endowed us with rights not just us everybody everywhere it is a gigantic revolutionary belief and it is a belief it is our faith statement it is what speaks to the soul of our nation there are many great and ancient nations that believe in freedom as we do most countries in the world claim the rule of law and have written constitutions many of us use language of rights and equality and declare for human dignity but none have a co correct basis for doing so we alone occupy that space god gave us rights made us in his image and therefore demonstrated all human beings are created equal even the unborn from conception the poor the infirm the old the weak all colors and kinds all races all of us are endowed by the creator equally because we are made in his image without this fundamental belief rights become only social protocol conventions historic inheritances creatures of state citizenship class identity and features of consensus they become malleable and fading creatures in the capicious hands of willful men but america is different god endowed us with rights and that belief is either true or it is false if it is false then we americans among all mankind are most to be pitied the experiment must fail it cannot and must not succeed but if it is true then we have built our country on a foundation that cannot be shaken if we are true to it if we are anchored in the eternal bedrock of all truth as lincoln said as a nation of free men we will live forever or die by suicide to those whom are given much much is expected and somewhere deep down deep down inside every american we know this it is the air that we breathe only we ourselves can end this great experiment there are no external mortal forces that can overcome the bulwarks of that eternal truth and therefore what we believe matters madam speaker our indivisible immaterial beliefs are the strength of our national soul the things that we hold on to and serve are the foundations of our institutions our laws our liberty and the hope of our nation when the founders established this republic 250 years ago and created the institutions that guide us they were well aware that those institutions were insufficient in themselves to govern a free people the lifeblood and the heartbeat of the nation is moral character not the institutions not the institutions or even the laws themselves for laws and institutions are corruption without the rectitude and wisdom of a moral decent people without the people embracing themselves to wisdom and the holdfast of character our institutions have no power to preserving us if the people ever lose their love of truth justice goodness and the eff essence of beauty that flourishes in them there can be no hope in the parchment barriers of a constitution or the institutions created by it no matter how noble that hope is in effect everything rises and falls in our republic as a consequence of the character of the people as a nation we live or die by the standards of our own moral character the founders knew this but many of us know we are forgetting it quote we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religions apharis ambitious and revenge would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other john adams wrote that to the militia of massachusetts what he is saying is this the power of the state is not secured by the power of arms it is anchored in the honesty and decency of the people today this may seem a quaint notion i hope it is not but the founders who experimented in government to create a just and free society understood explicitly that freedom and justice are not the products of institutions but rather institutions that defend freedom and justice are the product of a moral people freedom cannot exist without morality george washington understood this john adams understood this abraham lincoln understood this dr martin luther king understood this i believe this not because they believed it but because it is true i believe that most americans understand this when we drift from the creator we drift from the source of our own liberty when we forget we get our duties to god we forget our duties to each other when we become proudful and lazy and forget the father of all rights we become orphans of oppression we are lost without the guiding hand of the almighty it may seem that congress is not the place to introduce an appeal to god i disagree and so far as all our rights and all our institutions are based upon the presumption of a just and almighty god and since this congress itself rests upon the foundation that our creator gave us the right to govern ourselves to quote my hero abraham lincoln it is all together fitting and proper that we do this it is precisely because of america's distinctive belief that i rise in this house to offer a resolution to humble ourselves and entreat wisdom from god the father of all blessings and mercy a resolution of contrition prayer and fasting a resolution in the great tradition of our free people we have as his guide evidence many times before a resolution to return to the wellspring of liberty and our rights a resolution to depart from iniquity and entreat his guidance a prayer that we remember him as the father of every good thing that we have and everything as a nation and people we aspire to be whereas we the people of the united states of america continue our search for a more perfect union and whereas we are a people conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all are created equal yet like in the days of abraham lincoln when he observed that we have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied enriched and strengthened us whereas we have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts that these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own whereas we confess we are self-consumed prideful and unloving quick to point out the speck in another person's eye while missing the log in our own whereas we're trusting in our wealth and skill and leaning on our own understanding whereas we become ungrateful lovers of pleasure stubborn hard-hearted divisive and unforgiving whereas we confess that instead of speaking of forgiveness we cry out for vengeance we've allowed the poisonous root of bitterness to grow up and trouble us whereas the global pandemic okova 19 has intensified fear unknowns chaos and confusion whereas the impact of lockdowns and isolations has been here further exasperating the breakdown of mental health families communities and our nation whereas we are divided perhaps like we haven't seen since the civil war when abraham lincoln president abraham lincoln by faith prayed saying may we again devote ourselves to prayer and acknowledge as a people and as a nation our dependence upon the overruling power of god let us confess our sins and transgressions in humble sorrow yet with the assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon whereas by faith at the 1787 constitutional convention when the outcome looked grim benjamin franklin appealed to the delegates and urged prayer asking i have lived a long time and the longer i live the more convincing proofs i see of this truth that god governs in the affairs of men and if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid whereas during world war one and at the signing of the armistice president wilson proclaimed complete victory god has indeed been gracious let us thank him whereas this year marked the 80th anniversary of the initial national bible week declaration made by president franklin d roosevelt just weeks before the start of world war ii whereas george washington carver born a slave during the civil war testified in 1921 in front of the house ways and means committee expounding on the myriad of ingenious uses for the peanut transforming the economy and which had been revealed to him by faith as he regularly walked through the woods at 4 am whereas president john f kennedy said the guiding principle of this nation has been is now and ever shall be in god we trust whereas reverend dr martin luther king jr encouraged us to pray daily to be used by god in order that all men might be free therefore be it resolved by those assembled we pray that in this hour of our great need our sovereignty god will come and do again as he's done in days gone by we pray for a time of healing from our brokenness broken lives broken families broken communities and broken systems we resolve to humble ourselves pray seek god's face turn from our wicked ways and thank and praise the god of our ancestors who's given us wisdom and strength and who controls the course of events therefore it behooves us to call upon the people of our nation to humble ourselves before our creator and acknowledge our complete dependence upon him to repent of our pride and selfishness and to ask the lord to break our hearts for the things that break his heart that we may not miss hearing his voice and that he will pour out his spirit once again on our nation and leaders we proclaim a year of national humiliation fasting and prayer what might god do in the next 365 days if we commit to re reading his word daily and praying together for our nation in our families for the young generation this generation in misery and despair we are expectant that he will do immeasurably more than all we could ask or imagine and that he will hear from heaven forgive our sins and heal our land may he be as original with us as he's been with others amen i yield back

Thank You mr. speaker and thank you to my colleague from Montana and from Hawaii also for their supportiveness briefly mr. speaker this is what you get when people talk about issues and not cliches this is a long time in the making folks from as has previously been indicated folks from the wilderness areas folks from economic development areas folks from the resource extraction areas all coming together on this but just in case there is some concern about they're about oh my god potentially we are transferring the federal estate let's remind people of a couple of things that is that are in this legislation first of all nothing is transferred for nothing it talks about the appraisal process and how if you're going to purchase the federal estate you're going to pay for it secondly it's talking about exchanges along the trans-pacific legislation on the checkerboard from 1862 which talks about the Secretary of the Interior is a full partner with the County Commission in identifying those lands that are appropriate for exchange why is this important this is important because if they don't think it's a good idea to exchange then the Secretary of the Interior can stop that process so it doesn't force the Secretary of Interior to exchange lands that he or she in the future doesn't want to but let's remind ourselves of one other thing exchanges of checkerboard land are not just something that benefits perhaps economic development along the interstate 80 corridor or somebody who grazes who does a cow-calf operation somewhere it also allows resource managers federal land managers wildlife people to consolidate checkerboard lands where they need to be consolidated to do things like preserve habitat preserve special resource areas whether it's for mule deer whether it's for the endangered species potential of the sage hen and other things like that so it's a two-way street so my congratulations to the folks of Pershing County and the BLM employees in the Winnemucca district by the way no lands are subject to this that haven't been identified in their resource management plan their planning document as potentially available for either exchange or disposal finally I want to remind you of this there are a hundred and fifty thousand acres that can be bought out of a potential federal estate of over nine million acres in that County so it's a fraction of one percent and of the potential available for exchange it sets an upper limit of 300,000 potential the county has to ask for it the Secretary has to agree to an exchange so when you talk about the size of the federal estate in Pershing County which by the way is the home to the Burning Man festival for those of you that follow that sort of stuff it is something that is quite frankly not something that is going to change the landscape literally speaking in terms of the ownership and the diminishment of the federal estate there's still the major player to the tune of at the end of the day 95 percent of the federal estate is still intact finally on wilderness study areas and wilderness creation areas we have in this bill you have created about one hundred and forty-eight thousand dollars of new 148 thousand acres of new wilderness areas and you have released parts of five different wilderness study areas that are about 48,000 acres so when you start talking about this is a good housekeeping measure it allows Pershing County to come into the the new age in terms of what they think is appropriate for their economic diversification and vitality but also gives federal land managers resource folks wildlife groups and conservation groups the tools to do good things in Pershing County to the last piece and I want to thank my colleague for his generous provision of the time is this the most successful public lands legislation in the country is probably the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act which turns twenty this year much of this is patterned on that when you talk about what happens when they sell money it goes to education it goes to the and then 85% of every dollar brought in goes for the benefit of those federal lands for those federal land managers in Pershing County it's been working in Southern Nevada for twenty years this is a good step I encourage your bipartisan nationwide support Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back gentleman from another

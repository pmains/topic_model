uh thank you chairwoman for for allowing me to ask questions and thank you for hosting this hearing you know president eisenhower was from kansas grew up in my district and he used to say that farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand months from a corn field and there's a lot of lot of truth in that i think you know we're having a lot of conversations about the input side which is what we need to be talking about the biggest issue facing um the first district uh of kansas today and and moving forward i think we've got to acknowledge that to a large degree this is self-inflicted i mean this irrational war on fossil fuel is the basic reason we've seen these incred these input prices increase um it's also self-inflicted because this war against our chemicals and how modern day agriculture works this just makes no sense the policies that we're pursuing so that happens and then things come along um that may or may not be within our control like ukraine that just exacerbates the problems i think we've got to acknowledge that um you know we all know this crop insurance is absolutely vital and it does two things it benefits farmers but it also benefits americans because we've never had to rely on another country for our food supply we get that wrong um the whole world looks entirely different certainly our country looks different and i know we've talked a little bit about this but for you specifically dr outlaw you know given the ability to make some changes uh to crop insurance this year and i think we need to use a scalpel and not a sledgehammer but what specific changes would you make would you advise that we consider making to to the crop insurance program in this next farm bill really i don't have very many changes other than there's a situation right now with uh the uh basically back in the ethanol situation uh the usda capped the ano for uh for agents and and that has caused a a problem with providing insurance policies to the specialty crops and and that to me is one of those things i'm not an expert on it but i've been reading about it and it's one of those things that needs to be adjusted sooner rather than later in terms of the rest of the crop insurance products obviously we've got a really good system in place where new policies can be developed and the government helps policies be developed and paying for the cost which will make it more likely so i really can't say that there's anything else that really needs to be looked into uh for crop insurance other than uh that a o issue that again i'm not the expert on but i know it's out there okay you know based on recent drought monitoring indexes in kansas you know we have some areas that are 10 to 15 inches behind annual rainfall this year you know so areas of the country certainly severe drought which is leading to uh less forage less hay less ability to feed our for livestock producers who also are facing you know record inputs a question for you dr rainey can you speak more to the value of the current risk management products available to our livestock producers i think that they've been they've been enhanced recently uh i still think that there is uh as farmers uh learn of these products i think there's opportunities for for technical assistance to to help enhance the understanding and how to use those products more effectively uh i think that that i think if you're going back to retirement in general crop insurance i think that that the metric is protection to the farmers and ranchers and as we look and sometimes we can look and see whether a product is being used or not and actually just do some follow-up and feedback to get some feedback on why products aren't being used and and sometimes that's the indicator of that lack of understanding or additional work being needed to change some of the parameters of the program right and so i think that especially uh i've heard a lot of success stories from uh from a lot of our livestock farmers in terms of the forage in terms of drought products that have been advanced that are really helpful as we see this enhanced issues with climate variability yep thank you last night i just said you know while we're discussing these tools available to farmers and ranchers across the country i think we also have to take a moment to discuss the impact of some of the administration's proposed changes to the tax code specifically president biden's most recent budget once again included eliminating the stepped-up basis it also includes imposing capital gains taxes on farms rangers and businesses that have been held in a family for over 90 years or more i'm calling this the farm killer task because it would destroy the livelihood of producers across the country dr outlaw my last question would be a few have you examined the impact of changes to the tax code would have on farms and ranches and can you expand on what an elimination of the stepped-up basis or the new farm killer tax would mean for farm country yes sir we actually did a study at the request of uh ranking member thompson and senator bozeman last year that across all of our 94 farms 98 of them would be affected by elimination of stepped up basis at an average cost of 750 000 extra in tax yeah once again it might be stepped up or this would be you know self-inflicted nonsense and we got to make sure we don't let that happen to our ag producers so thank you with that i yield back

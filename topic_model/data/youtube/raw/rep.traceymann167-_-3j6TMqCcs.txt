hi congressman tracy mann welcome to my office i'm getting ready to walk down to the floor of the house of representatives to submit these six pieces of legislation i like many americans have been appalled at the number of executive orders that president biden has issued clearly bypassing congress and the founding fathers intent these six pieces of legislation will require the administration to provide a 30-day notice before an executive order is issued to congress so that americans can know what's happening and then it'll also require six months later and annually thereafter for the administration to let congress and the country know the impact of these executive orders now what we're submitting will cover things like agriculture we've got to protect our farmers and ranchers it'll cover energy oil and gas industry the natural natural resources pro-life legislation our second amendment rights as well as immigration so i can't wait to walk downstairs and submit my first six piece of legislation [Music] [Music] you

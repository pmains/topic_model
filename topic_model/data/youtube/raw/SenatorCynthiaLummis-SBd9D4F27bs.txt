bipartisan team of senators revealing details of some long-awaited cryptocurrency legislation this legislation is called the responsible financial innovation act and it comes courtesy of wyoming republican cynthia lummus and new york democrat kirsten gillibrand both senators join us right now first on squawk box and uh ladies welcome it is great to see both of you because there's so much anticipation about what this could mean first of all i'll ask you senator lumus how this kind of came about that you two are working together and how much support you found from your colleagues on this well we put out early drafts of this bill in december so it's been a long time coming and when senator gillibrand joined in her contributions to this bill have been significant and important we've put out several iterations for comments we've had multiple meetings with regulators with the regulated industry and a lot of stakeholders and we wanted to take our time to put the best draft that we could assemble onto the table we think they're we're there today's the day senator gillibrand let's break it down for people who haven't seen the details yet i think the most important part is that it it declares that that things like bitcoin and ether are commodities and so they would be regulated by the cftc a lot of other things would be considered equities to be regulated by the sec how did you come about with kind of deciding this how much squabbling is there because there has been some in a regulatory kind of dispute about who should be able to regulate this between the cftc and the sec the most important goal of this legislation was to create safety and soundness to create consumer protections transparency accountability and certainty when we met with industry leaders they basically said we just need to know what the rules of the road are we've been seeking regulation from various regulators and the delays in response have been unconscionable and so what we did was common sense uh we used existing definitions if you're a security you're going to pass the howie test which is the securities definition and for cftc uh we already had the futures market so we added the spot market for cryptocurrencies and we look at each digital assets purpose and based on the purpose we've uh aligned the regulatory framework around that purpose already though there's squabbling that's continued that's going back and forth people saying look how can you regulate a decentralized effort to begin with and by the way aren't there conditions where some of these things would be considered equities and should be regulated by the sec you're right this has taken a really long time and the industry is kind of pushing back and others are too jumping in on this i guess that gets me back to that original question uh senator gillibrand how much support do you have do you think that this is something that the senate will get behind i do and i think this is just day one and our goal is to make sure this goes through the four committees of jurisdiction it takes a long time to build a regulatory framework for a new industry and we expect this to go through the banking committee which cynthia is on it'll go through the agriculture committee which i'm on it will go through intelligence and it'll go through financial services these committees will have pieces of the bill because they only regulate parts of this industry and regulation is necessary you need to make sure that you have consumer protections you need basic rules of the road and that's what this legislation provides we think there's going to be a lot of momentum behind this bill having met with most of the industry stakeholders and the experts in this field and we're just going to work with them over time to continue to improve the bill who who have you talked to senator lumus in terms of the leadership are they on board with this i i know you've reached out to to both the left and the right where do you think your biggest support is coming from we have found very receptive people on both sides of the aisle we've met with the leaders of the finance committee as senator gillibrand mentioned there will be four committees involved in this bill so we'll want to go through and sort out how the bill can be divided among the committees and then continue to meet with all of their members not just the chairs but all of their members the fact that we're on several of these committees helps we've met with the chairs and ranking members of all of the committees of jurisdiction they know we're working on it they know our approach they know that we're trying to just fit the digital asset world into our current regulatory framework and have a general uh overview of how we're going about it so we've had dinners we've had breakfast we've had briefings we've had meetings we've brought in speakers we've gone to meet with them individually we our staffs have met with their staffs this has been a lengthy effort on our part to not only brief our colleagues but also collect information from the stakeholders hey senators two questions for you one is and i'm sure you saw this a little over a month ago fidelity the largest 401k manager in the country um announced that they were going to offer uh bitcoin to users or to consumers uh companies have to choose to allow their employees to put bitcoin in their 401ks the labor department came out and said this is a terrible idea what do you think i think the labor department's wrong i think it's a wonderful idea it should be part of a diversified asset allocation and it should be on the end of the spectrum of a store of value obviously if you have a fully diversified asset allocation you have some assets that you want to produce income in the short run you also want some assets that are just a store of value and i think that's where bitcoin really shines i think it's some of the hardest money that's ever been created in in the world and for that reason it belongs as a slice of a diversified asset allocation for retirement funds senator joe brown you agree disagree no i agree and that's why this piece of legislation is so important and why it's so timely once you create basic infrastructure around these types of digital assets where there are disclosure requirements where they have a regulator where there's full transparency that is going to create the safety and soundness in the market that will give other people comfort that this is a market that is here to stay it's one that is properly regulated and one uh that has oversight and accountability and that's what this legislation is going to do so while many people are uncomfortable with where these digital assets are being used or offered today once a regulatory framework is put around it there will be more comfort there senators and then i always ask you a philosophical question considering you're dealing with the sec and the cftc there has long been chatter about whether these two agencies should actually be one that there's too much competition between them there's too much uh infighting about who's going to take this and who's going to regulate that and how they're going to do it in different approaches some people think the competition is good some people think the competition is terrible what do you think i think it's our job as congress members to create the laws and they implement the laws and they should not be fighting over jurisdiction that is why cynthia and i work so hard to make thoughtful decisions about what part of these digital assets go to each regulator each regulator has expertise that is unique it's important that the cftc continue to review and have oversight over commodities they're going to need more resources when this industry goes to them which is why we have a revenue stream going into the cftc specifically so that they can hire more experts more cyber security uh personnel uh and more lawyers it's important that they have the resources to do the work we are giving them to do but the distinct responsibilities of the sec and cftc are significant and so they have to continue to focus on their areas of expertise and allow these markets to flourish and and we spent a lot of time on the definition of the modern howie test in fact we looked at every single circuit court decision that has ever referenced the howie test to make sure that our current definition is sufficiently modern and updated so that it's going to be fairly clear between the cftc and the sec about which assets fall into which regulatory regime but senator lemis the sec chairman has been very clear that he would like to regulate a lot of these things has has he made any comment on this about kind of losing out on things like bitcoin and ether you know we continue to meet with the regulators i think you met with him yesterday i'm meeting with him today and we're going to continue to work with both the cftc and the sec to make sure that we both have found the right mix of using the howey test to sort out uh which of those agencies best can regulate so we think that because we're using the howey test it'll it's going to work it's going to come come out just fine it this just says this is day one and i think uh this is not the day of the vote on the bill that will be day 100. day one is you introduce the ideas so that the people who have responsibility to write these laws have a chance to look at it learn about it we can have a lot of round tables and hearings about it and we can um mark up these bills so each one will be taken their par part that's their jurisdiction and they will create their own oversight that will happen over the weeks and months to come and it is our job fundamentally for congress to write these laws and the regulators to implement them they don't decide what they get to keep and what they don't we have to write that rule for them which we're going to do and over time this market will become more and more stable and more and more transparent and have the kind of safety and soundness that we expect in the united states my guess is you're going to face some pretty significant lobbying from a lot of different parties over the next hundred days or so while you do this senator gillibrand let me ask you um your state lawmakers in your state new york last week passed a law or that will halt permits for new cryptocurrency mining facilities because of concerns about the environment what do you think about that so i think that is an oversimplification of the issue and i think there was just an urgency to protect specifically our pristine resources like the finger lakes because clean water is essential for many industries in new york such as farming such as our drinking water such as tourism and so that was specific to one particular miner that the entire advocacy came around i think long term there will be places that are appropriate for bitcoin mining and places that are not but each state can figure that out my view is i'm trying to create the regulatory framework for these digital assets with existing infrastructure and let states make other decisions about what they want we also have a new york regulator who's been issuing bit licenses for a while but that regulator is kind of doing all the work right now and she would love to have some federal oversight as well yeah senators gillebrand and lomas we want to thank you for your time and thanks for your efforts on this it's uh something the markets have been awaiting so we will continue and watch and and see where things shake out from here thank you

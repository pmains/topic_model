Our hearts are still heavy grieving for the
17 innocents murdered in Parkland and praying for their families and friends. I cannot begin to fathom the sorrow of the
parents who must bury a child. From the time our children are born, we instinctively
understand it is our responsibility to protect them. But increasingly as a nation, we are failing
our children and allowing them to be gunned down in schools, at concerts, in houses of
worship. Still, in this darkest time, I see reason
to hope. I’m inspired by the eloquence of the survivors
and the young people across the country who are speaking out for positive action. We all know there are commonsense actions
that would curb gun violence in our communities and save lives. Universal background checks; banning military-style
assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks; and funding mental health
care to name but a few. These measures have overwhelming support from
the American public. All that’s missing is the political will
from Congress. Hopefully this moment is different. I urge my colleagues to listen to the voices
of our young people. Let’s have the debate and vote on real actions
to reduce gun violence in our schools, our neighborhoods and across the country.

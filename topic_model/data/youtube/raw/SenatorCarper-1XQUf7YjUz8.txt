I as our presiding officer knows I no longer the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee but I am the senior Democrat I've served on the committee for about 15 years and the issues of security of our homeland with us from cyber attacks or terrace or any number of other threats is one that I thought about and care a whole lot of a whole lot about the couple of months ago i'm sure the presiding officer recalls and mall of us probably recalled it the other side of the Capitol the got a special visitor and he addressed a joint session of the the Congress and his name was Francis he is the Pope was a papal visit and he addressed a joint session of of the Congress I'm not Catholic but I was moved and I know a lot of our colleagues were removed especially when he invoked in front of a national television audience the Golden Rule and when he called on all of us to treat other people the way we want to to be treated and also when when he invoked the words of Matthew 25 when I was hungry did you feed me when I was naked did you clothed me when I was thirsty did you give me to drink when I was a stranger in your land did you take me in did you take me in and the the prospect of a thousand or so Syrian refugees coming to this country this year and more next year is it says when I when I hear that I think of that the desperate plight of a lot of people that are trying to escape hellacious situation in Syria they've been here living in some cases of months or years in in refugee camps what kind of moral imperative do we have with respect to them what kind of moral imperative what kind of moral imperatives we have at the same time to ensure that the folks that we allow to come and refugee status to this country that we're going to protect those of us who live here those of us who live here from possible of threats that might be caused by that immigration and this week I've learned a few things that mr. president I didn't know before a lot more I have to learn but among the things that I've learned so this week is when folks who are refugees whether they're in Turkey or someplace in that part of the world or whether on the other side of the world in Pakistan or any other place refugees when they seek to come to this country they don't get to come just like this is I like I'm going to apply as refugee status to come to us and I would like to come this week or this month or even this year the average weight for for folks are ever in refugee status trying to get some place out of a refugee camp and could be here but if they're especially trying to come here they cut the average weight for those refugees is is not a week it's not a month it's not a year it's a year and a half and for folks who are of Syrian descent the other way could be even even longer I'm not going to go mr. president through all of the hurdles that folks have to go through but it's a screening process that begins not with the department homeland security in this country it's a screening process it begins way before that with the UN High Commission for Refugees they first registered refugees they gehrig a biometric data and they gather other background information only those who passed the UN assessment are ever referred to the United States for for possible resettlement the in a case where there look we're looking for maybe to accept a thousand Syrian refugees this year the the UN High Commissioner for Refugees may interview three four five thousand refugees or more to find a kind of come up with a list of a thousand that we would even consider those are refugees are interviewed not when you get off a plane here but overseas before they ever get onto a plane before they ever get onto a plane they go through any number of multiple background checks and vetting then use by biographical checks conducted by the State Department security advisory opinions from intelligence and other agencies for certain cases National Counterterrorism Center checks with intelligence agency support da Department of Homeland Security and FBI biometric checks Department of Defense biometrics screen and then when they get here if they get here after going through all of that then they have the opportunity to be interviewed again face to face by the department of homeland security folks who are trained to be interviewing people alleging to be refugees could be something else and then after they if they get approved to stay here as a refugee then we continue to monitor them for an extended period of time for the people in our country who are led to believe as we were a year so we'll go with folks who remember about uracil go with Ebola when there was great concern that you know we're gonna add a lot of people coming here across the border with Mexico and they're gonna have a bold and they're going to affect us all and a lot of people are going to die not one American ever died from from a bullet contracted day here on so i would have much just take a deep breath try to gather the facts and and understand really what somebody's got to go through in order as a refugee ever to get here and it's not an overnight a one-week it's not a one month it's not a one-year deal if i happen to be a bad guy over there wanting to come over here and create mischief I sure I'll tell you I sure wouldn't go as a refugee I wouldn't out cool my jets for a year and a half trying to get through that process I find another way

Dr Calvin one of the things that our committee's been focused on is the uh growing concern about orbital debris is there a threat posed to the landsat program by growing amounts of orbital debris is this something you are focused on so at Nasa people think about this and we agree that it's important to ensure that space is usable for years to come space debris and and mega constellations are an issue that need to be addressed by U.S leadership and I think I can refer other colleagues within my Agency for more information on that thank you very much um Dr abdullati being from the West uh you know well the dangers of not only drought but also some surprise flooding from snowpack melt in Wyoming we saw a lot of damage this spring around Yellowstone National Park where we had a surprisingly rapid snowmelt due to some unseasonably warm weather and Rain simultaneously and so um are there ways that um landsat can help mitigate these sorts of disasters well the mitigation what we can do is observe as they unfold so we can mitigate the management of those kinds of disasters and preparation and it's not just landsat it's it's other observations because it requires understanding the potential for rain you know how much water is in the atmosphere how much is going to fall out how much snow we call it snow water equivalent is is stored in the mountains so you mentioned rain rain makes melt happen much faster it's a much more efficient Energy Delivery system form out so it really requires the monitoring and forecasting of rainfall temperature the rate at which it'll occur the topography because the runoff of the water dictates or is a big driver in flooding as well so all of those elements combine certainly landsat is a component of it but there's much more to be observed thank you um Mr Gallagher as you know Wyoming is rich in oil gas coal uranium um it's my understanding that using images from landsat we were able to determine the subsurface composition of minerals and other deposits based on above ground particles certainly it's true with uranium we see that in Fremont County Wyoming as well as some other counties how how's the data collected by landsats program making our natural resource location and extraction more efficient pinpointing and a little better good thank you for the question so yes it's true that the superficial geology if you know this official geology then then it can tell you what whether or not it's complementary for minerals and oil and gas uh landsat has some spectral bands that provide some certain information about the surface more broadly at USGS we have other sensors that can do that as well so in my mission area I partner with the energy and minerals Mission area on a project we called we call Earth MRI so we're flying Airborne instrumentation that is electromagnetic data that lets us see us into the subsurface for the identification of critical minerals so I just cite that as an example there as my colleague said they're really multiple sensors that give you that kind of information both on the surface and subsurface and landsat has a role thank you um Dr volts are you are you still there can you hear me can hear you finally going on great thanks um I want to expand on a question that was asked earlier are there data sets that can be used to help us combat wildfires in real time as uh as chairman Hickenlooper stated you know if we can catch them early enough we can really contain the damage um and and I'm curious about whether data sets uh can be used in that way what Dr abiladi just said a few minutes ago yeah we're getting we're getting a lot of feedback all right say yes okay good good you answered my question and you yes yeah and then and then you reference stuff Dr abdallotti's name so I wonder if I might turn him to elusive yeah a little bit yeah I'm sorry can you restay you're asking if there are data sets yeah that can can help us identify in real time um Wildfire uh potential or oh certainly uh you know in fact um I personally my my neighborhood was destroyed by the Marshall fire uh in Colorado we lost 1100 homes mine was not one of them it was a lot of smoke damage but uh personally as we were evacuating I with my daughter and my coughing dog um the I just looked around at how dry the land was and felt the wind you know and so it's information on wind speeds it's information on drought soil moisture is is key because well it was a likely human ignited fire as most wildfires are the conditions for it the fuel for it were in the dryness of the soil and the vegetation the winds that just cause it to to rip through the neighborhood the area so data sets are soil moisture information on vegetation so we understand its Health how dry it is is it kindling or is it you know Green winds precipitation and all of these can be derived from not not solely or exclusively but from satellite observations as some of which were mentioned here landsat is is a great element of that system but there are also things like forecasting winds and understanding soil moisture and other other data sets so yes it's an integration of capability thank you and can I ask one more quick question do I have time for that uh Mr jablonski um is there a way the private sector can work with the public sector's data sets and information to um provide even more information uh thanks Senator absolutely for example on a private sector satellite World V3 we have over 20 multi-spectral bands including shortwave infrared sensors and those shortwave infrared sensors can actually see through the smoke to determine the boundaries of a wildfire where the hot spots are and help the the teams on the ground as determined it can also tell you when you think you've got to fire out where you still have localized hot spots that you might need to take care of or or work on and then um maxar and other commercial companies have weather desk type abilities so for example our weather prediction capabilities are used commercially but can also be used by governments to determine crop Health to figure out economic indicators and in areas like this think think about what a propagation pattern might look like in a localized area thank you panel really appreciate your testimony

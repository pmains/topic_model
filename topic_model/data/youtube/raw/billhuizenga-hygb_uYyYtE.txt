uh hey everyone bill heisenga and uh trying to get uh some lighting here uh out obviously in washington dc uh just walked off the house floor and actually i don't even think the vote has concluded yet on a a vote ostensibly a rule vote but this rule vote is going to spend an authorized spending for another half a trillion dollars um it is uh sadly a uh another cynical play by the speaker let me just explain a little bit about what's going on so uh we were scheduled to have a district work week this week we then had this fiscal cliff that was created by the democrats in the senate in the house with both the spending as well as the debt ceiling this is something that that mitch mcconnell has talked about in the senate and others have been talking about getting the the budget reconciliation the 303.5 trillion dollar stimulus spending uh having uh having a debt ceiling get rolled in so they called us back for a stand-alone bill except it wasn't wasn't a standalone bill we had a vote on a rule tonight and so just a little bit of procedural uh education here on this every bill that we vote on on the house floor goes to the rules committee and the rules committee does one of three things with it it declares it to have an open rule meaning kitty bar the door any amendment that you want to add to it you can do it a structured rule which means they're going to decide to narrow it down to a certain set of of subjects or certain parts of the bill that are going to get amended or a closed rule which means that no amendments of any kind are allowed only the bill moving forward as it's written gets to gets to happen well what they did is they they wrote a rule that has three bills in it one of them called the pump act it's about nursing mothers another one about education another one about family violence all right which would be normally uh some pretty bipartisan issues then they rolled the the debt ceiling 480 billion dollars almost half a trillion dollars in authorized spending between now and december and uh what this allows the democrats to do is to say we didn't vote on a on a on a debt ceiling increase but you did but no we didn't because it was part of a rule and we always follow procedures with these rules and it's called self-actuating or they deem it past so even though they didn't take a vote on it it just authorized the federal government to spend another half a trillion dollars without a single reform without a single pause on what we're doing here and um that that's tragic in addition to all that 45 of the house almost half of the house knocking on the door of 200 members of congress wrote a proxy out to say that they couldn't attend session today because of covet now that's the house rule you can vote by proxy if and only if you can't travel to washington dc because of the pandemic um i know southwest is having some hard times getting people around the country but this is not this is not part of it it's uh it's not constitutional in my opinion it's certainly not right and you have to question the legal uh the legal ability to pass a bill without a majority of people on the house floor now it's different having a a prior having a proxy vote or even a remote vote in committee the u.s constitution talks about how the u.s house has to work because i mean think about this back in the 1700s early 1800s if you lived up in boston do you know how long it took you to get there or bangor maine or new york city or down in the carolinas or in georgia if if the founding fathers didn't want people coming together in washington dc they could have said tell you what just mail them just mail your ballots in but that is not the purpose of the house of floor or the senate floor it's to have people together and voting on these things and that's that is that is the base assumption until uh until this crew showed up speaker pelosi showed up and said well we have a pandemic and now i can control it all and uh so we've had people in row boats that have that have uh phoned in their in their votes we had people on vacations doing space launches all kinds of things things that had nothing to do with the pandemic in previous votes so i'll be curious to see what kind of uh what kind of stories the media turns up if they do their job of where people were tonight uh instead of being here in washington dc and uh you know canceling things back home constituent hours or whatever it might be and coming out to washington dc to doing their constitutional duty so uh i maybe i haven't been clear yet i was a no on this uh because um first of all i don't think that we have had any real kind of conversation about what we are doing on the spending side we need to have that i've been part of a group a bipartisan group that i helped start that is uh it's a bipartisan budget group and we are talking about our spending and our in our debt and our deficits and uh we are trying to force this conversation uh with leadership frankly on both sides of the aisle uh with uh with what needs to happen uh for the future here for the for the united states for our kids and our grandkids um so anyway uh there you go there's the update from washington dc we'll be spending uh nearly another half a trillion dollars between now and the beginning of december right around in that time frame there will be another cliff uh we've got the continuing resolution which is getting uh the authorization for all the spending is going to be expiring in early december this is more fungible the treasury can do different things to extend this but that's going to probably be sometime in december as well that early into mid-december and uh here we go just uh you know pulling the rug out from under our military members and others that are trying to do their jobs by not being able to uh to help ourselves and kick the can down the road and it just it's the most frustrating part of my job so um anyway keep uh keep praying for our country uh we need it uh we absolutely need it and uh i hope uh that uh this was a little helpful to understand some of the context of uh of what's going on in the games and the cynical games you know putting it in putting this this self-actuating deem it past increase in spending into a rule that is now going to be used against us all politically for somehow being against nursing mothers and family violence which is complete garbage and uh this is this is nothing to do about uh being inconvenienced to come out here to do a vote in fact that's exactly what we should be doing this is our job and we're not doing it and shame on the house representative shame on speaker pelosi and we need to end this practice of all these proxy votes so we'll talk to you again soon

so when I started to meet the families who lost loved ones to gun violence it was devastating when you talk to a mom and a dad who lost their teenage daughter because she was at a party with friends and the stray bullet hit her and killed her and you meet her whole class not only do you immediately know that you were wrong but you know that you have to do something about it because that young woman niasia a prior yard should not have died and she should not her death should not be in vain so I believe that things are changing I think the fact that you have young people who are marching not just the kids from Florida but the fact that they work with kids all across America whose friends die every day in their neighborhoods that they made this movement intersectional and this movement powerful and they're speaking out they're walking out of classrooms they're marching on Washington emma gonzales calls BS on every lie remember Congress has ever told her you have young men standing up to Senator Marco Rubio and say will you stop taking money from the NRA and he didn't even have the courage to say yes so for me these young people are going to change the conversation because even if Congress doesn't listen to them one group of people who will are their parents and their parents live in all 50 states and so this issue is going to be about our families our communities protecting our loved ones and I think I can walk into any voter in a red state or a purple state or a blue state gun owners NRA members and say you do care about a four year olds die on a park bench in Brooklyn don't you and the humanity of each person this country should kick in and you are going to ask them to imagine that happening to their own child their own loved one and their own family and I think you can change hearts that way because the truth is we all love our kids and that is a common bond between everyone in this country and if I have enough humility to recognize that I'm wrong I hope there's many Americans around this country who could say the same

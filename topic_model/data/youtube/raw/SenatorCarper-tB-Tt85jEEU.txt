service academy coordinator senator carper hosts this event each year as a way for students their families educators and counselors to learn more about the many opportunities the u.s service academies have to offer as you may know with the exception of the u.s coast guard academy service academies require a congressional nomination for appointment in delaware students may apply for nominations from senator carper senator coons or congresswoman blunt rochester we encourage students to apply with each of the three offices to maximize their chances of receiving a nomination senator carper's nomination application can be found online at his website carper.senate.gov and opens on april 15th completed applications are due by october 15th at midnight each year to fulfill the application package you must include a completed questionnaire three letters of recommendation a copy of your high school transcripts and official copies of your sat or act scores every student who completes an application with our office will then interview with the senator service academy selection committee as the final step in the process students can then expect to hear back from our office regarding the committee's decision by the beginning of january as the senator's point person for this process i am available throughout the year for any questions you may have and my contact information can be found at the end of this presentation this evening you will hear from representatives from the u.s air force academy the u.s coast guard academy the u.s merchant marine academy the u.s military academy and the u.s naval academy but before we hear from them it is my pleasure to first introduce to you my boss and your senior senator tom carper well everybody i want to welcome you to this year's u.s service academy information night i'm united states senator tom carper delaware senior senator and this is my 20th year hosting this event it's one of my favorite nights of the year usually we'd be in person at deltek in dover but this year is a bit different as you know and what has uh remained the same though is my commitment to nominating the best and brightest young men and women delawareans all to our nation's service academies and soon you're going to hear from presenters from the service academies themselves and at the end you'll have an opportunity to submit any questions you may have and we will get back to you promise uh let me just tell you a true story i was a kid growing up my family didn't have a lot of money my dad once said to my sister when we were in middle school that he wanted he and my mom wanted us to go to college and my sister and i said i think we're in the seventh and eighth grade we said oh we want to go to college that we want to do that and then he said we also want you to figure out how to pay for it he said really he said really and i was in something called civil air patrol i'd been a boy scout it was in something called civil air patrol and uh i uh thought well silver airport was part of the air force i thought maybe i could go to the air force academy and partly my membership in the civil law patrol toward that goal and i didn't know how to apply to the air force academy i missed the cut out deadline and i was out of luck a couple of weeks later i was sitting in homeroom my high school my senior year and they announced on morning announcements anybody interested in when i'm winning a navy scholarship go see your guidance counselor and i said navy they have airplanes i'll go see my guidance counselor and i did i was the only one in my school who applied to go for a navy rotc scholarship and fortunately i won so that's my that's my story and hopefully you'll have a story that ends as as well for for you but you won't succeed unless you try and i would just urge you to give this your your best best shot i wish all of you the best of luck on your applications and the rest of the school year i leave you with with these thoughts i give a lot of commencement speeches i've sort of honed it down over the years to ten words and uh here are the ten words in case just in case i don't get to give your commencement speech maybe these words will be of some help to you going forward uh the first two words are aim high aim high the next four two words are work hard work hard the next four words are uh embrace the golden rule treat others people the way we want to be treated last two words are don't quit let me say those again aim high work hard embrace the golden rule don't quit uh you do those four things those ten words i promise you you'll be successful at whatever whatever you do good luck god bless my name is gail mader and i am an admissions liaison officer for the united states air force academy i graduated from the air force academy in 1996 and i would like to share with you the opportunities of those that wish to continue their education beyond high school at the academy there are two main things that you must understand first it's an appointment and therefore you need to one apply to the academy itself and secondly you need to receive a nomination these nominations come from congressional sources as well as a few other sources primarily um you apply to each senator of your state and the congressional representative for your district which of course for delaware we have one everyone should also apply for a vice presidential nomination even though these are very limited in number it is best to do that to have as many avenues of opportunity as possible the other is if which these are very rare cases um medal of honor recipients um their children can receive a nomination and also there are presidential nominations so if you have a parent that served eight years of active duty or an equivalent amount of point system within the reserves you can also apply for a presidential nomination as well another one actually that we need to mention is that if your high school jrotc is an honorary jrotc they also can offer nominations so when you're looking at applying to an academy it's um different than most colleges not better not worse just simply different the academies are looking for a whole person concept the reason being not only will once you graduate you'll have a commission in the united states air force or now even the united states united states space force um it's also to prepare you because not everyone is going to serve 20 years but you will if you choose be a leader in whatever industry um or life path you take so there are a couple of things to consider there's four main pillars there's academics athletics leadership and this one's always a little bit hard for me to find just the right word for um i would say moral but it's with the understanding that the academies have an honor code and therefore they are seeking people of integrity the air force core values are integrity first service before self and excellence in all we do and therefore when seeking candidates [Music] to become our the future leaders of the air force in our nation that's what one aspect that we're looking for so leadership what does that look like um really quite honestly it looks like you doing the best that you can do and what you're passionate about if you're in jrotc um hopefully you have some leadership positions um if you're on an athletic team hopefully you're pursuing captains slots i myself was a band member so i was a section leader maybe your journey isn't right in high school or you have some unique life challenges or presentations that you need to work with so maybe you're working a lot of hours to help support your family so it's if you're working at a job to help support the family or yourself that you're doing the best you can at that so i always encourage candidates there is no um right or wrong here okay because it's about you being the best version of you find something you love and be the best you can be at it and help others along the way um academically quite frankly the academies are challenging so you need to be as prepared as possible that means taking those challenging those college prep and those ap classes that being said you don't want a solid c in all of them to drop your gpa so be mindful challenge yourself but at the same time do your best of course part of academics but yet seen separately is the sat and act the best thing the best advice that has been around the block for decades for the academies is test early and often we recommend you take both sat and act and take them frequently because thankfully the academy is super scores what that means is if you go let's say you take two tests and on the second test you go up in one area and down in the other one in uh uh you know in comparison to your first one the academies are going to take the best from each so you can't go wrong i myself took the act five times i've worked with people that took it six times do your best right it all goes back to that another aspect of course is physical fitness so the academies have a candidate fitness assessment and it is designed to exhaust you you start with a basketball throw you have pull-ups or a flexed arm hang you continue with push-ups sit-ups and a shuttle run and then lastly after all that you run a mile so it's a test of endurance and fortitude and overall physical fitness but yet again it's simply a piece of the pie if you max it that's wonderful but that's not a whole person concept right so we're looking at being the best in everything we can with understanding and accepting where we are and of course uh there is the department of defense medical examination um that being said you know there are basically simple i don't wanna no that's not worded properly there are simply basic qualifications that are needed to be in the service um and you know that's outside the purview of an admissions liaison officer such as myself we don't handle that but you um do have to go through that process as well like just like you would if you were to enlist or go through another commissioning source um i'm trying to think here let's see i've covered oh high school curriculum let's talk about that so you want to be looking at four years of math four years of science with a lab four years of english three years of history or social studies and at least two years of a modern foreign language remember that approximately 30 percent of every class it's not their first application so what does that mean that means if you don't get in the first time if you really want it try again generally you look to start your application july 1st it is a rolling deadline so you have four months from the time you start to the time you finish so when you go online to academyadmissions.com and you fill out that pre-candidate questionnaire i recommend you start getting the ball rolling um as all my friends that are in scouting say how do you eating how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time so you look at that big picture and you plan ahead and you do your best you enjoy the journey and know that no matter what whether you get into the academy or not the intention is to be the best version of yourself and no matter what life throws at you if you're open to it you will grow thank you so much for your time good evening everybody my name is lee dawkins i'm the state of delaware coordinator of admissions partners for the u.s coast guard academy in new london connecticut so i'm here tonight to talk to you a little bit about the u.s coast guard academy as a college option for some of you and briefly touch on the coast guard for those of you who might be interested in direct enlistment into the coast guard so let's take a look at a couple of programs that we have here to talk about tonight our main point of contact for you if you are interested uh as in the academy is uscga.edu and that'll be your point of contact for getting some information all right so immediately so let's talk about what you think the coast guard is and let you know that there is a series of missions at the coast guard that allows you to do the job of protecting and serving every day many of you probably familiar with our maritime safety the search and rescue whether it's on a ship or a small boat out of a small boat station like in ocean city maryland or maybe flying or jumping out of a helicopter as a marine swimmer there's also aids navigation boating safeties and water waste management there's also marine maritime security the us coast guard is a law enforcement agency we also operate defense operations drug interdictions and migrant interdiction especially down in the caribbean there's also if you've seen our ice our icebreakers so we have small icebreakers that go into the great lakes and up the hudson river also a very large icebreaker that's in the arctic and antarctic but maybe you're more interested in environmental protection that type of thing marine sciences and environmental responses on the screen there's a big picture of the big fire that was down in the gulf of mexico years ago but there was also if you read recently in the news about an oil spill right here off the in the delaware bay that the u.s coast guard was handling also being part of national defense again the u.s coast guard is not a part of the department of defense but we're depart part of the department of homeland security so that means that we take care of port security and anti-terrorism so great careers uh that will be around for a long time if your interest in those types of things so it is a the only military service that is a law enforcement and regulatory powers enacted by congress so we do all the arrests so that's be a co if you're interested in law enforcement that's a great small service to be a part of the united states coast guard is only about 35 000 active duty members and it gives you a heritage of lifesavers so if you're a guardian that wants to go out and save lives then maybe we are the right fit for you being a part of the homeland security is a career that can lead you to the fbi secret service nsa in the private sector in law enforcement and into the merchant marine the school is small and so is the service so where is the u.s coast guard academy not as famous as maybe as west point or our cousins over in annapolis of the u.s coast guard academy is located in new london connecticut easy to get there from delaware just go up route 1 do you hit i-95 turn north and travel up to you see the sign that says u.s u.s coast guard academy in new london it's about a five-hour trip from dover to give you somehow some a bit of reference on the distance there is also an amtrak station right in downtown new london so it's an easy train ride from wilmington on up to the us coast guard academy so what about the size of the school we are a smaller school there is only about 1100 cadets at the academy we try to represent all 50 states and we also do training for coast guard officers from around the globe so at any one time there are 10 to 20 different nations represented so you have an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people from all across the world while at the coast guard academy we also are upping our minority and female population so we urge anyone that falls into those categories to to think about us and apply you have a home at the u.s coast guard academy so our average gpa for a high school graduate if you're thinking of the academy is about 3.75 in the mid 600s for the math sats our student population was approximately 80 percent high school varsity athletes that also means 20 were not so don't think that eliminates you we are a stem school so engineering math degrees and sciences are important to us so that would be part of your high school curriculum that you should be looking at right now especially if you're just a sophomore starting out so this is what a cadet kind of looks like how about the academy what do we offer in the terms of an education well we are the top undergraduate experience in the northeast according to u.s news and world report our majors are listed over on the right side of the screen up here with our newest one cyber systems now cyber problems as you know in the news today is a big problem and several years ago we started a cyber major uh to help combat that down the road we are also one of the top 15 engineering schools in the country so how about mom and dad what about tuition well like the other military academies we are tuition free you happen to owe us five years of military ex duty at the end uh but the nice thing is on day one when you arrive you get on the payroll with about a thousand dollar a month uh paycheck coming in nice thing also for mom and dad once graduation comes you have a hundred percent job placement if you graduate from the us coast guard academy uh the other thing that is very nice is the graduates of the academy we have a high retention rate and so that because of high retention rate over 85 percent of our graduates go on to earn a master's degree which is paid for by the us coast guard so that's a very nice uh bonus to be able to go to school get your masters and while you're in that program that's your only job so maybe your parents can tell you about having to juggle a full-time job and raising kids and trying to get their master's degree is pretty tough if you're in this program you're able to go to school and that is your only job at that point so while you're at the academy we're assault a small student body that means there is a small ratio of students to teachers once you get into those upper programs out of your mass freshman courses you have about an eight to one student ratio to your faculty and as a bonus when graduating from the u.s coast guard academy you graduate with a 100 ton mariners license so if you had dreams of operating big ships or being a captain of a boat of a ship in the maritime service you have a really good start here and right there on that list again i want to emphasize is being cyber that's one of the big things maybe you're also an athlete what happens what will happen to you here at the academy well we still have um athletics for you to choose from health and physical development are core requirements for the academy so we want you to encourage you to play in sports so we have 25 inter interscholastic sports uh two of them are division one the rest are division three but we also have club and intramural sports and if you are an athlete and you want to be considered and recruited by our coaching staff as part of your admissions packet go to our website which is the coast guard academy dot edu and then go to the athletics page and on the athletics page there is a recruit me button which you can then connect directly with the coach and be uh so that you can send in sports tapes they can come out and see you at local sporting events that type of thing and for some reason the kids kind of think that's important to have an adidas shoe contract and apparel contact contract so i can tell you the new uniform swag is pretty nice but like i also said uh we also have music programs so it's not all about athletics so if you're a vocalist or a band member we do want to hear from you also the arts are important so you can reach out with your audition tapes again as part of your packet basic administration admissions there's our website uscga.edu is where you can start and get your bears in account and get more information and i would urge you to do that even if you want the slightest interest register and you'll start getting some information we have a modified rolling program on admissions you do have to be a us citizen no dependents in under 25 23 years of age we were looking for heavy math english and science and no nomination is required so if the only academy that you're going to apply to would be the us coast guard academy you would not need a congressional nomination from our congresswoman or one of our two u.s senators it's not required at the academy here are your careers you can go to see land and air you can uh and if you want to be a direct enlistment so let's just say that uh being a high level student maybe isn't your where you stand but you do want to serve in the military or maybe you are just a great leader and know that you can eventually be an officer well we'd enjoyed you and encourage you to join directly so you can go to gocoastguard.com and then you can get information from there about direct enlistment because there are 25 ways to become an officer from the enlisted program if you are a leader you will eventually become an officer you want or you can have just a fun job in the coast guard by going to there so lots of opportunities uh and here's the last thing i'd like to cover here tonight is our if you are a junior we have an aim program which uh this is our summer program for this summer you need to apply now to come up for a week this summer so if you are are a junior right now i'd urge you to apply to that program as soon as possible again go to uscga.edu all the information is there lots of youtube videos you can also again sign up for what we call a bears den account and that'll start feeding you some information even if you're only slightly interested what we want you to do is make sure that you're a good fit for us and that the school is a good fit for you you have to make sure that where you go to college is what you really want to do so i want to thank you for your time and again reach out to us as soon as you can greetings everyone my name is lieutenant commander joe becker i'm the northeast region's admissions officer united states merchant marine academy i'm here today to talk to you about our academy who we are what we do and our requirements for admission picture here is our academy this is taking on a beautiful spring day you notice our academy is relatively small we're the smallest of all the service academies what does this mean for you as an applicant it means you have small class sizes our average class size is 13 students to every one professor uh with the easy access to facilities and accommodations parents what does this mean for you we know where your son and daughter is at all times if you ever need to get a hold of them we know exactly where they are during the day what do merchant mariners do i receive this question all the time and the best way to describe the merchant marine is don't think of it so much as a career excuse me don't think of it so much as a branch of the military but think of it more as a career field so there's so many great career fields students can go into these days law enforcement food service entertainment there's so many great ones out there the merchant marine the maritime industry is one of those great career fields the merchant consists of both properly owned and government-owned u.s flag vessels we provide waterborne transportation for cargoes and persons moving both domestically and internationally and in times of war and national emergency the merchant marine serves as the fourth arm of defense uh case in point with the the with the recent covert pandemic that has affected us all the hospital ships that were sent to new york city and california were crewed by merchant mariners while the vessels were owned by the united states navy they were crewed by civilian merchant mariners so that's just an example of some of some of the great services that we provide what do graduates earn the the us merchant academy is very unique in the sense that our graduates gradu graduate with what we call the triple crown the triple crown consists of the bachelor of science degree a commission as an officer in the navy reserve and i will put i'll put an asterisk next to that and i'll tell you why in a second as well as a coast guard license as a merchant marine officer as either a third mate or third assistant engineer again the triple crown we're the only academy that offers you this option as detailed i explained that the al of our graduates commission has ensigns in the navy reserve at minimum everyone does have a service obligation many of our graduates will go to the navy reserve however graduates have the option to join any branch of the military they so choose whether it be on active duty or reserve and i'll go into further detail in the next slide as detailed all of our graduates encourage service obligation and following graduation what's unique about our academy is the the options you have for satisfying this obligation the majority of our of our graduates will take the first uh option here they will work in the maritime industry for five years they will maintain their uh coast guard license for six years and they will serve in the navy reserve for eight years this this time is all served concurrently so within eight years of graduation the student would have satisfied their service obligation roughly 70 of our graduates will take this option they will serve the maritime industry for five years again maintain their license for six years serving in the navy reserve for eight years thirty percent of our graduates will go on to serve active duty military five years service period they can go to any branch of the military they so choose the below chart details the various services as well as the number of graduates that went into that respective service dating back to class 2016. as you can tell roughly 30 of our graduates will go active duty the remaining 70 will go in navy reserve with the option of pursuing their deck or engine license academic majors our academy offers five academic majors in total we offer two within the department of marine transportation and three within the department of marine engineering understand that we are a very stem-focused school we do not offer programs in liberal arts or sciences uh in psychology in any of the medical fields so if you're looking to be a dentist a sports psychologist or going into a business other than the merchant marine or maritime shipping uh this may not be a great fit for you again we're very stem focused and this is reflected in our admissions criteria which i'll touch on in the next few slides our academy offers a very unique program called senior senior is by far the greatest paid internship and study abroad program there is all of our students will go out to see between their sophomore and junior years typically you know and a four-month sailing and then an eight-month sailing in their junior year students will uh on average visit between 15 and 20 countries they'll be paid about a thousand dollars a month while they're at sea by their respective uh ship's employer the pictures you see here these are not actors these are not stock photos these were photos that were submitted by our graduates uh following and following their respective seniors so just you take a moment just look at look at these photos again this is the greatest paid internship and study abroad program there is if you can find one better uh please let me know uh right here this is a typical day at the academy if you like structure if you like routine this is gonna be a great fit for you all of our students wake up in the morning typically between zero five and zero six hundred they'll go through the day's activities uh culminating uh at twenty two hundred ten o'clock at night when they go to sleep they'll wake up the next day and do it all again so again if you like structure if you like routine this would be a great fit for you uh our athletics program is pretty robust we are a division three athletics program so if you have any interest whatsoever in playing sports in the collegiate level i encourage you to check us out uh because we are division three our coaches uh tended not to make cuts as long as you're willing to participate you put the time in and uh put a good effort forward to find a place for you on the team the teams listed here are our division three uh programs again we're very robust programs we're very competitive uh i encourage you to check out our website check out our teams as this is something we do consider for admissions purposes uh we also feature a very robust waterfront program waterfront features everything from rowing and dinghy sailing to offshore and capital vessels our crew teams and sailing teams are considered division one athletics programs and they fall under the waterfront program waterfront program is open to all students regardless of uh grade or a major it's a it's an excellent excellent extracurricular activity and we encourage students to participate at least at some point during their time at king's point our next few slides i'm going to talk about the admissions process uh what we're looking for in terms of admissions and how to be competitive and how to ensure that your your file is a successful application when we evaluate student we look at four major areas uh act to include academics which also includes extracurricular activities physical fitness via the candidate fitness assessment we look at your medical suitability via the dahmer medical examination as well as your ability to secure a nomination from your member of congress of these four areas the physical fitness test the medical and denomination are strictly pass fail meaning for the physical fitness test you need only to pass the test we do not award additional points based on performance uh we do not post the minimum results or the minimum score necessary we encourage you to try your best with that said is if you if you do take a practice test and you reach out to your admissions officer myself or our admissions team uh we will give you advice of how to improve your score where you need improvement for the diver medical this this medical examination is required for admission all these services require a uh what's unique about the dahmer examination is that you can take this for any academy and the results will be made available to us so if you're applying to other academies which we encourage you to do so those results will be made available to us likewise the candidate fitness assessment if you take the cfa for another another academy with the exception of coast guard the you can send those results to us and we will accept them for a score understand the medical examination can only be completed after you start your application typically.morbid allows candidates to start testing in late august and early september so we encourage students to apply early and to take the the diameter of examination when they're able to do so the cfa the candidate fitness assessment uh can be conducted by any physical education teacher strength and conditioning coach it can also be conducted by any uh former or current military officer or non-commissioned officer the testing you can start taking the physical with some sort of the cfa uh during june of your uh junior year or going into your senior year so we encourage you take the cfa and then medical over the summer as soon as you can don't wait for the fall and winter months um finally you're all required to secure a nomination from your member of congress uh being issued from delaware you can secure from either two senators or your u.s representative i will tell you right now from uh state of delaware app nominations are competitive again you only need one nomination and understand the rules for our academy differ from the other academies you need only secured nomination there's no primary or secondary selection we can and have in the past uh selected multiple candidates from the state of delaware uh so it's a competitive state but you also have some very great great great candidates coming out of your state so if you you know if don't be don't be concerned if you only receive one nomination you only need one nomination to be considered uh below is an sat act admissions uh testing chart uh while we don't have a minimum testing score this is our middle 50 range based on previous year statistics uh this is what we're looking for if you're applying uh this past year due to covid we we waived the sat act requirement however we do anticipate that it will be the requirement for the class of 2026. so we encourage all students to uh test the early test often we do super score the exam we'll give you the highest scores available likewise you can take the sat and act we will take the highest math and english scores and consolidate them into a single score to try to give it the best score possible for the sat we do not require the essay we only look at the reading score the reading score is a two-digit score that is found in your sat score sheet uh we encourage students again test multiple times if you'd like to forego the essay within the sat you're certainly free to do so however understand that that test made it you know main factor for other academies or other schools other opportunities that you're applying for as discussed academics is one of the foundations of our evaluation process it is the only category where students are actually ranked accordingly against each other within our academic criteria 75 of your evaluation is academics this includes your transcript uh your high school class ranking in your sat scores as previously mentioned only 25 includes your leadership and extracurricular activities so while we want students who are well motivated that are involved in extra extra curricular activities athletics band etc we place a great emphasis on our academics uh more so than the activities so please understand that within academics or we we take a very hard look at your transcript all students coming in at very at minimum should have taken chemistry physics and pre-calculus uh free calculus is okay we prefer to see calculus but pre-calc we can work with you on that ideally you should have a b average or better in these courses we want to see you take a take the hard courses challenge yourself take the ap courses the honors level courses any courses that give you college credit uh are very desirable so especially going to your senior year if you can take chemistry or physics or calculus do so if you're taking a second time that's wonderful we love to see students take the courses multiple times especially on the ap and honors levels for high school class ranking this only accounts for about 10 of your evaluation in the event your school does not rank uh we do accept a decile or uh estimation if the event your school cannot provide us that that figure we revert to the sat to determine your high school class rank okay application process understand the process there's a lot of moving parts we understand it's there's multiple items you do need to secure our application opens up may 1st of your junior year so may 1st 2021 our application window opens we encourage you to play as soon as you can the sooner you apply the sooner you're able to upload documents schedule appointments and do all the items that are necessary for uh completion of the application we do require a copy of your high school transcript uh official test scores from the sat and or act a school profile an activities record a biographical essay the essay is only 500 words the only thing we're looking for is just tell us why you want to come to the academy there's a prompt included with the application uh again 500 words we don't need your life story but please be concise clear and why you want to attend the academy and also state that you understand the service obligation following graduation we do require school official evaluations from a math teacher a science teacher and an english teacher these can be teachers that have taught you in the past doesn't actually have to be your senior year teacher but someone that can give you an honest assessment of how how you perform within their class deadline for admission is february 1st this is a hard and fast deadline this comes up every year where students try to ask for extensions and unfortunately we operate a nationwide uh campaign here for admission we cannot grow grinch extensions for under no circumstances so please take advantage of the time frame we're offering you may first the application window opens and the sooner you start the sooner you'll be able to finish and we encourage students like do not hoard documents don't wait for a test score don't wait for a nomination as soon as you have a document upload it okay because everything can be submitted concurrently you're not dependent on medical examinations or nominations to submit your items uh following slide here these are just admission strategies that we offer we tell all students coming in here uh first two items here i can't stress this enough uh the applicant not the parent should be driving this process all right uh ultimately if you're if you're successful if you're accepted for admission you're gonna be one going to the course of study you're gonna be the one that's here raising your hand your right hand taking the oath of office not your parents so typically students who are successful are the ones that are assertive that are involved in the process uh that complete their items early and um accurately all right we encourage you to play all available nomination sources early within the state of delaware and nationwide every office will typically put out their information in april may time frame go on each respective congressional members website plenty of information there about how to apply for the nomination what they're looking for and what their timetable is understand every office is a little bit different about what they're looking for and what their timetable is but they do have similarities in terms of what their you know items they're looking for and typically deadlines can be october november time frame it may vary between offices but that's what we see nationwide typically october november is when your items should be submitted to a congressional office again complete the application earlier we can't stress that enough the sooner you start the sooner you're finished the more time we have to provide feedback to you and to provide ways that you can improve your application take the sat and or act early and often at minimum you should take each test once even if it's a practice exam that's okay just to get an idea of which one you're better at and proceed from there again we do super score we'll give you the best possible score we can and we don't judge on how many times you've taken the test i've literally seen students take the test more than five times okay so that is a viable viable strategy for admission uh take chemistry physics and calculus i can't stress that enough we're very stem-focused school has reflected on our curriculum chemistry physics and calculus are valued if you can score at least a b average or better a is terrific if you have an a in all those courses wonderful uh we also encourage you to take those on the honors and ap and uh collegiate level if possible um practice for the cfa i can't stress this enough the cfa you can start taking the effective june 1st and onward can be conducted by any strength and conditioning coast a physical education coach any colonel former military officer or non-commissioned officer can complete this for you as well i encourage you over the summer this way you're you're not running up against your school schedule the weather conditions are favorable and then if you need time to improve uh you do have time to work with i can't tell you how many students wait till the last minute take the test are not successful and then try to ask for an extension and it just doesn't work out for them complete the diamond physical early again this is a medical examination you cannot complete this medical examination until after you apply once you apply your information will be forwarded to doddmer they'll provide you follow-on information about how to schedule the examination dahmer contracts with doctors in your local area uh via your zip code so you're going to their website you're punching your zip code they will tell you who the local nearest local provider is and it's an easy day don't schedule the examination again until you receive notification from dadmer but i can't stress that enough we've had students in the past that have taken the exam on their own without scheduling it and it creates all kinds of headaches so please don't do not schedule the examination until after you receive notification uh from dahmer that you're eligible to do so we encourage you to visit kings point uh pre-covert we would host uh daily and overnight visits uh please consult with our office about our availability and when we can we can accept you for a visit and lastly explore all your options i can't just i can't tell you this enough there's so many great options out there and opportunities if you're looking to join the military i encourage you check out all the academies check out rotc uh there's multiple ways to the top of the mountain don't think that the merchant academy is the end-all be-all um you know case in point myself i did not go to school here i attended rotc at suny maritime so i received my commission my license and i tell students hey there's multiple ways to top of the mountain explore of your options and ultimately decide what's right for you um again we can't stress this enough the worst thing that can happen is a student gets here um the program they're looking for it doesn't match up with what we're teaching them and they end up dropping out and nobody wins if that happens so explore your options do what's right for you i you know the phrase i used to test drive them all so if you're if you can if you can't visit the academy at least jump on their on their admissions zoom calls check out their website ask questions and just again figure out what's best for you lastly any questions feel free to contact our admissions office our website is detailed here the email list there is the admissions

we're here to help you we'd like to see you be successful but at the end of the day it comes down to your willingness to apply the academy and put the work in that's necessary to be successful i wish you all the best and take care good evening my name is stephen murphy and i'm a volunteer with the united states military academy at west point it's my responsibility as a delaware congressional coordinator and the delaware valley regional coordinator to be a mentor for young people interested in applying to west point in front of you you'll see the west point admissions email address admissions.edu at westpoint.edu you'll see my personal email address and the telephone number that you can reach out to me now as i started i'm a mentor to help you we have a team of people here in the state of delaware that will assist you with the application process now it's very important that you understand applying to west point applying to any of the service academies is very different than applying to any civilian school there are more parts it's more evolved and the timing is different so we are here to assist you now tonight's agenda i'm going to talk about west point itself the west point experience and then we're going to talk about the application process and what's involved with that now west point is one of the united states greatest resources and treasures at west point there's a wonderful poster in the history department that says much of the history we teach was made by the people we taught think about that for a minute much of the american history that was made was made by graduates of west point west point prides itself on being the countries and maybe the world's leading institution for teaching leadership now some of the great examples of west point graduates on the top line in front of you is gerald macarthur general eisenhower and general davis below some current character uh individuals are mike szyszewski the coach successful coach at duke university general nadja west who is the first woman army surgeon general and alice gorski who's the current ceo of johnson johnson and as you know it's a pandemic johnson johnson is now one of america's leaders in providing the vaccine west point prides itself on building building leadership for the country that is not only of a military aspect but can serve the country in many different categories now the important thing to understand about the mission of west point is to educate train and inspire the core cadets the students that comprise the academy the most important thing that you have to understand about attending west point is that at the end of the day when you graduate you'll be a commissioned officer in the active duty army you go into the army and you serve for at least five years and then you go on decide what you want to do with your professional career but everyone who graduates goes into the army so that is a big requirement now west point itself let me blow up the screen a little bit for you this what you have to understand the military academy west point is considered one of the top institutions academically not only united states but in the world when you look at how its rating rated by independent agencies this is an institution that competes with harvard yale princeton mit is it the format the premise is an academic institution of the highest ranking it's world-class so you have to be able to compete to get in with eventually understanding that's what will be expected of you now at west point let me adjust this a little bit for you it's not just uh military science right it's oh let me fix i apologize let's fix it here we go there are 36 different majors and 15 different minders it's a pretty robust stem and liberal arts program there's lots of ways for you to find your specialty at west point and compete for a degree that will be satisfying now here's one of the key things you want to keep in mind as you compete for a service academy all cadets receive a fully funded education that leads to a bachelor of science and when i say fully funded all your tuition all your room and board health care and your monthly salary is provided you don't take out loans to go to west point your parents don't have to borrow money to go to west point and the total value of this world-class academic opportunity this bachelor of science degree is valued in excess of 300 000 now we'll talk about the application process itself there are three different buckets that you have to think about and this is the area where the field force people like myself will make themselves available to help you walk through it and understand and when i say say three buckets is the candidate application applying and completing the application on time and to a level that makes you competitive there is the medical application on qualification and then of course there's a nomination process now the candidate application applying to west point you must go online everything is done online and what west point is going to review first and foremost is your academics 60 of the application formula is based on your apple your academics your sats or acts essays and recommendations from your high school teachers 30 of the application is on leadership you want to demonstrate that you have a you're a leader of your potential leader that you've participated in programs like boys and girls state an eagle scout you're active in athletics possibly the captain of a sports team the other bucket is you need to conduct you need to complete a candidate fitness assessment it's a pt test a basketball throw pull-ups shuttle run sit-ups push-ups and a mile run and it's not a pass-fail exam it's a graded exam each event you're graded and then there's a cumulative grade you have to do very well in that and then finally either myself or other volunteers in the area will interview you and provide a rating for you on your competitiveness based on what west point expects next is the medical qualifications and this is very important that you understand that medically is a very time consuming evaluation the physical takes one and a half days it's done by the donmer physical which is the department of defense medical evaluation report or board now to get put into perspective there's west point which is a subset of the us army there is a us army which is a subset of the department of defense this is an independent agency under the department of defense and because of privacy issues and you you have to work with them you have to focus on their requirements and we're here to help you with that but this is usually the most time consuming thing and what we want to do is get you qualified as soon as we can so you're eligible for this physical now this physical is paid for by the army and is done by contract services solicited by doddler so word to the wise we want to get to this point as quick as we can because if there is an issue and we need a medical waiver we need as much time as we can to get it it's a very bureaucratic agency to be honest and last you need a nomination now as delaware residents this is probably the best place in the country to apply a large part of it goes to the nature of our congressional delegations senator carper senator coons representative blunt rochester these are outstanding individuals who for years have worked just to help as many young people as they can but you have to understand their nomination processes are standalone senator carper's is different than representative rochester's and different from senator coons you need to start that application work with their different offices directly and treat it just as if you were applying to a college and those are outside of the west point application it's a component but it's not a piece of the application now finally once again my contact information we're here to mentor you we are here to help you and this is not an easy challenge our job will be to give you direct information we will see your file we'll support you in any way we can but it has to be a two-way street when it comes to communications we'll be reaching out to you and you will be reaching out to us we hope and that will work together with us over this very long 18 month process i want to thank you for joining us tonight and thank senator carper's office again for the support and effort to put this together in some very difficult challenging times thank you i look forward to talking to you in the future good evening and welcome to academy night on behalf of the naval academy my name is major brad boyd i am the delaware area coordinator for the naval academy information program also known as the blue and gold program and i'd like to briefly familiarize you with the naval academy and the time that i have so without further ado here's my contact information i know the administrators will provide this at the end of all the presentations but feel free to copy this down if you have an opportunity now so the naval academy we affectionately refer to as the yard it's a great combination of a military base in a college campus they have all the amenities and services that you would expect probably a little more than that it's located in annapolis maryland about halfway between baltimore and washington dc we have world-class facilities not only for our division one athletes but for uh club sports and intramural sports as well the burghead of midshipmen is what we refer to as the uh student body if you will a midshipman is a student at the naval academy uh roughly about 4 500 students there and you see the breakdown of male and female midshipmen uh all the midshipmen are represented in all 50 states our territories and foreign countries uh we have many diverse and cultural backgrounds and even sailors and marines come from the fleet to attend the naval academy and amongst them are many leaders scholars and varsity athletes so uh the naval academy is a stem school we're heavy on engineering math and science we only have 25 majors to offer we also address humanities and social sciences and available minors but as you can see in the left column and center column pretty heavy on the science thing and um that's that's the onus that you come with strengths and those particularly when you demonstrate that um in your transcripts your high school transcripts so uh we have small class sizes in the classrooms we think that's better for learning student to faculty ratio is eight to one and in addition we have a one to one civil uh to military faculty ratio so we have fleet marine officers and navy officers that are uh also instructing in uh or on campus so we have uh varsity sports we have club sports and we have intramural sports there is a requirement for each midshipmen to enter engage in one of those and you can see the list of uh the the typical sports uh men and women sports and then co-ed sports that we offer and believe it or not uh you get pay and benefits while you attend the naval academy because you're essentially uh almost on active duty they receive a full scholarship if you earn an appointment to attend the naval academy which includes tuition uh your room and board and medical and dental coverage uh each midshipman receives a stipend or a pay each month however as a pleb or a freshman uh you have a lot of things to pay for you get your whole allotment of uniforms in the first couple of weeks you buy a computer with that money and so uh you only may see as a freshman a plebe about a hundred or so dollars every month and as you uh uh get more senior uh a first-class man or a first eat may see about 600 a month in a pay stipend so the goal at the naval academy obviously is to graduate there is a service obligation at the end and everyone graduates with at least a bachelor of science degree you earn a commission as an officer in the navy an ensign or a second lieutenant in the united states marine corps you have a minimum five-year service commitment and some of the opportunities i mean there are many but as depicted on the slide here you can see uh at the lower right uh part of the slide you see the submarine service and then above that is naval aviation and in the center of the screen is marine corps aviation and then the backbone of the navy is the surface warfare officer pipeline and that's depicted with the uh the destroyer there um what's not listed here is marine corps ground and that is the backbone of the marine corps so here are the service assignments for last may we graduated uh almost 1025 uh second tenants and ensigns and you can see uh surface warfare took up almost a quarter of the class uh both conventional and new and nuclear and i say surface warfare a surface warfare officer is a swo or swo the submarine service also took a fair amount of the graduating class um we graduate 30 seals 25 to 35 navy seals every year and explosive ordnance disposal is listed and you'll see also naval aviation marine corps aviation um and marine corps ground at the bottom and then the restricted line is predominantly navy side of uh specialties in crypto um intelligence oceanography and the like at the bottom you see a marine corps cyber intelligence is also a supported field so you have to have a basic uh there is a basic eligibility to attend the naval academy uh somewhere between ages 17 and 23 you must not have passed your 23rd birthday by the time you get to plebed summer must be a citizen you must have no obligations outside of yourself and you must be a good moral character which means you can't have a uh a police record essentially so uh the naval academy website is where i go to find all the information i need it's updated frequently and it's uh i think it's an exceptional resource for those uh thinking of applying and those in the application process it's at usna.edu slash admissions there are other sources also uh on social media which i'll touch upon in a bit but uh basically let's talk about the uh information required in the application you will be expected to provide a personal statement usually in the form of answering two questions and two essays you have to do a fitness assessment which i'll touch upon shortly and then you have to go to your guidance office and uh seek out an activities record and your academic information your transcripts and then you would go to uh your favorite math and english teacher for a recommendation on your performance uh in a class that they had you for and then of course uh hopefully in your junior year you're uh entertaining s.a.t and act prep courses and actually full on act and sat class tests so i mentioned the physical qualification required it's called the candidate fitness assessment all the service academies have it um i think there's some variances as i understand but it's six events in roughly an hour ending with a one mile run and that is administered by either a blue and gold officer a commissioned officer from one of your uh or a junior rotc unit uh a coach or a physical ed teacher from the state of delaware and then there's a medical qualification that's uh we call it dodd-merb but it's an organization within the military that evaluates uh candidates for service academies and rotc programs uh usually you're notified about 50 into your application so that we know you're serious uh and then you would uh start you know filling out your health history and uh you just have to meet requirements and there are actually some things that would make you not eligible to attend the academies or rotc um and that's what this is for obviously so nominations nominations are a separate a separate pipeline from the application um while you're applying to the academies you actually have to seek out a nomination from one of your two state senators in the state of delaware or our congresswoman lisa blunt rochester um there are other nomination sources like the vice president you can also apply uh to her for five spots she has five spots per year and uh you have to adhere to a domicile requirement if you go to school in the state of delaware but don't live there then you would have to apply to either maryland or new jersey or pennsylvania but if you live in the state of delaware then then you're good with uh with with my team of blue and gold officers to oversee you so here's a little bit of a busy slide it's a candidate cycle and it starts with the uh january of your junior year so second semester of your junior year and hopefully you've already started uh working left to right you've already taken your act and sat scores or tests but hopefully working on them and fully engaged in them uh also in january the summer seminar application opens for rising seniors the preliminary application opens about the first of may at the naval academy and then you'd be notified by the naval academy if you're an official candidate and you can start working on it we recommend all candidates that they do their best to complete as much of the application before the end of the summer maybe as you're starting you can tie up loose ends as you're starting the your senior year uh but it really is in your best interest as you see where september is marked the admission board meets every thursday and reviews all the completed applications at that time so um it's in your best interest to complete the application uh briskly and quickly um and and move on from there uh so the deadline for the application for next year for the class of 2026 is december 31 or excuse me january 31st as far as we know uh the deadline to open a new application is december 31st but really it's a moot point if you get the application open in may really it's it's in your best interest to uh complete it quickly um and then the admissions places a uh sort of a restriction on themselves to try to notify all candidates by april 15th of the following year or or this this uh candidate cycle uh to let everybody know who's appointed who isn't you can go on with your plan b if you're so interested maybe you go to college for a year reapply uh the disguise the limit and then if you are appointed plebe summer would uh begin at the end of your junior uh your end of june after you've graduated and maybe early june or late may so the admissions process as i described you so you fill out a preliminary application the naval academy uses the basic information that you provide to assess your competitiveness as a candidate then you become an official candidate hopefully not everybody does then the admissions board will review your completed application you'll complete your candidate fitness assessment and you'll go do the dodd-merb exam if there's any questions about any medical things the medical office at the naval academy uh engages you and hopes to complete that application without any problems then you have payment nominations separately that usually happens late december maybe the first week in january you learn that you've earned a nomination and that means now you're eligible to come to compete for an appointment to the naval academy in the state of delaware and you're competing against other students and then if you're tremendously fortunate and offers a offer of appointment is uh is provided so here's some advice for admissions uh you need to be strong in math and science like i said it's a stem school chemistry and physics with the lab and uh background in algebra uh trig geometry pre-clock and calc uh ap and honors and ib courses are highly encouraged that's just uh what is competitive and there's no minimum gpa requirement but you strive to be in the top 20 of your class and then at the bottom there we'd like to see demonstrated leadership potential and i'd like to see that you're active in athletics and non-athletic activities and that includes community service and volunteer work so the top right five reasons to attend the naval academy it's a full ride you have guaranteed employment upon graduation it's in a really great location and it's not far from delaware mind you it's about an hour and 45 minutes away excellent leadership and character development and an 89 graduation rate here are uh some social media links on facebook twitter and instagram our website usna.edu admissions is up there as i mentioned before and there's additional information for athletes at navysports.com that is all i have i appreciate your time tonight and thank you for coming and also thank you for the senator and your staff for putting this together by far it's uh one of our most popular events and uh look forward to speaking with all you candidates in the near future have a good night that concludes the presentations this evening please feel free to reach out to any of the contacts listed here with your questions thanks again for

SYKES, YOU SAID IT ALL. THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU. >>>>> PRESIDENT BIDEN IS  RESPONDING TO NEW PRESSURE FROM  WITHIN HIS PARTY TO PUNISH SAUB  FOR CUTTING OIL PRODUCTION AND  SIDING WITH RUSSIA. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE  PRESIDENT IS PROMISING THE  U.S./SAUDI RELATIONSHIP WILL NOT BE THE SAME. >> WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE  GETS BACK, THERE'S GOING TO BE  CONSEQUENCES FOR WHAT THEY HAVE  DONE WITH RUSSIA. >> WTT KIND OF CONSEQUENCES? MENENDEZ SAYS SUSPEND ALL ARMS  SALES. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD  CONSIDER? >> I WILL NOT GET INTO WHAT I  WILL CONSIDER AND WHAT IAVAVE IN MIND, BUT THERE WILL BE  CONSEQUENCES.  >> THAT WAS JAKE TAPPER IN A CNN INTERVIEW. SENATOR, HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT? WE ARE TOLD THAT HE WILL HAVE  SOME TALKS WITH SENATORS BUT  WON'T STLE DOWN AND WORK ON  THIS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTIONS  EN CONGRESS IS BACK. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THE  PRESIDENT YET. I EXPECT TO SPEAK WITH MEMBERS  OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND  EVENTUALLY THE PRESIDENT. INDEPENDENTLY OF THAT,E ARE -- HAVE OUR OWN CO-EQUAL BRANCH OF  GOVERNMENT VIEWS. MANY OF THEM WE WILL PURSUE  BECAUSE SAUDI ARABIA CANNOT WITH IMMUNITY ULTIMATELY GIVE THE  GLOBAL MARKETS ENERGY  INSECURITY, CREAT A GREATER  ECONOMIC CHALLENGE AT A TIME OF  GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONCERNS AND  FUEL PUTIN'S WAR MACHINE. THAT'S ARE ALL THE ACTIONS  THAT --HEHE CONSEQUENCES OF THE  DECISI THAT SAUDI ARABIA LED  AT THE OPEC CARTEL. >> EVERY DECISION HAS  CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE H HAD MORE THAN 70 YEAR  OF A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH  SAUDI ARABIA AND NOT JUST FOR  OIL. IT'S ALSO A SECURITY ALLIANCE  AGAINST IRAN. HOW PRACTICAL IS IT TO CUT THEM  OFF FROM WEAPONS, FREEZE IT FOR  A YEAR, GIVEN THE INCREASING  AGGRESSIVENESS BY IRAN? >> T REALITY IS THAT'S ONE OF  THE DECISIONS THAT THE SAUDIS  WILL HAVE TO MAKE. WHO ARE THEY GOING TO RELY UPON  TO HAVE GREATER SECURITY FROM  IRAN, WHICH IS AN EXISTENTIAL  THREAT, THAN THE UTED STATES? RUSSIA? RUSSIA IS IN BED WITH IRAN. RUSSIA IS -- PUTIN IS GIVING  THEM ASSISTANCE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, RUSSIA IS  NOT YOUR SOLUTION. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES. IF WE' NOT IMMEDIATELY GOING  TO CONTINUE TO DEPLOY A  STRATEGIC DEFENSE FOR THEM, TY WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU CANNOT HE ACTIONS WITHOUT  CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY WHEN  THOSE ACTIONS AFFECT THE  NATIONAL INTERESTS AND SECURY  OF THE UNITED STATES. >> DO YOU FACTOR IN THE FACT  THAT THIS BRASH YOUNG SAUDI  CROWN PRINCE IS GOING TO BE MOST LIKELY THE COUNY'S KING FOR  THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, FOR  DECADES? >> THAT'S WHY PRESINT BIDEN  MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY TRIP TO  THE REGION AND MET WITH THE  CROWN PRINCE IN A MULTI-VERSED  APPROACH. IT WAS ABOUT THE ABILITY TO HAVE REGIONAL GULF COOPERATION WITH  EACH OTHER AGAINST IRAN. IT WAS ABOUT HAVING BETTER  RELATIONSHIPS WITH ISRAEL. IT WAS ABOUT COOPERATION WITH  THE UNITED STATES ON ECONOMIC  QUESTIONS. YES, IT WAS A GLOBAL OIL  SECURITY. BUT THE RESPONSE OF THE CROWN  PRINCE BASICALLY IS NOT JUST A  SLAP IN THE FACE TO THE UNITED  STATES, IT'S A SLAP IN THE FACE  TO THE WESTERN WORLD, WHICH IS  LEADING IN MULTILATERAL  INTEATIONAL EFFORTS AGAINST  VLADIMIR PUTIN. HE SIDED WITH PUTIN. HE IS FUELLING PUTIN'S WAR  MACHINES. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THE  ADMINISTRATION CAN THINK ABOUT. ARMS SALES IS JUST ONE ELEMENT. WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT I SHARE, I HAVE SOME JURISDICTION OVER  THAT. I HE USED THAT IN THE PAST WHEN TRUMP GAVE THEM $8 BILLION  IN ARMS SALES. THERE'S OTHER THINGS. SHOULD OPEC BE SUBJECT TO BEING  ALLOWED TO BE SUED AS A CARTEL  IN THE UNITED STATES? DOES THE CROWN PRINCE HIELF  HAVE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AS 9/11  FAMILIES ARE PURSUING THE  KINGDOM? ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE TO  PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THEM ONRA  WHEN, IN FACT, OUR FOCUS COULD  BE OUR ALLY, THETATE OF  ISRA, THAT SHARES OUR VALUES  D ACT IN COOPERATION WITH US? >> WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THE  PRESIDENT TO DO ABOUT VENEZUELA? THERE IS CONSIDERATION OF  LETTING CHEVRON IN VENEZUELA  PUMP OIL AGAIN, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE DICTATOR HAS NOT DONE  ANYTHING ON DEMOCRACC REFORMS? >> LISTEN, IN ALL O THESE  THINGS THERE'S A CALIBRATION. I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT, IF YOU  GIVE --  [ NO AUDIO ] THE AUTHORITARIAN DICTATORS  KNOW HOW TO TAKE, BUT THEY ARE  UNWILLING TO GIVE. THE RESULT IS A BAD DEAL. WHETHER THAT'S IRAN'S NUCLEAR  POSTURE. WHETHER THAT'SHE CROWN PRINCE  AND WHAT HEAS DONE TO FUEL  PUTIN'S WAR MACHINE. OR WHETHER --EE TALK ABOUTOW  MANY UKRAINIANS HAVE FLED. 8 MILLION HAVE FLED VENEZUELA  WHICH ARE AT OUR SOUTHERN  BORDERS. I WOULD NOT GIVE HIM THE ABILITY  PUMP OIL WITHOUT OTHER  RECIPROCAL ACTIONS BY THE  REGIME.

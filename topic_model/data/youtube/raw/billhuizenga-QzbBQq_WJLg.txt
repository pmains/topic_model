Bureau website dealing with foreign trade and year-to-date Canada accounts for 16.2 percent of all of our trade both exports and imports China is at 14.2 percent and all of the European nations singer Lee are in the single digits collectively are much more significant than that I had I had run out actually to meet with the gentleman who is the chair of the standing committee on international trade who is a member of parliament Rob merrifield from from Canada and and we had a little conversation about this we talked about what's happening in Canada and with with their budgets they are actually going to be introducing an austerity budget they have lowered their their tax rates they believe that they are on firm ground and certainly Prime Minister Harper who has been here and and in other places around the world is looking for those trade partnerships so we know that when we're talking about America we're actually talking about an expanded North American envelope of influence really and in in Canada being so tied directly to Europe they are also affected by that and I wanted to talk a little bit about you were starting to things you were starting to head down a path and I believe what we would run out of time about the Brits separating their retail versus institutional spending and you had said it's much more radical I just want to give you a brief time to expand on that and then I've got a very specific question as well well I'm not sure I can really do justice to the reform but it brought outlines what they propose to do over time is to separate the retail deposit-taking activities there big banks required them to be very substantially capitalized and leave the wholesale parts of the banking system separately managed with less regulation and you know they have to choose what's right for them but I don't I could not conceive of why we'd want to adopt at the United States because we just went through a crisis in 08 09 where it was cost significantly not really by traditional banking activities although a lot of banks took too much risk but because of what in the wholesale markets where there were much weaker capital requirements and much more funding risk and it was that collapse of the shadow banking system United States they'll brought a wholesale system that caused so so much pressure so much trauma to this how much damage to the innocent here now so I it says with respect to them but there's is a much more sweeping separation and I do not think it makes sense for our country well I'm not saying that it does either i think the point that you were making earlier and certainly I track with is that there's a number of solutions being talked out there and whether it's Basel discussions and in in in what England is doing and others and there's and we know there's great differences between Greece and germany and france and italy and and others within the EU the very specifically though it brought been brought to my attention looking at our debt structure and looking at the british debt structure there is a there is a chart out there that i saw that indicated the amount of debt that Great Britain has and when that debt is coming up to be renewed and they have much more effectively in my mind back loaded this their 10-year debt window is very different than our 10-year debt window we have gotten and maybe you have the exact figures but it's somewhere around sixty percent I believe or seventy percent of our total debt that is going to be needing to get refinanced here in the next 36 months at at historic some would argue artificially low interest rates and what is going to happen with those it seems to me we need to expand this out I talked to former state treasurer in Michigan about this exact issue and that is how so many whether they're states or countries or whatever have gotten themselves into trouble we need to lock into these longer-term lower interest rates obviously it's going to have an impact on our day-to-day budgeting and if you could comment on that please you're right and thank you for raising that and extending the maturity of that is a sensible smart prudent thing to do in this environment and we're doing it really quite aggressively I think even over the short period of time we moved from an average maturity of I think 14 I months to I think 67 months a day and we're going further expect to go further and it as you said it makes it makes sense to do that because we're at a time of exceptionally low long-term interest rates so we'll keep moving will do in a carefully balanced way and you're right will this administration be willing to to take a short term higher time and interest payment of course of course then it makes sense to do it chair now recognizes the gentleman from medicine

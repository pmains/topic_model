so we we always tell everyone don't ask a military family what what you what can i do for you just do it yeah because military families are proud and they're strong and they don't ask for help very often no just do it just do it just if you see a need do it go mow their lawn for them go help them drop off some groceries [Music] well good afternoon everyone congressman pete stauber here i'm here with uh my best friend a great mother and and my wife jody you know we're as we run for reelection and and jody's been by my side um from my city council days to county commissioner days and it's really been a rock and supporting my endeavor and i think that as jody performed in her professional life as a member of the minnesota air national guard at the 148th fighter wing um you know we worked together she became the first comanche for the 148th fighter wing uh in the state's history we're very proud of you and and and you know i just joey tell us about what it was like as first female command chief and entering the guard in the mid 80s as a female at the 148th well i i joined the military when i was 18 as you know before we even met and i always said that that was my first best adult decision was joining the military i had no idea where it was going to take me or what i was going to see and do but i just knew that i had it in my heart to to actually join i had gone to a recruiting semi truck that they came to my school back in the ninth grade and there was a big flag in there and had a presentation about that and it really pulled up my patriotic heartstrings and that was the reason i joined the military was be for patriot patriotic reasons so when i joined i was a shy quiet kid and i left to duluth minnesota and and went to basic training and came back and never i guess really looked too far ahead in my career at the time but just as a uh shy quiet kid i i did the best i could in the job that i was in each each time each time i would get a new job and it would lead to other successes and later on i would tell people to bloom where you're planted you know those are some things that i i bring uh to the campaign trail and and from your um you know your time at the the base you always said bloom where you're planted and your signatures on everything you do and you know as you know throughout our life and and our marriage of raising kids i remember that all the time and i think that's why there was great you had great success in doing that and i think i mean there's people that i meet right now that uh worked with you and and for you and and personnel that really appreciate your leadership and and you left a great legacy as the first female command chief in the state's history and and i was very and i'm still very proud of your service and and i know that the members of the minnesota air national guard are uh citizen soldiers and we appreciate them more than that they know and i think your leadership and also your leadership and deploying to iraq at the uh you know service to our nation when our nation called um you know you went and it wasn't easy for us that was hard those were hard times and that was scary for mom to leave and leave you with four kids and and how are you all gonna manage and you guys did you did great it was wasn't easy and it wasn't easy to for me to be gone for sure but with the help of our community and um your friends and family you managed to feed the kids and keep the house from falling down and it was it was a good thing and and we really i think the best thing we did with that whole deployment was to really stress to the kids that they're serving their country too even though mom's gone i'm the one that's in iraq but dad and kids are serving the country too by holding down the fort and by supporting me and allowing me to go serve in that way and that was really important for our family and it was a really big time of service for us and remember the message we got out of that too with how difficult that was that you and i both now when we talk about the military and deployments and things that are hard on families we we always tell everyone don't ask a military family well what you what can i do for you just do it yeah your military families are proud and they're strong and they don't ask for help very often no so just do it yeah just do it just if you see a need do it go mow their lawn for them go help them drop off some groceries and that's what happened that's what helped our good friends and family a church family helped us through it and you're exactly right don't ask what you can do just do it because military families we're proud we can you know we can persevere and but it really takes a lot of help from family and church activities i would just say that you know as moving on into your career and and my career allowing me to not only work as a police officer in the city of duluth but at the same time uh being able to serve as a city councilor in hermantown and then allowing me to run and become a county commissioner those days those nights that you know we had meetings or whatever you understood service and sacrifice and it's not easy raising the four kids but you you've been really a champion of allowing me and to serve and and i i can't tell you how much i appreciate that it's not easy and i think spouses of elected members will say the same thing there's a sacrifice that that you know you you have and allowing me now to uh not only run for congress but run for re-election um it's been a you know some challenging times but um i think deep down i think that people have to know that you understand service to our nation that patriotic service and um i just i really really appreciate that some some of those days that are along for you with the family and and uh at home i just appreciate everything you do it's it's it's interesting that you and i both started out our careers as uniform wearers yes we both chose in our careers to serve our community around us you as a police officer put on your blue uniform every day and serve the community and and and took an oath to protect and serve our community and which is very important and a very big job and i when i was 18 raised my right hand and took an oath to protect our country yeah and to wear a uniform every day and put on that uniform and and like i always tell you you protected the city but i had the bigger job always and i had the whole country to worry about every time you heard those f-16s that fly over the sound of freedom you had mentioned that you're proud of the people at the 148 to keep the planes flying and protecting and serving our country i'm very proud of the people i served with people that would step up and it's such a great community of people helping each other not only during deployment but every day we we are proud and we appreciate every person who serves in the job they're doing and that was one thing that was important and one of the things that i would tell the troops that when we were when i was in iraq was you were called to serve here and now in this capacity and i'm proud of you and thank you for answering that call yeah because there's there's any myriad of uh jobs to jobs to do some big some small and some not so fun but it's very important and that people stepped up and they did and they did the job they're called to do whether it's a 19 year old cook or if it's somebody flying a jet every single job is important and everybody recognized that and they respected that so we appreciate all that all the people that serve and the families too that serve a lot right along with our service members and also with the police force yep there's a there's definitely calling you talk about wearing uniforms and and i was a privilege to serve with the dolores police department for you know um over two decades and and uh being able to work close with great people and establishing or really being the benchmark for community policing in duluth you spearheaded that and you did an excellent job and you were you were the gold standard for community policing in duluth there was a yeah there was a good teamwork we had a good team and good commitment good leadership and i think that's important that's exactly what i'm trying to do with the justice act by the way but i think that uh for the for those of you who are watching this right now i think you can see um you know the the support that i have in my wife uh 24 years of marriage we're blessed with four children um you know one with special needs our isaac is just an unexpected blessing from the lord and to have the ability to serve every single day the constituents in our eighth district everybody is such a privilege and an honor and and i'm asking as we run for a re-election that that you give me another opportunity to work in the 117th congress and and continue to do great stuff not only for our eighth district but the state in the nation so um it's kind of a little insight on on pete stauber and my best friend my wife and a great mother to my children so we'll uh we'll see you all again soon thank you you

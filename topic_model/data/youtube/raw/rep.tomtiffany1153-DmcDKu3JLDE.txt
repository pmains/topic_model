let's be real clear about the apology in regards to the national school boards association why did they do that they took the fall they took the fall and that's why the attorney general should come back in and answer the questions that my colleagues have stated quite eloquently here why attorney general garland should get back here the school board association just took the fall for what was happening within the biden administration and in particular um with the attorney general's office the general lady from texas did her roll call and i'd like to build on some of the comments that representative bishop made she did this roll call she did not include the bernie sanders supporter that came and shot up some of our colleagues just a few years ago almost killing the whip that serves here on the republican side of the republican side of the dais and we can do this tit for tat stuff i mean we can just keep doing it back and forth and whatever but that doesn't solve what the american people want to see happen they want to see murders go down in the united states of america they want to see violent crime go down in the united states of america regardless of what their ethnicity is regardless of what their color is they want to see crime reduced but that's not what we're dealing with today and i just hark back to what is it two weeks ago when we had the president's state of the union he said we're going to fund the police well for all of you out there in america right now it's very clear that that was simply lip service because the people that are driving the train at this point on the other side of the aisle they have no interest in additional funding for police they have no interest in supporting law enforcement and you can tell by their priorities with having a bill like this come before us today and i want to know why we're not having a hearing on what woke prosecutors are doing across america because as much as we talk about i mean our governor recently announced there's going to be a big grant for law enforcement whatever but he didn't do anything about the prosecutors which by the way he could relieve them for not doing their jobs like the prosecutor in milwaukee county i will repeat to you back in 2007 when he started his job as the district attorney in milwaukee county he said publicly yep we may divert some people um that should perhaps be behind bars and they may kill somebody you bet guaranteed that's going to happen but that does not invalidate the approach does not invalidate the approach that he took that ended up with five deaths at a christmas parade in waukesha county wisconsin why are we having a hearing on prosecutors why don't we bring the attorney general in and have him talk about prosecutors that are not prosecuting crime that is leading to a diminishment in the way of life for the people here in the united states i would just close by saying this i look up at that staff that shield that is right in front of us here i look at that shield that's up there that says e pluribus unum and what is this hearing about today on this bill it's about dividing people e pluribus unum out of many won i hope this committee will get back to trying to bring the american people together rather than dividing us i yield back

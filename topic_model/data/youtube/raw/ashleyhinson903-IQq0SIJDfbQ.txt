well good morning everyone and thank you so much for joining us for this edition of hot seat with hinson i'm congresswoman ashley henson from iowa's first district pleasure to be with you today um so thanks for tuning in and we have a very special guest today a fellow member of our freshman class here in dc representative tony gonzalez from texas's 23rd district so good morning to you tony good to be with you and thanks so much for joining us uh for hot seat with hinson hey hey ashley thank you for having me i'm excited about today it'll be fun yeah so tony tell us a little bit about your district because your district is on the southern border with texas that's one of the things we wanted to talk about today just describe to everybody who's watching today kind of what your district encompasses yeah so my district goes from san antonio to el paso it's 820 miles of texas to mexico border that's about 40 percent of our southern border it's both urban and rural i have a lot of rural areas it's larger than 30 states two time zones like i am on the road non-stop and oh by the way it's also 71 hispanic yes a very um actually similar makeup to my district in terms of rural and urban areas but you are facing some unique challenges in texas right now and um that's part of the reason we wanted to get together today was to talk about issues that texans care about but also most importantly issues that iowans care about which are securing the border and of course our economy as well so i obviously had a chance to be down with you uh representative gonzalez in texas in your district um to see what was actually happening at the border at del rio sector we had that round table with with local sheriffs local law enforcement who were talking about their needs uh in keeping their communities safe as it relates to the challenges at the border we saw the overflow facility at eagle pass that customs and border patrol has put up but you led a great delegation trip to show truly why every state's a border state and um and so we could experience what you are actually seeing on the ground there for everyone watching can you kind of explain what you're seeing right now um that situation hasn't improved um but just give um some some of your first-hand experiences with what you're seeing right there at the border yeah no first it was great for for you uh to come out you know there's a lot of people that have it camilla harris who haven't made it out to uh the southern border right so the fact that you are willing were willing to come out here was great and uh you know probably one of the most frustrating things for a lot of my constituents is they feel as if they're alone as if they're forgotten you know and they're they're kind of on the it's really the wild wild west i kid you not and they're they're they're there alone nobody cares about them you know the administration is saying nothing's wrong it's the furthest thing from the truth um you know you have folks that have lived on the border their entire adult lives that are saying it is as bad as it's ever been like you said when we visited we spoke with sheriffs and and local elected officials and oh by the way i didn't mention this but this round table that we put together half of them were democrats half of more republicans so and and half of them were like liberal democrats really conservative republicans like it was a mix i was a little nervous because you know i didn't tee it up so you don't know exactly what everyone's gonna say but if you recall like everybody was saying the same tune and and they all they all were first generation americans or second generation americans so it wasn't this kind of xenophobic we don't want you here it was just the fact that people didn't feel safe and you know as a as a a parent children are everything to us and the last thing you would want is to get a call from from your neighbor or something that some terrible has happened so it's as bad as it's ever been well in some of the stories that were shared at that round table and like you said it's it's a nonpartisan issue it's not a republican issue it's not a democrat issue it's a safety and security issue for all americans but some of the stories that they were relaying of these stash houses that you know the cartels are stashing people guns and drugs in and money and um just the the the crime that has uh ticked up um it's a challenge for our local law enforcement to keep their communities safe because they're being pulled in um and to help with that wave at the border i think you know when i look at our state iowa obviously is a it's a border state too because you have interstate 35 and the people who come in who get past customs and border patrol who get past those local law enforcement agencies they're coming straight north and bringing dangerous drugs like fentanyl into our state making our state less safe i've heard from many of my constituents they're concerned about about the safety and security so obviously a major issue that like you said it's getting it's getting worse it's not getting better um president biden needs to go visit the border vice president harris needs to go visit the border and we've seen it firsthand you're living it firsthand can you detail some of the stories that you've heard um you mentioned kids um there were some stories told about um families feeling threatened um because of this no absolutely and and i'll go back to iowa like why is it important to iowa you know you know um it's important to iowa because a lot of these kids and families honestly that are coming over they're going all over the united states once they get processed as they're awaiting their uh they're literally flying all over the united states so it what is happening is these these folks are in your communities whether you realize it or not nobody's telling you the administration isn't saying hey we've got 10 people flying to uh uh you know uh uh grand rapids this year right they're not doing that but it's happening what's scary to me as a as a father is these children are going into these places that we have no idea nobody's tracking them after that right which it's just really dangerous so some of the stories um just sunday it's mother's day right and uh you know i get uh one of my staffers reaches out and she goes tony i know it's my mother's day but we they just found these five young girls at this uh farm and there's five young girls three of them for for from honduras two of them were from guatemala the oldest was seven so it was a seven-year-old a five-year-old a three-year-old a two-year-old an 11 month old just there just they they'd come over the the smugglers had come over the border dropped them there in the middle of the night because the farmer had done his rounds that evening nobody was there that next morning they're there um you know they didn't have any water they didn't have any food what i've been saying is there's only a matter of time before something very bad happens and and we need to act now i'm trying to kind of tone down some of the rhetoric and just kind of entice the administration to work with us hey come visit for yourself come you know let's work together because once something bad happens no one goes oh you know what it's your fault i told you so it doesn't matter like that life is lost or that terrible incident happened we have to do something about it absolutely we have to fix the problem and you've got some legislation in the works uh to help support local law enforcement and also to to help with the border situation can you talk a little bit about what you're working on tony yeah absolutely so i leave this so i i uh i visited this this ranch yesterday kemado it's right on the border and on my way home i live in san antonio on my way home it's about a two and a half hour drive there is literally two high-speed chases on my way home right so you see the law enforcement what has happened is because border patrol is stretched so thin um you've got sheriffs and local uh law enforcement that are having to to kind of uh fill that space well guess what their budgets are tiny they're small little towns uh and they're having high speed chases every day literally every day something's happening so this bill uh it's the uh the uh border uh it's a border uh security security first act and uh focuses on there's a specific account it's called operation stone garden funds federal grants that go to um that go to uh share-ups and and local law enforcement that are operating in the immigration space and it's not just our southern border it's it's our northern border it's uh you know the the waterways in florida this is one way i think we can directly impact uh our communities that are doing that work absolutely we need to be supporting our law enforcement as they're protecting our borders keeping our communities safe and yeah i think i was struck when i was down there by the um the frequency of the the high-speed chases that are happening in in communities i mean it is a real threat uh to the safety and security of the people who are living there every day um the cartels are more and more emboldened and we're seeing that play out obviously in your district and and then it affects districts like mine and every state is truly a border state so thank you for your work on supporting law enforcement i think it's truly important we support law enforcement not defund law enforcement so um can you talk a little bit too i think you know one of the biggest issues that we're working on here is um you know trying to get to an infrastructure package making sure people do get relief but we want to do it in a targeted way and there is a lot of talk about the spending spigot as i like to say um being turned on here what are you hearing um from people back home about proposed spending packages literally in the trillions of dollars and also about what we can actually be doing to get our economy back up and running yeah people are frustrated they're frustrated with the sheer amount of money that is just being shelled out i mean as you know there's trillions of dollars that has yet to be spent and now we're talking about another 4 trillion you know when biden was talking about not only the infrastructure package but that second package for 1.9 trillion i was confused i'm like wait are we talking about a new 1.9 trillion are we talking about the same 1.9 trillion no it was a new you know two trillion dollars is just astronomical i think we can all agree like you know would love to do something on infrastructure that would help our economy a lot of ways you know help a lot of these small communities but i always ask well that's great i'm with you halfway there how are we going to pay for it you know some of the things that really is um is scary to a lot of a lot of my constituents especially in rural areas is this estate tax you know this death tax um and that's absolutely gonna be on the uh the chopping block um that's scary of course you know that that when you tax everybody out of existence all that's gonna do is uh hurt our economy not allow it to grow but the spending is out of control i think we need to to look at not how much we're spending but how we are spending it absolutely and uh you and i are serving together on the appropriations committee so our constituents back home both in texas and in iowa can count on tony and me to to make sure that we're advocating for taxpayers and how we are spending that money we have a seat at the table and we're making sure we're uh trying to be responsible with your resources um in washington dc because it's your money it's not the government's money and we want less heavy hands of government in your life so we will be continuing to push for those kinds of policies through our work uh in washington dc but um a lot to be done obviously a lot to protect and a lot a lot of issues that we are tackling together uh tony and i as new members of congress so um representative gonzalez if people want to learn more about your campaign where should they go for more information yeah our social media uh tony gonzalez for texas is our twitter handle of tony gonzalez on uh on our facebook page um and so

that are important are heard and and to be honest there's not a lot of people like that on the hill unfortunately you know there's a lot of people that are just kind of going along to get along don't want to rock the boat don't want to cause don't want to cause too much trouble but also don't want to put in the work so i'm excited to work with you i think it's you're you're an amazing colleague

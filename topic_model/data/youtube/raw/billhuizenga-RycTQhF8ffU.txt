Thank You mr. Chairman I appreciate that and and Madame chair appreciate you being here as well neither one of us were around this institution when dodd-frank came into effect but we're both dealing with the echo effects of it and I want to explore that a little bit i gotta tell you i was thrilled earlier I think in one of your responses to to my colleague mr. nagavara from from Texas you said I believe the quote was it's one of your highest priorities to simplify reporting requirements well we've got one of those solutions for you all right it's called HR 1135 myself and my colleague mr. Garrett from New Jersey it's dealing with the pay ratio and section 9 53 of dodd-frank has been labeled by some a logistical nightmare because of all the different factors that are having to be put in place to consider calculating total compensation and I'm curious there's a lot of questions out there you know what transit transit benefits or employee paid health care costs be a component of compensation should domestic and all multinational employees be a part of the calculation what about part-time employees or independent contractors it seems to me it's a vague statue I would if you agree or disagree with that and what factors do you believe must be considered to issue determing this calculation have you looked at that at all I have looked at that and again you know there are you know others who feel very strongly that that needs to be done as quickly as possible the complication with that is in the definition of total compensation and and under a specific definition of that which applies and when you're disclosing your top executives compensation that is the statutory definition leads to all the other issues you've just you know teed up in terms of some of those complexity I guess ultimately my question is as to what end to what good and and in that you know when center around executive compensation is survey they believe that's an estimate of three months in some cases longer to calculate and gather and all this pay ratios and I love to know whether the weather commission has staff has taken any effort to identify the costs to business for this when there's in my view of it absolutely no benefit to the health and well-being safety and soundness of either a corporation or the investors of it it seems to me it's trying to turn it into a political football and and I'm curious and we can and love to submit these as well get up maybe a further more full answer from you but it seems to me I we need to we need to find out from you whether you believe that it's worthwhile the significant amounts of time and money that are going to be spent in developing very quickly I mean it's a it's a mandated rulemaking for us so as a regulator well 1135 will take care of that and will will alleviate you of that burden so the other thing I have it we're working on some draft legislation regarding mergers and acquisitions and earlier you're talking about small businesses and trying to focus and concentrate on that our proposal is to right-size federal regulation of ma intermediaries and business brokers and it's been one of the top recommendations for the government industry forum on small business capital formation which the SEC annually holds it's been a recommendation in two thousand and five six seven eight nine ten and eleven do you see that this is an important small business capital formation concern and under your leadership what priority are you going to be giving to these small business issues I you know I'd certainly appreciate the concern of that issue and I will give a very high priority of small business issues during my tenure okay well it's the just to clarify right now presently broker-dealer registration is a one size fits all approach and ninety percent of the requirements are totally irrelevant to a broker-dealer engaging in a liminal limited capital raising activities this could be something as small as selling an LLC because it has membership shares and those kinds of things and it will commit to reviewing that specific that's great because I know staff has acknowledged that concern but it's not addressed it yet and I look forward to that finally I on brokers I just wanted to echo my my friend mr. Meeks as well it seems that the SEC the DOL here are in a race I and one of those one of those in my opinion shouldn't be in the race and it seems to me that we need to make sure that we're looking at that standard of care for for retail accounts especially when it's including those IRAs and looking forward to an update from you on that so those those were my three issues other than the last 10 seconds I've got we're talking budgets according to my calculations about 550 million dollars of your budget goes to folks that make a hundred thousand dollars or more on your staff and I understand a hundred thousand dollars in Washington DC isn't the same as in zeeland Michigan but you've got eighty five point seven five percent of your employees making a hundred thousand dollars and more lugga to review that as well

hi I'm Senator Mark Warner and I'm going to talk about what happened in the impeachment trial that began in the United States Senate today this afternoon the articles of impeachment were in a sense officially brought to the United States Senate we heard as the house managers read out the articles of impeachment the first article outline series of allegations of abuse powers by the president the second allegation the second charge was that the president by refusing to honor any of the subpoenas from the house or any of the requests for information from the house obstructed Congress obviously these are both extraordinarily extreme serious charges in addition something that came out today was that the GAO an independent entity in our government did a review and saw that the White House had urged parts of the administration to actually break the law when they illegally withheld aid to Ukraine aid that have been approved by a bipartisan House and Senate again the challenge going forward will be for each senator to evaluate these charges to evaluate the relevance of this jail finding and reach a conclusion the feeling in the Senate today was extremely somber I think all of us realized the responsibility and the constitutional responsibility we took on during this proceeding second part of the proceeding that Chief Justice of the Supreme Court came over to the Senate and he was sworn in as the an effect judge overseeing the proceedings and then asked each of us to raise our right hand and take an oath to be an impartial juror we'll come back next week and we'll start to hear the facts laid out by the house managers and then the defense laid out by the president's lawyers these are challenging times for our nation challenging times I think for all Americans as we grapple with something that's only happened literally three times in terms of the presidential level to have a full impeachment trial before before the Senate so I'm gonna looking forward with some trepidation but also a sense of somber responsibility that I'm gonna take this responsibility and come at it with an open mind here all the facts and then ultimately have to make a decision my hope is that no matter whether you're for the president or against the president that we'll all take a step back and and you know take a fresh look at the proceedings and you'll reach your own conclusions as well I hope to continue to update Virginians and and friends around the country on a regular basis throughout this trial and again we will get through this just as our country's managed to get to other crises in the past but this one has to be taken with that appropriate degree of seriousness

mr. speaker more than 40 years ago the Supreme Court held that women have the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy prior to viability or at any time to protect the life and death and health of the mother this bill is flatly unconstitutional on both counts the Supreme Court has blocked every other 20-week ban because 20 weeks as well before the point of viability further the bill includes no exception for the health of the mother only waiving the ban if a woman's life is at imminent risk and clear violation of a woman's constitutional rights shamefully the bill places new and cruel restrictions even on women accessing abortion after a rape or incest and once again the Republicans are proclaiming the falsehood that 20 week old fetuses can feel pain contrary to the conclusions of every reputable researcher in the field and what about women like Danielle from New York who found out in the 29th week of her pregnancy that her baby's brain was dangerously deformed and that if she and the baby were to survive the pregnancy the baby would only live a short extremely painful life Danielle and her husband had two young children and faced a heartbreaking decision should they put that yell on their family through the pain and suffering of a dangerous pregnancy and birth and allow their baby to suffer and die in pain or should she terminate the pregnancy and mourn their baby as a family the Constitution guarantees Danielle the right to make that choice with her family and her doctors it does not grant that right to the politicians sitting in this room I will close with Danielle's words what my husband and I experienced was just so horrible unless people have walked in my shoes they don't understand I did what was right for my son and my family and it's no one else's business on behalf of Danielle I urge my colleagues to vote no on this horrible bill we must stop the bans

we begin by saying that again I've said this before I'd certainly say it again here today our thoughts and prayers go out to all the citizens of Japan especially those families of the thousands of the disaster victims and those that are that are in going through a very very difficult time as it's a tragedy unfolds I encourage the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other US agencies to continue to coordinate the Japanese government to provide any assistance that they need to recover the events instructor pan or reminders that we are all vulnerable to unexpected disasters whether it's an act of nature or a terrorist attack while we cannot predict when or where the next major disaster will occur we know that it will occur and we also know that adequate protection adequate preparation and response planning or vital to minimize both the injury and death when it when it does happen today's hearing is one of many I hope that this committee will have to make sure that our nation has prepared for the worst in order to prevent any law is lost from nuclear power in this country the United States we have as you know 104 nuclear power plants in some 31 states which generate approximately a fifth of our nation's total electric consumption nuclear power has helped to curb our reliance on dirty fossil fuels and reduce air pollution the damages our health and causes global warming over the years the the NRC has strived to create a culture of safety and the nuclear energy industry and as long as I've been on this subcommittee we worked very hard to reinforce those of those efforts as a result we have seen not seen any direct us from nuclear power plant radiation exposure in this country in over 50 years as part of this culture was safe to the NRC requires nuclear facilities to be designed to withstand natural disasters and terrorist attacks after September 11 the NRC took a closer look at the nuclear industry put in place additional safety and security requirements despite all the protections that are in place the crisis in Japan is a clear warning clear reminder that we cannot become complacent when it comes to nuclear safety I often say as my colleagues are tired of hearing me say if it isn't perfect make it better and that certainly applies to nuclear plants and and the way that they are they're operating and with respect to their safety that's why its chairman boxer and i asked the NRC for a comprehensive review of our nuclear fleet we wanted to make sure we want to make sure that every precaution is being taken to safeguard the american people from a similar nuclear accident the NRC is just getting started in this review and I anxiously await their results today I look forward to hearing from our witnesses an update on Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and update on our response to that crisis I also look forward to hearing what we can learn from the ongoing crisis in order to prevent similar events from occurring right here I'm particularly interested in hearing about the state of emergency planning process from the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security Secretary Schiliro welcome him especially and as chairman of the Subcommittee on nuclear safety I take seriously my responsibilities our responsibilities to make certain that we are taking the appropriate measures to make the nuclear industry as safe as they can possibly be and as I said before well I'm a proponent of clean energy my top priority of our domestic power I am nuclear power industry remains public safety

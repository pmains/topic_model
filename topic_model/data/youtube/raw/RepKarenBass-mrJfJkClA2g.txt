democratic congresswoman karen bass of california she's on the house judiciary and foreign affairs committee congresswoman thanks for joining us as always this legislation comes on top of three trillion dollars of relief passed during the trump presidency should americans feel confident that this massive new bill almost two trillion dollars is the last step we need to get the economy back on track or will more relief be necessary down the road well i am certainly hoping that it won't be because again the president has said that we will have enough vaccines for all americans that want it by the end of may and clearly with national leadership we can put our arms around and contain and reduce the covet virus and so i believe that that will help us get the economy back but everybody needed the support i'm very excited that we passed it out of the house today the three trillion dollars uh that were passed last year by congress under president trump those were bipartisan efforts uh in the house and senate and obviously republican president trump this legislation passed without a single republican vote in the house or the senate what do you make of that fact well i think it's actually a shame because if you look at the different categories of funding my republican colleagues have already voted for this before so there was no reason for them not to vote to extend it we all know that unemployment is going out in the next few days and we certainly don't want people cut off so i think the only reason they didn't vote for it is because it's a different administration and i think that's sad including included in this bill is something not related to covet relief not related to the economy uh writ large uh 86 billion dollars for union pension bailouts uh pensions that if if this money wasn't provided a bunch of people who had worked hard and deserved pensions wouldn't get them there was a bipartisan effort to have this happen but it would have come with some reforms perhaps it would have been a loan instead of just a direct bailout wouldn't that have been a better way to address this issue so as to make sure it doesn't happen again there's the mismanagement issues well i don't think so i mean i think it was important for us to look at the fact all of the different ways that the economy and working families can be impacted and this was certainly one you know one of the things that i'm the most excited about in the bill was done by representative barbara lee and that is targeted vaccine distribution are two communities that are really suffering because the online registration has become a real barrier and so the idea that seven billion dollars would go for to community clinics to mobile sites to door-to-door outreach and then another 7 billion for the public health workforce so that we can really distribute the vaccines on a ground level to the communities that are most impacted a lot of good stuff in this building it's interesting you say that because you have an op op-ed in which you suggest that uh the the whatever delay there is in members of minority communities getting vaccinated isn't because of hesitancy it's because of access right and it occurs to me uh colleagues i know when they have gotten vaccinated they have you know signed up online they've taken a day off of work right they've driven down to the hospital or whatever in the middle of the day they had time to wait and maybe some communities there are individuals who who don't have those luxuries absolutely you've laid out all of the barriers and if you just imagine that the priority is given to people who are 65 first 75 and then 65 you were talking about communities where online access is very difficult and so that's why you have people from other neighborhoods coming into the inner city areas and so a collaboration that we established with the congressional black caucus hispanic caucus asian and native american caucuses with the urban league and the national psychological association for racial and equity we just finished a poll and that poll says in the black population 67 percent of african americans want the vaccine so guess what if we focus on the people that want the vaccine they are related to are friends with people who are hesitant and the more we focus on that they can show their friends and their neighbors and their family members that they're okay i think that's the better way to address hesitancy we also need trusted community voices and that's also a part of this bill yeah and there's there's mobile clinics it sounds like a a real possibility stay in touch in this issue it's very important we appreciate your your being here today democratic congresswoman karen bass of california thanks so much

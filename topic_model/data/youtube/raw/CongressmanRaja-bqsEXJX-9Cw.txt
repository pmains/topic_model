damning testimony at the latest january 6th committee hearing this as lieutenant governor juliana stratton appears on capitol hill to testify at an abortion hearing plus highland park in the spotlight at yesterday's white house ceremony marking the passage of a bipartisan gun control bill here to talk about all that and more are congresswoman robin kelly a democrat from madison congressman raja krishnamoorthy a democrat from schaumburg and congresswoman jan chakowski a democrat from evanston we also invited all of the republicans in the illinois congressional delegation none accepted our invitation for this evening but we thank the three of you for joining us so today's january 6 committee hearing painted a detailed picture of what went on inside the white house and the role former president donald trump and his advisors played in the riots take a look at what republican congresswoman and committee vice chair liz chaney had to say president trump is a 76 year old man he is not an impressionable child just like everyone else in our country he is responsible for his own actions and his own choices as our investigation has shown donald trump had access to more detailed and specific information showing that the election was not actually stolen than almost any other american and he was told this over and over again congresswoman jane chakowski what's your reaction to today's january 6th uh committee hearing no i think it's so incredibly important for the american people just to hear the truth these are people who are under oath these are people who um are have all the information about what's really going on and i think the american people are paying attention we know that um and are going to act accordingly certainly we want to hold people accountable for what they do to take this information with them to the polls as well congresswoman kelly who's the audience here is it the department of justice is it the gop of the republicans think it's the department of justice but i think the public and the republicans as well as my colleague just said we're hoping that americans are watching so they can remember this when they go to the poll as well as other things also uh congressman christian murphy former president donald trump recently tried to call an unnamed witness and the panel has referred that incident to the department of justice uh vice chair lee's liz cheney explained this during the hearing today should the former president face any sort of uh witness tampering or witness intimidation charges absolutely and i think that any attempt to influence uh these witnesses uh would absolutely uh violate the law and i think that uh the whole the whole problem that the justice department has with donald trump is trying to prove corrupt intent that is doing things knowing that they are unlawful or illegal and this man knows exactly what he's doing to be unlawful and illegal so many of his advisers keep telling him that what he's doing is unlawful and illegal and he continues and that proves corrupt intent and i think that uh he needs to be held accountable for that congresswoman chukowski are there other crimes that you believe the former president should be uh charged with you know from beginning to end the kinds of things that he did with the big lie which has so many offshoots um that that he did um you know trying to actually encourage finding thousands more votes that he knew were not his votes and intimidating uh people and legitimate people who were at the polls that kind of behavior is what people on television um not to mention throwing his lunch against the wall i guess that's not a crime congresswoman kelly uh only 19 percent of gop voters who believe trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election threatened american democracy that's according to a new poll from the new york times in siena college how concerning is it that these hearings don't seem to be moving the the the needle on republican voters well it's very disappointing as one that was um in the gallery on january 6 on my hands and knees is disappointing that uh more of them are not interested in what the truth is and uh keeping our democracy intact i mean it's just so important but you know people say a lot of different things uh during polls we'll see when they have to go to the poll and will they really support uh donald trump in 2024 uh if he does in fact decide to run uh so turning the discussion to uh to guns and reform there uh representative schakowsky you met with survivors of the highland park massacre yes uh today uh tell us what you heard from them i i met with highland park people today you know who are absolutely traumatized their children were with them their children are frightened and and will be for for a long time but they formed an organization oh in the last six days of hundreds of people that are determined to get a ban on assault weapons and i'm telling you these people are fierce they're not going away and that's why they're in washington right now and they're going to have a rally tomorrow governor jb pritzker and highland park mayor nancy rodering were at the white house yesterday privately urging president biden to push for a federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines here's what mayor roetring said after that meeting we in highland park banned assault weapons nine years ago but we need the rest of the country obviously to catch up with us the fact that guns in these shootings are legally obtained says that these laws need to be changed but most importantly weapons designed for combat need to be removed from the streets of the united states congresswoman kelly you were at the white house yesterday to mark the passage or the the signing of the safer communities act is reinstituting a ban on the high-capacity magazines and assault weapons is this a real possibility i think it is a real possibility so many people have been affected by gun violence period by gun violence with these um military weapons and as was said not only in highland park but in many other places people want to see us ban these and they want to see us raise the age of who can buy guns to 21. there's a lot of public sentiment you know out there and as jan said the highland park folks are traumatized and those kind of things imagine you know the people that live with it every single day you know in their blocks and their neighborhoods the young kids from some of those areas so um you know we're going to have a traumatized country and this is such an american problem it's just so so very sad and hopefully uh some of our colleagues uh on the other side will realize that and we'll want to do right especially for our children congressman christian murphy before we uh before we take a break here in the wake of the highland park july 4th parade uh shooting hundreds of activists as we just heard representative schakowsky mentioned hundreds are heading to dc um to push to march basically for change to push for an assault weapons ban this has been going on of course as we know since the sandy hook shooting what does it take to actually move the needle with with lawmakers is it calls is it letters marches and demonstrations i think it's all the above i think that there is a change um quite frankly i didn't i didn't think that we would arrive at a bipartisan package uh the other day that got signed into law but we did because there is a change that i sense among independents and republicans on this issue i personally think that we have to do what we have to do in the u.s house of representatives and pass this legislation it may get filibustered in the senate but then we have to create a carve out within the filibuster or eliminate the filibuster altogether to make sure that we have this gun legislation taken up for consideration in the senate it only takes two or three more votes to get an elimination of the filibuster or a carve out within the filibuster for gun rights for that matter reproductive freedom and voting rights and so that's what we need to go to the polls and convince people to hold people accountable to that pledge all right that's where we'll have to leave it for now uh we'll be joined again by congress members later in the program to discuss abortion access and funding in a post-row america for now thanks to representatives robin kelly raja krishnamoorthy and jan jakowski

chairman to the committee as a whole I think we there had earlier there were some discussion about the herd of congress and barton bring up the subjective of the yucca mountain it was some discussion well I'm so curious I've been reading about Yucca Mountain since the 80s I'm just one of two engineers in Congress to practice engineering 82 is when the act was put into effect in 87 is when Yucca Mountain was designated to be the repository 25 years later we're still talking about it is that is that what I'm hearing coming from the panel we're not sure what we're going to do with that um it's not the NRC's job to make policy we are a regulator but given that and given my past experience as a commissioner on the Blue Ribbon Commission I will say yes we are there is still discussion about Yucca Mountain and let me just say as a scientist you're an engineer and maybe in engineers you work faster than scientists but science often works very slowly but I think we work faster than 25 years I'm just curious how much money has been spent on yucca mountain in terms of infrastructure bricks and mortar what have we invested in that over these 25 years this again isn't as an issue that is not under the control or purview of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but I believe if you are looking just at what has been spent on yucca mountain itself and not on the entire waste disposal program you are looking at and figure between seven and eight billion dollars I'm sorry between seven and eight billion dollars I don't have the exact 18 billion dollars if the gentleman yield I think you can make some claims for 15 billion and the other thing just put this in perspective what the NRC needs to do is finish the scientific study a lot of the Yucca Mountain issue is do e and money spent in that in that venue the NRC is tasked to we hope eventually to finish the fun scientific study and then that would then be the final aspect of proving the viability for yucca they won't manage the site they're not there they're not going to be a power to do that I'm just trying to get a better handle of it up close this this glacial pace that we move around here is it is pretty incredible to think that 25 years later we still only have a place to deposit so so my question would be from you or your perspective given they're probably too two courses of action dealing with spent fuel run they're either going to go into a gina lynn geological formation below the ground someplace or we're going to recycle them as they do in France with arriba el a hug so can you tell me which is the more likely direction you see nuclear fuel rods going in in the in this country well again the NRC doesn't set that policy for the US the NRC regulates the reactors and materials i'm using as i understand you don't but I'm for your opinion you are the regulatory group on nuclear power I'm just right where do you think we're going as a nation after 25 years we if we can't decide it's going to be a yucca mountain well oxygen re goodness are we going to go just recycling which direction you think we should go as a nation no matter whether you go in direct disposal of spent fuel or you recycle as France does you will need a final repository and France itself has is working now on its final site selection for a deep geologic repository do you see us as a nation you see us in recycling ever I think it's largely an economic and policy question okay d it I don't think it comes under your purview but I believe under the under the Act in 82 that they set up that the consumers of using nuclear power would be assessed charges for the disposal yes the nuclear waste yes right how's it whoo man where's that money going if we don't have you you manage it Congress manages the money a nuclear waste fund and are you appropriating yeah I'm trying to understand here so we can have that turn back over to the consumer or is it being collected and just saved it's being it has been collected and saved into the nuclear waste fund and the consumers there sorry it's the rate payers who pay into this fund at one mil per kilowatt-hour gentleman's time is expired before I go to the gentlelady from Florida I last yeah its consent from my colleague mr. green for one minute mark

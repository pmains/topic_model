I can live to be a hundred and I will never forget what those their children 12 to 16 normally is what they're after you don't forget that and to think that this bill is even necessary that's pretty appalling that we have to have a bill to say by the way we don't want our government money in this country going to someone who's charged with sex trafficking or human trafficking but it is necessary and the reason is necessary is this President will not even go down to the border and talk to the people that we talk to I am glad that we have come back and we are trying to address this this could be so much easier if this Administration would look at this for what it is and truly have compassion and truly want something Humane happening we would be working on immigration policies right now instead of trying to save our money from going to people that have been charged with sex trafficking that's what would be happening it is just amazing the financial gains nothing is going to stop these people making billions of dollars other than to go down there and close the border

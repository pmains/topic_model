thank you very much I appreciate the recognition and I want to thank you all for being here today I've said many many times in this committee in fact maybe every time I've been in the committee with a joint group of VSOs that we need to take our cues from you and I believe that and I strongly believe that the dysfunction of this administration is now but over to the VA and I am very very very concerned ranking member walls talked about this committee has worked well together I can tell you that Johnny Isakson and I have worked hard together and we've worked for you we've taken our direction from you every step of the way and there's not been any Democrats or Republicans it's been about veterans 100% of the time unfortunately the dysfunction is hindering our ability to our job as Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and I won't speak for the house they can speak for themselves we have a caring for our veterans Act that Johnny and I worked on we were hoping to get it out by Veterans Day it's still not out yet now we need to move that bill so the final piece of a puzzle of a lot of legislation that you guys have advocated for that we've been able to do from accountability to taking care of the backlog - now redoing the community care piece of this program so this dysfunction administration has hindered our ability to move forward and I think it is jeopardizing the ability of the VA to serve you our nation's veterans so I would just say this is very disturbing to me because we send young men and women off to war and they come back changed some of those changes you can see some of them you can't but we have an obligation as of people to this country and we have an obligation to the next generation of fighting men and women to take care of you if we have changed you and so I believe the president really needs to decide whether he's going to empower secretary Shulkin to actually do his job or whether he's going to side with political interests something these committees never done political interests like the Koch brothers who by the way I do not believe understand what our nation's veterans are going through we need to know whose column shots I'm going to tell you what the stakes are high they've never been higher we've been at war for far too long we've got Vietnam vets that are getting older and older and need more and more health services we need to know as policymakers in the legislative branch who to hold accountable it's important it's important as we move forward it's important for this country Thank You mr. chairman

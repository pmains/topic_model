Thank You mr. speaker as a practicing obstetrician apologist for 25 years I certainly had a very unique perspective but many of the unique challenges faced by women in the workplace for many women I would see them once a year and in a very casual greeting ask him how they were and what was new and quite often or once a wild woman would have a new job and I would ask her wow you had a great job what why did you leave that and too often the answer was because of sexual harassment now as United States congressman I think it's important that I do more than just listen to these constituents of mine that I was sent here to be their voice to be a strong voice for all my constituents and especially to draw upon my experiences as an obstetrician and gynaecologist to be an advocate for women with my strongest and most unequivocal terms I can voice Mr Speaker I rise to condemn sexual harassment and assault and those cowards who perpetrate it mr. speaker I'm also here to salute those brave women who are speaking out about their past experiences here on Capitol Hill these women are the victims they should be treated as very courageous folks who are sharing their story to help protect others in doing so they're not only helping to identify another predator but they are helping the thousands of women who will come after them and work in these hallowed halls by bringing these dark disgusting secrets to light they make the workplace across America that much of a safer environment for all women something we must not stop working toward and something we must all take responsibility to foster in the plainest terms I want to make sure all men know that is unacceptable behavior to not allow your co-workers to perpetrate it and that those who assault or harass women should receive the harshest punishment there's no place in America for this behavior and we must all take responsibility for ensuring it has no place in our offices I'd offer up this advice it was given to me many years ago that old man every woman as they were your mother your sister or your daughter and let that be your Creed when you're choosing your words and your actions let us all take responsibility and use this incredible social moment to make a lasting impact for my daughter our granddaughters behind them and for future generations it's early starts with me in my office my sons my grandsons the people that work with me and the people I used to surround myself with we can all be that shining example and I pray that my colleagues will join me I'm making this so and with that Mr Speaker I yield back

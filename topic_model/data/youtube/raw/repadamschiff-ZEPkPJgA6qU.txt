E GOING TO FIND THEMSELVES UNDER OATH, ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY DID. JOINING US NOW IS CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, HE WAS A DEMOCRAT IN CALIFORNIA. HE'S A MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6TH INVESTIGATION. -- CONGRESSMAN, IT IS A REAL PLEASURE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME. >> GREAT TO SEE YOU. >> LET ME JUST ASK YOU IF THAT LAST POINT THAT I WAS MAKING, THAT LAST QUESTION I WAS RACING, IS THE RIGHT WAY TO LOOK AT THIS. WE KNOW THAT YOUR INVESTIGATION HAS REQUESTED VOLUNTARY INTERVIEWS FROM SOME REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THAT NONE OF THEM HAVE AGREED. DO YOU EXPECT THAT THE INVESTIGATION WILL COME TO ASCEND, WILL COME TO ITS CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT EVER SPEAKING WITH ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WHO APPARENTLY WERE VERY INVOLVED IN THE MACHINATIONS OF THIS PLOT. >> I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE WILL GET TO SPEAK WITH ALL OF THEM, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE WE WILL SPEAK WITH SOME OF THEM. AND CLEARLY, THEY DO HAVE VERY RELEVANT INFORMATION. BUT WHAT'S WE ARE WRESTLING WITH IS, WE CAN SUBPOENA THEM, BUT IF YOU SUBPOENA THEM, YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO FOLLOW THROUGH IF THEY REFUSED TO COMPLY. THAT WOULD MEAN WE WOULD REFER THEM FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IN ADDITION TO, OBVIOUSLY, WITH THAT WOULD DO IN TERMS OF RILING UP THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER, WILL THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GO THROUGH WITH IT? -- MORE SIMPLE CASES AND THEY HAVE YET TO ACT. THIS IS WHY WE ARE WRESTLING WITH. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, AS WITH SO MANY OF THESE WITNESSES, WE ARE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT, WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR NONCOOPERATION. WE ARE GETTING THE FACTS AND I KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. WE CAN PUT THAT INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND WE CAN -- >> ASIDE FROM THE PROSPECT OF A REFERRAL FOR CRIMINAL CONTEMPT PROSECUTION, DO YOU FEEL LIKE WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED THUS FAR MIGHT SUGGEST CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS? I'M THINKING ABOUT THESE REVELATIONS TODAY IN THIS REPORTING FROM CNN THAT WOULD INDICATE, IN THE WORDS OF ONE REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, THAT MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BELIEVED THAT TRUMP SHOULD DECLARE MARTIAL LAW JUST AHEAD OF THE INAUGURATION IN ORDER TO STAY IN POWER AND SHE TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO CONVEY THAT, THOSE ARE JENNINGS, AND TO CONVEY THAT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. THAT IS THE APPLICATION OF THE OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT BY FORCE. IT IS THEIR INDICATION, TO YOUR MIND, THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SHOULD BE FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT? >> I HAVEN'T REACHED A CONCLUSION ON THAT POINT, BUT I DO AGREE CERTAINLY WITH THE JUDGE IN CALIFORNIA, JUDGE CARTER, THAT THERE IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND OTHERS ENGAGED WITH VERY POSSIBLE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY TO OBSTRUCT CONGRESS, TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED STATES, TO ENGAGE IN CONSPIRACY. I THINK THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE OF CORRUPT INTENT. SOME OF THE REVELATIONS THAT THEY MENTIONED GO TO THE FACT THAT WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL WAS TELLING SOME OF THESE PLAYERS LIKE MARK MEADOWS THAT THIS IS ILLEGAL. AND IT IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTOOD THERE WAS VIOLENCE ON THAT DAY THAT WOULD BE USED TO -- THERE ARE, I THINK, VERY SUBSTANTIAL GROUPS OF EVIDENCE OF CRIMINALITY, WHETHER THOSE EXTEND TO CONGRESS, -- WE CONTINUE TO PUT THE FACTS TOGETHER AND LEARN NEW INFORMATION EVERY DAY. >> DO YOU THINK IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT WE ARE LEARNING FROM THESE RECENT DISCLOSURE IS THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AN ACTIVE EFFORT, A PLANNED EFFORT, NOT A SPONTANEOUS SURPRISE, THAT IT WASN'T A SPONTANEOUS SURPRISE, THAT THE CROWD THAT TRUMP HAD RALLIED AT THE ELLIPSE MOVED TO THE U.S. CAPITOL? OBVIOUSLY, WE HEARD TRUMP CALL FOR THAT DURING HIS SPEECH. THAT WAS PORTRAYED AS AN AD LIBBED A MOMENT, AS A SURPRISE, INCLUDING BY MARK MEADOWS WHEN HE WROTE HIS MEMOIR ABOUT THAT. WE ARE NOW SEEING EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS NOT A SURPRISE. IT WASN'T AD LIBBED. AND THERE WAS AT LEAST SOME PLANNING, BOTH INVOLVING THE WHITE HOUSE AND NEWEST MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, ABOUT THE DESIRABILITY OF GETTING THE CROWD TO CONVERGE ON THE CAPITOL BUILDING THAT DAY. IS THAT IMPORTANT? IT'S NOT JUST LOGISTICS OR'S THAT IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL ISSUE OF CULPABILITY HERE? >> I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT, TO THE DEGREE THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OR THE WHITE HOUSE OR THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAD AS A PART OF THEIR PLAN TO BRING THAT MOB INTO THE CAPITOL, THIS WAS A WAY TO BREAK INTO THE BUILDING, OF TRYING TO INTERRUPT, DISRUPT, THE JOINT SESSION GOING ON INSIDE. AND PARTICULARLY, IF THE MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WOULD BE THE PARTICIPATION OF THESE VIOLENT, RACIST WHITE NATIONALIST GROUPS, I THINK THAT RAISES THE CULPABILITY OF THOSE INVOLVED. I WOULD ALSO SAY, YOU ASKED WHETHER MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE -- ONE THING IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. AND THAT IS, THEY WERE VIOLATING THEIR OATH OF OFFICE. THEY WERE VIOLATING THEIR PLEDGE TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAD SUGGESTED THAT THE PRESIDENT USED MARTIAL LAW. I CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE FLAGRANT VIOLATION UNDER SWORN OATH TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION. SADLY, THAT'S NOT DISQUALIFYING. -- EVIDENTLY, WHAT THIS QUALIFIES YOU IN TODAY'S GOP IS IF YOU DO UPHOLD YOUR OATH AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO TELL THE TRUTH, THAT PUTS YOU ON A TRACK OUTSIDE OF MCCARTHY AND TRUMP'S GOP. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA, SITS ON THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE, CHAIR OF THE

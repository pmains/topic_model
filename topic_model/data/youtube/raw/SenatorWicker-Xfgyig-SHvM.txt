thank you madam chairwoman and Mr Washington uh sergeant major Washington thank you for being here I had a great deal of respect for your service uh with the United States military and I say that as a veteran who didn't do anything nearly what you were able to do as um as a command sergeant major you were nominated in July of uh 2022 is that correct yes Senator and and uh sergeant major I think it's fair to say that you would already be in office you would already be confirmed if there had not been serious bipartisan uh questions about your qualifications and your Fitness for office and it gives me no great pleasure to say that this is I've been chairman of this committee I've been ranking member of this committee and I've been on it for a long time this is what is going on with your nomination is not my idea of a good time but it's a it's a responsibility that I think we have at the time of your nomination you had uh had this CEO position at Denver for about a year um safety is the top priority of the FAA and and I think really on on the both ends of the diocese there have been serious questions about your expertise in that area and that's been pointed out in some of the questions um on your resume um at Denver you cite specifically uh success in construction a renovation program and facilities and and um in the implementation of a career pathway again I don't think that qualifies you uh for for this position uh and and in particular with what has been going on the last um the last few months um with regard to these near misses it's it's very very troubling um there's something though that that Senator Cruz said that I'm not sure I I agree with he said you might have been confirmed uh for the Amtrak board had you been nominated for that it and and that may be true but we would still have had to get better answers to these questions um about um investigations and about allegations that are still out there about public corruption um you have been involved in multiple corruption investigations accused of retaliating against a whistleblower that exposed this Corruptions the investigation relates to involvement with a series of no bid contracts awarded by LA Metro to a non-profit to operate sexual harassment hotline the investigation found that the hotline cost the taxpayers more than eight thousand dollars per call most of these calls were missed Downs or spam the non-profit awarded the contract was a close friend and campaign donor of an LA County supervisor the investigation is still pending and has been taken over just recently by the California Attorney General and in addition you have been accused of discriminating and retaliating Against The Whistleblower who received a 625 thousand dollar settlement uh I'm not sure for any position with those being um unresolved that that you would have been confirmed and again the this it gives me no pleasure to say this just days ago a lawsuit was filed by the Denver International Airport's former senior vice president of parking uh Benjamin Juarez who left his post um last year the lawsuit alleges discriminatory pay and Personnel practices at the airport um again you you um that you there was this matter that Senator Cruz mentioned uh about the search warrant including accusations of misconduct and um in in Seeking a record of your Communications and this has not yet been resolved as we meet today the California Attorney General's office is still conducting this public corruption investigation we need we need a very very qualified person in charge of the FAA and immediately and and for the life of me I do not understand why the president persists with this nominations with this nomination based on so many questions from the corruption aspect and also the qualification aspect and for for that reason I do think to bipartisan opposition will continue sir thank you madam chair

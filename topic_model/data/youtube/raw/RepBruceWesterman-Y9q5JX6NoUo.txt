thank you madam chair and ranking member I am Becky Keough secretary of the Arkansas Department of the Environment I bring greetings from the natural state and my from my governor your former colleague the Honorable ASA Hutchinson it is an honor to be here in Washington DC today appearing before the subcommittee as our state's Logan suggests in Arkansas we are incredibly concerned with the health beauty and safety of the waters of the United States in fact our governor has recently taken extraordinary steps of financial and regulatory to ensure the enduring beauty and quality of America's first national river the beautiful Buffalo by successfully negotiating a permanent closure and conservation easement conversion of a sixty five hundred plus hog operation near the river our governor noted that he believes in farming but that it must be balanced with efforts to preserve the Buffalo as a national treasure finding the balance between progress and preservation is a constant struggle for environmental regulators legislators and increasingly now more often federal judges that is one too many cooks in the kitchen I think we can all agree when judges are left to be legislators we have all failed the recent repeal of the 2015 clean water rule is the step in making sure we are all using the same cookbook and the same recipe prior to the recent repeal 22 states follow the 2015 rule while 27 did not and New Mexico was left unclear - which cookbook to use or even if it was able to cook at all now Arkansas was not subject to the 2015 year old that our bordering states of Tennessee and Oklahoma were yet we share similar ingredients the Mississippi River with Tennessee creating jurisdictional and Achaia wetland issues and Oklahoma where we share numerous interstate waters some tributaries of which may be currently jurisdictional in Oklahoma but not in Arkansas without a consistent definition of what is and what is not a water of the United States states are left to whip something up from scratch Arkansas and Oklahoma with our Cherokee national tribal partners are for the first time ever working together on an Illinois River Watershed Improvement Plan this basin-wide effort seeks to restore and protect the Illinois River by engaging stakeholders cities and industry to address historical issues while ensuring community and agricultural progress continues a common application Lotus will enabling bordering states to effectively manage shared water bodies but it is not only uniformity that we seek we also want a rule that is lucid ludicrous in its application the 2015 rule had brought opposition because of its in pot-stirrer terms perhaps unconstitutional reach the rule made it possible to regulate waters on private land that were invisible to the naked eye with no physical channel or evidence of water flow with the broad we will know a regulated water body when we see it reach of the rule routine activities such as home construction farming and infrastructure investment were stalled as the EPA and Corps function is more local zoning boards than federal regulators seeking relief from this ambiguity and overreach we turn up the heat pushing EPA in the courts for dramatic overhauls of this rule we sought respect for the integrity of state regulatory programs the removal of the rules wasteful federal duplication we don't always need that second helping we ask them to serve up a solution that abandoned the helicopter mom mentality and regulatory authorization and decision making in Arkansas specifically we needed a rule that supported critical expansion of our broadband and highway infrastructures welljust Supreme Court Justice Scalia set out a recipe for success in Rapanos versus United States when he instructed that the Clean Water Act apply only to waterways with relatively permanent surface water connections to navigable waters and last week administrator wheeler and assistant secretary James finalized these efforts to repeal the 2015 regulation clarifying that water bodies like the Buffalo River are subject to the Clean Water Act but our backyard petals are not limiting ingredients of the Clean Water Act and spelling out each step of a proper recipe proposed revisions also curtail states who set out to broadly apply section 401 of the Clean Water Act negatively impacting the economies of other states and perhaps in direct violation of the Commerce Clause they're getting a little bit more pot-stirring the proposals allow the states the flexibility of seasoning solution but prevents states with waterways from shouting shutting out neighboring states from entire markets and while we do not face these same water weight challenges Arkansas is a net exporter of natural gas and supportive a protective permitting program that reduces environmental risks while at the same time meets market response in critical use deeds this balance is accomplished in Arkansas through innovation technology and best management practices our secret ingredients forestry LED initiatives like streamside management zones proper logging road construction prescribed burn academies and unpaved roads and initiatives have contributed to Arkansas 92 percent adoption rate of forestry be in peace with resulting water quality protections and wildfire prevention well in closing I echo the words of ranking member a fellow engineer and a friend to Arkansas the Honorable Bruce Westerman in support of a new Otis rule and in support of a common cookbook with a workable recipe he reminds us that rolling back the 2015 rule ends years of uncertainty over where federal jurisdiction begins and ends for the first time we are clearly delineating the difference between federally protected and state protected wetlands thank you for your time and consideration

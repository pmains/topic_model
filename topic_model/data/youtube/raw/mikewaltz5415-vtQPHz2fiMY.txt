bringing in congressman mike waltz the republican from florida good morning to you congressman i mean you know i think peter said it all right there i was going to ask you what do you think is going to come out of the president's trip apparently not a whole lot yeah you know i i have to admit my bar is low uh at this point while he didn't obviously he doesn't have the deliverables that one would expect from the president's first middle east trip i'm also looking at what didn't happen he didn't exactly roll out the red carpet for the palestinians there were no i i guess kind of fatal gaffes so to speak from a policy perspective and he didn't take the military option off the table like he did uh with russia so yeah i i'd give it a i give it a c at this point and this relationship with saudi arabia i know it's always been complicated but you know he he describes saudi saudi arabia as a pariah state when he was on the campaign uh for president back in 2020 now he's going there to try and make nice they say he's not going to ask them to pump more oil but it seems a very interesting and scattered strategy to me but look the moment air force one lands on saudi soil the saudis have won the entire region has gotten the signal that the president is there hat in hand i don't care how they try to spin it and what is so incredible to me is them rather than take on the progressives uh here at home and actually move us back to energy independence which we've absolutely demonstrated uh we can and should do he's going to go hat in hand to the saudis to beg them to to pump more and they're not even going to announce it while he's there and meanwhile they're still reaching out to iran venezuela like let's defund dictatorships uh let's not pour uh more more of our funds uh and to embolden them and let's get back to energy independence i just it just befuddles me that we won't go there and then finally we remember just a few years ago the saudis were colluding with the russians to drop oil prices to knock out our energy production and to knock out our fracking industry they weren't successful but now we have the president over there basically asking them to do that because he wants to knock out our fracking and our energy independence it's it's just asinine you couldn't make it up you really couldn't congressman mike waltz of florida congressman thanks for joining us on this friday

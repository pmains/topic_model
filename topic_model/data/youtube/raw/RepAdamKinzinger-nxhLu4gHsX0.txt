  ASIA. >> THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO  IT YET ON UKRAINE. KAITLAN COLLINS, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. >>> ADAM KINZINGER IS IN  ILLINOIS. THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME FOR  US. >> YOU BET. >> IN EFFECT DOES THE U.S. NOW  HAVE A NEW TAIWAN POLICY WHICH  IS TO SAY IT WILL DEFEND TAIWAN  MILITARILY IF CHINA WERE TO  INVADE? IS THAT THE REALITY? >> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A  NEW POLICY. HERE'S THE INTERESTING THING  WHEN YOU GET INTO THIS KIND OF  INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY IS KIND  OF THE UNSPOKEN THING IS THE  INTENTION IS TO DEFEND TAIWAN. THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S KEPT  TAIWAN FROM HAVING TO FACE CHINA DIRECTLY. CHINA SETS UP MOCK INVASIONS OF  TAIWAN, THERE IS A FIGHT OVER  THE STRAIT, IT'S JUST A CONSTANT BACK AND FORTH. THE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT  EVERYBODY REALLY IS THINKING  WHICH IS, OF COURSE, THE UNITED  STATES WOULD INTEND TO DEFEND  TAIWAN MILITARILY, WHETHER  THAT'S DIRECT ACTION OR EVEN  JUST SENDING AID, BUT IT'S THE  SPEED, THE BREAKNECK SPEED AT  WHICH HIS AIDES WALK BACK WHAT  HE SAID. IT'S SIMILAR TO WHEN HE WAS  SAYING ABOUT VLADAMIR PUTIN KIND OF OFF THE CUFF, THIS GUY CAN'T  REMAIN IN POWER. IF I WAS PRESIDENT AND PEOPLE  DID THAT TO ME, THEY WOULDN'T  HAVE A JOB ANYMORE FOR SURE. >> LET ME ASK YOU, FOR BOTH  RUSSIA AND CHINA, SHOULD THE  U.S. BE EXPLICIT TO SAY, YOU  INVADE UKRAINE AGAIN, WE WILL  SEND U.S. FORCES. YOU INVADE TAIWAN, CHINA, WE  WILL SEND U.S. FORCES. SHOULD THE U.S. STATE THAT OUT  LOUD EXPLICITLY? >> LOOK, I THINK THERE IS  BENEFIT IN PUTTING OUT SOMETIMES IN PUBLIC WHAT YOUR RED LINE IS. SO WITH UKRAINE, FOR INSTANCE, I THINK THERE IS REALLY BENEFIT IN SAYING, IF RUSSIA USES NUCLEAR,  BIOLOGICAL OR CHEMICAL WEAPONS  ON UKRAINE, THAT WILL LEAD TO A  NATO REACTION, BECAUSE THAT'S  SOMETHING THAT'S FAR BROADER  THAN JUST UKRAINE. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT  SPREADS AROUND THE WORLD, NOT TO MENTION, BY THE WAY, RUSSIA'S  BLOCKADE OF UKRANIAN PORTS WHICH IS GOING TO CREATE REAL  STARVATION ISSUES AROUND THE  WORLD. AND I THINK WITH TAIWAN, YOU  HAVE TO BE A LITTLE GINGER ON  TAIWAN, OBVIOUSLY, BUT I THINK  WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY, WE HAVE THE  ABILITY AND THE WILL TO DEFEND  TAIWAN IF CHINA ATTACKS. LOOK, JIM, IF WE LEAVE THIS KIND OF IDEA THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT  GOING TO DO ANYTHING AND WE'LL  JUST KIND OF ROLL OVER, THIS IS  A LESSON WE'VE FORGOTTEN. WEAKNESS INVITES THINGS LIKE  THIS. STRENGTH HAS THE BEST SHOT AT  PREVENTING WAR IN THE FIRST  PLACE. WE SEE THAT IN UKRAINE AND I  THINK THAT SAME SITUATION EXISTS IN TAIWAN. >>> "THE GUARDIAN" NEWSPAPER IS  SAYING THE COMMITTEE WILL HOLD  SIX PUBLIC HEARINGS IN JUNE. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PLANNED  SCHEDULE OF THESE HEARINGS, HOW  MANY AND OVER WHAT TIME? >> I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF  WHAT THE COMMITTEE IS SAYING. LET ME SAY THIS. OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO BE IN  JUNE AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT  A GOOD CASE FOR THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. IF I COULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO  WATCH THESE THINGS, MAKE YOUR  DECISION, LOOK AT THE STORY FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF  EVERY ASPECT OF JANUARY 6. WE MAY WANT TO, QUOTE, UNQUOTE,  MOVE ON AND MOVE FORWARD, BUT  OUR DEMOCRACY WAS THREATENED  THAT DAY, JIM, AND WHAT BOTHERS  ME IS I THINK WE'RE ALMOST IN A  WORSE SITUATION THAN WE WERE  EVEN A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHEN  I SEE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT STILL PRETEND LIKE IT NEVER  HAPPENED, THAT ACT LIKE YOU CAN  JUST, THROUGH THE WILL OF A  STATE LEGISLATURE, OVERTHROW A  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. DEMOCRACY DOESN'T SURVIVE UNDER  THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. ALL THESE THINGS WE HAVE A  LUXURY TO TALK ABOUT, HELPING  UKRAINE DEFEND ITSELF, ET  CETERA, DOES NOT HELP IF WE  CAN'T SAVE OUR OWN DEMOCRACY  HERE AT HOME. >> HAS THIS BEEN CRITICIZED BY  OUR OWN PRESIDENT? >> ANYTHING THAT'S CRIMINAL OR  NOT CRIMINAL, THAT WILL BE A  QUESTION FOR THE DOJ. WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN FRONT OF  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVERYTHING  WE KNOW, AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL MAKE THOSE  DECISIONS. >> WE SEE A REMARKABLE THING  HERE WHERE HIS ENDORSED  CANDIDATES, BUT, AGAIN, DONALD  TRUMP'S CONTINUED LIES. IF IT WAS PENCE RUNNING, WOULD  YOU SUPPORT HIM? >> IF IT WAS PENCE AGAINST  TRUMP, SURE. I'M PROUD OF WHAT PENCE DID  REGARDING JANUARY 6. HE'S BEEN QUIET UNTIL RECENTLY. FOR EVERY PUBLICLY ELECTED  OFFICIAL, WHETHER YOU'RE A  COUNTY BOARD MEMBER, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP NOW, BECAUSE I TELL  YOU, EVERY DAY THAT YOU'RE SIGH   -- SILENT, YOUR PEOPLE THAT  FOLLOW YOU BELIEVE THE ELECTION  WAS STOLEN, THEY BELIEVE THE  DEMOCRACY DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM. FOLLOW THROUGH ON YOUR OATH OR  YOU'LL BE ASHAMED OF WHAT YOU  DID IN OFFICE IN FIVE OR TEN  YEARS, AND FRANKLY, I HAVE NO  SYMPATHY WHEN YOU ARE. >> YOU'VE BEEN TOUGH ON CHINA  FOR ITS TRADE VIOLATIONS. THE PRESIDENT IS NOW SAYING HE'S THINKING OF CUTTING TARIFFS ON  CHINA GOODS. IS NOW THE TIME TO DO SO? >> I THINK THAT'S A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE COME TO  EVOLVE ON IN THE LAST TEN YEARS  IN CONGRESS IS WE DO HAVE TO  DEFEND OURSELVES BETTER AGAINST  CHINA IN THE TRADE AREA. I THINK TO SOME EXTENT WE HAVE  TO KEEP THESE TARIFFS IN PLACE. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE THAT THE  PRIOR ADMINISTRATION DID WAS  PUTTING TARIFFS ON OUR FRIENDS  IN EUROPE, FOR INSTANCE. WE NEED TO BE, IN ESSENCE,  FIGHTING THIS GLOBAL TRADE WAR  WITH OUR FRIENDS. I'LL EVALUATE EXACTLY WHAT THE  ADMINISTRATION IS TALKING ABOUT, BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME JUST  BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA, WHICH IS  MASSIVE. IT'S NOT THE TIME TO FORGET THAT OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGIC  COMPETITOR IS NOT RUSSIA. THEY'RE A FAILING COUNTRY. IT'S CHI

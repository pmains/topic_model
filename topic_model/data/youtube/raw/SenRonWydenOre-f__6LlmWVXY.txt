thank you sir white for letting me Thank You mr. chairman Thank You mr. secretary it's been a long morning and I've tried to listen carefully on this comprehensive tax reform issue and and see if you can sort a little bit of this out for me if you will you mentioned three times that we ought to have comprehensive tax reform that's a good good thing and yet when you look at the budget its corporate reform is in effect going to come now that's what's been announced and individual reform would come sometime later so corporate reform isn't comprehensive it's in effect you know piecemeal and if you would start with me in terms of how your view would get the country to comprehensive tax reform because we both agree that's what's needed and there's bipartisan support for it a good question and you're right to say that uh why not do it all at once and I think realistically that's how it's going to happen but what we're saying is that we want to provide a little bit more detail in jerz a framework for core elements of corporate at this stage you think that's the best way to start to get the debate going I think you're right that ultimately and maybe these things have to happen together you can't do corporate had a vintage lots of good reasons for that you've spoken a lot about that and you've been a big champion of comprehensive reform but part of what we're trying to do is to get people to think about a comprehensive approach to improving incentives for investment United States we think one way to do that is to try to get discussion earlier on how to redesign the corporate tax system to support that objective but I understand your point that ultimately these things have to go together let me ask one other point and then kind of get a sense of what will come come next you you also talked about I think the way you described it we're foundational principles the foundational principles in 86 I think still have a lot of support up here in the Congress bipartisan support the idea was to cut breaks on business and individuals keep a simpler code for both individuals in business and retain progressivity what I'm concerned about is that if we're not careful we could end up with a different foundation in effect you would see changes on the business side you've correctly described you're going to clean out these business breaks in order to have the corporate side and we could end up with more complexity as as well so like the last question how do you see us getting to the foundational principles as you you describe that are so key and keeping within that 86 approach with how we're going along the lines you've described those are the right principles we would very much support those in general you want to clean up and eliminate reduce scale back a bunch of the special preferences tax expenditures across the tax code use those to make affordable a reduction in the overall marginal tax rates preserve a basic level of productivity for obvious reasons and leave yourself a system it's more simple more efficient better for growth easier for people to comply with those are the constraints we should all live within this context and I don't think we're going to put those at risk by showing we shown a lot of elements of what we think should guide the individual discussion even though we have another comprehensive proposal we're going to provide a comparable level of additional elements for think we should guide to corporate poseable but will be guided by the nice way you framed the core objectives parameters the only point I making in terms of summing up the key in 1986 was of course the presidential bully pulpit and that the executive branch every single time out talked about how you had to fit the pieces you know together I'm glad you said what you did that you know in the end it's probably all going to have to come together but we've got to get that message about two hours you know earlier because we've been sitting here you know for two hours and hashing through all of the specifics in terms of corporate reform and how you'd clean it out and what would go first and the like and absent somebody particularly at 1600 Pennsylvania with all of you that are out and about you know the country it's going to be very hard to build it here I think we've got a lot to work with chairman Baucus chairman camp clearly want to move in this in this direction but two hours in we finally got to the key point which is we're gonna have to bring this together have to bring it together around 86 principles and I hope you and everyone in the administration will start using that bully pulpit because that was the key in 86 I agree that and I think you made the point right i mean i can I just say one thing mr. chairman on this episode you know this very well senator better than I do our challenge here is much greater than it wasn't 86 because the scale of fiscal problems are much greater and we don't have the luxury of offering people a substantial neck tax cut to individuals or do something that doesn't raise revenues overall so we can contribute to deficit like we don't have that luxury now and we don't have the ability even with all the unpleasant features of our tax code today it is a in many ways a cleaner less well I want I guess I don't really want to go there and sec I don't want to call this look at them cleaner another thing I was gonna make a point which is that in the 86 act as you know it was possible at that point to provide individuals at least at the first stage of that reform a very substantial net tax cut now President Reagan to his credit two years later took back about two-thirds of that tax cut because it proved unsustainable unaffordable and the country today even though there's a lot of support for the president's proposals we face a i think a much more difficult political environment in the current context but I completely support you on the principles these are going to have happen together we recognize that and I agree you also that when Congress is ready to move on this we're gonna have to get to looking at a much more comprehensive framework of reform thing this term Thank You senator Sarah through

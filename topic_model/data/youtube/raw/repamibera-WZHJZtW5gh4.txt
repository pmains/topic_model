chairman my amendment is it it would require the government accountable ability office a non-partisan government watchdog to complete a report on the impact this legislation would have on public health I look at this from the perspective as a doctor in public health expert and one of my guiding principles as the doctor is to make sure we protect the public health coal refuse plants not only increase the amount of pollution in our air they also use a power source which is less efficient than normal coal and contains higher levels of mercury exposure to sulfur dioxide and other pollutants such as mercury have been known to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and respiratory illnesses including aggravated asthma bronchitis and heart attacks my amendment would require the GAO to investigate whether this legislation would increase emissions of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants I strongly believe the EPA plays an important role in protecting the health of our families in our environment from dangerous pollutants while we should be mindful about the impact of regulations on our economy we have a responsibility to address urgent threats to the planet such as climate change and we have a responsibility to make sure legislation that's being passed protects our public health this legislation before us today would hamper the EPA's ability to limit dangerous pollution and protect public health and it will also slow down our transition to clean energy that's why I introduced my amendment today to ensure that we know the true impact this bill would have on public health and on our environment Thank You mr. chairman I'll reserve the balance of mine

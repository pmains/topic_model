thank you um Mr ship I wanted to ask you another question if you would consider another friendly Amendment after anti-Semitism uh comma anti-christian bigotry and bigotry against all faiths I would uh say the gentleman that uh uh I would be happy to accept an amendment that also refers to domestic terrorism motivated ball forms of bigotry including that against members of any faith I don't think we need to single out one faith and preference to another but I would be happy to accept a modification of your Amendment so are you deleting anti-Semitism and saying all faiths then I'm not deleting anti-Semitism because that has been a unique Scourge which is on the rise but as I said unless you want to add anti-muslim faith and and other religious faiths I don't think we should single out one to the preference of others well I certainly am aware of a number of church shootings there are some I'm aware of shootings of involving Sikhs and and some mosques but the number of church shootings exceeds those of shootings at other religious facilities and so I would just think that it would be important to send a message that anyone who Harbors a bigotry against Christians because of their faith is every much every bit as condemned and repugnant to those members of Congress as any other Faith well I I agree it is as repugnant as crimes against other faiths and I would be happy as I said to accept a friendly amendment that includes all faiths if that is the gentleman's intent I'm happy to accept it okay

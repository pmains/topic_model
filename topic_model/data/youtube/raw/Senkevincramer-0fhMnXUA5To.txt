thank you Mr chairman thank you chairman Powell for being here and I can't resist responding to a few things that um my friends on the left have said for example in his opening statement chairman Brown had a long list of things that raising interest rates won't do interest rates interest raising interest rates won't fill in the blank I'm going to fill in the blank with a couple things how about raising interest rates won't stop Senate Democrats and President Biden from over taxing overspending over borrowing over regulating chairman Brown said we should rebuild our supply chain by curbing offshoring corporate offshore I agree he talked a lot about corporate greed contributing to inflation okay but how about regulatory greed contributing to corporate greed how do you expect corporations to reinvest money if you over regulate their ability to invest that money right here in the United States of America you want to onshore some things how about energy policy how about instead of looking to Venezuela or Iran for oil supply or Russia or rather than looking to China for electric vehicles and chips and and solar panels how about we have a strategy that onshores those things by reducing regulation reducing taxes and letting those corporations reinvest their profits rather than than you know stock BuyBacks or or dividends this idea that somehow the Federal Reserve is supposed to keep inflation in check while half of the government works against it is mind-boggling now I know Mr chairman you don't like to comment on policy you and I went round and round about this you were anxious to to advise us to spend lots of money during the pandemic I don't think a lot of people blame me for that you wouldn't respond to to um efforts by the Biden Administration after we're in a robust recovery from not spending so much money okay I can appreciate the change but now we're in this debate between Republicans and Democrats between particularly the house speaker and the president on how to raise the debt ceiling and you've made some pretty strong comments about raising the debt ceiling absent from structural reforms that would actually help us get back to a reasonable growth and so I I just I warn you again if you're going to make political comments if you're gonna if you're gonna advise us on policy be consistent with it now I want to get back to The Greening of the Federal Reserve and this these I call them stress tests you can come whatever we call them but I'm concerned that now the Federal Reserve is starting down this path maybe it's slightly at first uh about about climate stress testing I just want to ask you this if we're going to go down that path if the Federal Reserve is now going to become part of the federal climate police force are we going to consider the ramifications of having entire communities and economies factories and manufacturers um you know whatever energy entities um large server Farms leaving them susceptible to a very unreliable very expensive energy source is that part of the stress test no that those are considerations for elected people not for us we have a we have a narrow narrow role to play here but it's a real role and I can talk about that if you'd like well yeah I would like you to because again if we're gonna if we're gonna start doing stress tests for the six largest financial institutions related to climate which really is more weather than climate then are we going to consider the effects of of uh an unreliable energy source at several locations throughout our country so our only focus is on the safety and soundness of these institutions and do they understand and can they manage all of the risks that they that they run in their business model that's that's our our only goal we're not we're again we're not looking to be climate policy makers climate policy is clearly going to have effects on regions on companies on individuals on countries disparate effects and you know that is not for that is not for unelected people like us who have a narrow mandate but I think it does touch climate and your your right to be concerned that we you know that we find ourselves on a slippery slope but honestly I I think the climate scenarios are something that the banks are already doing uh and themselves and and uh the climate guidance is something that that they're looking for they want to know how we're thinking about this but we we we will try really hard not to get on a slippery slope and find ourselves becoming climate policy makers it's just not appropriate for an independent agency okay and I completely agree and I hope you stick to that and I think Yoda can you know ask the banks to consider what the overreaction might you know what kind of vulnerabilities that might expose with that I just with regard to what Senator Warren was saying on her monologue one thing about ideologues they have the luxury of binary choices you have a really big job and and you have a single in my mind one and a half maybe two two um missions um I think the first one handles the second one okay but it's got to be tough when the White House is working against you and you don't have to comment thank you thank you Mr chairman

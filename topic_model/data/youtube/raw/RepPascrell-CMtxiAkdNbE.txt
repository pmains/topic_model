mr. Pascrell Thank You mrs. secretary you've had a splendid reputation for listening in your job but this is not business this is government very different so welcome to the combat zone I have a couple of questions you know we've hurt hungry families in the proposed budget which cuts that budget by joining the SNAP program by two hundred and fourteen billion there is a relationship between nutrition and health and I don't have to go into those specific details and then the rest of the budget cuts at one point four trillion dollars for Medicaid which is the very basis of any States helping opioid victims and trying to prevent it in trying to respond to those it eliminates and cut spending in Medicare by four hundred and ninety four billion so good luck to you you have to defend this stuff but from your reputation you could rise above this I hope that happens I want to talk about the hiv/aids program it's very close to me for thirty years of my life working with people who at first no one wanted to work with and secondly to get the federal government to understand its responsibilities this administration I personally believe has abandoned people living with HIV it wasn't enough that the President had to shut down the presidential Advisory Council on hiv/aids and closed the White House Office of National AIDS policy but it's also attempting to gut funding for HIV prevention cure and treatment this budget could close the door in the face of all progress that has been made under Democratic and Republican presidents to curb this horrible disease both here in America abroad and turned the clock back to the 1980s we don't want that to happen I know you don't so mr. secretary please explain the rationale behind the domestic cuts the hiv/aids funding and specifically the 43 million dollars in cuts to the Ryan White program mr. secretary so congressman um the the Ryan White we strongly support the Ryan White program and have kept it's a very large program and I can't remember the exact numbers on where it's come out but it has our the Ryan White hiv/aids program has our full support and backing as do as do so many of the initiatives radiation these cuts um so we've got this what your being in that post and then we have in PEPFAR continued support abroad on hiv/aids so I'd love to work with you to I want to make sure to understand across the board as the chairman mentioned I'm still getting into the details of so many of our programs and where they stand Colonel I point visit I point being mr. secretary I'm interested in what you're for I'm interested in how you will fight these cuts because you have a bigger responsibility than the President of the United States and dealing with those people afflicted and those people who might be afflicted thank nice Pascrell times

which German here we go again in a bipartisan tradition we are here on a budget that is little more than a messaging document for the majority party to amplify on senator Kane's remarks they're actually about 40 seats in this room and they're now one two three four five six seven people sitting in them there's the world's smallest press table over there with the world's most bored press corps reporting on the world's most useless hearing and we've gotten ourselves into this pickle on our own this budget has no hope of passing the House which makes this year's markup especially insignificant tomorrow we'll be voting on meaningless deficit-neutral reserve fund amendments sort of glorified sense of the Senate statements and then we have a party-line vote and the majority will pass its resolution it's Groundhog Day and it's useless now I strongly oppose the policies that are reflected in the majority's budget I think they are a disaster and a disgrace to be blunt but I'm really concerned as I think all of us should be in a bipartisan fashion about how broken our budget process has become there's virtually no chance that both chambers will agree to a common budget resolution this year even if they did the budget resolution would have little force or effect as a concurrent resolution the congressional budget does not raise the statutory spending caps so we'll need a separate deal on spending caps for the appropriators to do their work the budget resolution doesn't raise the debt limit I've spoken about the debt limit before the debt limit is like having a bear trap in your bedroom if you're lucky you will not step in it but with one stupid misstep you're in for a hell of an injury the budget process does nothing to neutralize that threat last year senator Perdue and I served on the Joint Select Committee on budget and appropriations process reform we worked for nearly a year with 14 bipartisan and bicameral members on proposal to improve the Congressional budget process and to give the Senate Budget Committee a more meaningful role one idea which did well in that committee is to establish an optional off-ramp in this budget committee for a bipartisan budget create a process so that if we could agree on a bipartisan budget there's a path for it we don't even have that this is partisan in many respects by virtue of the rules and habits of this committee we can fix that maybe we can't get a good bipartisan budget but we damn well ought to give it a try and we ought to have a mechanism for doing that so I'll speak more about that when I relate tomorrow when I do my amendment to do a deficit-neutral reserve fund on the budget process there were congressional politics that interrupted the work of that Joint Select Committee but I'm working with senator Perdue and my co-sponsor senator blunt on legislation that I hope will be considered by the Senate Budget Committee to explore a variety of reforms including a hearing on the Joint Select Committee's work I want to take a minute and give a congratulation to chairman Enzi who in addition to being a particularly gracious and kind and good colleague is also a fellow advocate for reform of the budget committee and I think there are lots of ways in which we can work together to try to make this a meaningful exercise again there is no better signal that this doesn't matter than the fact that nobody shows up for it as Senator Kaine pointed out so this markup is an exercise in political messaging sadly and were unfortunately sending out I think of terrible message about blowing up the national debt with one point nine trillion dollars in tax cuts most of which is for very wealthy people big corporations and foreign investors thanks a bunch and now we're facing the usual talk about deficit reduction through spending cuts and through attacks on Medicare and Medicaid the budget expressly protects billions of dollars of tax cuts for the likes of the Koch brothers while calling for 551 billion in cuts to programs for low and middle income Americans this is like Robin Hood in Reverse and it's plenty of reason to oppose this particular budget but let's set all of that aside because none of it actually matters in the long run we can exchange our usual Barb's during the week ahead we also have the prospect of turning this committee into one that does real work and if we're gonna do that what we're gonna need to do is not just talk about appropriated spending but talk about tax spending talk about healthcare spending and talk about revenues because you don't even get to your budget arithmetic alee if you're not looking at those constituent parts of it we've got to figure out what a suitable debt to GDP ratio looks like a sustainable debt to GDP ratio we got to figure out how long it takes to get from where we are to there and we got to set some glide slopes some alarms some barriers to guide us on the path from the unsustainable position we're in now to a sustainable GDP to debt ratio I suspect if we did that work before we got to the sustainable debt to GDP ratio markets and the world would be happy with us because for once we'd actually be taking our role here seriously and working in the arithmetic aliy necessary way to get to a sustainable budget I think we can do this mr. chairman you have been a terrific ally in trying to do this and I look forward to working with you to get this fixed if not we should just jettison this stupid committee [Music]

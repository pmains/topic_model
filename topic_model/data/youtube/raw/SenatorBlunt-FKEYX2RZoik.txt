i'm pleased to be here today madam president to talk about the 2021 appropriations bill that we filed this week for labor for health and human services and for education obviously with what we've gone through this year those three agencies have all experienced dramatic challenges the labor challenges the health challenges the education challenges and while this bill would not specifically be a coveted relief bill it's a bill that ful that funds these agencies so they can move forward with their normal work uh rather than have to in some piecemeal way try to deal with their normal work uh while they're trying to work with us on the extraordinary circumstances of of the covet bill uh it's the largest bill labor h and education is the largest non-defense bill on the discretionary side of the agenda it's about 30 percent of all the money left when the defense appropriation is taken off the table there are 11 bills left at that point but this bill has about 30 percent of all the money it has a lot of competing priorities from apprenticeships to biomedical research to public health and preparedness programs to child care and special education national service community service are all in this bill we received 8 352 requests from senators of things they'd like to see in the the bill and um they're not all in there but we did all we could to take the money we had and move forward with priorities that make sense i'm disappointed at this point that our democratic colleagues on the appropriations committee were unable to support the bill right now but we've worked together in the past i hope we can continue to work together to find a way forward and frankly my view is if appropriations bills appear to have a path to the president's desk that is the thing that brings us together most quickly this bill continues in our sixth year of commitment to robustly and consistently funding medical research at the national institute of health we provide a two billion dollar increase on that research we target funding toward alzheimer's toward precision medicine premature birth research the brain initiative and at my time as chairman we've actually increased nih funding by 45 percent in budgets that often had virtually no increase at all so we've truly had to work together to prioritize we've done that my time as chairman's about six years if you're wondering how long it took us to get that 45 percent increase uh but six years ago we hadn't had any increase for 12 years uh and nih uh was about 22 behind in buying power where they'd been a decade earlier so we've made up that 22 percent and actually now putting real money on the table in an environment that's never been better and never been more promising in the nih research area we continue our focus of combating opioids between 1999 and 2018. nearly 450 000 people in the united states died from opioid overdose these drug overdose deaths in 2018 was four times higher than in 1999. the bill provides money to deal with this we saw with the effort we've made in this area over the last several years a consistent decrease in opioid overdoses until 2020 and of course the increase in 2020 in many ways related to the pandemic and the isolation the support structure that appeared to be working to get you move you from dependency no longer there and suddenly you're back where you were the bill provides a 20 million dollar increase for apprenticeship programs this week i joined the missouri chamber of commerce in highlighting the importance of apprenticeships last year missouri was the second in the nation in the number of new apprenticeships uh first in the nation is california and we're not a small state but we're not nearly nearly as big as california so i think the leadership in our state of the business community the employers the governor and others has made a real difference there we fund both registered apprenticeship programs and allows for industry recognized programs as well fourth the bill invest in education from early childhood through college and career it increases funding for high quality child care education by 150 million dollars it increases funding for elementary and secondary education programs that provide the most flexibility to school districts on how to best use those limited resources this also includes increased investments in title one in idea the individuals with disability education act the title for student support and academic enrichment grants charter schools and impact aid it increases the maximum pell grant by another 150 dollars a 2.4 increase at a time when the mandatory money is gone so to find that two four point four percent increase we have to find that in other programs and some programs just not able to fund and if they're not working we shouldn't fund them and we've seen several years of growth in areas where we have a priority like pell grants and to do that we had to look carefully at programs that just frankly weren't working a fifth we continue our focus on closing the care gap between mental health and physical health approximately one in five adults in america has a diagnosable and almost always treatable mental health problem this bill provides money an increase of almost 200 million dollars in the mental health area i'd mention again the excellence in mental health pilot we've increased that pilot from eight states to two we're seeing what happens uh in a positive way in people's other health issues when you deal with their mental health issue like it was any health issue and it's making a difference this year was reinforced again by understanding the need to address disparities in foster care greater diversity in health care education and the workforce many populations across the country whether defined by race as ethnicity geography experience higher rates of certain diseases and often lack access access to health services this bill tries to look at that in a way that analyzes where those gaps are and has programs that encourage filling those gaps further more the bill continues our efforts to ensure these disparities are addressed through a number of programs including workforce development programs uh diverse medical community efforts research initiatives focus on underserved communities uh programs that target health disparities and education workforce programs that create opportunity so madam president this bill prioritizes programs that provide the most benefit and greatest return for all americans the bill continues key program integrity activities aimed at reducing waste fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars these initiatives have proven to be a worthwhile investment returning billions of dollars to the treasury and allowing us to look other places as to how we can fund that money in programs that work better and work more transparently this bill eliminates eight programs equally nearly 115 million dollars in spending reductions by focusing on programs that are the most efficient and cost effective with proven outcomes we all know that budgets are tight but making careful choices about health spending can be one of the most valuable investments we make as a congress and in the congress you don't have to look any further than the recent announcements of announcements about the record progress we've made finding a vaccine for covet 19. through the cares act and other legislation congress provided 18 billion dollars for research into therapeutics and vaccines 12 and a half billion of those dollars uh went to vaccines and did it in a way that's going to allow us to set a record in having a safe vaccine available that meets the highest standards the vaccine that appears to be first in the line for approval is 90 effective now i'm not an expert in vaccines so my first thought would be well i want a vaccine that's 100 percent effective as it turns out no vaccines 100 effective the measles vaccine that school kids took for years and most still take is 90 percent effective health care experts nine months ago said if we could have a vaccine that was 50 percent effective we should approve that vaccine and every other one that was at least 50 percent effective we're looking at vaccines that are going to help us move beyond this as we look at tests that help us move beyond this but the fundamental uh foundation of all that is in the the health care framework that we maintain you can't look at a pandemic and say now it's time to think about how we do do important health research you can't look at a pandemic and say now it's time to think about how we think about having care providers in underserved areas you can't look at a pandemic and say now it's time we begin to think about how you connect child care and work and school all together this bill does as much of that as we could figure out how to do in the best way we could figure out how to do it i hope the congress can pass it it would be a great gift to the next congress and the administration after january 20 to be able to start next year with next year's work rather than having to start next year with this year's work let's get this year's work done let's get it done now and let's send a bill to the president that the house incentive agreed on and let's get back to looking at these bills in the right way at the right time so with that adam president i would yield the floor

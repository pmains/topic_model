collins a purple heart recipient who served for more than two decades he's running in florida plus pat harrigan a west point grad with two bronze stars and christian costelli whose service included five tours in afghanistan both are running in north carolina it's a whole lot of dudes on our screen right now i love it warriors green berets it's great to see all of you congressman let me start with you uh you know crenshaw has enlisted a lot of navy seals navy seals get a lot of the headlines it's time for the quiet professionals tell me why it's important that green berets be sent to congress yeah hey thanks so much pete and number one i need reinforcements up here uh but number two look in the wake of afghanistan and that debacle ukraine and what's going on iran and north korea marching towards a bomb still the threat of global terrorism and china is our greatest adversary we need members of congress who understand how to hold the pentagon accountable how to hold the the uh administration uh accountable but more importantly it's the ethos that they bring leadership teamwork followership discipline uh and look pete if we're all willing to die for that flag we'll roll up our sleeves and take the tough votes so 2022 is going to be the year of the gop uh veteran uh if you want to support these guys go to gop frontlinepatriots.com and most importantly we can't let the seals hog the spotlight we need some true quiet professionals in there to get the job done i knew you'd get that in for sure uh it's let me say this you're exactly right there's nothing like watching a vet or someone who's worn the uniform ask questions of folks in the pentagon they're not used to those types of questions let me go around the horn with the question of why why you're running and what you hope to do in washington dc derek anderson let me start with you hey thanks again pete for having me you know uh the catalyst for me to run for office and specifically in virginia's seventh congressional district my home my home district i was watching the botched withdrawal in afghanistan you know i lost five of my guys two of my green berets in afghanistan and i was pretty disgusted and disheartened at the biden administration's lack of leadership during and as we've seen since uh and so that's what uh catapulted me into this race to run for congress in virginia's seventh congressional district and you know the green berets our motto is one of them besides quiet professionals is deo priscilla bear which is the freely oppressed and if we see everything going on in our country right now whether it's crime spiking through the roof whether it's record high inflation whether it's a border that's causing serious national security issues after 20 years of war in afghanistan iraq and in syria us green berets decided that it was time to step up after all of that time and seeing everything that was going on you know we we took an oath to serve and defend our constitution and our country and so that's why you're seeing so many of my brothers that are up on the screen right now that are stepping up when our country is in truly a time of need for sure jay collins same question you're running in florida why are you running well first off pete thank you for having me on and of course you know that's a simple question as derek uh mentioned there we've seen a lot around the world we have a lot of unique experiences when you sit back and you watch where our country finds itself right now the economy is tanking inflation's through the roof our border is a seat as a sieve people are just leaking through on a daily basis and then you talk about the withdrawal from afghanistan and the projected weakness on the international stage i think you see that uh those of us who sacrificed some remember you know in our hearts those who sacrificed all and we didn't lose those friends and our allies and give up so much so many of our freedoms over time to watch our nation torn apart from within by failed leadership and failed policies in the end it comes down to those who can should and you know if who is that you send you send me we're volunteers we're ready to serve our nation and continue it i'm running in florida 15 just northeast of tampa bay this is our home it's where our children are going to grow up and god will and we're going to grow old it's true you fight over there for the freedoms we cherish it here and then we watch them slip away pat harrigan you're running in north carolina why are you running hey pete you're a combat veteran and we all know as combat veterans and as special operators what it means to put service before self and not only do we understand what that means we've demonstrated it time and time and time again and the problem that we have today is that we have self-interested career politicians in washington who consistently are putting their own self-interests above the above the interests of the united states of america and the american people and as we look around and we're leading we see that we're leading ourselves down the road to failed outcomes we can't do this anymore enough is enough this isn't actually something i think any of us truly want to do it's something that we're called to do because we want to make sure that we're not part of the first generation of americans that leaves the next generation of americans behind yeah you're right compelled feeling compelled to enter the race i hear that a lot from vets that's not what uh you thought your path might be but here we are christian castelli uh again why are you running uh again i'd have to echo what pat said i feel compelled to run you know as a young ranger i was taught a three-word mantra proactive dynamic leadership as a green beret i was taught leadership decision making problem solving and that's what it you know what we bring to the table as green berets the men on this screen have sacrificed greatly they've risked everything for our country and they have a set of skills that we can bring to congress and given that opportunity i think this is where america needs to to get more folks with our type of background activated and uh you know i'd like to tell mike waltz we got reinforcements on the way mike continue to hold down the fort we're coming to help you out i believe it i believe it uh thank you and i will note looking at those photos you all have sharper haircuts now than when you had in the green berets it's just sort of a rite of passage i get it let's get to one topic real quick around the horn and i'll end with you congressman we'll get the candidates to answer first here is house majority leader steny hoyer he was talking about the war in ukraine and energy at home take a listen to this it's unfortunate that a time of war that we spend all the time blaming our own president we have the problem because russia second third producer of petroleum products in the in the in the world is an irresponsible dictatorship run by one man essentially i know there's a lot of politics here but we're at war so derek again we'll go around the horn pretty quick uh he says we're at war and criticisms of energy are unfounded how would you approach that as a congressman that's absolutely ridiculous pete at the end of the day gas prices have been soaring prior to the conflict in ukraine and that's the bottom line that's a fact and as the democrats in the bible administration have been doing over and over again they want to walk away from the facts they want to you know push off the issues onto something else they're a day late in a dollar short on almost everything that they get their hands on whether it's afghanistan whether it's ukraine whether it's inflation or what have you and this is just another ploy by the democrats and specifically the biden administration to really push off the issues and kind of divert from each crisis that they get their hands on and jay that's a provocative phrase saying we're at war yeah pete that sure is i'm a big fan of words have meaning pretty sure i haven't seen congress vote us into war openly against russia right now but let's uh let's dial back and look at numbers a little bit here when biden came into office gas was i believe 238 a gallon right now we find a high average price of 445 a gallon across this country and i believe diesel was 556 as you mentioned earlier what is biden done well he's doing everything he said he was going to do right with this new green deal and all the far left legislature they're trying to push they stopped keystone uh they've stopped the uh the lease sales on federal and oil uh they've stopped drilling on federal lands and now the permitting is being viewed through the lens of a social cost he's doing exactly what he said he's gonna do and in the end i to use three words it's accountability honor and integrity uh the by demonstration is not showing any honor they have no integrity and in the end he's passing accountability on for every decision he makes and all the failures that he is truly responsible for it's always blame somebody else they stand for it exactly right uh pat same question you know you've been in war uh what does that do to say that and then place the blame somewhere else well it's definitely frustrating pete and i'll tell you this what green berets do is they plan they plan for every contingency and from a national perspective having energy independence and not being reliant upon our foreign adversaries for our energy needs is absolutely paramount and as the other green berets on this panel have said president biden has done exactly what he promised to do and we are now shifting and deflecting blame to a conflict and the reality is what the us government is doing and the bible administration is doing is simply asking the american people to suck up these costs on their back right now and they're just deflecting the issue from the true cause which is a lack of preparedness with our national energy policy christian exit exit answer yeah so i think steny hoyer is nothing but a career politician he's been in congress for 40 years this is just a diversionary tactic to take the focus off of the real issues like the crisis at the southern border we need we have a lot of issues here at home that need priority and focus and once again this is just another diversionary tactic which proves that he's a career politician skilled at doing that uh congressman you listen to all this you must must feel like a proud papa almost look these these guys pete have been shot at literally all over the world uh their entire adult lives and yet they're willing to step up again uh they'll be damned i think i can speak for all of them if we're gonna have our kids growing up in a world led by socialists uh here in the united states or chinese communists uh around the world this is a fight for our country's future and these guys are willing to come up here uh and fight and apply their skills where it matters most and again anybody wants to support them gop frontlinepatriots.com we need your help we need your supporting fires good for you and hopefully you do have some reinforcements all of you uh michael walls derek anderson jay collins pat harrigan christian castelli thanks for your prior service and i hope you get you get another bite at it really do thank you all so much all right thank you it's a good group of guys right there

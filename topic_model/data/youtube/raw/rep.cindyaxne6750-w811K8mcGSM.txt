so much time as I may consume the gentlelady is recognized mr. speaker as a mom I've spent hours in doctors offices with sick kids nothing's more frustrating than when a doctor has to spend more time looking at their computer screen than helping our children I've taken time off work only to end up sitting in waiting rooms because the doctor is running behind all because of a mountain of paperwork that they must do for every single person that they see and I've seen doctors who are frustrated at their computers trying to find the information they need I've also heard from my constituents in Iowa that when they go to the doctor's office they don't want to feel like it's an oil change a quick check under the hood and then a mountain of forms and we it's not the doctors fault they have to comply with all of these administrative rules and codes parents like myself those doctors and everyone in the health care industry knows that something has to change and that's why I'm offering my amendment today my goal is to create a grants program to help reduce all this excessive and unnecessary paperwork on doctors and health care workers it will help doctors spend more time with their patients including children like mine and those across Iowa it will save money because it makes required medical administration more efficient my amendment will reduce the time crying kids have to wait for their parents to fill out that paperwork before they go into the doctor's office and my amendment will cut red tape and federal spending this amendment cuts federal health care administrative work by 50 percent in ten years I spent ten years working for the state of Iowa and I focused on making government more efficient so I absolutely know where to find government waste and how to cut it and I think it's important that we look at that and as an efficiency expert and a mom of two boys I'm proud to introduce this amendment today health administration costs are out of control we spend five hundred billion dollars on all types of duplicate administration every year my amendment creates 250 million dollars in grants for States each year because when excess administrative work costs nearly 250 billion dollars per year that's 1,000 times more in other words if we reduce administrative waste by more than 0.1% these grants would already pay for themselves and this amendment is going to cut away way more waste than 0.1% I have the opportunity to travel all 16 counties in my district every month and I've met with doctors nurses and physicians assistants they've all told me how exhausting and unnecessary all that extra work is in 2016 doctors said they're spending almost twice as much time on administrative work than they are with their patients that's just wrong and that same study also found that when a doctor is in the exam room more than a third of that time is spent on desk work our rural and small communities are struggling to hire enough doctors and I'm already working on attracting doctors to our state but we also need to protect and keep the doctors that we have and doctors want to help patients not do paperwork last month the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services released new guidance to help reduce documentation burdens and ensure doctors have more time with their patients that was the first time in 25 years we've updated these regulations with a specific purpose of reducing paperwork my amendment creates grant programs to get that done look I get it mr. chair if you're filling out 30 pages of paperwork you probably won't like this amendment if you like doing that if your favorite place is a doctor's waiting room and you want to spend more time there I'll understand you're not wanting to support my amendment or if you've always dreamed of being treated like you're a computer code and not a patient then you can vote no on this amendment but I'm pretty confident that you're like me and you hate those things so vote YES if you want doctors to focus on your kids vote yes if you want shorter wait times and more time with your doctor vote yes if all that while you're also saving federal government money and by the way if you're going to miss the waiting room I'd be happy to sign you up for a highlights magazines person to come to your home

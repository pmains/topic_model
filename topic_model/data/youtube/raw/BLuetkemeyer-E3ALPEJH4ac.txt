hi this is congresswoman welcome to the edition of blaine buzz thanks for joining us this week i want to just talk a little bit about upcoming day next week thursday june the 14th it's flag day uh it's a very important day in that i think the flag is an important symbol for our country it's recognized around the world the stripes and colors of the flag all have a very significant meaning and you know here at the capitol we have the opportunity to have flags flown over the capitol from time to time and if you have someone who has a special date coming up sometimes we can get a flag flown for that special day i know that we have sent some flags to some of our young men and women fighting in the military as well as veterans organizations i have one young man in particular who has been to both iraq and afghanistan and has taken his flag with him both places and it's and wherever he goes he flies it so i think it's uh it's important to remember the importance of the flag and to remember the importance of the day and hopefully you have an opportunity to fly your flag on june the 14th and contact us if you need any help with flag purchases we'd be glad to try and accommodate you so with that look forward to seeing you next week take care

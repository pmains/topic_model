NORTH CAROLINA.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA  IS RECOGNIZED. MR. MCHENRY: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I THANK THE CHAIRMAN OF THE  SUBCOMMITTEE.  I RISE TODAY TO SUPPORT  AMERICA'S INNOVATORS ACT.  MR. SPEAKER, THESE DAYS  AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESSES ARE  FACING A CAPITAL CRISIS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR  EARLY STAGE COMPANIES AND  STARTUPS.  DESPITE THE HEADLINES FROM   SILICON VALLEY, THE TRUTH IS   THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF EARLY  STAGE COMPANIES ARE NOT  SECURING VENTURE CAPITAL   FUNDING. INDEED, ALMOST 80% OF STARTUPS,  STARTUP INVESTMENT, GOES TO  JUST THREE STATES. IN THESE UNITED STATES.  MEANWHILE, ANGEL INVESTING FOR   THESE EARLY STAGE COMPANIES IS   CHALLENGING. INVESTING IN STARTUP COMPANIES   IS INHERENTLY RISKY. WHICH IS WHY THE WEALTHY   INVESTERS WHO QUALIFY TO BECOME  ANGELS OFTEN -- INVESTORS WHO  QUALIFY TO BECOME ANGELS OFTEN   SHY AWAY FROM IT.  THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO ADDRESS  THE CHALLENGES FACING ANGEL  INVESTING. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY  CHANGING OUR MINDSET AND   CREATING A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK  THAT ENCOURAGES INNOVATION AND   GROWTH.  WHILE ENSURING THAT SHAREHOLDER  AND INVESTOR PROTECTIONS REMAIN  STRONG.  RANKING MEMBER WATERS AND I  PROPOSED AN AMENDMENT THAT   WOULD INCREASE THE CAP OF  INVESTORS FROM $100,000 TO   $250,000 FOR CREDITED INVESTORS  OF ANGEL FUNDS AND THIS WOULD  ONLY APPLY TO QUALIFYING   VENTURE FUNDS TAILORED TO EARLY  STAGE INVESTING. WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IN THE  HOUSE, IN THE FULL HOUSE, IS A   GREAT WORK OF COMPROMISE.  AND I THANK THE RANKING MEMBER,  MS. WATERS, FOR HER WORK, HER  DILIGENT WORK, WORKING WITH MY   STAFF AND HER STAFF TOGETHER   OVER MANY LONG HOURS TO COME UP  WITH THIS COMPROMISE THAT WE   HAVE THAT WILL, I BELIEVE,   GARNER BIPARTISAN SUPPORT LIKE   IT DID IN THE FINANCIAL  SERVICES COMMITTEE.  I DO THANK THE RANKING MEMBER  FOR WORKING DILIGENTLY TO MAKE   THIS OUTCOME POSSIBLE. THE RESULT OF OUR PROPOSED   AMENDMENT AND WHAT WE HAVE   BEFORE US ALLOWS FOR EARLY   STAGE COMPANIES TO RAISE THE   CAPITAL THEY NEED BY OPENING UP  ANGEL INVESTING TO MORE  ACCREDITED INVESTORS.  THIS IS A GOOD BILL, THIS IS A   COMPROMISED BILL, AND I'M  PLEASED THAT THIS LEGISLATION  ENJOYS WIDSE SUPPORT.  AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES --  WIDE SUPPORT.  AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO  SUPPORT IT AND VOTE FOR IT AND   LET'S GET THIS THING DONE AND  SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT. I YIELD BACK THE BALANCE OF MY   TIME.  THE SPEAKER PRO TE

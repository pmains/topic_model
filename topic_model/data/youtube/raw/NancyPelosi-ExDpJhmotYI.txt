good morning everyone this morning my purpose is to be the master of ceremony so I'm going to be brief because we're here to listen to some very special guests of course our very distinguished Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to our two hours I say our bosses our constituents Cal was low and elite Meredith chev its and we are here in front of the flags as we go into the fourth of July to celebrate health independence as you know a Social Security Medicare have been pillars of stability in our society and now Social Security Medicare and health independence that's the third pillar something that we were very very proud to be about our founders as we observe the fourth of July our founders talked about a declaration of independence guaranteeing life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that is what this is all about a healthier life the Liberty to pursue your happiness not being job locked you can be a camera meant a writer you can be self-employed start your own business change jobs you are free to do all of that that's very good for society and very good for our economy others will talk about what has already happened I'm eager to for us to move forward and we are choosing today because it's about a hundred days until the implementation of the Affordable hair at the the enrollment begins October first 100 days and it is one year this week since the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act so we have a lot to celebrate and that's why we're proud to stand before the flags to celebrate life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and to pay tribute to the secretary and the president for their leadership in making that freedom pasa for the people of our country Secretary Sebelius is a great secretary her implementation of this is a is fabulous she was the governor of Kansas she was the Insurance Commissioner she knows of what you speak she knows it in detail more important than that she has a vision for America that has healthcare as a right for every person not just a privilege for the few in that spirit I'm pleased to introduce the distinguished Secretary of Health and Human Service Kathleen Sebelius well thank you very much leader Pelosi and I think it goes without saying that not only the leader but the rest of the house leadership and the members who are here there wouldn't be a celebration today without the hard work of the folks in this room who actually made sure that the Affordable Care Act was passed and signed into law by the president in March of 2010 so thank you thank you thank you for the eighty-five percent of Americans who already have insurance either through their employer or through a program like Medicare the Affordable Care Act is as the leader said already making a difference over the last three years tens of millions of families have been freed from the fear of hitting a lifetime limit or having their coverage canceled because of a paperwork error millions of seniors are saving an average of more than six hundred dollars a year six hundred dollars a year on their prescription drugs and millions of young Americans are keeping their coverage as they start their careers or pursue graduate school if you have health coverage that coverage is more secure today because of the Affordable Care Act but the health law also carried the promise of providing better coverage options for those Americans who found themselves locked out or priced out or dumped out of the insurance market we had a market that worked pretty well for insurance companies but not so well for a lot of families and small business owners so in less than 100 days on October first that promise will be fulfilled when new health insurance marketplace is open for business in every state in the country the markets will give Americans a better way to shop for health insurance for the first time ever in history consumers can go to one stop make apples-to-apples comparison of prices and benefits and companies for the first time ever will have to compete for their customers on price and service not and who does the best job of medically underwriting and dumping people out of a plan every insurance plan has to cover a comprehensive set of benefits including physician visits hospital stays prescriptions and people with a health condition won't be turned away ever again that discrimination is over no more pre-existing condition and being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition gender discrimination is over so for millions of families and small businesses they also look forward to a break on their monthly premiums and what that means simply is no matter where you live or what your situation is affordable health coverage will be within reach we recognize this is a huge undertaking if it was easy it would have been done decades ago but we are on track finally to get it done and I want to be clear we are ready to go on october first so this week we had another big step forward when we launched our two new and improved websites healthcare gov the english version in cuidado de salud the spanish version online homes of the marketplace and they're up and running we also opened a toll-free 24 hour call center that's going to operate seven days a week we have translators who can give advice in 150 languages so people can call and get information we have web chats possible we have live folks available the new tools are part of a series of steps we're taking to make sure that Americans can take advantage of the improved health coverage options will be unveiling new partnerships holding events around the country and funding outreach efforts through community health centers and other local organizations so we've got a lot of work to do in the next hundred days but every day we get reminders of how important the goal is that we're working toward early reports have already shown that the marketplace is going to give a lot of consumers choices that they've never had before and we've seen very promising news about rates offered in states from Rhode Island all the way to California blowing away the myth that somehow we're going to see rates skyrocket so more choice and better rates in the coming months we are going to be reaching out to uninsured Americans and underinsured Americans to let them know what's coming a health insurance market that works for you is finally on its way and the days of insurance company underwriting is coming to an end so we're going to let all Americans know that changing jobs are retiring early or pursuing a dream or starting a small business is now much more possible because health security and as the leader said health independence is coming and I want to thank our guests excuse me callous and Annie and Meredith who have some real life examples to share about what has already happened to them thanks to these new Affordable Care Act and thank you for letting me be with you today thank you ma'am Madam Secretary thank you very much to talk further about independence I wouldn't a graduate of Suitland high school that's interesting but we have somebody from suitland maryland where I went to high school here to speak to us about what it's going to do for her and her neighbors and friends and family and Ely Chani thank you come on up thank you good morning morning my name is Annie leach I am 67 years old I am a retired cook among many jobs that I've held and held today and a behalf of the Alliance for retirement Americans i live in

longer have to pay any costs to share or preventive service the law of coverage coronary Council screening test as a Medicare beneficiary I was able to take advantage of the annual wellness checkup in March of last year at first my daughter did not know the service was a pig for pain then someone close to me informed him that he was an error in attempted to charge me we were right we were right and I did not have to pay the Affordable Care a work the way it was designed on it is important for my peace of mind to know that these protections to my health are placed in peace looking forward I know that I've done all I can to keep my medical care costs down thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak for many seniors to dig thank you we're gonna ask any run for Congress sandy she's from Maryland not from Carol at California Esperanza that means hope that's a necessary ingredient if you want to have life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and this health security law that's now in place offers hope but there's no one who could talk about hope better than a cancer survivor so let me now introduce to you cal was low thank you very much good morning everyone my name is callie slow and would first like to thank leader Pelosi for the opportunity to share my story today Thank You President Obama for making the success of the Affordable Care Act a high priority and Thank You Secretary Sebelius for all your dedicated work in implementing the law and making sure that things are done correctly the first time around as a former student body president I worked on building public support for the bill for the Affordable Care Act through the US students association and never thought would have imagined the impact it would have in my life we work on the Affordable Care Act because House leaders include the student aid and fiscal fiscal responsibility act which cut profits to banks and provided more student aid to make college more affordable in june two thousand eleven i graduated from the university of california santa cruz which led to the termination of my university health insurance my parents maintain a working-class household and do not help insurance themselves so I purchased short-term health insurance just to be safe shortly after having gone through weeks of medical testing I was diagnosed with stage three hodgson disease because my cancer was in his late stages it was deemed a pre-existing condition although I initially had no prior knowledge of my illness my insurance company notified my doctor and I that anything relating to my illness will not be covered by my plan my family struggled to pull money together to meet my deductible get through all my required medical tests and start chemotherapy one of the tests I was I had was a full-body CT scan that cost two thousand doing the dollars just for the procedure to process the results a bill in the mail came for ten thousand dollars I tried working with my health insurance company but that produced no results it just so happened that one day in February 2012 after House Republicans repeat a repeal on the Affordable Care Act leader Pelosi appeared before television to talk about the Affordable Care Act and how it works she said that the hell thought was already helping millions of Americans across the country because of leader Pelosi I learned that as a result of the Affordable Care Act California contracted with the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a federally funded high risk full to provide coverage for medically uninsurable individuals who live in California after going months without health insurance I qualified and receive health care that my family could afford it also prevented approximately twenty-five thousand dollars in medical bills from being added to my current debt today I get to live and I get to take back my life into my own hands although although they didn't know my story or what my story will eventually be leader Pelosi members of Congress and President Obama fought for me fought for the American public they made a promise guaranteeing that every American will have access to affordable and quality healthcare and for me they made good on that promise thank you very much thank you very much Secretary Sebelius thank you leader Pelosi and thank you to the members of this Congress I often say that no matter who we may think we are of what you may think we are we can be no more nor can we be in a less than what our experiences allow us to be and I think that what you hear that today or the experiences of people who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act and to further that discussion i'm pleased to present now Meredith chivet who is a student in New York universi or who is from New York who suffers from diabetes and as one who lives for the wife who has one time in a full shot a day diabetic I know what that sees is all about mething good morning everyone morning Thank You leader Pelosi Secretary Sebelius and members of Congress for being here this morning my name is Meredith shepherds and I'm a student at New York University I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in a second week of my senior year of high school almost four years ago during my hospital stay I learned just how much my daily life was going to change from that day forward type 1 diabetes is a chronic pre-existing condition that requires checking my blood sugar monitoring my food intake and insulin injections several times each day as well as multiple appointments each year with endocrinologist nutritionists and several other specialists there currently is no cure for type 1 diabetes so this form of treatment is the only method to control the effects of the disease without insurance it is nearly impossible to pay out of pocket for insulin and testing supplies necessary to stay alive and lead a nearly normal life the Affordable Care Act meets these essential needs in several ways it allows me to stay on my parents health insurance plan until I'm 26 years old so I don't need to rely on my University's insurance plan during my early 20s and starting in just five months the law will prohibit insurance companies from denying my coverage based on this pre-existing condition that requires so much medical attention surprisingly about sixteen percent of young adults in my age bracket have some form of a pre-existing condition like I do the law also creates insurance exchanges which guarantee access to coverage I need to enjoy a healthy and productive life no matter where I work or where my career takes me those exchange is open and less than 100 days when people type 1 diabetes don't have insurance and therefore can't afford the proper medications and technology to properly control their condition the results can be devastating nobody should be denied the ability to lead a healthy life I remember feeling overjoyed when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 so on this anniversary of the Supreme Court decision I want to thank Jung invincibles for helping me share my story and most importantly thank Congress and President Obama for passing legislation that will allow me to live my life without fear of losing my insurance coverage or my health what could be more eloquent than our guest here today telling their personal stories they are joined here on the podium by many friends who helped pass the Affordable Care Act and now to implement it whether it's students who are invincibles whether it's a national physicians alliance whether it's an American Nurses Association the Catholic hospital association individual nurses as PD active dr. Haley tisha pediatrics instructor at Harvard Medical School just the list goes on and on I thank them for joining us all suited up for care and in closing I just want to say this because it with our guest said it so beautifully and our Secretary has led us so magnificently as as well as our President President Obama on this and other subjects I tell this story because it is a way of thanking all of you the morning after the affordable health care bill passed the House of Representatives mr.

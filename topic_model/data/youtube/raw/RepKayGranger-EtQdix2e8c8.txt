hello i am courtney rankin deputy district director for congresswoman k granger i'm going to go over some basics about the united states service academies and how to obtain a congressional nomination from congresswoman granger just as a reminder before we begin our office does not represent any of the service academies if you have academy specific questions you should reach out to the service academy directly or to the local service academy liaison links to the academy's websites are provided on this webpage so what is a service academy if you've made it this far you're likely pretty familiar with what a service academy is and what is expected but just for a quick recap there are five service academies the coast guard academy military academy naval academy air force academy and merchant marine academy you need to have a congressional nomination to be considered for appointment to all of the academies except for the united states coast guard academy upon graduation from any of the academies you will commission into the united states military and be required to complete five years of service if you choose to attend flight school after graduation your five years of service will begin after flight school if you complete all four years of school and your five years of post graduate service you will have received an estimated 400 000 education without any student loan debt upon graduation you will commission into the respective services as an officer if you graduate from the naval academy you have the option of commissioning into the united states navy or the united states marine corps air or marine ground if you graduate from the air force academy you will have the option to commission into the united states air force or the new united states space force the merchant marine academy is the only academy that is under the umbrella of the department of transportation upon graduation you will still be required to fulfill the term of service however the terms are a little different you must maintain a license as an officer in the merchant marine for at least six years after graduation you must apply for an appointment to serve as a commissioned officer in any reserve or national guard unit of the armed forces for at least eight years following graduation and finally you will be required to fulfill a five-year service agreement within one of the following as a merchant marine officer as a commissioned officer on active duty in any armed force of the united states or in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration or noaa or as an employee in a u.s maritime related industry profession or marine science as approved by the secretary of transportation so there are five academies to be appointed to the military academy naval air force or merchant marine academy you must obtain a congressional nomination the coast guard academy which is under the department of homeland security not department of defense or transportation appoints directly without requiring a congressional nomination the united states coast guard academy is in new london connecticut our office does not have a lot of information on the coast guard academy because you do not need a congressional nomination to be accepted it is under the heading of the department of homeland security and thus appointments to the coast guard academy are established by the secretary of homeland security 65 of coast guard academy graduates have a stem approximately 1069 cadets are currently enrolled all 50 states dc and 13 separate nations are represented at the academy student to faculty ratio is seven to one class of 2024 swore in approximately 270 cadets the merchant marine academy falls under the umbrella of the department of transportation as mentioned before upon graduation you can commission into any of the branches of service noaa or the merchant marines the merchant marine academy is located in kings point new york the merchant marine act was passed by congress in 36 in 1938 the merchant marine cadet corps was established and the academy was dedicated by fdr in 1943. student-to-faculty ratio is 12-1 there's approximately 1 000 cadets enrolled at the merchant marine academy the military academy which is also referred to as west point after its location is the oldest of the service academies it was established in 1802 by thomas jefferson and its location was considered during the american revolution by george washington to be the most important strategic position in america which is why he moved his headquarters there in 1779. graduation rate of the military academy is approximately eighty percent the school was ranked number two in top public schools by us news and was ranked number four in engineering program enter in undergraduate engineering programs by us news student to faculty ratio is eight to one with about a nine percent acceptance rate class of 2024 admitted and sworn approximately 1200 cadets with a total enrollment of about 4 400. the second oldest academy is the united states naval academy again upon graduation from the naval academy you have the option of commissioning as a naval officer or to go marine air or marine ground the naval academy is located in annapolis maryland was first proposed to congress in 1825 by president adams and was established in 1845 by the secretary of the navy without any congressional funding student to faculty ratio like the military academy is eight to one with approximately a ninety percent graduation rate it was ranked the number one top public school by u.s news class of 2024 sworn about 1200 cadets with a total enrollment of about 4 500. the air force academy was established in 1954 the air force academy is the youngest of the service academies it's located near colorado springs student faculty ratio is eight to one with approximately 80 graduation rate and it is ranked number three in top public schools by u.s news so military air force and naval academies are one two and three top public schools in america by ranked by u.s news air force academy swore in approximately 1100 cadets in the class of 2024 with the total enrollment of approximately four thousand 2020 was the first year graduating airmen were provided the option to commission into the united states air force or become the first graduates to commission to the united states space force 86 airmen from the class of 2020 commissioned into the united states space force so what are the basic qualifications to apply for a nomination and appointment to a service academy generally you must be a united states citizen to qualify for a congressional nomination from congresswoman granger you must reside in texas congressional district 12 unless you are applying to the merchant marine academy or you are active duty military whose home of record is in district 12 but you are stationed elsewhere or applicants who are currently attending one of the service academy preparatory schools but you are originally from texas congressional district 12. you must be 17 and not have reached your 23rd birthday by july 1 of the year you enter the academy you cannot have any dependents meaning you cannot be married pregnant have children or be legally responsible for child support you should have an excellent academic record and be prepared to provide scores for sat exams or your acts with writing portion you need to maintain an excellent physical standard and have completed your candidate fitness assessment including your basketball throw pull-ups or flexed arm hang shuttle run crunches push-ups and timed mile you will be required to take a dod medical examination review board exam more information about the exam is provided below in the dodd-verb video by larry mullins there are two steps to getting into the united states air force naval merchant marine or military academies the first is obtaining a congressional nomination and then you can be considered for an appointment under title 10 of the us code to be considered for appointment to the merchant marine military naval or air force academy you must receive a congressional nomination from your representative this is to ensure representation from across the nation once you receive a congressional nomination you are then eligible for appointment but remember a nomination does not guarantee appointment vacancies charges and nominations so nominating sources include your senators and representative the vice president the presidential nomination and other military-affiliated nominations the primary nomination sources are the vice president both of your senators and your representative you should apply for a nomination through all four of the primary sources all candidates who are qualified and nominated they're not selected for appointment are eligible to be appointed to the academies through the secretaries of the army navy and air force as well as the respective academy superintendents but the students must have obtained a congressional nomination to be considered for one of these appointments military-affiliated nominations include the presidential nomination of children of career military and an unlimited number of children of medal of honor recipients merit-based nominations are for children of armed forces personnel killed in action missing in action or during active duty service became 100 service connected disabled the service secretaries can also nominate enlisted members of regular and reserve components so again you should apply for all four of the primary nominating sources including the vice president both of your senators and your representative you should be familiar with how each of these nominating sources handle their applications all of that information can be found on their respective websites the vice president both of your senators and your representative may only have five cadets charged to them at any one time this includes plebes or freshmen sophomores juniors and firsties or seniors we can nominate 10 names for each vacancy and the academy chooses one of those 10 names to fill the vacancy every year we do try to have one to two vacancies per school and under each vacancy we can nominate up to 10 names so why apply to all nominating sources remember the vice president can only have five cadets at any academy at any one time and can nominate up to 10 names per vacancy but the vice president has no geographical restriction meaning he can nominate 10 names for one vacancy from across the united states your senators have the same restrictions in the number of cadets meaning they can have five cadets at any academy at any one time and can nominate up to 10 names per vacancy both senators cruz and cornyn however are limited to nominating cadets from the state of texas congresswoman granger can also have five cadets at any school at any given time and can nominate 10 names per vacancy but she is restricted to nominating students from within congressional district 12 which is a much smaller geographic region than the entire state and of course then the united states the exception is of course the merchant marine academy where congresswoman granger can nominate from anywhere within the state of texas so why is seeking all four nominations important you want to increase the likelihood of being nominated and you want to make it easy for the academies to admit you this year we have two vacancies to the united states military academy and one vacancy each to the naval and air force academies some quick math we can nominate 20 names to the military academy and 10 each to air force and naval academies you are competing for just one spot if you only apply through one source you are not eligible to be filled in to one of the senator's open vacancies or the vice presidents the more nominating sources you apply for the more likely you are to be appointed to the academy you want remember the coast guard academy does not need a congressional nomination and we are not limited in the number of nominations for the merchant marine academy but the state of texas is limited to only 13 seats at the merchant marine academy nomination methods include competitive principal with competitive and principal with alternates so all 10 nominations are weighted equally under the competitive nomination method the principle with competitive means we nominate a principal who stands above the rest and the remaining nine names are weighted equally principle with alternates allows us to nominate a principal and rank our next alternates as far down as we would like for example we can choose to nominate a principal and then nominate a second and third alternate and the remaining seven names would then be awaited equally generally congresswoman granger uses the competitive nomination method meaning all 10 names are weighted equally however if a candidate does stand out to the congresswoman or to the board we will use a principle with competitive or principal with alternate nomination method it is important that you review our application and our frequently asked question page thoroughly if you have questions you should contact me my information will be provided at the end of this this is something that you need to want and it will be you who goes to the academy not your parents not your best friend and not your mom's friend who knows how great you are you should be the one making contact and you need to become comfortable with doing so your completed application including your fitness assessment scores should be in our office by five o'clock on october 16th part of attending a service academy is learning time management and prioritizing tasks this is an easy step in showing us you are up to that task we do not have a standard resume format we prefer but make sure your accomplishments are not buried in three pages of information a passport style photo means a small photo and should primarily be a headshot without a busy background three letters of recommendation can be from anyone you would like generally we ask that at least two letters be from someone within district 12 but we have made exceptions in the past typically for active duty service members stationed elsewhere school transcripts with class rank should be official copies due to covid we understand that many sat and act exams were cancelled or rescheduled therefore we will accept sat or act exam scores after the october 16 deadline but remember they cannot be considered if they are received after the interview day typically we host interviews in november on a saturday before thanksgiving your essay should be 500 words or less this is your opportunity to make your case about why you want to go to a service academy and why you should be nominated ahead of everyone else applying do not take it lightly i have mentioned it twice now but for good measure your completed application for a nomination from congresswoman granger needs to be in our office by 1700 or 5 p.m friday october 16 2020. our interviews are conducted using an eight member board consisting of academy graduates local businessmen and women as well as active duty personnel the congresswoman also participates in the interview process bringing the total to nine members each year the number of board members present varies based on schedules so the board interview may consist of two or three members or may include all nine board members you should prepare for any scenario the purpose of the interview is for the board to get to know you what is not on paper they want to know that you are following current events they want to know that you have a backup plan and they're going to want to know if that plan includes public service more about the board interviews is in the academy board video by jim breen below but the overarching theme is can you show us that you are ready to attend a service academy and commission into the armed forces upon graduation when i say this is an opportunity to show the board what cannot be seen on paper i'm always reminded of the applicant who scored a 29 on his acts a 36 is a perfect score and a 21 is average a 29 is a good score but is about average for surface academy applicants during the interview process however it came out that this applicant took the act 16 times to receive that 29. on paper he looked like every other candidate who did well on his acts but in the interview we were able to see that his determination and his humility were well above average that is why the board interview was so important this applicant graduated from the united states air force academy commissioned into the united states air force and has been proudly representing district 12 ever since so what are we looking for again it's discussed further in the board video but what we are looking for is a well-rounded applicant we need to see a leader and someone who perseveres we want to see someone who is cognizant of world events and who is academically and physically prepared for the service academies remember a nomination does not equate to an appointment but you cannot get an appointment to a service academy except the coast guard academy without a congressional nomination academies review our nominations and select their appointees once offered an appointment you have the decision to accept or reject that appointment if you do accept the appointment we are notified and congresswoman granger tries to recognize appointees every year before you ship off to your summer basic training course thank you for watching my contact information is provided here you can also call the congresswoman's district office and ask for me if you have any additional questions links to each academy are available on this webpage you

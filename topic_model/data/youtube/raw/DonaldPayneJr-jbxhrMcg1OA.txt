well first i want to thank the general lady from the virgin islands congresswoman plasquette and the gentleman from texas uh mark vici for hosting tonight's special order hour on such an important topic racism and discrimination but before i begin i want to take a moment to mark the one year anniversary of the pulse nightclub shooting and to remember the 49 lives that were cut short in the deadliest mass shooting in our nation's history as we grieve for the victims and their families we must continue to stand in solidarity with the survivors and with the lgbtq community against hate intolerance for love in support of our nation's values of equality and dignity for all the kind of intolerance and hate and violence on display that day in orlando has become an alarming trend in this country a trend that has disturbingly been fueled by president trump according to the southern poverty law center 37 percent of the 1094 bias related incidents in just the first month after the election of the reference reference the president his campaign slogans or his remarks about sexual assault as he did throughout his campaign president trump continues to speak the language of racial and cultural grievance pitting americans against one another and perpetuating the vicious viciousness he pretends to despise the result is what you would expect a spike in hate crimes and hate speech i've seen in my district in new jersey where anti-semitic graffiti has was plastered on a pedestrian bridge and we've seen it at american university just down the road at the national museum of the african-american history cultural whose nooses were found last month where nooses were found last month communities of color know this pain all too well and mr speaker i am really fortunate to be able to discuss an issue of such importance to this nation this is nate one nation under god indivisible for liberty and justice for all you know i have been very fortunate in my life to have been born into a situation uh where a great american prior to me held this seat for 23 years of the 10th congressional district of the state of new jersey his name was donald payne he was my father and he um afforded me a lifestyle um one of which i did not know of his suffering and pain growing up as a young african-american in this country but have even in that situation have found myself irrespective of being in that position found myself in situations that have been dangerous and uncomfortable as a young 20 year old you know when we're 20 we do things that we probably shouldn't be doing at times i was on my lunch time i was on my lunch time going downtown to pay a bill at a department store i had my first credit card and i was running late so what i decided to do was make a u-turn on the main street broad street in newark new jersey which is the largest street in the town and i made a u-turn to come in front of this store and naturally you know with my luck a motorcycle police officer was coming down the street the same time so he pulled me over as he should and i was wrong but i was using my cousin's car and so when he asked me for my license and registration i could not find the papers that i needed and i was fumbling and nervous and the officer leaned into the car and used the n-word and said if you don't find those documents in a minute i'll throw you so far under the jail that they'll never find you so this is very frightening for any citizen to go through so i was able to get my license and i handed it to him so just before that they would throw me so far under the jail that they would never find me again once i held sanded him my license and it said that i was donald payne jr whose father was a sitting councilman in the city of newark his whole attitude changed don't you know that you could get hurt or you could hurt someone or you had to be careful a minute ago i was nothing i would be so far under the jail they would never find me but now that i'm connected to something or someone all of a sudden we've become paternal there are millions of people that aren't connected to someone mr speaker in this country millions and these are the types of things that they go through so i'm just here to say that we must be vigilant i believe in this country i believe in its greatness i believe in the words in the pledge of allegiance i believe in the constitution we must make it work for all americans and with that i yield back

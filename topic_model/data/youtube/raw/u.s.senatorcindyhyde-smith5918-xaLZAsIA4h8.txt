roe v wade has been a terrible stain on our nation for too long i'm grateful for god in his divine guidance in the supreme court's decision on dobbs by effectively overturning roe v wade the united states will step away from the notion that aborting a baby must be allowed on demand and up till the birth today the dobbs decision stands as an affirmation that states can take actions to protect both the pre-born and their mothers the decision does not outlaw abortion as some pro-abortionists contend but it is a significant departure from roe and that the people through their elected leaders will guide how each state approaches abortion rather than a nationwide policy set by unelected judges as we move forward as a nation i believe greater attention should be paid to the needs of pregnant women and their babies i am so very proud that mississippi has had a leading role in overturning roe v wade and i will continue to pray for god's guidance over the supreme court and all policy makers who will now take up the abortion issue across the country

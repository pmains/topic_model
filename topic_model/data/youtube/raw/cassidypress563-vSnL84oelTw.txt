one insurance rate supposed to be manageable again for some homeowners hit with skyrocketing premiums some might even get refunds for the price they've already paid it's thanks to a law passed in congress and news rob krieger gets answers on who should expect some relief the bigger waters act of 2012 sent some insurance premiums through the roof but thanks to legislation co-authored by congressman bill cassidy those payments are coming back down to earth mark vanprand lives on the amit river so flood insurance really isn't an option but last year premium payments got murky my main concern was i was if i'd be able to afford to live in my home we're lucky we have our mortgage paid off but we could have estimates of 25 to 30 thousand dollars a year for flood insurance alone but thanks to the homeowner flood insurance affordability act passed through congress in march van praan's premium is feasible it more or less freezes their rates with the subsidized rating with the government but that will change or could change in 2017 this is only till 2017. hopefully it won't change but we don't know that for sure terry forsman an insurance expert at louisiana companies thinks the changes will help people with rising costs normal rate increases will still be in play and people with secondary homes or businesses will experience a larger increase gradually over four years still with every natural disaster insurance providers will have to cover the losses and it could eventually come at the cost of your premiums these are going to continue to occur every year we just have to figure out how we're going to pay for them maybe build more smartly the government's been subsidizing the rating and subsidizing the losses for a long time they're just to the point where it's we're reaching our ceiling and we just can't keep doing that the act applies to homeowners who bought their house before 2012 homeowners who have already paid the higher premium may get a refund too but that won't be until at least later this year rob krieger wbrc news all right we'll look forward to that rob

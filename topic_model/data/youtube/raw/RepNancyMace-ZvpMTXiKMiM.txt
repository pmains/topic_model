thank you very much for joining us um congresswoman let's just start with what john was just talking about the white house threatening to withhold federal funds from different institutions what is your response to that well i'm old enough to remember when joe biden and kamala harris were questioning the efficacy of the vaccinations just because president trump was president at the time and now there's this push to harm states and potential institutions who don't get the vaccine or don't require people to get the vaccine this really should be a decision for individuals and families with their health care providers and their physicians and we shouldn't be threatened by the president of the united states i mean look what's going on at the border uh what are they doing about super spreading delta variant down there are they pushing this kind of requirement on the thousands of illegal immigrants who are coming across our border and spreading this deadly illness across the country probably not yeah congresswoman may say i wanted to ask you about the the status of what's going on on capitol hill as far as masked inside the capitol building i know you had a problem with speaker pelosi trying to arrest people for not wearing the mask even if you're fully vaccinated and and i wanted to see what what the latest was and how you feel about it so far that we've heard i walked into my office on thursday morning in dc to learn that nancy pelosi had directed the capitol hill police to arrest any visitor to the capitol and our staff if they were maskless and i lost it you know my i had four words for nancy pelosi was come and get me she also wanted members of congress who weren't wearing their masks reported to the police as well and then you saw members of the media with the uh the blue check mark saying well if they're not gonna if they're gonna go masterless we should arrest them there but let's arrest them if they're not vaccinated too to my understanding nothing has changed that threat is still there and it just goes to show how out of touch and how authoritarian pelosi's power and the power grab of her in the administration is becoming with each increasing moment each increasing week um just to compare uh former president trump threatened to withhold funds from local communities um all the time particularly when it came to sanctuary cities so why would this be different well this is different because this is a this is a vaccination everyone has different health care standards and different conditions and some areas of the country there are hot spots and others there are not most of the country is not a hot spot these really these kinds of decisions should be made at the local level between families and individuals and their doctors i i tell people all the time i'm encouraging vaccinations so we can keep the spread of the delta variant low and lower those that are getting it and are not vaccinated they are getting hospitalized there is a higher morbidity rate but that is a personal choice and a personal freedom that should be protected for individuals in this country it's a lot different when you're talking about a vaccination about medical care versus sanctuary cities there too couldn't be more different want to get your response to one of your colleagues congresswoman corey bush defending her massive security spending at the same time calling to defund police let's listen to what you had to say we'll get your response i'm going to make sure i have security because i know i have had attempts on my life and i have too much work to do there are too many people that need help right now for me to allow that so if i end up spending 200 000 if i spend 10 10 10 more dollars on it you know what i get to be here to do the work so suck it up and defunding the police has to happen we need to defund the police your response congresswoman uh totally crazy i mean i find it really rich a socialist finally discovers capitalism through the guise of private security and someone who i the whose hypocrisy sees no bounds who wants to defund the police yet you know is advocating and bragging about the private security that she needs i mean i just this is one of i hate politics i hate politicians i hate the whole thing and this is one of the reasons that the the american public that citizens of our country also hate dc they hate the swamp they hate uh what's going on because of the hypocrisy that we see day in and day out corey bush thinks you're an idiot yeah you know she spends what two hundred thousand dollars on private security but yet regular folk aren't supposed to be protected by uh police departments across the country and then also there's the hypocrisy that ties into our original conversation about mass because we repeatedly keep seeing pictures of nancy pelosi and others where they wear the mask in front of the cameras and then it's something entirely different off camera oh absolutely that hypocrisy there and guess what i get threats in my on my life too all the time and i can still carry in south carolina south carolina pretty soon in a couple of days we'll have open carry and i'll be exercising my rights as a citizen of the united states of america but that's not hypocrisy that's that's freedom and our bill of rights at work right okay congresswoman nancy mays thank you so much for joining us thank you as always

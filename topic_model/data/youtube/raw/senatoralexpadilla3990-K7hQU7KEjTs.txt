thank you Mr chair thank you Senator Johnson for the accommodation of another meeting in a few minutes to get to but wanted to uh first of all thank you Mr chair for your ongoing diligence uh on oversight here uh and uh I think all three Witnesses for participating I do have a couple questions for Professor Armstrong but wanted to begin with Miss Fano uh not only is a follow-up to the Chairman's question I guess the follow-up and then I'll share the personal the follow-up is so if some of the clear recommendations were to be followed and there is more transparency and more true data sharing but well how could that help you your family so many other families across the country that have experienced similar tragedies a big part in What had occurred with our family involved our trust consistently we were told to do things a certain way and that things were going correctly we did not know about how many incidents had occurred had we known had we been disclosed the information of how horrendous the conditions are in that facility and how few actually received adequate care we would have insisted upon a different outcome a lot of our decisions came from Pure trust towards our system towards the appointed attorney that we had as well as the staff members at that Correctional Facility so should we change that I do believe that other families might make the right decisions might have more acknowledgment of the potential dangers and with that acknowledgment can come change thank you for for sharing and look I know the the data in front of us the report that's being discussed spans you know from jails and folks that are pre-trialed to prisons folks that have been convicted of a wide range of crimes short sentences long sentences and everything in between but that does nothing to um take away fundamental human rights I mentioned a minute ago that there's just a couple personal comments I wanted to share and it begins with applauding you for being so forthcoming on concerned about mental health and mental health conditions my wife's a mental health Advocate our family is big on making sure we're undoing stigma and raising awareness it's one thing to talk about in the PTSD in the military context another when it comes to you know mothers suffering from postpartum depression or in the higher education space right stress on college campuses and like across the board mental health is a big concern prior to the pandemic we've all experienced a huge uptick during the covid-19 pandemic and it's important to recognize that whether it's jails prisons other institutions or no exception to that and again I come back to the human rights people deserve in terms of access to care quality of care and truth so the other piece you know you you grew up not too far from where I grew up very similar communities so your story resonates and I appreciate your courage to be here and to share Professor Armstrong following up on some of your work and some of the testimony you've submitted in 2020 Reuters completed an investigation into how an estimated 5 000 people died in jails throughout the country in a single year and that's jails it's not counting prisons so these people died without ever having their case even heard at trial the data sadly clear and compelling the U.S correctional system occupies a space where class race gender and a host of other factors influence how long or how demanding your time in custody will be however pre-trial time spent in a correctional facility should never be a de facto death sentence so I noticed it in your written testimony and I'll quote a lack of transparency on debts in custody undermines our nation's commitment to Public Safety could you walk through the subcommittee through how a detailed accounting of deaths in custody would make would better inform our policy making here in Congress absolutely so first the Nationwide data from 2000 to 2019 shows that 20 of deaths in custody were actually of people facing charges meaning they had never had a trial in Louisiana that was 14 of our deaths were pre-trial think about it this way if community members don't trust the policing the sheriffs the facilities right and the fact that our system is capable of delivering Justice they are less likely to report crime they are less likely to serve as a witness or to provide testimony in a criminal trial and they are less likely to themselves feel protected by those same systems when they are a victim of trial and so public trust in our criminal justice institutions is fundamental when we see the death penalty exacted without a Judicial sentence and where a person's range or their probability of death is simply a factor of which facility they are assigned to that undermines their trust and it undermines all of our safety thank you and just a final final question um in your written testimony again you list a number of suggested amendments that you believe could be useful for better collecting data so it's one thing to share data but if you're not even collecting out of the front end uh that's another issue among the suggestions you made is that the Bureau of Justice assistance collect information on incarcerated people's specific medical illnesses and pre-existing conditions did you mean to include mental health conditions as well and just briefly elaborate on that so what we know from the prior from BJs right so the earlier data is they actually did collect mental health observation and practices medical illnesses as well although they only asked pre-existing conditions for medical conditions they did not ask for mental health so when I proposed reverting back to those categories that we used to collect data on that would yes that would include mental health as well as Medical Health thank you very much thank you Mr chair

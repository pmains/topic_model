hi this is congressman luke tomorrow with another edition of lame buzz thanks for joining us this week i want to just mention a few things about the libyan situation we've been getting a lot of questions in the office about it just want to sort of clarify if i can for some of you what really is we know is going on or not going on and what congress can and cannot do basically we still have a lot of conflicting information as you all know with what's going on or not going on in the living situation we can't get in there yet to actually investigate the console itself that was destroyed in the attack to get the evidence that it takes to sort of put together a case against some of these uh extremists who we now know are terrorists that were organized probably by al qaeda to go in there and commit this act but we really don't know for sure exactly what's going on because the administration continues to point either in different directions as to how uh all this information should be flowing and who's responsible uh every difference kind of like uh gophers popping out of a gopher hole and trying to figure you know hit them all down which one's popping up next because they really continue to give a lot of misinformation or conflicting information with what's going on so i think from that standpoint everybody needs to continue to watch what goes on but with regards to what congress can actually do congress is not an enforcement body congress is a legislative body with some oversight authority and i used to serve on the congressional oversight and reform committee and that committee has subpoena powers with which they can use to get people to come and testify on issues such as this and which this committee did have some hearings a couple weeks ago to try and investigate exactly what went on and when that committee finds has comes with some findings they should then submit that to the judicial branch of government for enforcement if there is believed to be some sort of a crime committed of some sort of a civil punishment that needs to be meted out at this point they're still working on their report i don't know if they've actually come up with anything yet but again even the testimony in that committee was different than what the administration is saying so there's a lot of unanswered questions a lot of conflict information my advice is continue to watch this unfold and continue and all parties need to continue to press the administration for what's the truth bottom line is we have four people lost their life and that's extremely important from standpoint one was an ambassador and others are important people that are americans in american council who should have been uh defended and and their deaths need to be uh retaliated for in some way or some fashion so again we'll see see what's what happens but appreciate all the comments of concern and we'll continue to monitor ourselves thank you

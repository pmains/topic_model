OBJECTION. MR. MENENDEZ: MADAM PRESIDENT, I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AMANDA BENNET TO BE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR GLOBAL MEDIA. WHEN AUTOCRATS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN CRACKING DOWN ON INDEPENDENT MEDIA, WHEN REGIMES SILENCE OPPOSITION WITH REPRESSION AND FEAR, WHEN THEY SHUT DOWN THE INTERNET AS WE HAVE SEEN IN COUNTRIES LIKE CUBA AND IRAN, WHEN THEY ACTIVELY TARGET THE UNITED STATES AND LIKE-MINDED DEMOCRATIC NATIONS WITH DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS, IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE A CHAMPION OF DEMOCRACY AND FREE SPEECH LEADING THE U.S. AGENCY FOR GLOBAL MEDIA. SOMEONE WHO CAN MEET THE CHALLENGE POSED BY THE SPREAD OF DIGITAL AUTHORITARIANISM AROUND THE WORLD. MS. BENNET IS PREPARED TO TAKE ON THAT TASK. SHE HAS OVER TWO DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN JOURNALISM INCLUDING AS THE DIRECTOR OF VOICE OF AMERICA. FOR 23 YEARS SHE WORKED AT "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" INCLUDING AS A CORN DENT IN BEIJING WHERE SHE CAME FACE TO FACE WITH CHINA'S AUTHORITARIANISM. SHE'S SEEN HOW THE STATE FORCES WATCH. AS A FORMER DIRECTOR OF VOICE OF AMERICA, SHE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE U.S. AGENCY FOR GLOBAL MEDIA'S NETWORKS AND AMERICAN PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORTS. OVER THE COURSE OF HER CAREER, SHE SERVED ON THE BO BOARD OF TE COMMITTEE TO PROTECT JOURNALISTS. IN SHORT MS. BENNET IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THIS POSITION. SHE WILL BE A TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR THE JOURNALISTS WORKING AT USAGM AND AN EFFECTIVE STEWARD OF ITS OPERATIONS. SHE'LL ALSO BE AN INVALUABLE ALLY TO INDEPENDENT PARTNERS INCLUDING RADIO FREE EUROPE, RADIO LIBERTY, RADIO FREE ASIA. SHE'LL DEFEND THE IMPORTANCE AND INTEGRITY OF RADIO AND TV AND SHE'LL BE ACCOUNTABLE TO CONGRESS IN THESE EFFORTS. IT HAS BEEN ALMOST TWO YEARS SINCE THE AGENCY HAS HAD A SENATE-CONFIRMED CEO AT THE HELM. IT IS IN DIRE NEED OF STEADY LEADERSHIP THAT SUPPORTS INDEPENDENT MEDIUM. I ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT MS. BENNET. I RESPECTFULLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT HER CONFIRMATION AS WELL. FINALLY BEFORE I YIELD THE FLOOR, I'D ALSO LIKE TO CELEBRATE THE SENATE'S HISTORIC VOTE TODAY TO APPROVE THE KIGALI AMENDMENT TO THE MONTH -- MONTREAL PROTOCOL N. APPROVING THE KIGALI AMENDMENT, THE SENATE TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP THAT WILL HAVE ENORMOUS ECONOMIC AND TRADE BENEFITS FOR AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND JOBS. BUT IT WAS ALSO THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT CLIMATE ACTION THE SENATE AND THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE HAS TAKEN IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS. AS WILDFIRES RAVAGE THE WEST, HURRICANES DEVASTATE PUERTO RICO, AND CATASTROPHIC FUNDING INUNDATES THE MIDWEST, STRONG ACTION TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE URGENT. BY VOTING FOR THE KIGALI AMENDMENT TODAY, WE VOTED FOR MAINTAINING A LIVABLE PLANET WITH CLEAN WATER TO DRINK. WE VOTED FOR A STABLE FOOD SUPPLY FOR ALL OF HUMANITY, AND WE VOTED IN A STRONG BIPARTISAN COALITION TO KEEP AMERICAN INNOVATION AND BUSINESS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE FRAN DECISION TO CLEAN ENERGY. FINALLY, I WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR THE SUPPORT AND COOPERATION OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE'S RANKING MEMBER, THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM IDAHO, SENATOR RISCH. HIS PARTNERSHIP AND THE TIRELESS EFFORTS OF HIS STAFF WERE ESSENTIAL IN THE SENATE'S SUCCESS ON KIGALI AND I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF ON THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, DAMION MURPHY, THE STAFF DIRECTOR, ANDREW, THE CHIEF COUNSEL, JOSH CLINE, JOSH CHECKMAN, JULIA AND MEGAN BARTLET. THEY WERE ESSENTIAL IN GETTING IT TO THE COMMITTEE AND MAKING A SUCCESS. WITH THAT I YIELD THE FLOOR AND

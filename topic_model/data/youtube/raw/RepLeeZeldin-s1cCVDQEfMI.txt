here at home President Obama responds to the Orlando terror attack he could not bring himself to recognize the link between Islam and terror he could not say Islamic terror in France this morning a police officer and his wife stabbed to death in their home in front of their three-year-old son by an Isis terrorist he streamed at the event live there is a common thread to these anxiety-producing headlines the absence of leadership Angela Merkel in Germany and David Cameron in Britain come in for their fair share of criticism but it is President Obama's failure to show leadership that is truly unsettling he went to Britain to get them to stay in Europe bad move his intrusion was widely resented he backed up Angela Merkel's open-door policy to Muslim migrants bad move she's finished politically and in America he's lost in the maze of economic decline and a terror threat he thinks is all about guns no wonder the world is anxious the leader of the free world is not leading that's my take and joining us now from Capitol Hill constantly Zeldin Republican from New York mr. congressman I don't know whether you heard what I just said but I'm critical of the president because I don't think he's leading in the aftermath of Orlando your take please the world needs America to lead and I rather see jihadists on their heels in the Middle East as opposed to seeing them on offense here in the United States there's a lot more that we can be doing to improve our current system of idea in pursuing progress to close security gaps to improve intelligence there's a lot more we could be doing to continue foiling plots to prevent the next Orlando type attack to happen again we don't want to see this happen more frequently and that's why we need to defeat the threat overseas and that is why America needs our president to lead well that this is what we need to do understood can you tell me what exactly President Obama and Hillary Clinton are going to do they are I mean our intelligence network right now you know President Obama is currently occupying the White House and our intelligence network is foiling plots I mean we we are stopping attacks I've seen multiple of my home state in New York get foiled we see an effort overseas in the Middle East where we are disrupting some of the command and control of those leading these radical Islamic groups we see some disruption of their resources a some of the jihadists being killed so what we're seeing is a strategy where we're running in place we're not necessarily executing a strategy to win which is a huge problem with both what we see now and what we would see under Hillary Clinton we're playing defense it seems to me but congressman would you stay there for a second because we're learning more about the Orlando terrorist Omar mateen we already knew he had some connection to a suicide bomber but there's more actually what do we go out there talking about that this act was not just on impulse Oh a significant premeditation ahead of him buying the guns even we know hit that he basically cased the post nightclub also downtown disney and it's not clear how serious a comprehensive the surveillance of Disney was but we know that he was clearly looking for a target before he bought the gun so this suggests a far greater level of premeditation and we still have the president trying to decide whether Isis inspired this attack or whether they plotted it frankly I don't think the distinction is that important right that we were attacked in 50 days yeah the president made those comments hours after the attack when it was found he was shouting out the Mets he was shouting Allahu Akbar you know multi-car multiculturalism shouldn't Trump you know human rights now listen to what Hillary Clinton said about the concept of the lone wolf attacker roll tape we face H did ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves as president I will make identifying and stopping lone wolves a top priority congressman Zeldin I know you're still there would you comment on the whole idea of the lone wolf is that a the real name to call these people no it's totally inappropriate radical Islam is a a well organized effort that has become a multi-billion dollar enterprise where tens of thousands of people are traveling a to the Middle East for for training we're seeing it spread to the African continent Europe Asia we're seeing it now here at home what what's different between what we saw with al-qaeda 15 years ago with their attack was that they were trying to cause mass casualties through the use of an airplane well right now with a different modus operandi they are that you can grab a knife a camcorder put up a flag and you are now carrying out an Isis attack an isis-inspired attack these are lone wolves these are these are pieces that need to be connected and defeated overseas and not here home Carlos on lee zeldin Republican New York thanks for joining us so appreciate it

mr. pallazzo is recognized my purpose of amendment yes mr. chairman have an amendment at the desk you consider it read I'm asked that the reading be dispensed with well the gentleman is recognized mr. chairman my amendment is a would use unobligated balances from prior years within the Science and Technology Directorate to purchase long lead time materials for the 12th and final national security cutter as I stated at our subcommittee markup I have great concern over the lack of funding for the 12th and final national security cutter in this bill we're only one ship short of completing the one for one replacement of the high endurance cutters why are these ships needed just this Monday it was reported by the Washington Examiner that during the past two months the Coast Guard has intercepted 729 million dollars worth of cocaine from boats transporting drugs from Central America to the US a total of 53,000 pounds of cocaine Allah sees these interceptions took place in the eastern Pacific as well as the Caribbean the street value of these seizures over the past two months alone is enough to pay for just one national security cutter we have already talked extensively on this matter but back in February the president requested 1.6 billion dollars in funding for construction of a border wall the bill before us today contains five billion dollars in funding for physical barriers and associated technology well I'm fully supportive of building a wall on our southern border we can't forget that our nation has a wide open maritime border California alone has 840 miles of coastline Florida thirteen hundred and fifty miles of coastline in the Gulf Coast combined states share 1631 miles of coastline so ladies and gentlemen it is the maritime border that carries thousands of pounds of cocaine and other dangerous drugs and to our country annually destroying lives families and communities any conversation about border security is not complete unless we also address our maritime border needs for every dollar that we spend on the wall we should also be beefing up our maritime capabilities and the largest portion of that capability is the funding of our Coast Guard fleet in 2016 the Coast Guard interdicted over 6,000 illegal migrants over 201 metric tons of cocaine and choice 17 for NSCs interdicted 56.3 metric tons of cocaine with a street value of over 1.6 billion dollars this year the Coast Guard is on track for the most significant drug interdiction year in history these ships are essential and it is vital that we have 12 national security cutters to replace the 12 high endurance cutters that we are retiring out of the fleet and by almost every measure the Coast Guard is underfunded they have crumbling infrastructure and ships that are desperately in need of replacement it is the responsibility of this committee to prioritize given the Coast Guard the equipment and training that it needs so mr. chairman asked for support of this committee and of this amendment and I yield back the balance thank the gentleman for his amendment to chairman Yoder thank you Mike

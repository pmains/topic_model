Memorial Day every year looks a lot the same it won't look the same very many places this year if you did have a parade or an event planned that was probably canceled weeks ago and even with the best of efforts probably not put together for Monday but it doesn't mean that we still don't have an opportunity and an obligation in fact to remember those who serve it is in fact a unique more at Memorial Day it's a Memorial Day where 75 years ago we were just finishing the incredible devastation the devastating war of World War 2 VE Day into the war in Europe on May the 8th 75 years ago right now American soldiers were fighting at the Battle of of Okinawa just a few weeks before that two weeks before that our country and our allies had fought the fierce battle of Iwo Jima these were really the two last major battles of the Pacific one of the people who died at Iwo Jima was eighteen-year-old marine from Bates County Missouri named George Phillips on the night of March 14th an enemy hand grenade was cost was tossed into the area where his squad had sought shelter private Phillips shouted a warning and threw his body on top of their grenade saved the lives of every other person there but gave His life to save theirs for his actions that day he was a warded the Medal of Honor the citation was signed by another former Missouri soldier from Missouri President Truman honoring that bravery the kind of unhesitating bravery that has been so characteristic of American soldiers over centuries of understanding what it meant defend your family to defend your friends to defend those serving with you and in the case of our country to be willing to defend freedom to be willing to jump on the grenade to be willing to do what was necessary to protect others we have a lot to think about this Memorial Day a lot to dedicate ourselves toward as we look to a future where people continue to help others to where people continue to give selflessly and for those of those those who have served in the military to be willing to serve to be willing to pay what ever price and we stand in appreciation of that on this Memorial Day as we approach this weekend

you good afternoon everyone this is congressman pete sauber I'm so glad that you all can join me for this telephone town hall and I hope you're weathering the snow back home I will start this call with a brief overview of recent legislation legislative action and then open up the floor you for you to ask questions as you heard Kelsey say press star 3 if you would like to ask a question I want to begin by saying what an honor it is for me to represent you in Congress the responsibility endowed to me by northeastern Minnesota is not lost and is something I carry with me throughout my time as your representative in Congress I'm excited to tell you that constituent service is a central function of our office whether it's helping veterans our seniors secure the benefits they deserve coordinating a tour of our US Capitol for families visiting Washington DC or flying a flag over the US Capitol Capitol to commemorate an important event or by helping individuals navigate the difficulties of a federal agency my staff and I are here to serve you if you need assistance then I encourage you to call my office at two and eight for eight one six three nine six or visit my website at stabber dot house that Gao you know it's hard to believe we were just over 100 days into the 116th Congress and while some of the media would have you believe that Congress is broken I proud to tell you that I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find common-sense solutions to the most pressing issues facing our nation so far great bipartisan work has already been accomplished on behalf of Minnesota's 8th congressional district as some of you know I worked as a law enforcement officer in Duluth for just over two decades in that time I organized and negotiated on behalf of my Union that being said I know what it is like when the pensions you fought hard to save are at risk of being lost there are currently more than 1,400 multi-player plans covering 10 million people across the country unfortunately participants of these plans through no fault of their own are facing a dire situation for their retirement one of my main missions in Congress is to ensure Minnesotans don't lose the benefits they've worked hard to earn over a lifetime that's why it was a no-brainer for me to co-sponsor HR 397 the rehabilitation for multi employer pensions Act were commonly commonly known as the butch Lewis Act this critical legislation would help financially support these multi-employer pensions so they don't fail in millions of Americans don't see the retirement security that they earn along with protecting pensions I'm also committed to protecting Medicare and Social Security and ensuring these critical programs remain intact in fact I recently joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in sending a letter to preserve and strengthen the Medicare Advantage program for seniors in Minnesota and across this nation as Minnesota's seniors have worked their entire lives I recently sponsored hr:141 the Social Security fairness fairness act of 2019 this legislation would eliminate two provisions that have unfairly penalized educators police officers and public servants across Minnesota and the nation for hard to long by eliminating the windfall elimination provision and the government pension offset we can provide certainty to retire is who have devoted much of their lives to public service as we work with the President to secure a budget for fiscal year 2020 I will work to ensure that we continue to adequately fund these critical programs on which countless Minnesotans rely one of the biggest issues facing our nation is health care I believe that Minnesotans deserve high quality affordable and accessible health care that is patient driven and physician guided unfortunately since Obamacare was enacted health care has steadily become less affordable I believe that we can and must do better however I recently voted in favor of a 9 binding resolution supporting coverage for pre-existing conditions well I didn't particularly like the tone of the resolution I don't believe we should strip Minnesotans of Obamacare's provisions until a new and better health care law can be put in place before we repeal Obamacare both sides of the aisle must come together and work on a comprehensive plan that lowers costs increases access to quality health care and protects pre-existing conditions while I was on the campaign trail I made a promise to Minnesotans that I would protect coverage for those living with pre-existing conditions this is a promise I intend to keep so I become became a sponsor of HR 692 the pre-existing conditions Protection Act regardless of what happens in the courts this legislation will ensure that coverage for pre-existing conditions is never eroded I am so honored and humbled to have the opportunity to represent you here in Congress with that being said if you want to ask a question please press star 3 and we will get started right away thanks everyone thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber stellar Town Hall don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the Keele up next we have Doug from North Branch he is going to ask the question about legalizing marijuana Doug you are now live on the call all right yeah I uh I used to be employed as a Kim depth psych tech at a chemical dependency health recovery of center and I am myself I'm currently sober for over straight and sober for over 12 years and it's my belief that based on my experience that legalizing of marijuana would cause a lot more health problems among teens and cause a lot more car accidents on the highway I mean for recreational use and I wondered what the congressman's opinion on it is thank you okay thanks dad that's a great question so you know that's part of the discussion in the state of Minnesota and I have to bring it back to my law enforcement experience for 23 years I saw the devastating effects of drugs and I saw the devastating effects of using marijuana where it can chemically alter a young individuals development and brain and so I can say that I am NOT in favor of legalizing marijuana I think that it's a gateway drug and I think that people that use it as a young at a younger age they tend to that tend not to be quote enough for them so they have to go and experiment with with maybe a more potent drug to get them high and then they just spiral downhill I've seen that I have personally seen that in law enforcement and I can share with you that in my days at the city of Duluth Police Department I spoke to four parents about their kids using marijuana and one of the parents when I told her that her son is not only using and dealing marijuana she said oh boy I'm just glad it's not messed and I couldn't believe that because this is a highly educated woman that said that and it just so happens that three of those four individuals are not with us today they have overdosed three of the four overdosed on drugs so I think that marijuana is the gateway drug I asked my good friends who who want to possibly have it legal I said don't we have enough impaired drivers on our roads already and you want to put more impaired drivers I mean we want we have enough people right now that are chemically dependent or addicted to drugs that need treatment does that we don't need additional legalizing of a drug that that really takes the initiative out of some someone's life and I think that from my experience that I see it as a gateway drug and I would not support the legalization of smoking marijuana in the state of Minnesota all right thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber tella town hall don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue up next we have Judy who has a question about social security Judy you are now live on the call hello my question is when you were asked saying about supporting Social Security and getting it sort of last for a longer length of time you know that it would be a sound system of being able to fund Social Security and what I'm wondering is that I worked all my life and I always paid Social Security they always took it out of my check because I was below whatever the line was whether it cut up at 60 thousand or whatever was at the time I always had to pay why why don't you just make it so no matter what you earn everybody has to continue to pay there is no cut off line at the end of you know journey or or monetary as to what you can earn that would make it real solid yeah yeah I will say this I agree with you that you know my parents are in their mid 80s and they too have paid into Social Security are all their life it's a it's a something that this that we promised them and that they earn and I think that what we'll do is is for me to increase I mean to make sure that the Social Security stays for the next generation one of the things we can do is obviously have more people paying into it and we have people paying into it you know it has the ability to sustain itself longer for instance in 1964 when the Social Security was initiated 64 65 we had you know upwards of 20 30 people paying in for one right now all estimates are going to say it's about two and three quarters of a worker paying in for every recipient and so that that's not sustainable so what we have to do is get people paying in to get them in the workforce and paint getting good-paying jobs and paying into it but I'm one that wants to protect Social Security it's something that I've said it's benefits that that you earned and you were promised and we're going to keep those benefits to you there it's an important part of retirement it's an important part of making sure that we have we make that commitment to the seniors that that they deserve it and they paid into their entire life okay thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber stella town hall don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we have chair Tara and she has a quick question about Planned Parenthood Tara you are now live on the call yes I was wondering what I was wondering what your position was with the Planned Parenthood coming in to teach their morals and values and transgender and just putting their input into the school system that's a great question teryn I appreciate it you know the we have when I went to school we had we had health class and we went through some of those you know classes involving sexual education and what have you and I went to dilute Denfeld and it was I recall it was very you know you know very basic and the parents were told about it and I think that for me I've always talked about that the parents should be the you know did the real educators on this and I think that I know across some parts of the state because people have called me that that would rather not have certain people in their classroom teaching their kids about sexual education and abortion and what-have-you I think that that there's that can cause divisiveness in the classroom and amongst the the parents so I think that what we ought to do is go back I think to what we did maybe when I was growing up it was that general education general education and involving you know sexual Eddy and read a lot of the parents need to we as parents on the parents of four children we need to be the educators and talk to our kids as hard as some people think it may be I want my wife and I to be the educators primarily in that topic so I know that there's been there's been a lot a lot of concern about that and a lot of things that are talked about by certain groups that many parents quite frankly are not happy with so but my goal would be to allow the parents to be the best educators on this specific topic just like when I grew up all right thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber Keller town hall don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we have al from Bobi and here's a question about pensions al you are now live on the call mr. Bober I am Hadi I was wondering I was a member of carpenters volcko 606 up on the range and we have a pension fund out of Wisconsin and it's not doing so well but when you ask our district counsel or our international is there anything you guys can do to help us out you know they say well you guys just got to keep putting more money into that and I don't understand why we pay our district council and our internationals all this money and they spend it on special interest groups lobbyists and everything else and we can't get them to help us do something Alvis that's a great question and you know I I worked in law enforcement and I have a pension and and it was it was promised to me when I retired it has a different deferred benefit define benefit rather and so I can share this with Yael that that I signed on to the butch Lewis legislation I'm actually a co-sponsor and that has to do with the multi-employer pension bill to be able to help out these pensions that are struggling financially because it's not your fault or it's not other people's fault that paid into that pension that that they were promised security within that pension it's not your fault so what I want to do is is make sure that that we do it right and when I say that there's a lot of pensions that are doing very very very well so some of those that that need a little boost or need a little help I'm supportive of that that's exactly what the butch Lewis resolution to boost butch Lewis language the states it's about helping those out that are that are in need of help and not not taking or bringing down any of that the ones that aren't in financial straits or what-have-you so like I say I appreciate the you know your your concern and and and working as a carpenter in earning that pension so my job along with my other colleagues in Congress are to make sure that we take like I say take those pensions that are having some difficulty and give them the help they need without you know jeopardizing the ones that are that are doing very well but again if you look up the butch Lewis resolution that they co-sponsored it is it's exactly that making sure that we're protecting those the pensions that you were promised and that you earned okay thank you again everyone for joining congressman Pete Sauber's teller town hall don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we have Kathleen from Ely Kathleen has a question about immigration Kathleen you are now live on the call yes I would like to know why st. Paul is a sanctuary city and how much of our tax dollar is involved in supporting that cause well thanks thanks for the question Kathleen I hope that you're safe and sound up in Ely and he didn't get too much snow I was up there this weekend and stayed over at the Grand Ely Lodge because I had the event that morning the following morning at 8:00 and actually snow that day too so Ely Minnesota a great city so Kathleen you're talking about Wyatt st. Paul with sanctuary city you know that's a that is the the mayor of the City Council that would would dictate whether it's a sanctuary city or not so from the federal level there's not you know anything that that I could say about them but I will tell you this on immigration you know my law enforcement experience tells me that there's always the truth is somewhere between you know I mean the truth is two sides to every story and the truth is somewhere in between so I didn't I didn't rely on any news clips I didn't rely on my conference or the Democratic conference to talk about immigration I wanted to go down Kathleen I wanted to go down to the southern border and see it for myself and the week before Easter I went down to Yuma Arizona and I spoke to the Border Patrol I spoke to customs and immigration I spoke to ice I spoke to local sheriff's and every time I spoke to one of them or the groups of them I asked them is there a crisis and each of them said yes and they are overwhelmed and I'll give you an example in Yuma Arizona there is a detention center it was built for 246 immigrants when I went there they were there was 1,100 immigrants illegal immigrants in that facility they had to extend it out into the parking lot and cover it with tarp so they didn't you know so the Sun didn't beat down on them all day long and I was standing at the southern border of the Colorado River separate outside you may Arizona the Colorado River separates the United States from Canada we went down there with the Border Patrol during the day we could hear in the Colorado river's not that wide we could hear people talking on the other side of the river we couldn't see them because they were in the brush I asked the Border Patrol agent I said if they come over and just give themselves up why are they waiting till the night and he said because at night time the cartels tell these groups of people by the way each person pays between each illegal immigrant pays the drug cartel between seven and ten thousand dollars to get over so they come over at night because it forces our border personnel to come to that location where they crossed and and and what happens is on the left side and the right side you know a ways away maybe a mile or two away the drugs come across these drug runners come across and it's it's so sophisticated we don't have the personnel you know when I went down there I saw the the people taking advantage of our laws now give an example they came over on this particular night there's a 52 of them and the Border Patrol Cottam and each one of them had a child on their lap and I asked the Border Patrol when you're when they're processing these how do you know if that child's they're a legitimate child or not they said they they can't they can't ascertain that and so in an investigation they found out that these after these this these people the adults come over with a child that's considered a family under our immigration laws and what happens is within 48 hours they are released the adult and the child are released into the United States with a promise that they will return within two and five years later for their court appearance and less than 10% ever come back and show up for their court appearance and then what's happening these children then are flown back they're recycled it to honduras guatemala or else door and another group of people come back with these same kids and so I saw the devastation I saw that the people that are lost immigration must be taken advantage of and I know we can do better I support legal immigration where that immigrant wants to come to this country and live their version of the American dream illegal immigration is illegal we want to ensure that people go to the ports of entry so we know who's coming and who's going and that's critically important and I also was in the helicopter with a DEA on some parts of our border where they showed that some of these drug runners are just coming to walking across and and ninety percent of the drugs that are coming into this country are coming to our southern border and they're actually hitting and coming to our great state of Minnesota and devastating our children and family and friends I would imagine that there's probably every one of us knows a situation or knows of someone that has been affected by the illegal use of drugs I stood in front of a table that had fentanyl on it and asked the DA which fentanyl is here and the DEA agent told me there's enough fentanyl on this table to kill 11 million Americans and so I think it's just we can do better and in order for us to you know to work with cities they can't be sanctuary cities we have to have local federal and state law enforcement officers working together to keep all of our communities in all of our neighborhoods and all of our states safe thanks for the question Kathleen all right thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber tella town hall don't forget to press stars through to enter a question in the queue so up next we have Justin who has a question about addiction Justin you are now live on the call I'd like that's a question about what resources or what do we have in the works from your love on combating the drug addiction and the the outfall from that in the rural areas the local law enforcement doesn't have the resources or funding to get the resources to deal with the problem and it seems to be worse and worse all over the state what are your plans or what do you can you do to help with that Justin Justin that's a great call and you know rural Minnesota rural America matters and and I can share with you that I spoke to and I spoke to a drug addict and what he said what he told me was there's an itch inside of my head and I can't scratch it and he said that's what I deal with every day and and he's sober but he said he still deals with it and so he's working on it but to your question Justin you talked about the the addiction of rural areas we need to ensure that our that we have rural help we have rural treatment centers and that's one of the reasons that I co-sponsored HR 1767 this is the excellence and mental health and addiction treatment at which will ensure mental health and addiction services remain in rural areas so those of us in Congress on both sides of the aisle that that represent rural areas rural America and in this case rural Minnesota I want to make sure that the resources don't just come to the big cities that we keep those resources out in our rural areas and the availability and I can share with you Justin that that as a st. Louis County Commissioner that was critically important for us when we had when we raised our levee to ensure that these treatment facilities were not only in the major cities within st. Louis County but the rural areas because we know that when they're when somebody is addicted when they come in for help we need that door opened now because if that door is not open they may not come for help again and will we potentially could lose them the goal is to get them treatment as soon as practical and when they come to our facilities in rural Minnesota those doors have to be open and they have to get the treatment that they need and then they need follow-up treatment we talk about continued care not just for the time they're in that we have to follow up we call it holistic treatment for the individual but Justin that's what I'm doing from the federal level to not only authorize but appropriate that appropriate that money for our rule treatment centers and hospitals great question I appreciate it okay thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber tyler town hall don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue so up next we have a D where the question about the Enbridge pipeline a D you are now live on the call yes so good afternoon thank you for taking my call I have a I have a question that is probably right up your alley here it has to do with the Enbridge pipeline protests that have been ongoing for the last couple years and in particular what's to be done about out-of-state agitators and terrorists basically this I don't know what else to call them that are be bringing people in from other communist communist camps anarchist camps to come here and break our laws and put our citizens at risk on the 8th of May is at the Itasca County Courthouse four of these people having a having another hearing one of these people has a 30-year history of breaking law traveling the country going to different communist communist she's this one in particular has has broke into a submarine nuclear submarine years back her husband has broke into missile silos nuclear silos that was at Leavenworth this is insanity that these people are in Blackberry where I ride my horse and these people are putting us all at risk what's to be done to protect residents from these out of state people the other people with her that day were out of state she's actually a Minnesota residents but classified as a domestic terrorist I believe considering the the nuclear submarine bits the FBI discovered that the group she was with at that time they they research them as a domestic terrorist group so what is being done to stop these people and is there any way to stop people from coming to Minnesota specifically to break our laws Gladius yeah Andy that's a great question and I really appreciate it first of all I think that you're talking about the elf site and clam Lake Wisconsin and yet I'm familiar with that so let's start let's start with my let's start with my support for Android and bridge pipeline first it'll Enbridge pipeline for four and a half years has went through the process and it's not a new pipeline it's replacing the old pipeline that's corroded and needs replacing so I have I am a supporter of the replacement of M bridge 9 3 2 it's going to be able to transfer that oil in a much safer manner using our more technology and it's going to be great paying jobs to our region we know that so I am a supporter of that but to your point on the protesters first up first of all we can't if somebody breaks the law or does something illegal that's a law enforcement action and you know just recently we had in our area of northeastern northeastern Minnesota we had some damage done to some logging and trucking equipment where some people thought that those loggers and truckers were clearing some land for for the pipeline they weren't even part of it but there's hundreds of thousands of dollars so what we have to do is make sure that our law enforcement is vigilant and that we treat everybody with respect keep in mind we have we have something in this country called the First Amendment which is a freedom of speech and freedom of speech gives people the right to peacefully assemble as Martin Luther King said peacefully know as a law enforcement officer I allowed many people to peacefully demonstrate but when they started breaking the law inciting violence or riots or breaking equipment or property that becomes an unlawful activity you know one of the things that I talked about in one of our subcommittee hearings was some of these protesters are actually turning the valves on these current pipelines which is backing up which is putting pressure on the pipeline if those bursts because of that pressure it's going to be an environmental hazard and it's caused by those valve Turner's and you know I think that that you know valve turning it's an environmental issue a very high priority and we would look at that to be a federal time you know I actually spoke about this dangerous practice in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on pipeline safety a couple weeks ago you know if I'm raising this issue directly with or with the regulators but you know Adi I know when you're talking about there's some of the same people I can tell you that law enforcement in the area are you know preparing for these protests but we want we want peaceful protests not people that disrupt our everyday lives or damaged property or physically harmed people and so my goal is to support Enbridge you know and I would I would I would have hoped that our governor would have to but unfortunately he's you know he's going at least this point he supports a different Avenue of that he and I disagree on that but you know and bridge has done everything we needed that was required of them so but I think that we need to our law enforcement vigilant we're ready we need people to you know make sure that that freedom of speech is always protected in this nation but we never allow violence or you know violence speech of assaults or damage to property anybody because that's not who we are as a nation okay thank you at thank you and up next we're going to do a quick poll question for you the question is our programs like Medicare Medicaid and Social Security important to you if they are not important to you please press key one if they are somewhat important to you please press key two if they are very important to you please press key three if they are the highest concern to you please press key four again if these programs are not important to you please press key one if they are somewhat important to you please press key two if they are very important to you please press key three and if they are the highest concern to you please press key for all right thank you again for joining joining congressman pete sauber keller town hall don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we have a question from Dylan from Cook County's villains question is on renewable energy Dylan you're now live on the call hi actually my name is Darin but congressman Stauber you said you're in favor of replacing Umbridge line three and I understand and respect that however I believe our continued reliance on fossil fuel results in all sorts of environmental damage I've always seen conservation as essentially conservative protecting our public lands from exploitation helps to conserve our resources for future generations and as a Christian I believe we're commanded to care for God's creation I'm concerned about our continued reliance on coal and oil because of pollution to our land and water there was a recent pipeline spill in northern Minnesota and there's renewed mercury warnings for our fish because of coal-fired power plants we've got a great deal of potential for clean energy in Minnesota from wind and solar and advanced battery technology has the potential to reinvigorate manganese and nickel mining in our state will you oppose making it easier to drill for oil and public lands and will you work to eliminate subsidizing big oil with our tax dollars and will you oppose efforts to eliminate electric vehicle tax incentives and will you support other ways to move towards a clean energy future and thanks for the questions about five of them there let me tell you this I support the all-of-the-above energy strategy you know I co-sponsored the carbon capture modern modernization act which is going to provide for a market-based strategy that will not increase energy prices so I am all of the above and I'll give you an example Darren a couple weeks ago I was talking to somebody in our district in our northern district Minnesota aid and they brought up that same concern about you know we need more wind and solar and I said I agree let's have let's allow the market to push that forward and she and I got into a debate about my support for copper nickel mining and Polly meant I said I support it were blessed with these minerals we can do it right polyMet has met every state and federal or exceeded every faith state and federal standard and I said I in order to have a solar you need copper and and each of the windmills is thousands of pounds of copper in it and I said so wouldn't we want a mine that copper in our state with our labor standards and our EPA and our MPCA involved and she looked at me and she says well I guess so so that's going to help with the potential of having more windows out because we would be mining more copper so I am an all-of-the-above but I don't believe like Warren Buffett said he would never have got into the renewable energy in in particular wind if it wasn't subsidized that's how he made a profit and I think that if we allow the free market to put it forward I think that's the way that it's going to happen but as I said I'm all of the above strategy and we have the ability to ability to do it for sure thanks for your question during thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber stellar town hall don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue so if next we have Mike from sandstone who has a question on Border Patrol Mike you are now live on the call congressman thanks I have a good my father that has that okay uh Mike I guess my question is um mister bar touchdown on a confident a of the inadequacy of hiring said one person [Music] writing says he was not moving yes sir Mike I'm having a hard time hearing your question it's kind of Scratchy well I'm sorry is that better all right yeah mr. Barr cuts down on the inadequacies of the federal hiring process arm in reflects to like hiring Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement officers is anything being done to curve the grand prix hiring process so we're not losing qualified candidates to other positions because we have a six-month hiring process yeah so I think what you're saying like is is expedite the hiring process because quote in the meantime you know like the hiring practices are too long so these folks are going to other agencies one of the things we want to do is is like I was when I was in Toulouse at one point in time I was in charge of the Training Unit hiring police officers that's exactly the problem we came in to in Duluth we're hiring from the time they applied took the test to the actual giving them a firm date to start it was like six seven months it was too long because we were losing people in the process and I think that's what you're getting to and our goal is to you know hire as quickly as we can and get these positions filled once they once the money has been not only authorized but appropriated and so I think that the goal is to expedite that process because we're needing these ages we're needing the customs agents we're needing the Border Patrol ready to the ice when I was down there two weeks ago that's what they said that they're short personnel they're not there was three things they were concerned about increased technology in certain areas increased in the infrastructure meaning physical barriers or a wall or whatever you want to and personnel personnel is just as a priority as the other you know so I mean I just tell I can tell you from from being down in eula that we want it we want to make sure that we have the personnel hired in a timely fashion because it's low morale I remember what a Border Patrol supervisor that said at times because they're short they have to force overtime and when you have to force overtime and on a regular basis that gets to become low morale and if that's hard on them in their family so the hiring process we need to expedite that where they're needed the personnel is needed and I can tell you that the the the agents were talking about down there you talk about low morale but the catch and release basically catching the illegals and then releasing them in it with a promise that they will appear for their court date between two and five years from now and we know that less than ten percent of them do but I was very proud of the men and women in law enforcement at the border patrol immigration the customs and the DEA along with the local sheriff's coming from law enforcement background very proud of what they did but Mike I understand what you're saying but there is a process we know that their personnel needed in certain areas of government and it's not only law enforcement it's other areas there's a judicious way to hire them and I agree we can speed that up and that's one of the things we like to look at and put forward okay thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber tell a town hall don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we have a question from Gerald from ablis his question is on Medicare Gerald you are now live with the congressman thank you for taking my call hi Gerald my concern is about advantage insurance companies that take the Medicare payments from the people and they won't pay their 80% they want to keep all the money this happened to me before another issue is government contracts every one of them they bid on the contract to get a contract but all of them have cost overruns why can't they be held at the what they bid for another thing is transparency people got a million and a half million point seven million dollar bonuses but they won't let us see who got the bonuses that should be put a trade on the internet for everybody to see thank you here Gerald thanks thanks for the question you know your your spot-on you talked about the Medicare payments you know the Medicare Part A is a you know they talk about potentially in 2026 that is they run out of funding and our job is to ensure that it doesn't happen because you paid into Medicare your entire life that's a promise this government told us and it's a promise we must keep and so we look at the payments unless you're in Medicare or Medicaid or Medicare Medicare Advantage or Part D some of it's confusing even for the people that are delivering those services it's hard for them to comprehend the levels involved in the information needed to make a real wise choice in the Medicare but you know I want to stress the importance of Medicare Advantage which provides beneficiaries but more choice which is essentially important but it's especially important in a rural areas Lake Minnesota 8th congressional district generally talk about government contracts everybody that that you know puts in gets a contract one of the things that we did at st. Louis County when I was there was you know the the lowest responsible bidder it wasn't the lowest bidder that got the job you know on the RFP that was put out it was the lowest responsible bidder because we know and we knew coming in for whatever service we were asking for we needed somebody that was responsible and there are times our government doesn't give the the contract to the responsible that are just the lowest and sometimes that's not the best thing to happen so we know that in cost overruns that's a lot of times these contracts will allow cost overruns up up to a certain point and that too needs to be looked at the cost overruns cannot be just part of the the contract just an automatic overrun on each issue for that for the the people that providing the contract so those are things that we absolutely need to look at and then we talked about transparency I couldn't agree with you more we need to be more transparent in this administration the president right now is talking about drug transparency why is is a certain pill or a certain drug why is it costing 360 dollars in our country and you know 50 dollars in another country or why is the price of insulin the way it is and our president and this administration that I believe that we want to get down and be and have the ability to get these drug prices not only transparent to but to be affordable for us there was no reason that somebody who in for instance is on insulin should have to make the decision between the insulin or food or paying for the bills or what-have-you we can do better as a country we can do better and I know the I know there's answers out there and you know we're right we're right in the Battle of of having those discussions are here in Washington but the bottom line is Medicare Medicare Medicaid ought to be protected will be protected and it's something that they're not always an easy solution to that but I think that when we put our heads together and and forget about party lines we can do great things to ensure not only for your generation Jerald in mine but the future okay thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber Stella townhall don't forget to press star 3 to enter a question in the queue so up next we have a question from Sid and who lives in Chisholm Sid has a question about social security said you're now live on the call hello hello ed hi congressman barber congratulations first on your being elected it's a body here we've got honey who knows what's going on and is doing something about all of the issues that occur in Minnesota first I would like to make a comment that many of the callers that you have spoken to today and very good callers but I'm not sure if everyone knows about the magazine thinking Minnesota that just came out some excellent articles on alternative energy where it would cost the family 1,200 dollars more per year and a very good article on the tale of two Tim's and not to ridicule him but my concerns are as follows number one why is Minnesota here the number one income tax state in the country and we're always either one three or five and the other is why is Minnesota one of 12 states that still backs senior citizens on Social Security benefits and then just a comment on line three I appreciate your stance in support of line three as I think many Minnesotans are but you'll find that in that article in that thinking Minnesota magazine you'll find an article on the tale of two Tim's and he wants tax on gas and I get such credit to Paul gazelka for standing up for not increasing taxes when you don't have to and I could go on and on the other comment that I want to make is is it possible you have the power to turn the snow off in northeastern Minnesota what said I said I appreciate those comments I the easy answer will be to your last question no I don't but i but I can tell you the hardy Minnesota workers I will put up I will put us up against any worker in the country you know when it was a 70 below some of my colleagues would say how do you work in 50 60 70 below winters and I said you know what those are just another day for us in northern Minnesota that's what we do and they just ripped their head you know but we're very Hardy so chance your last question I have no power in it we'll enjoy it because soon enough we'll have the leaves and everything the grass will be green and we'll be enjoying our spring and summer but you know Sid you talk about that you talk about you know social security those are those are benefits that you earned and we promise and I am I am going to do whatever I can to ensure that that nobody takes that away from our seniors and people that are that have it right now that that you can you can rely on it you can count on it I'm not going to I'm not going to you know you know support any cuts to that like some people you know you want to say and as far as the income tax in the state you know I I I will say this that I am representing you on the federal level but you have to understand whether I agree or not agree with governor walls on whatever issue we're talking about I can say this I am a states right person that's a Tenth Amendment that does that which is which which is not given to the federal government goes back to the states I always believe that the more local the government the best and we can just go right from right from the townships to our Township supervisors and try jurors and Township board members to our local City Council council members or mayor's our county board members that is that is I've always said that's where the rubber meets the road so as far as a state income tax that that's a state you know we have to talk doors you would have to talk to the state officials and discuss that but I also this I've been I've been just privileged to serve an elected office for a number of years I have never had someone say that they don't want to pay taxes what I have had them say is please use our taxes to dis judiciously and wisely and that's what we're trying to do and that's what I am trying to do not putting mandates on the state of Minnesota or any other state for that matter without the operations to follow because I've been there as a as not only a city councillor but but accounting a county commissioner so and then you talk about line three I talked to the gentleman from up the shore I support alternative forms of energy I support line three you know there's a there's a there's the way the market can drive it and I think that we need to you know we need to understand we have the ability in northern Minnesota we have to we are so blessed with not only the minerals in the ground but the the workers we have and the labor standards we have the EPA we have I talked about the MPCA those are all regulatory agencies that help us be the best and the cleanest and the most vibrant I think that said you know with that I don't know if I answered your question but you know what I want to and will protect the social security the income tax reference the state is really that state issue and I did see the article about the the to Tim's I did read that but just know that I want to and privilege to be here as your representative all of you and I'm just thankful that you stayed on the call and and you know we're hearty we this old firm that we're having it's going to be here in Ghana we're going to be just fine all I say is is drive safe thanks for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime to serve you in our congressional district and I just love the healthy dialogue and I am I'm going to get back to work we're to be going on the House floor here real soon so I think we have time for one more question all right everyone so our last question is going to go to Christina her question is about military benefit Christina you're now live on the call with the congressman yes pete sauber how are you today hi Christina thanks for calling yeah you're welcome i ed i i'd want to get in contact with you about a month ago so I did call your secretary but I wanted to talk about the year claims for the military to get military benefits yeah I I'm I have entered a disabled veteran and I'm one of many that have it has taken like 10 to 20 years to get my benefits and I was wondering if you could possibly talk to Donald Trump about changing the the year claim and making it a longer chance for people to get are you talking about listing from the time maybe you developed something due to your military experience until they diagnosed it right no no you only have a year within to disagree with oh I see I see okay Parisa okay got it well I'd say what Christina thanks for the call and secondly thanks for your service to this country I really really appreciate the men and women who serve our country in our all-volunteer military force I had the privilege of this past weekend to speak to the Minnesota National Guard both enlisted and the officers and it was just a privilege for me so your military benefits you will not have a bigger champion than Pete Stivers protecting your military benefits the benefits that this country promised you and the benefits that you earn and with that being said I always I I will always say this Christina I have the privilege of spending the rest of my life with whom I consider the greatest veteran of life and that's my wife Jodi the former command chief of the 148th Fighter Wing an Iraq war veteran who also understands and enjoys those benefits that she was promised in that she earned just like everyone else so I will look into that that process but I will tell you and this is for anybody on the line you know we have we have the highest priority for this office is constituent services back in the district and we have people on staff that are dedicated to working on case loads on case work for you and it's that's the most important thing that we do is constituent services back home in my office I get to help seniors and Betts and other people who have concerns on other navigating other federal issues or federal agencies so Cristina I will say this if you're still there please call our office we will get you specifically tied into the pace worker in our office that that that specializes in our veterans and I think that's very important but to your point I will look at that what I hear you saying is that appeal process give that appeal process a little bit of a longer time so I think that's important but again I want to Christina thank you and everybody on this phone call if you are a veteran for your service and if you are a family of a veteran for your service as well because we know when the service member serves or is deployed the family stays back home and in their own important way they serve this nation as well so I appreciate the question okay so again we're going to wrap it up I want to thank you all for participating in the telephone town hall I really appreciated the productive discussions and value your feedback and again it's an honor to serve you in Congress and if you ever need anything please never hesitate to reach out to me or my staff and we can be reached at area code

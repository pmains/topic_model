or angus king of maine senator thanks so much for being here good morning Alison what do you make of what President Trump is doing to his own attorney general yesterday he tweeted a very eyebrow-raising tweet I'll read it so why aren't the committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered AG looking into Krueger Hillary's crimes and Russia relations then this morning just in the past hour or so he tweeted Attorney General Jeff Sessions had taken a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes where emails in DNC server and Intel leakers what do you make of this well I had an old professor in law school years ago Allison who said when in doubt read the statute and Jeff sessions under Department of Justice regulations had no choice but to recuse himself I don't know whether the president has ever seen those regulations whether anybody has ever read them to him but the regulations basically say no person can participate an investigation of a campaign if they were involved in the campaign it could have been written for this situation Rudolph Giuliani yesterday said he had no choice but to recuse himself right and you know as you mentioned in your opening Jeff sessions was was Donald Trump's principal first supporter in the Senate and one of the loudest voices campaigned with him and he mentioned the word loyalty yesterday in my world loyalty is a two-way street where does it tell you about president Trump's mindset or his loyalty to his early supporters or who would take this job next if he were to get rid of Jeff Sessions well I think that's a legitimate question and whether the Senate would confirm someone under these circumstances particularly if there was some implication or understanding that the new Attorney General would try to cut off the investigation by robert muller that the FBI is undertaking for a senator I just worry I want to ask you about that because industrial we haven't seen wide scale Republicans willing to go against something that President Trump wants so are you feeling as though this Jeff Sessions is a tipping point and that if the president were to find some sort of other loyalists who would take the job that Republicans in Congress would vote against that person well I I think you're going to have to ask some leading members of the Republican caucus I think I noticed you're going to have John Cornyn on later this morning you want to ask him that question but it raises the question of will they go along and got to remember Jeff sessions is a man of the Senate he gave up a safe Senate seat he'd been here 20-plus years and he has many friends I didn't vote for him but many you know he was confirmed so I think the Senators are going to be very skeptical about this again particularly if there's an an overt or or Subrosa understanding that the mulher investigation will go away as part of this I think at that point everybody in the Congress is going to say no we can't tolerate this my expectation is you'd see a special prosecutor passed by veto-proof majorities in both houses and the investigation would continue but you know who knows I mean nothing is predictable around here from one day to the next yeah truer words never spoken okay what plan are you voting on today for health care let me give you a quick synopsis of what I know about the bill that we're going to be voting on this afternoon well I'm absolutely serious there is no one who knows I talked to two senior Republicans at last Thursday afternoon I said what are we going to be voting on on Tuesday they said we have no idea I think it's going to be the House bill but then there may be a substitute amendment and it's I've never seen a process like this no hearings no discussion this is really to quote a famous American complicated stock and to be talking about one-sixth of the US economy and tens of millions of people without any understanding of what the implications are I just I really don't understand it and I think one of the dilemmas the Republicans are going to have today is they're going to say okay well let's give them the vote to start the debate but then if it's one of these terrible bills and by the way the best of the bills kicks 22 million people off of health insurance that's the best one of the three one of the goes up to 30 million then they're going to have to maybe vote against it and then they're caught in the well I voted for it and then I voted against it that's a bad place to be it seems to me as this thing unfolds why is Mitch McConnell put you in this position why aren't you doing it the regular way I think that they are just obsessed with this idea of we talked about repealing replaced for seven years and now we we have to we have to deliver on it but they've not been able to settle on an alternative that will garner a majority even within the or a fifth over 50 votes and so they're just going to it's sort of throwing darts at the wall at this point but it's it's we're talking about real people's lives I'm talking about people and man thousands of people who are going to lose health insurance are going to the government's going to the states gonna have to choose between disabled people and and seniors because of the German dramatic Medicaid cuts I mean this is this is real people this we shouldn't be doing this on this kind of oh well we made a promise five years ago we ought to be talking about how do we fix it how do we make it work and how do we protect people's lives yeah senator I only have a few seconds left but we had Senator Bill Cassidy on our program on Friday he said that he felt the Gramm Cassidy bill which is his of course and gives power back to governor's to make healthcare decisions for their states he felt that that had 50 votes do you know anything about that plan I don't I don't know exactly how it would work but I think the big question is how is it funded if you're giving flexibility to the states but you're cutting Medicaid by three quarters of a trillion dollars over the next ten years that to me is a false flexibility that's the flexibility to choose as I said between elderly disabled and kids or raise taxes it's basically shifting costs from the federal government to the states now I don't know how Senator Cassidy's bill fits within that category but if it still got the major Medicaid cuts then I think it's going to be very hard to get a majority of votes senator angus King we are on the edge of our seat to see what happens there with the vote just as you are thanks so much for being on new day Thank You Alice

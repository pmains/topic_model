uh in a challenging global economy the strength of our capital markets is a vital to long-term economic growth yet regulatory burdens and bureaucracy are preventing small businesses from thriving and hindering the united states ability to compete globally small businesses which are the fuel that powers our economic engine make up 99 of all enterprises in the united states and employ almost half of our workforce prior to the covet 19 pandemic roughly three-quarters of all small businesses relied on financing in the last 12 months nearly 70 percent of startups received less financing than they initially requested while 28 received no financing at all the fact is most people don't realize it but 80 percent of business debt financing comes from investors in our capital markets not from banks the us continues to experience a slump in the number of new businesses which hit a 2016 which in 2016 hit a 40-year low last year showed a spark in ipos that broke that disturbing trend until 2020 our economy launched half the number of domestic ipos than it had 20 years ago at the same time the u.s doubled the regulatory compliance cost of business incurs just one of the myriad reasons why the decline in traditional ipos is the cost of doing going public costs associated with quote going public are high because investment bankers lawyers and auditors collectively charge millions of dollars to prepare the lengthy registration statement that is required to be filed with the sec before any shares can be sold additionally a series of regulatory burdens placed on public companies only adds even more costs to these companies the sec estimates the s cc estimates the average cost of just achieving initial regulatory compliance for going public in a traditional ipo is two and a half million dollars with an annual compliance cost averaging 1.5 million dollars after that these costs are prohibitive for small and other emerging companies focused on growing their businesses as a result more companies are opting for private fundraising over the costly hassle of entering our public markets in 2016 private offerings in the us raised nearly five times the equity as ipos in 1997 8 84 companies were listed on exchanges in the us since then the number of companies on the exchanges has decreased by more than half which results in fewer investment choices for everyday main street mom and pop investors in the u.s there are two 242 unicorns startups with valuations of more than a billion dollars that were privately financed as of november 2020. that's called a herd of unicorns those aren't unicorns conversely as more businesses today remain privately funded instead of going public number of publicly held companies has declined the levels not seen since the 1980s declining ipos only hurt everyday american consumers as i said because there are fewer opportunities for them it's important to note that while the us ipo market has steadily decreased until last year foreign markets specifically china are growing china's annual gdp growth remains approximately 6.2 percent despite the recent trade war additionally in 2020 mainland china was the only major economy to achieve positive economic growth china's ipo market produced over one-third of the world's ipos in 2020 reporting 536 out of the 1363 ipos across all global markets beijing's made in china 2025 agenda lays out its plan to dominate the high-tech biotech and artificial intelligence industries within the next 10 years additionally experts predict more ipo activity and mainland china's 14th five-year plan which is designed to boost ipos in specific sectors throughout direct financing increased pressure on from foreign markets only heightens the necessity for immediate action and reform republicans support making our public markets more attractive make no mistake china is aggressively pursuing policies that challenge us economically this includes the ipo space republicans and democrats must work together to continue to make our capital markets the envy of the world given the capital formation issues facing american companies the decline in ipos over the last several decades this committee needs to be focused on legislative and regulatory frameworks that make our public markets more attractive and preserve various paths for companies to pursue going public i look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and i yield back

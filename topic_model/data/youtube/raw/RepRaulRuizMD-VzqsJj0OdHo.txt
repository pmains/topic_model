i rise today to tell the story of my constituent alejandro camacho of palm desert a veteran who has been affected by our military's use of toxic burn pits and to call for action after graduating from la quinta high school alejandro served our nation in the u.s marine corps from march to september 2009 he was stationed in south sinjar iraq at great personal sacrifice to himself alejandro bravely served as a member of the third light armored reconnaissance battalion even missing the birth of his own son jacob while he was stationed overseas every single day in south sinjar alejandro breathed in toxic fumes particular matter and carcinogens from the batteries medical waste and jet fuel that was burned in large burn pits on his base and when he returned home the effects of breathing in those toxic fumes started taking a toll in his body in 2019 alejandro was diagnosed with embryonal carcinoma an aggressive form of testicular cancer he and his doctor believed his diagnosis to be linked to his exposures to fumes from burning jet propulsion eight fuel a known human carcinogen when alejandro underwent the excruciating chemotherapy process his body fell apart he lost 50 pounds he lost feeling as his hands and feet and he constantly heard ringing in his ears despite being deemed 40 percent disabled despite his repeated exposure to jet fuel fumes and despite the diagnosis the va denied his claim for coverage and you know why because the va said there wasn't quote unquote enough evidence to establish a connection between his burn pit exposure and the cancer he developed look i'm an emergency medicine physician and a public health expert and in public health and in medicine it is practice that if there is a high enough suspicion based on the evidence available of a harm that causes a severe enough illness then we need to act on that suspicion we can't afford to wait decades like we did with agent orange for that perfect study to establish a perfect causality between burn pit exposure and cancers in pulmonary conditions our veterans are developing and dying from right now there is enough evidence to act and we must act for veterans like alejandro and help him get the health care and benefits he earned when we sent him to war for our country alejandro is now cancer free but the fight continues to get him the benefits he deserves we're making real progress bipartisan progress on this front with legislation like the honoring our pact act which takes an aggressive and comprehensive approach to the urgent health care crisis that veterans like alejandro are facing this legislation will keep our nation's promise to our veterans that we will take care of them after they serve our nation it contains my bill the presumptive benefits for war fighters exposed to burn pits and other toxins act it creates a presumption of service-related illnesses due to burn pits in order to take care of our veterans so i urge this body to take up this bill to support alejandro and the rest of our heroes in uniform thank you and i yield back you

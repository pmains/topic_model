madam Speaker I rise today along with my colleagues to talk about restoring Congress's constitutional oversight on matters of war and peace I invite all of my colleagues to join me in demanding that this house immediately repealed the 2001 authorization for the use of military force nearly 16 years ago Congress passed an open-ended blank check for endless war this authorization gives any president the authority to wage limitless limitless war at any time anywhere for any reason in perpetuity the boat to relinquish our constitutional authority occurred just three days after the horrific terrorist attacks on 9/11 the American people were angry and anxious to take action madam Speaker I was just as outraged and devastated as every other American but I voted against this 2001 AUMF because I believe then as I believe now that it was a blank check and state set the stage for perpetual war this house rushed to pass the 60 word authorization with little debate 60 words madam Speaker 60 words drastically altered history in almost 16 years since its passage the 2001 AUMF which was designed mind you to punish the perpetrators of the brutal and deadly attacks on September 11 has been used now by three presidents to wage endless war around the globe a recent report from the Congressional Research Service shows that this authorization has been used more than 37 times in 14 countries to justify military action these include operations at Guantanamo Bay warrantless wiretapping and recent military actions in Libya Syria Somalia and Yemen and many more and this report only looks at unclassified military actions our

three four five minutes thank you very much thank you chair to get for holding this hearing on such an important issue this committee has a long history of conducting oversight of the federal government's response to the seasonal flu the flu is a leading cause of death in the United States thousands of Americans die from flu every year and hundreds of thousands of Americans are hospitalized last flu season alone the CDC estimates it up to forty two point nine million people got sick with the flu up to six hundred forty seven thousand individuals were hospitalized and up to sixty one thousand two hundred individuals died from the flu individuals 65 years and older accounted for ninety percent of the deaths and 70% of the hospitalizations for the 2017-2018 flu season in light of this tremendous burden on our seniors in February of this year I along with Republican leaders Walden and dr. Burgess wrote to the CDC director about whether the CDC is doing enough to improve flu vaccine coverage and she wrote in to promote high-dose in a Jew van juvett day and flu vaccines I practice that word twice I've already took and get it out while we examine how to improve the response of seasonal flu we know the best way to prevent getting the seasonal flu is to get vaccinated each season if you have if you have not already gotten your flu vaccine this season please go get your flu vaccine today although the flu vaccine does not have the level of effectiveness of other well-known vaccines it is absolutely better than doing nothing the flu vaccine saves thousands of lives each year the flu vaccine also helps reduce severe outcomes when someone does become sick with the flu according to CDC data about 80 percent of the flu associated with deaths in children have occurred in children who were not vaccinated moreover a 20-17 studies showed that the flu vaccine also reduces severe outcomes and hospitalized patients have questions today on how we can continue to improve the flu vaccine preliminary CDC data shows that the seasonal flu vaccine was only 29% effective for the 2018-2019 flu season the lowest that has been in a decade for more than 70 years most flu vaccines administered in the United States have been made through the egg-based manufacturing process we have seen some innovation over the last decade however with the introduction of the new manufacturing technologies using a cell or recombinant DNA technology most of the flu vaccine does dose is distributed in the United States are still manufacturing the egg bakes process indeed the CDC estimates at about 82 percent of the projected vaccine supply produced for the 2019 22 flu season we produced using egg based manufacturing technology while the remaining vaccine will be produced these in the cell base and recombinant technology during the hearing on March 2018 dr. Rick bright an HHS deputy secretary for preparedness and response testified that we can improve the effectiveness effectiveness of a vaccine in four ways expand domestic domestic capacity for the sale base or recombinant based technologies enhancing the effectiveness use of flu vaccines in the addition of adjuvants and/or higher doses of antigen conduct clinical trials to expand vaccine in all age groups and continue to modernize the vaccine production processes for speed and flexibility at that hearing dr. bright noted that cell based in recombinant based technologies offer greater speed and flexibility than the traditional egg-based manufacturing process and some studies have shown that they may also be more effective than at bistec egg-based vaccines for these reasons I was pleased to see the president make modernizing and improving improving influenza vaccines a top priority through his executive order of September 19 2019 modernizing flu vaccines will help protect lives through prevention and promote public health and national security endemic and seasonal flu are interdependent and our approaches to seasonal and pandemic flu of influenza are inextricably interwoven what we do in our 1 in 1 area directly impacts the other area for example when we expanded our domestic manufacturing capacity for pandemic response manufacturers then also have the capacity to include an additional flu strain in this seasonal vaccine moving from three strain to four strain seasonal vaccines for better coverage I appreciate the administration's commitment to improving our flu preparedness I welcome all of today's witnesses and look forward to today's discussion about how we can keep Americans healthy during flu season and improve our federal response to both pandemic and seasonal flu and I yield back

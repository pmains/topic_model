well thank you mr. chair I would say that every level of government needs to get it better than the way that we have the current laws current rules current regulations whether it's the federal government whether it's the regional councils whether it's the state government so earlier on when we're having a debate on the underlying bill and I was talking about the fluke fishery for commercial fishermen 50 pounds a day for seven days 350 pounds you're not gonna let them catch 350 pounds in one day you'll make them catch 50 pounds a day for seven days while the neighboring state of New Jersey could do 500 pounds a day for three days well guess what happened today talking about not getting in other levels of government our governor in New York State and have no notice cuts off the commercial fuke fishery these people are struggling to make ends meet so instead of pointing fingers and other levels of government and regional councils where everyone's making mistakes and no one gets it how about we do our part how about we get it how about we listen to them we hear from them we make a difference we are leaders we are elected to represent our people I'm elected to represent my people and I would respectfully urge my colleagues especially those who are from faraway places several hundred miles away to do a better job listening and allowing me to represent my folks and stop trying to undercut people who are hardworking business owners struggling to make ends meet especially when science is on our side a yield back

gentleman from new hampshire is recognized for such time as he may use well thank you madam speaker and i want to thank chairman pallone for yielding i rise today and urge the swift passage of h.r 26 30. this legislation will save american lives by getting deadly chemical fentanyl analogs off our streets and allowing law enforcement to swiftly bring drug traffickers to justice the cdc reports that there were more than 50 000 deaths involving all synthetic opioids in the 12-month period ending in july 2020 50 000 deaths in 12 months the addiction crisis has worsened as a result of this pandemic and this is not the time to let regulations lapse or to back away from our commitment to get people the help that they need my state of new hampshire like so many has been hit incredibly hard by fentanyl and its chemical analogs chemical versions of fentanyl are ever changing and we know that traffickers intentionally make small variations and substances knowing that the scheduling process may take months in order to place these deadly drugs on schedule one where they belong this means that traffickers are often one step ahead of law enforcement this legislation helps prevent that by ensuring all fentanyl analogs are categorized as schedule one the dea first issued a temporary order in february of 2018 and congress wisely passed legislation extending that order through may 6th my legislation the extending temporary emergency scheduling of fentanyl analogs act would extend that order and again ensure that constantly changing chemical versions of fentanyl often smuggled in from mexico and china are labeled as schedule 1. the bill will prevent our communities from being flooded with synthetic opioids and will ensure that those trafficking them will be held accountable without delay people are in a fight for their lives right now our country continues to be ravaged by addiction to let down our guard at this moment would cause unmistakable harm to our families and our communities i'm hopeful that we will see swift bipartisan action in congress to grant this extension i urge passage of this bill and i yield back my time

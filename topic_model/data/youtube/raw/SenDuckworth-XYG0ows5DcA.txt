so thank you for being here this afternoon sixteen years ago this month a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missiles seared into Iraq beginning a war that would forever change my life in the lives of so many others I deployed the next year a proud member of the Illinois Army National Guard stationed in Balad a place nicknamed more to reader Ville because of the constant enemy attacks and a spot just miles away from where an RPG would tear through my Blackhawk helicopter that November I probably should have died that day I still remember the light rain coming down that morning and I still remember the rare treat of a milkshake in the Green Zone that I've had that afternoon but most of all I remember the scorching heat and deafening roar of the blast it cost me both my legs and nearly my life as well the only reason I didn't bleed out on that dusty better battlefield was a heroism of the troops around me my buddies didn't know if I was alive or dead but they lived every word of the soldier's creed refusing to leave me behind even risking their own lives in the process so from the moment I woke up in Walter Reed eleven days later I vowed to spend my life trying to repay the troops who saved me that afternoon I can't fly combat missions anymore or be the one to drag them out of a burning Blackhawk if the worst should ever happen again but what I can do is use my new role serving no longer from the pilot's seat but from my seat on the Armed Services Committee to make sure that the Armed Forces that I love are the strongest that they can be today we have the greatest military on earth but that may not be true tomorrow if we keep on the path that we've been treading the national defense strategy rightly points out the need to prepare for great power competition with China and Russia and I support the NDS call for investing in hypersonic missiles directed-energy weapons and a future vertical lift program Congress must also prioritize significant investments in our military's logistics systems and mobility capabilities we pour roughly six hundred billion dollars into defense annually this week the administration asked set aside more than 700 billion dollars for defense in next year's budget alone and Pentagon spending already accounts for more than half more than half of the discretionary federal budget but just funneling money into the DoD's budget is not enough if we want to win tomorrow's wars we have to reject yesterday's oversimplified view of what constitutes national strength for far too long we've measured the might of our military by the size of our arsenal and in doing so we've made the flawed assumption that our decades of dominance on the global stage can predict our future place in the world but Isis doesn't care that we stormed the beaches of Normandy Russia isn't giving us points because once upon a time we outrace them to the moon and China doesn't give a damn what we did during Desert Storm we will lose ground literally and figuratively if we sit back and assume that last century's tactics will win us next decades Wars and we believe that 2030s battles will be decided solely by how much money we spent on fighter jets or on ships you know I come from a long line of veterans who serve this country in uniform since washing since before Washington crossed the Delaware and I myself spent 23 years in the military I will always always make sure that our troops have every dollar every weapon that they need to bring down the bad guys but despite what the president proposed this week we can't just keep throwing together huge defense budgets every year and think that that's enough no instead we need a platform that balance is investing in our weaponry with investing in our citizenry in investing in our economy rejecting the false choice between looking out for our troops overseas and caring for our families here at home it's not either/or it's both and our power abroad stems from our strength here on US soil so it's past time that we recognize that funding on domestic priorities actually bolsters on national security because at this point refusing to invest in our schools or our health care system in the name of national strength isn't just cruel it's short-sighted recently for example the Pentagon announced it only 29 set of Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 are considered fit to serve just 29% the other 71% either failed the basic math or English test could not pass a physical or barred from and listening because they made a mistake years ago that still lies on their record like getting caught with marijuana in a state where it's now legal or once struggling with an opioid addiction meanwhile the army fell short of its recruiting goal last year for the first time since the height of the Iraq war so I'm not pushing for more funding for pre-k or mental health care just because they're progressive priorities or even because it's the right thing to do I'm doing so because I love our country because I want our armed forces to remain the strongest in the world and we don't stand a chance of dominating militarily if three-quarters our would-be recruits can't even get to basic training I'm doing so because out plays on top of the global order its contingent on us taking up the domestic policies that are too often is seen as in opposition to our defense priorities if we don't well then we're just going to be letting our dwindling recruit improve shrink even faster ceding our place in the world to bad actors like Russia and China in the process there are easy obvious ways to expand that pool policies that show both common sense and common decency when I was bleeding out in that blackhawk helicopter in that dusty field in Iraq I did not care if the troops risking their lives to save me were gay straight transgender black white male or female all that mattered was that they did not leave me behind if you're willing to put your life on the line for this country and you can do the job you should be able to serve no matter how you identify or whether you were born on US soil since freed slaves put on the uniform of the nation that had kept them in Chains since japanese-americans fought for this country even while their families sat trapped in internment camps here at home since women refused to be grounded smashing through glass ceilings to fly more than 10,000 feet in the air to help topple the Nazis and since Perry Watkins stood in camouflage as a proud gay man refusing to be forced out of service because of who he loved how differences have made us a more effective fighting force scientific research and four-star generals will tell you the same thing when everyone looks and acts and thinks the same you become stuck flat-footed insular diversity leads to more creative problem-solving and more success it's a better expression of who we are as a country it also makes us better able to execute missions and downrange with fewer people enlisting as the years go on we should be celebrating every person who serves we should be honoring those immigrants who can't even vote yet but who loved this country so much they're willing to put on her uniform and die for it but instead we're turning them away kicking them out deporting people like Miguel Perez jr. who went to Afghanistan to defend his nation then was tossed aside when he got back home and deported to Mexico where he's now homeless and penniless look I know that some people in power never deign to put on the uniform but bone spurs did not stop me from serving so let me be clear let me say something for those folks our military is the greatest in the world it is the greatest award has ever seen not in spite of our differences but because of them bigotry has no place downrange and winnowing our military in this way weakens our forces and in dangers our country so step one is simple stop discriminating against people who can do the job step two begin tackling the systemic issues that are robbing us of so many would-be recruits how do we expect to win the wars and to come if more and more Americans are too sick or have fallen too far behind in school to enlist we can't we will lose our place in the world if we don't do the work today to ensure as many people as possible can wear the uniform tomorrow and that starts with addressing the fact that half of young Americans are considered too unhealthy to serve some far suffer from asthma or hard-of-hearing about 27% are deemed too overweight to enlist and these numbers are only supposed to balloon in the years to come so let's be brutally honest the recent attempts to strip away how careful millions were cruel enough but they were also hypocritical every time our government makes it harder for an American to get health care they are sapping the military's potential strength robbing it of potential privates or second lieutenants even while claiming we need to spend more money making our armed forces more powerful there are fixes here that should not be considered partisan like putting more money into schools fitness programs or initiatives like the National School Lunch Program which has led to a 23% spike in fruit eating among kids something that as a mother of four year old I can tell you is quite a feat or making sure that every child in every classroom in America has access to mental health care or guarantee that every parent can afford basic checkups for their toddlers or I don't know maybe just maybe those in power should stop trying to take a we're away Americans health care in the middle of the night listen the military already pours more than 1.5 billion dollars a year into treating obesity-related medical conditions discharging those too unhealthy to serve and replacing those discharged with new recruits who have to be trained from scratch spending more training dollars so no one can claim to care about military spending or readiness if they don't support the common-sense health care policies that would actually get our forces into better fighting shape and save us money in the process it's a similar story when it comes to education there's something wrong when a third of potential recruits can't serve because they either failed the military's entrance exam or never earned a high school diploma or a GED that figure is shocking but not surprising reflecting the larger reality that half of US adults can't read a book at an eighth grade level but here too there are concocted ways that we can solve the problem research has proven that early childhood learning directly affects long-term development with studies showing that at-risk kids who attend Goodes preschools are 44 percent more likely to graduate in high school in 2015 a pentagon study review that a hundred and twenty five billion dollars of its budget was lost a bureaucratic waste another hundred million partially paid for by your tax dollars went straight into the wallets of just five civilian contracting firm CEOs imagine how many more kids would graduated if we had invested some of that 250 billion dollars worth of money in Chicago's public schools or headstart programs instead and we don't make these investments if we keep lending our schools slide and our students suffer imagine how many would be Green Berets or Marines we'd be losing if we don't start to better invest in our kids we might lose out on that next Blackhawk bail of helicopter pilot brave enough to risk their life to put an injured an injured buddy out of their helicopter or the next Navy admiral who otherwise may have led the raid to capture the next Osama bin Laden it's never been a choice between schools and national security despite what some might suggest as they tried to slash billions from the education budget last year or to try to redirect some cash for some emergency made-up emergency at the border just an investing in future vertical lift aircraft is a much needed investment in our army so too is investing in the child who could be capable of flying that helicopter one day so too is funding for the stem programs that ensure that folks in the private sector as well will have the skills they need to develop the next generation of weapons platforms this is not just about investing in human capital we can't sit on the sidelines and on us our adversaries lead the way developing the tech that will decide the global power order in the years to come as China is investing to win the next space race and Russia skates past us in quantum computing and we're putting our troops in danger of losing those battles if we don't invest in technologies that will help us compete in this century's battle fields whether that's a stretch of sand in Southwest Asia or a piece of code that holds up our electrical grid technical technology like AI and hypersonics and future vertical lift and supercomputers all of which would determine our standing in the world all of which Americans could learn to develop if we had better stem funding and more need-based grant programs because it's absurd right now that foreign students many funded by their governments are being sent to the u.s. to gain the tre to build these next-gen weapons at our universities and then they take that learning and go back overseas all the while too many Americans can't even afford to send their kids to this those colleges with the same education DARPA invented the internet a half a century ago there's no reason our nation should not continue to lead this field in another half century from now of course not all the biggest threats over the next 50 years will take the shape of a missile attack or a computer hack no matter how many people put their heads in the sand and refused to acknowledge basic facts the horrifying truth is that climate change is real and climate change is here Antarctica is melting and California is burning the Maldives are sinking and temperatures are climbing this is not a partisan squabble it's a national and global security threat something that military leaders and this administration's own intelligence officials admit as terrorist groups like Isis and Boko Haram used droughts to solidify their power in Syria and Nigeria as high tides flood our Coast Guard stations and rising sea levels threatened to swallow 100 of our own military bases tell me that won't impact triplett readiness there are no shades of grey here we need to take action to curb climate change before it is too late one way to do so is to pivot the military further away from fossil fuel investing in green energy instead even staunch Republicans like former Secretary of Defense Jim mattis have spent years pushing for this not just because it's its last pollutants not because it's cheaper not because it reduces our dependence on foreign oil and cuts our ties to oil rich bad actors like Saudi Arabia but because it's proven time and again to save troops lives don't take my word for it listen to general matters who all but begged the military to untether itself on fossil fuel since militants led a major assault on a diesel convoy in 2003 why because fuel supply convoys made for easy predictable targets in Afghanistan in 2007 one of every 24 fuel convoys suffered casualties even George W Bush agreed setting renewable energy benchmarks for our military to reach benchmark that became ambitious under Obama and in the years since we've learned that this policy works green energy keeps our troops safer and efficient few use slashes their numbers of refueling stops mobile solar panels enabled troops are turned off generators helping them move through enemy territory unheard and undetected and low weight longer lasting batteries lighten troops packs meaning they can carry more bullets on their backs instead as one former Navy captain put it years ago the belief was you could either be efficient or a capable warfighter now we've found that they are interdependent by being more efficient you become a better warfighter end quote in other words in every dollar that we invest in green energy our military gets stronger finally if we want to keep leading on the world stage we need to reflect on the fact that most of this country has simply accepted no they've seemingly forgotten that we're still in the thick of two wars we need to think about how casually with shipping teenagers off to Iraq and Afghanistan then we had the question why the hell we're asking them to die six thousand miles from home when we don't even know why they're still there when we can't even verbalize their mission or visualize the end state last year Americans who were in were not even alive when the twin towers fell became eligible to enlist eighteen year olds who've grown up knowing nothing but a nation at war who weren't yet born when we first airlifted special forces into Afghanistan were sent into the sandbox themselves most people run away from battle but our servicemembers run towards it they watch their brothers and sisters in arms die they missed births and funerals school plays and college graduations then they come home bearing the wounds of war both visible and otherwise they will always do their job defending our country no matter the sacrifice so they deserve to know that they have the moral support and the legal backing of this great nation but more than 15 years now Washington has failed to give them even that one of Congress's most solemn duties is deciding when and how we send them concentric combat by debating and passing an authorization for use of military force to set the legal framework and constitutional basis for military action and we are supposed to define the mission of Americans downrange but lately too many on the hill have shrugged off that duty hiding behind outdated AUMF set launched Afghanistan and Iraq Wars all the way back in 2001 and 2002 they're scared of political risks that come with bringing these Wars back into the spotlight staring down election days Congress has shirked its responsibilities to our troops these documents have been used to justify nearly two decades of war and the deaths of thousands of American heroes but they've been rendered meaningless as those in power have stretched and skewed their original intent leaving out troops without a clearly defined mission shadowboxing an ill-defined enemy everywhere from Niger to Iraq enough enough of being more worried about political consequences than about our troops in harm's way enough of watching on as another wife learn and sure never see her husband again as another father is forced to bury his daughter in section 60 in Arlington until we muster up the courage to ask and answer the tough questions that will actually tell our troops what they're fighting for we won't be living up to their sacrifices instead we will be leaving them in an endless loop refusing to even look for an off-ramp look I have friends from the Illinois National Guard who are in Afghanistan right now buddies who I served with in Iraq 15 years ago these are guys have done seven eight rotations who go in knowing they'll probably be back on that same stretch of sand in a couple of years fighting for that same patch of desert all over again they gained a few feet one tour they lose an inch or two the next they watch their buddies bleed died over the same piece of ground time after time deployment after deployment yet lately we've somehow spent more time debating whether athletes should kneel during the national anthem or if they're disrespecting our troops then we have discussing what our troops actually need it shouldn't be this hard anyone who claims the matter of patriotism can't keep demanding such sacrifice from our servicemen while refusing to half this debate after all how can we expect Americans to keep reinvesting or to sign up for the first time if we can't even imagine the end state they'd be dying for our already narrowing that military population will continue to contract leaving us with too few people to bear too heavy a burden so right now we're at a breaking point we can no longer keep to yesterday's definition of national strength one where our might of our military is measured by their numbers of commas in our defense budget and where our love for this country isn't judged by how loudly we sing the national anthem because unless our citizenry is strong our weaponry and pageantry won't matter unless our 8th graders can read and our families have health care unless our troops have the latest tech and our bases are not flooded unless everyone who wants and is fit to serve can put on the uniform our forces will be at a disadvantage and that's before they even reach the battlefield there's no real choice between caring for our troops and caring about our classrooms there's no choice between being a defense Hawk and believing in progressive policies there's no real choice between loving our military and wanting to make it better in fact working to improve our military is exactly what has allowed it to be so great for so long this nation was founded on the notion of a more perfect union it was built on the idea that we can always do better never achieving perfection but always striving to climb a little higher than the day before to meet that's true patriotism the kind of goes beyond just giving our servicemembers a discount at the ballpark the kind of patriotism they actually deserve because I know these troops I fought with these troops I would have died if these troops and some of them knew I would have died for so many of these troops and some of them verily nearly died for me they're heroes who lose an arm yet umpteen surgery later somehow find their way back to the battlefield refusing to stop serving their country their new parents who missed their little girl's first word or the little boys first steps because they've put the country over self walking back into harm's way just weeks after their children were born they stand on their front porches and kiss their loved ones goodbye so our loved ones can sleep a little better at night redefining bravery with every action they take we'll never be able to fully repay the debt we owe them but it's on us to try that's exactly what I've tried to do from the first moment I woke up at Walter Reed and that's what I plan to do every day I'm lucky enough to work in the Capitol and sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee tour after tour time after time our troops risk everything to fight for the rest of us so starting today I hope the American people would join me in vowing to do everything we can to fight for them to serve them - thank you [Applause]

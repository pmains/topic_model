senator Paul thank you Fatal conceit is the concept that Central planning with decision making concentrated in a few hands can never fully grasp the millions of complex individual interactions occurring simultaneously in the marketplace it is a fatal conceit to believe any one person or small group of people has the knowledge necessary to direct an economy or dictate public health behavior I think government Health experts during this pandemic need to show caution in their prognostications it's important to realize that if Society meekly submits to an expert and that expert is wrong a great tool of harm may occur when we allow one man's policy or one group of small men and women to be foisted on an entire nation take for example government experts who continue to call for schools and daycare to stay closed or that recommend restrictions that make it impossible for a school to function for a time there may not have been enough information about coronavirus in children but now there is there are examples from all across the United States in the world that show that young children rarely spread the virus let's start in Europe 22 countries have reopened their schools and have seen no discernible increases in cases these graphs behind me show no surge when schools open the red line is where the schools opened there is data from Austria Belgium Denmark France Germany Netherlands no Spike when schools are opened contact tracing studies in China Iceland Britain and the Netherlands failed to find a single case of child to adult infection here at home child care for essential workers continued to be available in some states throughout the pandemic Brown University researchers collected data on day cares that remained open during the pandemic over 25 000 kids in their study found that only 0.16 percent got coven and when you looked at the confirmed cases for staff there was about one percent of more than nine thousand staff the YMCA also has put forward statistics forty thousand kids at 1100 sites there were no reports of Corona virus outbreaks or clusters Dr Joshua scharfstein of Johns Hopkins writes there is converging evidence that the coronavirus doesn't transmit among children like the flu that it is a lower risk just yesterday the American Academy of Pediatrics says we got to get kids back in school we want them physically present in school they even cite mounting evidence that children are less likely to contract the virus ultimately this all comes down to the Fatal conceit that Central planners have enough knowledge somehow to tell a nation of 330 million people what they can and can't do perhaps our planners might think twice before they weigh in on every subject perhaps our government experts might hold their tongue before expressing the opinion whether we can play NFL football or Major League Baseball not in October perhaps our experts might think twice before telling the whole world that a covid vaccine likely won't provide herd immunity we don't know why why weigh in with these opinions that we have no knowledge of these are forecasts that may well be wrong perhaps our experts might consider the undue fear they are instilling in teachers who are now afraid to go back to work no one knows the answers to these questions we shouldn't presume that a group of experts somehow knows what's best for everyone Hayek had it right only decentralized Power and decision making based on millions of individualized situations can arrive at what risks and behaviors each individual should choose that's what America was founded on not a herd with a couple of people in Washington all telling us what to do and we'd like she blindly follow this all begs the question what are we going to tell the people the truth that it's okay to take their kids back to school Dr fauci every day virtually every day we seem to hear from you things we can't do but when you're asked can we go back to school I don't hear much certitude at all I hear well maybe it depends all of this body of evidence about schools around the world shows there's no surge all of the evidence shows that it's rare I mean we've so politicized this and made it politically correct that the who releases that it's rare and you have a scientist up there honestly giving her opinion what happens to her she's blackballed and her her report that she refers to is taken off the website when you go to that that scientist speech and you and you try to clink on the lick the who has now screened it from us because it said something that's not politically corrected guess what it's rare for kids to transmit this but I hear nothing of that coming from you all I hear Dr fauci is we can't do this we can't do that we can't play baseball well even that's not based on the science I mean flu season peaks in February we don't know that kovid's going to be like the flu season it might but we don't know that but we wouldn't we wouldn't banned School in October you might close some schools when they get the flu we need to not mean to so prom Sumptuous that we know everything but my question to you is can't you give us a little bit more on schools that we can get back to school that there's a great deal of evidence and it's actually good good evidence the kids aren't transmitting this it's rare and the kids are staying healthy and that yes we can open our schools Mr chairman do I have a little bit of a time till I give you a little well over five minutes but we'll thank you please answer the question so very quickly senator Paul I I agree with a lot of what you say about you know this idea about people having to put their opinions out without data and sometimes you you have to make extrapolations because you're in a position where you need to at least give some sort of recommendation but if you were listening and I think you were to my opening statement and my response to one of the questions I feel very strongly we need to do whatever we can to get the children back to school so I think we are in lock agreement with that the other thing that I like to to clarify very briefly is that I when things get in the Press of what I supposedly said I didn't say I never said we can't play a certain sport what happens is that people in the sport industry they could either be people from place Association owners people involved in the health of the plays ask me opinions regarding certain facts about the spread of the virus what the Dynamics are I give it and then it gets interpreted that I'm saying you can't play this sport or you can't play that sport I agree with you I am completely unqualified to tell you whether you can play a sport or not the only thing that I can do is to the best of my ability give you the facts and the evidence associated with I know about this outbreak thank you

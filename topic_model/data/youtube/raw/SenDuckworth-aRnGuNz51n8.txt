just before airtime I spoke with Democratic Center Tammy Duckworth of Illinois is a distinguished veteran of the Iraq war senator what do you make a president from saying that turkeys incursion into northern Syria quote has nothing to do with us because if it weren't for his conversation with everyone I mean this would not be happening he did essentially greenlight it by pulling special forces out of the area look Anderson in the space of a little over seven days president Trump has diminished America's role as the leader of the free world by doing several things one he abandoned out Kurdish allies who have fought and died alongside out troops for the last several decades he's emboldened the Russians who are not patrolling in the area that we used to have our Special Forces and patrol and we use a patrol he has now Imboden Assad a murderous dictator he has also for got into situation when where and NATO ally Turkey has actually fired artillery on American forces I don't think any of those things are in America first policy and I don't think any of those things make America great again so I have no idea what he's coming from but he could not be more wrong about the situation it's also given a win to Iran who's you know whose allies are backing the Assad regime I mean is it clear what the strategy is here from the White House or even if there is a strategy because the Vice President the Secretary of State you know we're making this trip over to Turkey supposedly to meet with air Dewan and push for some sort of cease-fire and the president is you know riffing during a photo-op undermining everything saying a look he doesn't really care about turkeys invasion well it's very clear that there's no strategy involved whatsoever and the president just did this on his own and now he's sending mr. Pompeo who's aren't you know a secretary of state but a guy with no actual success rate in international negotiations and vice president pence a man with no foreign policy experience to go meet with Rwanda men who actually rolled our president over a phone call there's no strategy here Anderson also the president seems to paint the courage with a pretty broad brush I mean there are you know terrorist threats that legitimate terrorist threats that that Turkey has and concerns they have about the PKK but the president is saying that you know the the Kurds are no angels criticize their ability to fight without us helps that we paid them a lot of monies and they didn't help in World War two in Normandy of all things do you think he doesn't I mean is he just trying to make excuses for for a rash decision he's clueless Adelson he's clueless just ask any a US troops who served any time in Iraq any time in the region the Kurds have lost 11,000 fighters fighting and dying alongside American troops there are any number of American troops whose lives have been saved by the Kurdish fighters who stupid longshot alongside us and you know what by abandoning our the Kurdish allies would we've toned as we've told people in the region don't work with Americans because we will abandon you who is going to work with the US forces now who's going to tell us the intelligence that we need to know because they know that working with Americans does not benefit you in the end we're just gonna abandon you to be slaughtered the way we abandoned the Kurds to be slaughtered by the Turks you know what's so sad about this is you know when when South Vietnam when Saigon finally fell there were a lot of people who had helped the United States who were not taken out who were you know who were left behind and and paid the price for that when you know there's plenty of interpreters and people who have worked for US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq who have not gotten the visas that were sort of dangled in front of them in order for for their help those things now seem to pale in comparison to this betrayal of a force of fighters who have been on the front lines more so than US forces I mean it's not like we've had tens of thousands of troops in these regions the Kurds have done most the actual fighting and dying 10,000 or more well I mean I would not expect this president to learn any lessons from Vietnam since he wasn't there and also obviously it was not a student or a scholar of the Vietnam conflict and the lessons learned from that bottom line I'm looking moving forward if I were a division commander right now or a commander of a US Special Forces Group I would be looking at dusting off my plans for potentially being caught to go back into the area to fix this mess the president's comments in to make clear do you think that might be necessary in danger oh I think it's very much it's very likely to happen because the president has not put American personnel both civilian and military in danger not just in what happen in Serie P because this whole area is all interconnected and those Isis fighters are headed towards Iraq and we have forces in Iraq right now or are you pleased with what you're hearing from Republicans in in Congress there's no you know a lot of them are not backing the president here Lindsey Graham I mean he's sort of been a little bit all over the place he was first upset with the president then he said seem to cut him some slack and now he seems upset again well here's the deal Anderson there's one person and one person alone who can fix this and that is Donald Trump and he's the guy that made this decision he's the guy that basically green-lighted Turkey to conduct this invasion all this the release of the Isis fighters is Donald Trump's fault and that's where it lies sure you know we can pass sanctions all we want but at the end of the day it's Donald Trump who has to fix this and he's the one who got us into this mess and he's responsible for those hundreds and thousands of Isis fighters being set free Senator Duckworth I appreciate your time thank you thank you

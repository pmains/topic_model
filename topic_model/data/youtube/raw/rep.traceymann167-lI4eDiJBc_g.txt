thank you mr chairman appreciate uh mr melanie's comments and questions i also would like to associate myself with courseman davis comments and questions and really getting at the heart of you know what will the impact of this if it goes through beyond production agriculture on the agriculture markets as we know them and obviously a whole host of other issues um first question would be um for for you mr uh bankman freed what is the difference we talk about market structures what's the difference between the ftx proposal and the ice ngx model that currently exists uh thank you for the question and i as you're pointing out there exists a number of licensed futures exchanges with the cftc that have various properties of our proposal already ice ngx being one of these um you know the difference we have uh you know we're combining together uh a few different things each of which is found in other exchanges but not always together one of which is collateral held with the clearinghouse the real-time margining system and the option for disintermediate direct access to the platform um for uh for all participants put together um is to the extent there's something novel um i think i guess that's what it is okay um the second question will be for you as well um there's been a lot of discussion of course and we just elaborate on a little bit on whether or not the your 250 million dollar guarantee fund is sufficient relative to the billions of dollars maintained by cme and ice in their guarantee funds could you please elaborate on why you believe that your holdings would be sufficient relative to the risk in the market yeah thank you for the question so first of all um and there are different terms used by the different models for similar things which makes it a little bit confusing um i probably haven't done a perfect job of of describing all this in addition to the 250 million dollars that we have put in the guarantee fund that's our own skin in the game none of that's mutualized um we also require margin held with the clearinghouse from all open positions and so internationally we have tens of billions of dollars of collateral in the equivalent of the clearinghouse today um collateralizing customer positions on the venue and so that is a very significant piece of it um that you know plays the role of collateral held at you know various intermediaries to some extent in other models um and is backstopping customer positions also say sorry that um we have done an extensive analysis uh historically of this model uh internationally um total historical insurance fund draw was only a few percent of the uh guarantee fund that we were proposing um and that's over the last three years combined um and that is with a less conservative model uh than what we would be uh proposing so it has functioned successfully to also just tack on one thing the numbers that uh mr duffy quoted are not uh necessarily numbers for the us platform that was for the international um platform um although i will also note that empirically it seems to have worked so i i don't know where that smoke's ending up but um you know apparently uh it has been successfully managed as i would predict it would be uh given the parameters in the risk model okay thank you question for you mr duffy uh you know you've raised concerns about volatility and market disruption spilling over from a direct access market into the traditional market can you elaborate on how you see that risk transferring well and i've said it several times in my testimony my hearing here's the way it's going to play out again it's a market structure change when you go to a direct model that ftx's proposal is asking for when that's deployed against other asset classes the participants are not crypto participants they're farmers ranchers they're producing oil they're writing mortgages every other products that i trade so i've been through that they are not prepared in my opinion for this type of model today because the auto liquidator that is being proposed is something that will be unsuspecting to the client now he can talk about the margin that he has and the collateral that he has but the bottom line is people at my institution as i've said have cl margin from cme then they have additional margin from their clearing firms so those clearing firms are in touch with their clients and if in fact they touch certain levels they get calls and they determine either put up more money or we're going to take you out of the market so an auto liquidator is not revolutionary new technology by any stretch of imagination but the way they do it is differently and but when you deploy that and you have to keep these markets open 24 hours a day seven days a week against agribusinesses and others i think it could be extremely detrimental in a time where not only the time that we're living in now but going forward for the food industry going forward they need risk management tools they don't need casinos to do risk management great thank you with that my time is expiring i yield back

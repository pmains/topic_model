joined now by pennsylvania congresswoman and former impeachment manager madeleine dean and washington congresswoman pramila jaipal congresswoman thank you both for being here and congresswoman dean i want to start with you and just get your kind of reflections um 100 days later particularly in light of the fact that you faced continuing threats a trump supporter having been charged with harassment after threatening phone calls to you in voicemails including sexual remarks directed at you and members of your family and grandchild it feels like this kind of hasn't really 100 ended for you is that accurate to say it hasn't ended for me it hasn't ended for pramila it hasn't ended for any of us i think of our staffs what they have to worry about they have to receive these incoming threats you're absolutely right my own family myself have been threatened i wound up with a protection group of capital police officers i could go on for hours about the professionalism and the humanity that they brought to their job protecting me for more than two and a half months uh in light of these threats as i was impeachment manager and then thereafter um this is a protective agency and they were underprepared as the report showed they were under-resourced and the fault uh i have to tell you from my own experience dealing with frank and file sergeants and upper-level members uh was not theirs we owe them congress owes them the protection so that they can protect us uh carmilla i don't know what you think but i can't believe it's been a hundred days we were we were talking just today talking about how close we were up in the gallery together for miller just having surgery uh and uh the the surreal nature of it the reason that that is i spoke about the nature of the the sound uh and for mill i don't know if you felt this also the series of commands that we got i felt like we're safe here we're we're certainly safe in this chamber this can't be that great a threat but of course it was an extraordinary threat uh yeah and the intelligence shows that congress itself was the target what does that tell you about the administration that knew that it is frightening to think about and i still i have not gotten over it even i wasn't even you know there in proximity to it and congresswoman jayapal i mean on top of the threat from banging on the doors that god knows what they would have done had they been able to get through to any one of you um in addition to that i wonder how you feel 100 days later about some of your colleagues who were not taking seriously the other threat which was the threat of spreading covid and you having to be in close contact with them in these secure rooms with no masks and people laughing at those who are trying to distribute them and sort of adding to that threat i just wonder your your reflections on on that or even just on the day 100 days later well madeline's absolutely right this isn't over for any of us you might know that i started a text chain of all the people who were in the gallery i call it the gallery group because joy it's been really traumatic and i will tell you that every there are all kinds of triggers you know just like with any trauma when we see something happen when we read about the oath keepers when we see somebody on television when we see the images again and we've all had to go through as well as our staffs a lot of work to just process all of that and to live with the continuing fear because our colleagues are not taking this seriously and yes i contracted covid because i was just to to the left madeleine and i figured out i was just to the left of where she was looking down on the floor and so our group was sort of the last group to be let out i think now in looking at everything and by the time we made it to the room the secure location it was packed there were a couple hundred people and that video you showed was our colleague lisa blunt rochester trying desperately to get people to wear masks we were trying to shelter and secure lockdown but they were refusing to wear masks and laughing when lisa was offering those masks to them and the minute i walked in there joy i knew that it was a super spreader event and the minute i was done voting on the floor at 4am i went home and i told my husband i'm going to get covered so i'm not leaving the house i'm isolating and in fact three days later i tested positive five days later he tested positive and you know and the and the republicans are still not taking this seriously and so i think the whole experience you know matt and i were talking earlier today and it feels unreal still because it's hard to imagine that something like that could happen i remember a text right at the beginning when we first heard that the crowds were breaching the capitol and my husband said i think you should come back to the office and i said oh no i'm here in the capitol with the speaker this is the safest place i can be and that gap of perception between how safe we felt or we thought we were and how safe we actually were is something that is continuing today i think we all feel like without these additional security measures without the additional 200 positions that the capitol police is down without the retractable fences you know all the things that general honore has proposed with his review and without i mean we just had the first person uh the the oath keeper plead guilty but there's a lot of people out there who were involved in this and worst of all all our colleagues who are still perpetrating the big lie and that is the scariest thing well that is the question i wanted to ask both of you is how is is what is the level of trust because you have you know i mean i still by the way i'm still chilled by just i remember talking with congresswoman ianna presley about her panic button not working and all of these things they've got to remain traumatic but then you have members on the republican side who are doing things like forming a caucus for anglo saxon values that sounds like it's repeating the 14 words um and still trying to push through anti-voter legislation um and and still supporting the big lie and pretending they don't know who won the election what's the level of trust within the congress when you have members who it's not clear what side they're on when it comes to the siege congressman dean you know i i really want to say publicly that the big lie and the continuation of it i our top elected officials on the other side makes everyone in this country unsafe it's not just about electeds like congresswoman jayapal and me it is about our staff it is about the very capital itself it is about think of it uh we not only lost officer sickney but then billy evans just this week had we had to have him lie in honor uh we are all less safe so i call upon our colleagues and pramil and i both serve on judiciary where many of the big lie spreaders are in addition to the super spreaders and i call upon them to reflect to say i owe you the truth because i make all of you less safe as i promote the big lie and i tell people that something was stolen from them nothing was stolen from them this election was fair and square we know it it is it is frightening and i am frightened for you uh and i don't know how i would be able to go about working with people who were still pushing that when that is what caused the violence and as you said uh people died as a result of it people got sick because of it and it's traumatized the country but thank you so much for being here and sharing this evening with us it's an important anniversary we'll never forget it congresswoman madeline dean congresswoman pramila jai paul be well and still ahead thank you more more on 100 days since the capital insurrection capitol police officer

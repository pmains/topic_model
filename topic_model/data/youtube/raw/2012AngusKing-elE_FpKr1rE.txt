in this day and age it's very difficult for us to tell a young person your time is valuable we want you to intern but we can't pay you anything that's a mixed message and they don't receive that message well my question to you governor is would you consider a program that would provide tax credits to companies that provide paid internships yes uh i'm a huge believer in interns in in internships i'm also a huge believer and i don't want to tell you how to run your university but i'm a huge believer in the co-op model of education and i think that i've always thought that was a great idea and and i wish we did more of it in maine because it connects kids to the community it connects the the businesses to the school and and it gives us an opportunity to uh frankly for you to have more throughput without having to build a lot more buildings because part of your students are going to be out in the community i'd like to see an internship program statewide to grab some of these talented students that come to maine that go to husson or colby or or bates or thomas college provide them with an internship and get them hooked on maine do you think that career and technical education at the high school level is part of the solution in making that connection to fill jobs in maine i had a recent experience that sort of underlined that i had a meeting in biddeford with the head of the chamber down there craig pendleton and sat down and he said governor we've got a jobs problem down here and i thought you know here we go again you know unemployment and everything he said no no it's the opposite we have 500 jobs in york county in technical fields that we can't fill we've gotten this idea that everybody has to go to a four-year college when in reality there's a there are just a huge number of opportunities you can't say well i'll only do this because the opportunities may be somewhere out here and it may be something you haven't even you haven't even thought of what are two federal policies that you would support to make it easier for maine's high schoolers and college students to stay in maine after they graduate we've got to think about student debt young people are graduating from college today with what amounts to a mortgage the other thing is i think we need to be sure our kids are good consumers and they know what they're getting into my sense is that sometimes it's too easy and they find themselves up to their neck in debt they're 18 years old when they start that's something i think there needs to be some education involved

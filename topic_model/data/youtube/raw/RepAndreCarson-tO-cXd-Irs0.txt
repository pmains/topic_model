my question is mr flynn regarding beech grove i've been very concerned about the furloughs you're considering i'm especially concerned about the possible impact on maintenance facilities can you tell me whether or not uh if you plan to cut positions at beech grove i'd also appreciate uh in writing any plans you have to change the workforce levels at the beach grove facility thank you congressman carson uh we are not furloughing any employees at uh at beech grove in fact a number of uh of our beech grove employees did take the uh the visit the voluntary separation and retire so in fact we're actually hiring some employees in beech grove to backfill the positions as you know beech grove requires some substantial capital investments over the next several years but as we develop future plans about beech grove or uh plans that would impact beech grove we would be very happy to advise your office of what those plans would be thank you that'd be a big help thank you very much mr miller i i i appreciate listening to your your your testimony about the damage being done to passenger rail service in the midwest by reducing uh the daily service on long-distance routes indianapolis was previously served and benefited from this uh to mr miller another business is can can you elaborate on what happens to midwestern cities when daily services are cut do you think congress should mandate daily services i apologize congressman was that for was that a question for me sir for you mr miller and if anyone else wants to jump in about a congressionally mandated daily service chime in so uh well yes sir uh our our position is that yes these services should be at a minimum daily and the reason for that is because of the multiplier effect that these services have in the communities you know we've heard a lot this this morning uh an assertion that amtrak is required by congress to make a profit it is not uh it is required to minimize subsidies and uh and when we have the conversation about profit that ignores the benefits that the communities receive and we talked about that in the midwest is a perfect example of that uh when i when we looked at at the effects of the long distance routes 12 of the 15 long distance routes would be affected by these cuts those routes together contribute about 4.7 4.8 billion dollars to the economy that's the profit the profit is going to those communities that are served and whether you're looking at places like st louis or indianapolis or for for for for in terms of tourism in terms of visitor spending in terms of taking vehicles off the road all of those impacts are measurable quantifiable uh and and you know amtrak itself used to talk about 7.4 billion dollars of value to the economy uh this that was created we think that number is actually a low ball we think it's actually a little higher than that when you cut the daily service down to three times a week you don't just cut four days worth of ridership the ridership declines more than that because of the diminished utility and because of the diminished connections chicago is an enormous connection point as you know and that is going to be a particularly difficult situation for the midwest because a lot of those connections because they're difficult to make those trips simply won't take place 39 million dollars of revenue of connecting revenue flows through chicago alone and a lot of these trips are going to originate in chicago and go flow through the midwest and those trips will not take place because the network does not have the utility required to make those trips worthwhile right so those are people that will not be getting off in those smaller towns will not be spending their money in those towns will not be eating in the restaurants and will not be supporting the local economy and that's a big blow it's already a big blow and it's only going to get worse thank you thank you both chairman i yield back

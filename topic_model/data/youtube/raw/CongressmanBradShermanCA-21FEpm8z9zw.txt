hello I'm congressman brad sherman and i chair the asia subcommittee here at the United States House of Representatives a few of you are aware of my work as the floor manager of the Hong Kong human rights and democracy Act and the protect Hong Kong act both of which passed the House of Representatives on October 15th others may be aware that I am the author of the stand with Hong Kong resolution which passed the House on the same date the People's Republic of China needs to be aware that the whole world is watching Hong Kong a government is only as good as its word Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy under the principle one country two systems at the time some of us were a bit cynical thinking it would be one country two systems' for one day followed by the absorption of Hong Kong into the People's Republic but due to the hard work and courage of the people of Hong Kong the sovereignty of the territory has been observed to a greater degree than the skeptics would have thought possible but the promises of Beijing were made to the people of Hong Kong and to the world and they will not be met until Beijing honors the five demands of the people of Hong Kong the world is inspired by your determination to peacefully demonstrate by the millions the more massive and the more peaceful the demonstrations the more convincing you are to the world and I am confident that through peaceful demonstrations a United action the five demands of the people of Hong Kong will be realized in contrast when Beijing is able to point to acts of violence and vandalism the message of the protests is undercut those who engage in violence are so helpful to the Chinese Communist Party that some believe that they are in fact committed by paid agents of the Beijing government but the Chinese Communist Party must not be allowed to use a few sporadic acts of vandalism as an excuse for delaying the upcoming district elections I'm congressman brad Sherman from Los Angeles to say the hearts and prayers of America are with you and the whole world is watching

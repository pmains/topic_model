mr. Han Thank You mr. chairman and thank you for convening this virtual forum for all of us today like each of you I've been working home from here in Massachusetts these last few weeks doing a lot of virtual meetings talking with doctors and nurses and other frontline workers small business owners and employees union workers and advocates for those who are unemployed and in need of assistance certainly our teachers our school superintendents and our community college presidents as well as state and local officials my priorities several of which a number of my colleagues have already raised have been informed by these discussions and what I've seen for myself around this district as previously mentioned by my colleagues I too support expanding funding for child services and providers making greater investments in special education to support students with different needs as schools pivot to online learning curriculum development and training for our educators and addressing the racial economic divide that ails our institutions in our health care system certainly enacting butch Lewis and paid second family leave policies as well earlier today I spoke with Layne Glen he's the head of Northern Essex Community College about the urgent need to close the digital divide making that investment in rural and urban broadband and ensuring that all students have access to online learning with Chromebooks tablets and hotspots when necessary I've also connected with our community college and state university presidents here in Massachusetts who seek our help to make greater investments in powell for students put resources into our cyber and physical infrastructure and prepare us for the post kovat 19 workforce as we addressed these issues and approach the next package these stakeholders and institutions need our help to stay whole and emerge from this crisis in a better place first and foremost the next coronavirus package should cover Cobra for those who have found themselves out of work due to the crisis at least 30 million people have filed initial unemployment claims since mid-march more than 750,000 here in Massachusetts and we should ensure that they aren't forced to choose between paying for their health insurance or putting food on their table we should absolutely advance the chairman's worker health coverage Protection Act to cover Cobra the corona virus has also demonstrated how vital our cap agencies are and the fact that CSBG is their lifeblood cares provided 1 billion dollars in CSBG and lifted the eligibility to 200% of poverty this was extraordinarily important CSBG has made enormous different an enormous difference in my district after the 2018 gas explosions in the Merrimack Valley the greater Lawrence Community Action Council charged into action using CSBG funds to help those who had lost so much today community teamwork incorporated which serves Greater Lowell is using CSBG to help close the digital divide by ensuring low-income children can participate in distance learning while schools are closed they are providing those children with Chromebooks so that they don't have to take their lessons on a mobile phone but the demand for CSBG has soared the mana 2/3 opportunity comes soul-based in Fitchburg in my district has served six thousand three hundred families in just four weeks with meals that is 82 percent of their average for an entire year they need more reliable CSBG funding so I would recommend that the committee prioritize the community services Block Grant reauthorization Act which were four new the CSBG program so that 1,000 cap agencies around the country can continue to serve those in need I also strongly support the Chairman's Cove in nineteen every worker Protection Act which would require OSHA to issue standards to protect workers from exposure to the virus last month a whistleblower nurse by the name of Maria Cryer began sounding the alarm that the Life Care Center of Nashoba Valley and nursing home in Littleton Massachusetts wasn't taking the necessary precautions to protect residents life care sentence of an eye as a national network of nursing homes the company's facility in Kirkland Washington was one of the early kovat 19 hunts back in February 10th there were signs of a possible infection at the Kirkland facility and ultimately 37 people there lost their lives nearly two months later the same thing was happening again but across the country Littleton Massachusetts unfortunately like in Kirkland the Littleton facility wasn't prepared in Moorea and 16 others have passed away we've alerted CMS to the problem but an emergency OSHA standard would be to everyone's benefit we should pass the coab in nineteen every worker Protection Act I would also like I would also ask that the committee give consideration to the equity and Student Loan Relief Act a bill that representative Stefanik Schmucker Adams Lee and I recently introduced the cares Act made significant advancements and providing loan paint repayment relief to student borrowers however it didn't provide such relief for the 7.2 million students with privately held loans under the federal family education loan program the equity and Student Loan Relief Act would protect these student borrowers just as cares did for those with federally held student loans I would also urge consideration of a comprehensive expansion of AmeriCorps in response to kovat 19 we should put these volunteers to work conducting virus testing and contact tracing I understand that representatives price and Matsui are currently working on such a bill with Senator Coons and I would encourage its advancement finally I will wrap up I promise I would ask that the committee permit student borrowers and the public service loan forgiveness program to continue to receive full credit toward loan forgiveness even if their hours at an eligible employer have been reduced they shouldn't have to delay their debt both at 19 thank you so much again mr. chairman and I yield back well thank you very much thank you

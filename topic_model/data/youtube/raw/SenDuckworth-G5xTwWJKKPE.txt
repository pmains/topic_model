but thank you madam chair miss Lam can you speak to how the importance of our maritime highways to the freight network well again most of our AG members are containerized shippers and not moving or navigating through our rivers so today I'm really just prepared to talk if if I may about containerized exports moving by motor carrier or by rail as I mentioned boxcars into those hub centres where they're translated into containers thank you no yes you know in the last couple of years in Illinois and and also our nearby neighbor of Iowa we've had to stockpile corn and soybean and our silos are overflowing and in fact our neighbors in the southeastern United States have been purchasing corn and soybean from Brazil because it is faster to move this agriculture product from Brazil to Georgia than it is to Atlanta than it is to get it down to Mississippi and part of this is because of the problems we have with our Lock and Dam system the congestion with our inland waterways and certainly it is an important part of the network and I know that the rail for example have been very supportive of some of the bridge projects that we have been working on in order to to have railroads come to support bridge projects over the Mississippi because that's what the barge folks need in order to get Freight truly speaks to the true intermodal nature of freight traffic in this country then several of you have mentioned a need to lift the multimodal cap mr. Sabel more than once in the freight program then you provide specifics examples of why this is important why is it important to me and I now open it up to the group but you want to start I think you know the easy answer is because freight doesn't just use the highway system and so again we're talking about a holistic approach we're talking about an entire supply chain you know in in this fluid system and so there needs to be the flexibility to invest in the very projects and there shouldn't be any type of mode restriction where is the best return for the public and wherever that best return is that highest return this is where the investments need to go give a specific example of where this obviously I mean the big one for me is coming back to the create program in Chicago you know where we're talking about rail infrastructure that impacts you know the national flow of goods through the Chicago hub Amtrak Metro commuter trains emergency grade crossings truck routes you know and and all of these are constrained with the the antiquated design that we face today and so when the fast Act provisions were being put together we were trying to make sure that we would have a tool that would allow us to untangle this entire mess and we were able to make it work with the cap but it was it was very concerning and a little bit tenuous and so for me that's one great example certainly there are port issues I think there are wiser minds at this table than me that can speak to that but it's got to be about this system thank you I'm sorry yes sir I would agree 100% with mr. Sabel the Port of Long Beach for instance were on a four billion dollar capital investment bram program we believe that that's what we must do to maintain our competitiveness going forward in an era of bigger ships ships bringing more cargo creating Peaks and surges and creating imbalances on the equipment side it's critical that we continue to build out our infrastructure one billing out of that four billion dollar capital program is all devoted on-dock rail the advantage of on-dock rail is that it allows us to put a container on a train at the port eliminating that short haul to an inland destination it's safer it's more reliable it's cleaner it's more cost effective and these are some of the projects for instance that would benefit if that cap was lifted mr. Baker right I would simply say that with the point of the of the infra program being to solve our nation's freight challenges which are numerous and many and in a world of finite resources to us it doesn't make it doesn't make sense to limit the program unnecessarily to one mode and as I as I said in the testimony I would I would say that's especially true in an era where these programs are no longer being funded 100% by by highway user fees I believe we're at a hundred and forty billion dollars in Counting since 2008 of general fund money that has gone to support the the Highway Trust Fund so we believe that it's no longer appropriate to we would say artificially limit the program to a single mode or primarily to a single mode thank you Thank You senator Duckworth I look forward to working with you on many of these important issues it's a pleasure that to have you as a ranking member and I thank the witnesses today for your good testimony the hearing record will remain open for two weeks and during this time senators are asked to submit any questions for the record upon receipt the witnesses are requested to submit their written answers to the committee as soon as possible and with that the hearing is adjourned thank you Thank You chairwoman mr. Szabo the benefits of increasing investment in freight and intermodal infrastructure are well known and we've already been discussing them a little bit today these projects require large amounts of money and involve many public and private players federal funding for these projects is often necessary to get the projects off the ground this is why I was a strong advocate for fast acts for eight funding programs and I've seen firsthand the positive impacts of freight and rail grants in Illinois in Euro let's see ma'am how important is federal funding to getting these projects developed and with these projects have moved forward without federal funding yeah having a reliable federal partner to participate in these projects is is crucial it's it's somewhat fundamental particularly understanding that it's about interstate commerce and that so many of the major projects as I mentioned in my testimony transcend states or local jurisdictions across multiple modes and so having a federal partner that is able to provide the leadership provide funding is critical you know we were incredibly pleased with the fast act provisions and how that allowed several of our projects to move forward but I would again come back to the concerns about the cap on non highway projects we believe in performance-based program management at its CMAP and this means ensuring that funding is completely affects flexible it allow us to invest in the very best projects possible that have the greatest benefits to the public and when we put our plan together for the region it looks out 30 years and one of the points I make is that it doesn't make much sense today to focus on funding amodal silos when modes are changing and we don't even know what the modes are going to be 30 years from now so whatever we do should be completely flexible thank you the federal highway administration has reported that the largest increase in truck traffic will be where interstates intersect two of the 25 most congested segments in the nation or in Chicago anybody who has driven the old circle interchange where Dan Ryan and Kennedy meets is in how our expressway can tell you what that means I've spent too many hours of my life there to each of the panelists what more should we do to focus attention on the worst most congested areas in our nation and how can we direct federal funds to focus on alleviating congestion at these particular freight bottlenecks do we start over here with mr. Baker the we believe that the merit-based competitive federal programs that you've instituted in the in the fast Act including Chrissy and infra and then also also build our well set up to address those problems well we would support increases in funding for those and certainly increases in flexibility for in particular for infra and the state freight formula program but essentially a federal merit-based competitive program ought to be able to be be leveraged to address the biggest bottlenecks and choke points as those those projects should rise to the top in a competitive benefit cost analysis senator the illustration that you use to illustrate the state of our highway system I think is endemic of what we're seeing nationwide is a noted a moment ago the total cost to meet freight infrastructure needs is estimated at approximately 3.7 trillion and as much as we like to focus on the first mile and the last mile I think the focus of this panel here is to understand the entire and immortal Freight network and how it fits together and so from my Anna's perspective we believe that investing in Freight infrastructure is critical not just to our industry or collective industries but in order to move America forward and and and the the downstream impacts on the economy with regard to jobs the Munk the multiplier effect that we see so from our standpoint we believe and fully funding freight provisions and opportunities for for ports to apply for formula and competitive multimodal frequence thank you Muslim absolutely agree I mean when we talked earlier in the testimony about how our AG shipments have to go to where the containers are and so we'll bring in rail cars and we'll transload in these huge areas of that you're talking about they rise to the top Chicago Dallas Atlanta Memphis all of these key inland hub areas are where this traffic is moving into and so absolutely prioritizing these areas of congestion is very very important get the last 20 seconds is this table yeah I think it's already been said continuum Arab based approach you know the provisions in the fasts Act are an excellent place to start just lift that non highway cap and make it completely mode neutral and ensure predictable funding thank you Thank You senator senator Klobuchar thank you very much thank you to all of you

mr speaker let's be clear everybody in this chamber supports lowering prescription drug costs lowering these outrageous costs that all of our constituents are playing paying across the country we all support clean affordable energy and access to those resources and we all support lowering inflation the difference is where the credibility gap exists is that the very problems the very crisis that our country is experiencing today were actually caused by the body administration's policies we went from in my hometown 100 a dollar 80 a gallon for gasoline so i recently paid four dollars and 20 cents we've seen a tripling of natural gas costs their own policies have caused this nearly a quarter of all americans today can't even afford to pay their electricity bills the biden administration policies have caused record inflation making americans unable to even afford grocery costs the bind administration policies have resulted in higher emissions not lower emissions as compared to the previous administration's and bite administration policies have resulted in this president going to countries like saudi arabia and asking them for energy while telling americans that we can't produce mr speaker i can't help but reminisce over jack abramoff a disgraced lobbyist convicted who created problems then charged clients to fix it the difference is between this bill and jack abramoff is that jack abramoff actually fixed the problems for his clients this bill's a disaster there's a credibility gap they've caused the problems now we're being asked to trust them to fix it and we simply can't oppose this legislation yield back

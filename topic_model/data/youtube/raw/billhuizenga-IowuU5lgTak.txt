congressman bill Huizenga Republican from Michigan itself is with us right now bear in mind that Larry Kudlow said I think just yesterday hey that GM strikes beginning to hurt the overall economy so you think it's time the Fed stepped in cooling-off period no I don't think that should be the case I believe this is a private sector discussion and and debate that needs to happen we are cognizant of the effects of this there is definitely some headwinds it appears that everybody is negotiating in good faith we've reached out to a number of our suppliers that are suppliers into into GM in West Michigan that's that's our one of our big industries I've we've tried to reach out to the UAW Local I have a plant in my district that has 800 800 union employees are line workers and another 206 I think it is celery so there is real effects that are happening in Michigan what's the sticking point here I mean it's into its fourth week for a GM strike the longest since 1974 having to say yeah might hurt the economy what's the big sticking point yeah so what what we're hearing is that it is how you're dealing with the temporary workers and their status and and then sort of where that pay is gonna go and there's no this is but that's one issue yeah but 20 percent of all the GM vehicles sold in the United States 20 percent of them are actually made in Mexico yeah that's the problem was it because the UAW does not like that and what that's one of the reasons why frankly we've talked about this on the show we need to pass us MCH it increases the u.s. content of those North american-made cars but we've got to be very cognizant of the effects of this but I still think that people working in good faith should continue to move forward our suppliers are kind of mixed some of them are really afraid as they've slowed down and had to lay some people off voluntarily that they may not be able to keep doing that voluntarily and they're gonna have to do layoffs and at which point then they could be going into other industries why don't you just get the feds to step in and say come on lads so since when Stewart Bernie been a federal government interventionist that's that's that's a I think we just need to be very careful about the federal government coming in and bigfooting this no doubt if they had come to an impasse they can help move it forward and maybe help negotiations clarify but I don't think we're at that point yet it's a very serious point because I understand that General Motors says it's going to delay the launch of the new 2020 Corvette hey this is serious as serious that is a sweet car and it doesn't need to go forward but again it's really about the workers behind it whether it's the whether it's the suppliers and a lot of those parts come on I I've hit a nerve with this tell me more about the delay this is the Bowling Green Kentucky plant which I use to go to old terminal into Nashville just up on 65 it's amazing but they're still trying to catch on production on this year's model so the 2020 could indeed be delayed is gonna come out in the Cooper Convertible starting at $67,500 it's that mid-engine redesign people love this thing but it could be pushed back because of the strike GM however is saying it's too early to speculate on you know production timing but there is a concern now on manufacturing workers GM workers in the state of Michigan gonna vote for the re-election of President Trump that's a good question I think so I think us MCA is a big part of that okay so we get us mca that's a plus but that and tariffs yes yes I think that's one of the reasons why speaker Pelosi I would think that is absolutely the case I've got a fight on our hands now bill Huizenga thanks for joining us appreciate ya thanks all right

my name is Hannah weisfelt and I'm director of yeah at which is as you can probably tell from my accent the British Jewish communities pro-israel pro-peace movement I I am the future of pro-israel because through Yahud I'm giving voice to thousands of British Jews who want to speak out in support of Israel speak out in support of ending the occupation and speak out in support of creating a Palestinian state the future pro Israel is a British Jewish community which is unafraid to say what it believes to be in Israel's best long-term interests according to the last piece of polling of British jury which was done about a year and a half ago now and I think you'll be surprised by these statistics ninety percent of British Jews believe that Israel is the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people and ninety-five percent have been to Israel we are an incredibly closely connected and passionate community and to be closely connected and passionate means to be vocal and to speak up and that's why when on a university campus in the UK Israelis demonized it's accused of being a rogue and criminal state undeserving above and beyond all other states to have a place in the family of Nations I on behalf of yaad will go on to campus and I'll debate those opinions and at the same time when him neuter the JNF company in Israel evict Palestinians from their homes in silwan in East Jerusalem we are unafraid to galvanize thousands of British Jews to protest against those evictions to tell the JNF in the UK that we believe those actions damage prospects for peace the future of pro-israel is a confident and articulate British Jewish community which is unafraid to defend what needs defending and also challenged what needs to be challenged when you turn 16 in England you take a set of well in the United Kingdom you take a set of high school exams or secondary school as we call it and has almost become a rite of passage that when you've completed those exams you spend a month in Israel touring having an Israel experience to see fifty percent of our 16 year olds just over go to Israel and have that month in Israel seeing the sights and of course if you spend a month in Israel you spend a significant amount of that time in Jerusalem and if you can just picture in your heads and I'm sure some of you have been to the place i'm going to describe most Jerusalem experiences start in a neighborhood called tell ports and in teleport there's a viewpoints called the tire let's wait you can see the old city in front of you in to your left you can see pockets of West Jewish West Jerusalem and your rights you can see neighborhoods of these Jerusalem and you can see a Buddhist which is behind the wall so if you can imagine standing on that viewpoint and of course you look to the old city and you marvel at the role that Jerusalem plays for the Jewish people but the future of pro Israel is thousands of British 16 year old standing on that viewpoint looking at the old city and being amazed at what role Jerusalem plays for the Jewish people and its centrality to Jewish life and at the same time noticing that on the tops of the Palestinian homes in the Palestinian neighborhoods there are small blast black plastic water tanks and those water tanks collects rainwater because in the neighborhoods of East Jerusalem where Palestinians live they don't have access to proper municipal services and so they collect rainwater as a substitute because the future of pro-israel is to care that 250,000 Palestinians live inside those neighborhoods without equal access to education without the right to vote without a passport our young people should be able to care deeply about Israel and at the same time care not that it just exists the Jewish state but care about its character as a Jewish and democratic state this summer arum in this summer with era men who I know are one of the conference partners and their hair will be taking over fifty percent of those 16 year olds who take part on that experience to look at those black water tanks and to understand what they mean that's the future of pro-israel we're ten months old and in those ten months we have taken thousands of British sorry hundreds of residues on tours of the occupied territories to get a sense of the conflict to understand what the occupation looks like thousands of British shoes have participated in pro-israel pro-peace actions with us in support of a two-state solution and in support of democracy thousands of British Jews have participated in our education events hearing narratives that they have previously been excluded or in completely ignored by the British Jewish community the future of pro-israel is tens of thousands of British Jews having those experiences with us and just for the record there are only about 280 thousands of us so tens of thousands is quite significant I want to end by reading to you an email which I received just a couple of weeks ago from one of our supporters a man called Bruce who lives in London and he wrote one of your greatest results is that people like me are able to stand up and say what we feel express our love for Israel and yet concern about some of its government's policies knowing that you had stands behind us the future of pro-israel is thousands of people like Bruce who have found their lost voices so when people look to the British Jewish community to understand what we think and feel about Israel whether that's the Israeli government Israeli civil society the British government or fellow g Jews they hear Bruce and those thousands of others of other people speaking up and when they look to America to Australia to Europe they hear all of our voices together that collectively in beautiful Jewish values are speaking up in support of Israel speaking up in support of ending the occupation and speaking up in support creating a Palestinian state that is the future of pro-israel

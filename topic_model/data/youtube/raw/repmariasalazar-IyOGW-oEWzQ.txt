debt ceiling yesterday I spoke with representative John Garamendi of California about the ongoing debt limit debate in Congress and he said basically how is it for the Republicans to talk to us about spending because they've raised the debt ceiling before this is part of what he had to say during the Trump period the debt saving was raised three times by the Republicans and by President Trump as they were adding 7.8 trillion dollars to the debt and now suddenly this becomes an issue now this is all about the trying to use the debt ceiling as a nuclear option or a nuclear weapon to get their way that was yesterday today we're going to the other side of the island talk to Republican congresswoman from Florida she's Maria Alvira Salazar she serves on the Foreign Affairs and small business committees so Congressman thank you so much for being with us that was the Democratic point of view but I I got to ask you does he kind of have a point that there's some responsibility if not guilt on both sides of the aisle about running up the debt of course and we should not be doing what we are not asking the average American family to do which is to spend more than they make you know when you talk to your children and you tell them hey you have to stay within your allowance or you have to make ends meet with what you what you earn or what your salary is the same thing for the government so yeah there is there's waste there's fraud there is a lot of problems in every branch of government and we should be going there and cutting but at the same time we are the United States and we need to be responsible we need to be paying our debts we cannot default on our debts but at the same time put the house in order so that's what we have to do and I'm very happy that Kevin McCarthy the speaker of the house is going to be meeting with the president and now the president is willing to negotiate and put an end to this situation but at the same time sending the message to the rest of the world that we are not going to default on our debts so let's talk about that meeting is going to happen tomorrow we don't know exactly what's going to happen but there is reporting at least ABC News was reporting for example the President Biden will say can we agree as you just said we won't default on our debts number one number two I'll put forward a budget a fairly specific budget March 9. why don't you Kevin McCarthy the Speaker of the House you put forward a specific budget as well are those two reasonable requests they kind of sound reasonable to me but I'm not in the middle of it well I think that they are and then you do reconciliation which is the same thing that we do with the house and the Senate then we come together and as the committee and then we put together the final version of course hey the word is bipartisanship the word the word is working together which is what the American people out there those people who are working and not spending more than what they earn would want from us there's no difference between the regular family that sits around the kitchen table to put together their finances in order and the United States government why should we be better or spend more as you say congresswoman bipartisanship sounds like a good way to resolve the problem with the debt ceiling let's talk about another problem that's immigration uh because that's clearly a big problem uh do we need bipartisan action to really deal with all the aspects immigration at once rather than just one of them of course we need bipartisanship since Ronald Reagan we've not been able to put the immigration house in order and that is why I a member of the GOP a sophomore in Congress I presented last year the dignity Bill dignity and why because we need to fix four things first of all we need to seal the Border seal it tight because we do not want any more fentanyl number two we have to allow for the future Albert Einsteins who want to come to America to work to come in Legally so we have to fix the legal immigration number three we need to give dignity to those people dignity I'm not talking about amnesty I'm talking about dignity not citizenship to those people who have lived Among Us for 13 15 years you have 15 million illegals right who have been here for more than five years give some dignity to those and then at the end to pay or re-educate those American workers who feel that they have lost their jobs because the illegals have come to take it away we have a within the dignity Bill we have a provision that we are going to re-educate those American workers easy it's an easy fix the problem is that you need one thing called political willingness and that's why I'm here a brown girl from the hood from Miami I have presented a very good bill and I need bipartisan support to make it through so where does it stand congresswoman because as you lay that out I mean I haven't studied at all but that sounds pretty reasonable it also sounds a little bit like what I thought we were close to under the Trump Administration we came close didn't we to some sort of a bipartisan Arrangement that included an awful lot of what you just said no under trump it was basically taking care of the dreamers because that's what the Democratic party specifically Nancy Pelosi she wanted to take care of 1.8 million dreamers which is okay but there's a lot more people be behind or besides the dreamers dreamers who are illegal in this country and then Trump wanted some border security and the Democrats did not want to even go there well now reality has hit everyone in the face and look at what's happening at the southern border we the Hispanics largest minority in the country I say it once again we do not want illegal immigration because those people are going to wind up in our Barrios we have the fentanyl we have the child sex traffickers the coyotes the terrorists we don't want any of of that we want to order and then those who are here already be able to live in dignity in the promised land and at the same time help look you are a an um a business oriented news station you know the business community in this country is dying for hands they need if we want to grow as the number one economy in the world we need to keep a growing economically and how do you do that by having workers there are no workers you are so right every single person we talk to the business Community says we gotta fix this immigration because we need the workers one last one because I know it's really important to you you propose a resolution with Steve scalise one of your colleagues there Republican colleague condemning socialism I've read through it and again business oriented we believe in capitalism it sounds pretty reasonable to me but in reading it I wondered who's on the other side of that argument is anybody in a prominent position United States today arguing for socialism because I'm not sure who they are I mean really like nationalizing companies is anybody arguing for that look I come from Miami the heart of the Cuban Exile Community we know what socialism means so you may call it Democratic Socialism or pragmatic Socialism or simpatic of socialism I don't care as long as you hear the word socialism you run the other way because we know that the Democratic socialism is what Hugo Chavez promised the Venezuelans 20 years ago and Democratic socialism is what Fidel Castro promised the Cubans 60 years ago and I don't have to tell you how those stories ended right the average Venezuelan weighs 15 pounds less because of lack of food because there is no production the average Cuban eats only once a day because there is no food fifty percent of the Cuban land is not produced and so and on and on and on so we're going to bring this to the floor and let's see which member of Congress wants to vote against this idea okay we will certainly be watching that closely thank you so much really great to have you with us that's Republican representative Maria Alvarez

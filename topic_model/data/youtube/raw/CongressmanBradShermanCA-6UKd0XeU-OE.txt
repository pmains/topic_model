congressman brad sherman who's with us who's done important work on the terrorism subcommittee of Foreign Affairs this has been part of his focus he's with us here today and a good friend and colleague would like to welcome congressman brad Sherman [Applause] hello I'm Brad Sherman from California's best name city Sherman Oaks for 21 years I've sat with chairman Royce on the Foreign Affairs Committee and he was there back in 1997 when I put forward the proposition that Iran was the number one threat to American national security as to qatar amir al fani is trying to perform a effort of political gymnastics that would have disabled nadia comaneci look at the splits he seeks to have one foot with the Brotherhood and the extremist Sunni he seeks to put another foot with the United States the moderate Sunni and the Gulf Cooperation Council and while these legs are separated beyond human capacity he's trying to do it all while kissing Ayatollah Khomeini that is a disabling act of gym political gymnastics he may believe that we are obligated to protect his regime because he hosts an American political base the Castro brothers never reached the same conclusion it is time for Al Thani to pick a side stop supporting Al nusra and stop supporting Hamas as to Iran we need the maximum sanctions the maximum enforcement of nuclear restrictions and the maximum international support one way to justify additional sanctions is to renounce the nuclear deal doing that would cause Europe not to support our additional sanctions and in many and many of many in the world would even say that Iran was then free to reopen its nuclear program without inspections or restrictions fortunately the world is based is blessed with an almost in quite beyond possible use natural resource and that is our supply of evil coming from Teheran we can impose the maximum sanctions without even mentioning the Iran deal and then we will have European support as we point to almost 500,000 dead Syrian civilians a direct responsibility of Tehran as we point to the Terrorism around the world as we point to how they treat their own people and the execution of those in the LGBT community there is no shortage of reason to support to impose sanctions on Iran and if we do enough they will come begging to us to note to have negotiations on all the pending issues including the inadequacies of the nuclear deal thank you [Applause]

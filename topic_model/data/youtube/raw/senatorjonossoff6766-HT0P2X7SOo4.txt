senator ossoff who i believe is joining us virtually to ask the first round of questions senator ossoff are you there yes i am madam chair and thank you for kindly allowing me to ask my questions at the top of the hearing under secretary torres small welcome it's a delight to see you i wish that we could meet i hope we will soon and thank you for joining today to discuss these important issues i want to begin on the subject of language access and the housing market it's a big issue in rural communities in my state i hear about it pretty regularly for example from latino constituents asian american constituents just to give you a sense for example in stuart county georgia over 15 percent of the population face language barriers and so what i want to ask you is first of all to comment on the steps that you intend to take and are taking to help americans who face language barriers to navigate the housing market in the housing system and then ask you to commit to working with my office and on a future visit to georgia sitting down with leaders in the latino community the asian american community other communities facing language barriers to discuss what steps we can take together to help ensure all americans can access safe affordable housing thank you senator assaf for your question and for looking at a truly important issue which is working with people in all of rural development and the work that we do rural housing is where we have the most interaction with uh the final recipient of the services that we get to provide and it's so crucial that there's a real partnership there and the most fundamental piece of that is is language is communication i was recently in arizona where this issue came up because of course spanish language and the accessibility there is crucial so we do have the civil rights office that helps to make sure that the documents are translated and that there is also translation services available but also working to make sure that we have technical assistance from our rural development employees so that they can be there because the written language is one thing but when you look at a 504 repair loan for example and you're working with an elderly woman who may only speak spanish makes less than fifteen thousand dollars a year sometimes you also just need someone to sit down and have a conversation with her and the ability to do that reinforces how crucial having staff on the ground that are from those communities to be able to provide that service so certainly appreciate your comment about the importance of language accessibility and would love to visit georgia to speak with stakeholders about that thank you i appreciate that commitment under secretary and it sounds like uh we see eye to eye on the importance of addressing this issue i want to raise for your attention um a uh particular concern for affordable housing in cordeal georgia and just for your awareness a community and core deal was approved for funds to establish more affordable farm labor housing through the usda 514 516 programs that project was approved by usda in 2018 was delayed in construction by the pandemic and some processing changes at usda since then the estimated cost has increased significantly i'm going to follow up with you and get you the details more broadly what i'd like is a commitment from you that on that future visit to georgia you'll engage with my office and local leaders to address the specific matter of affordable housing in cordeal georgia and to have that broader conversation about improving access to affordable housing throughout rural georgia senator ossoff i really appreciate you bringing up this issue although it's a specific one it's it's not uh unique there's across the country we've heard from our partners who are seeing increased construction costs and the supply chain and so we are responding to that in a few ways we're seeing it both in self-help and to your example in farm labor and for farm labor there's a very specific route that we're trying to address it so with some uh construction projects they were awarded and i know i'm about to run that time but they were awarded under a nofa that had a cap a limit on how much we could award so the only way we can extend that is if we recompete and so we're working very closely with the stakeholders you mentioned to identify the opportunity to recompete that and we feel that they'll be very strongly situated to be able to make the case for those additional cost overruns we're also encouraging them to find other partners as well in that financing but working very hard to partner with them because all of us are suffering the impacts of the supply chain so for that specific issue i want to make sure that our teams are working together closely so i'm not weighing in on an application process but certainly would love to further discuss the larger issue of housing in georgia when i'm able to visit that's great looking forward to it and you know in places like dooley mcintosh and warren counties we're seeing folks leaving those communities because housing is becoming unaffordable so looking forward to working with you to address these concerns that my constituents raised with my office and with me every single day and i appreciate your presence appreciate your leadership i yield back thank you senator ossoff

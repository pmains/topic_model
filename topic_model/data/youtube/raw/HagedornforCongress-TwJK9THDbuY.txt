you make it sound like at some point your life you stubbed your toe this is not what happened to you but for folks that do not know that Jack Zimmerman's story you were I believe it was of you if I remember right an electrician or we're working for Electric Company and then decided you want to join this service and I believe was because of 9/11 correct when 9/11 happened and then I got out of high school went to college for a year and try that out and found out Polydor them for Jack and I started out by tradition and from there I went down recruiter station and I want to serve my country and went to for betting and became an infantryman in jump school and all that and I was in Afghanistan I stepped on ie D over there and and I went was flown down to Texas where I rehabbed down there and just moved back to Minnesota and late 2012 and and I have a wife and two children now who live just outside of Mankato and uh yeah this year's gonna be my year I'm actually uh going full-time doing the speaking thing and and you're killing me smalls you're killing me you you go through this I joined the service went down the Fort Benning you did the thing you were you didn't just join the service first off you and to become an Airborne Ranger with 101st right just a guy who'll jump out of a perfectly good plane okay so then you head over to Afghanistan and you just throw out and I

yourself to a point where you're up and moving and and and not in constant pain and then I spent about a year and a half total trying to rehab myself you know my right hand was damaged severely and I was right-handed before so my head alone how to read excuse me and learn to rewrite each everything and as I've talked to a lot of people and I said you know when people are studying goals I went from being an infantryman in the US Army you can deploy me anywhere in the world and I would win to trying to touch my nose so I could so that as soon as I could touch my nose I could eat again and I could drink again and I could do those things you know and so we're setting goals and so important to just realize where you're at your life to what needs to be done you and I talked about this this this changes the trajectory of your life I mean there's everyone has something that makes them who they are but this changes the trajectory from electrician do I want to be an army guy to now where you're

if you wanted me to come to your corporation or your school or whatever wherever you want me you can go to Jack Zimmerman and mancom J ACK me I mm er mmm mmm calm and that's where you can find all my information and I'm on Facebook at Jack simmerman and Instagram and Twitter at at Jack simmerman 23 and for folks to give you know a little bit better you did just start a podcast if I'm not mistaken so in the video there for me and so I'm down here fishing were salami buddies and some friends of mine and I've been working my way down here sobbing in Kentucky for a few nights stopping in Tennessee for two nights and now in northern Alabama I've been shooting some podcast and we've been trying to roll that out for the last week but be honest with you I'm not I'm not the best with technology and the backend work and building a podcast and extremely expensive but I hope in the next week or two we have this thing rolled out and really it's just me sharing a bunch of stories with with my friends and then letting you in on some of the conversations I'm having and what makes me and my friend sick and and why we do what we do and and I'd meet so many cool people I thought the world I didn't share this with the world so good yeah this is Jeremy Jack how you do and this is Jeremy Munson I just want to say that Jack Zimmerman is probably one of the most inspirational in motivational people that I have met and if anybody has a chance to have Jack come in and speak to them there if you if you run a company and your employees are lazy and you bring Jack in there and they're gonna say if all the stuff Jack is done check Jack travels around the country hunts down the old lions and bears or what you know he he is a is absolutely motivational to get your workers moving absolutely the fantastic am I gonna have a bringing an amendment to specifically exempt the segways Jack just for you yeah and for those of you who have not met Jack his his main mode of transportation is a sent as a Segway with the with with the poll taken off and where he you know sits on and balances on two wheels it's an amazing looks for device and Jack has worked with the manufacturer to get these great great modes of transportation to disabled veterans around the country thanks for Beth that I was actually I still have number three that's the chair I use the most Martha third she ever made and it's by far the biggest piece of technology that I've used in my life and and the other piece that I used everywhere I go hunting all over the country is from the independence farm down in North Carolina and that's my tractor I get out napping and I can hunt and go off new place with that and you know it's a pretty supposed to group of guys that I work with down there - I do motivational speaking with them - so I'm just lucky to be able to travel all over the country and meet so many great people and and they have an opportunity to share my stories there's the therapeutic for me and and maybe I can affect somebody along the way and and I've just been given so much opportunity since I've been entered to LA to meet people I'm just true in most Western in the world Jack I thank you very much for calling in for us today and being with us today for this first show that we've done I appreciate it jack yeah great to hear your on the radio it's a good place for it thank you jack we'll see at the Mavericks game yeah and again if you ever want to get a hold and then go to Jacqueline I'm I'm calm he's a good promoter - thank you jack thank you back to talking with Rick I have this opportunity very often in congressman I appreciate you coming in I would like to share a story that I'm I've read and I suppose the Free Press or something but you your dad was the representative here I don't think it was the first that I was the second or something in the 70s right 1974 in 74 Nike was the only new Republican elected in the Watergate year 1974 the whole state of Minnesota I want the inside stuff you get the stuff you see but here's what I didn't have any clue on and it struck me so you go to Washington you get you voted in you go there and somebody says hey we're picking offices a day grab a number out of a hat or something I don't know how they decide you do this yeah that's kind of how they do it dad no not really yeah well the office is for members of Congress members the house are all based on seniority so you get all the way down to the freshman and then you have a class like we did of about 80 85 86 people and you draw a number out of the box and you'd that determines what what order you get to select the remaining offices so I selected 45 I guess the senator would say that's the Trump number I don't know but 45 and and yeah then you commence and you start suit so we're in 2019 of the the greatest country in the history of the world and they're drawing numbers out of a hat 20 last year orientation 2018 so anyway the the cool part is you so you get 45 mhm and you decide if it's available you got your dad's old office I think that's just kind of really cool that 4045 years later you actually got your dad's along yeah we're in 325 Canon it's the same office he moved into 44 years ago and it's it was great my father was there at or at our swearing-in he was there when we moved into the office so really really exciting and neat and in two years the canon building you know each two years one of the wings is being remodeled so our office will be remodeled in a couple of years but if we're able to stay in office when they fix it up I get the first dibs to go back to it and I think we will well that's fantastic now can you give us any inside skinny on the cool stuff that happens we can come but you get the wash you didn't tell us the coolest thing first vote you had to make you probably weren't happy with well yeah that was for Speaker of the House so you didn't get that's the most consequential vote anybody ever cast it's that first one to organize the body and I voted for Kevin McCarthy the Republican and Nancy Pelosi the Democrat happened to win that one but in a couple of years we're gonna try and hold this seat and get back about 20 more and try to take back the house for the Republicans is it what you thought it would be them I mean you've kind of knew what was going on I guess if they haven't changed throwing numbers out of a hat and 200 years ago you know it is I mean being around it when dad was in office and and working for congressman staying when this I did in the eighties um you kind of you kind of understand what's going on but there's always lots to learn and you know you have put a staff together in offices we'll have our man Cato office up and running here pretty quickly I'm gonna ask you about you do well I've won in Mankato and wanted Rochester and you know we're gonna we're doing everything we can to connect up with our local officials like Senator France and representative Monson and you know senator Draheim and the rest of them senator Rosen to make sure that we can work together to help our constituents what what getting constituents get from your office I mean this and I live in Mankato I I got a beef with something I call your office I buzz on down there and I sit down and say what I mean what can I get for sure I mean everyone that's elected in the US House one of their major responsibilities is to help people in their district that have some interaction with government where they either need something or they think that you know something needs to change well it could be a social security issue an immigration thing could be an agriculture problem and so they don't they come to our office where we're going to have caseworkers and others there to listen to their concerns and then we will interact with the federal government in their behalf and try to get them an answer we'll do what we can to to get a positive answer but the main thing is to you know get that concern addressed so you know that's that's the man that I think that congressman walz and his staff did a good job I think congressman penny when he was in office did a good job I hope my dad and Gil good Nick and the rest of them didn't that that's no we're just gonna do the basic work for the people doesn't matter who they voted for or anything like that that's our that's our job and our responsibility it's interesting cuz I think that makes sense but we had two other normal Minnesota three other normal Minnesotans in the room often call the congressman's office I mean it you're politically you know I'm saying I don't know that it's ever happened in my life that I've well first of all I was very pleased to see two representatives of congressman Hagedorn office come into the Senate building and meet with me this week and they were both the constituent service people and that's what democracy includes which is representing everybody in your district no matter who they voted for - very nice Minnesotans and now I have a connection and if we have something where we need to call the congressman's office I know who they are also we're gonna have an office in Mankato thank you very much for that so that's constituent service and we have it in st. Paul and I have people come to my office all the time asking about issues that have to deal with federal changes or so I've worked with Wallace's office in the last session to to work through some issues I've got issues with riverbank erosion that kind of touches on is it federal or state and trying to work through these issues and I too sat down with congressman's congressman Hagedorn staff this week to talk through how we can partner with constituent services it's really important I myself if called Walz his office a couple times to complain about my health care costs when I was a mad voter okay I also called to get tickets to the inaugural ball or the inauguration of the president you know for some reason he wasn't hoarding tickets to Trump inauguration I did get some from his office Bobby what is it speaking which is there something off the top of your list and the committees you're on that that representative Hagedorn could do for you is there something we should look thank you I got like for me I'm not a farmer but this whole idea that we needed 50 foot of drainage or whatever from the waters and I'm like is there something that says 50 feets the right answer was 20 the right answer the other 20 s just you know buzz that's buffer is that something we could look at what is it that you could get from the from the congressman who's on the AG committee that's basically a state issue so but waters of the US or something it's the u.s. I mean I think what the president Trump's done on that has been exactly right it was an overreach by President Obama no way in the world Congress that the United States ever intended through the Clean Water Act to have the EPA come out and regulate every you know puddle and and put the federal government in a position where they could come in and and have influence over farmers and small business people and property so I've totally against that and thought it should be defunded or defeated any way possible one of the fixes that I support is to make sure that the House and the Senate have to affirm major regulations before they are implemented that's called the reins act the Republicans have passed it many times in the house the the Senate and the Democrats kind of held back but I think that's a fix that would make sense if you can't get it through the house in the Senate and they're the ones that write the laws it shouldn't be a regulation good well first of all it's a stadia shuen buffer strips and I actually came out during the campaign in 2016 a little bit against governor Dayton's rollout because I didn't feel one-size-fit-all but as far as what the congressman can do for us I still think it starts in southern Minnesota with agriculture and I think everything we can do to support our farmers whether it's regulatory reform tax policy especially now with commodity prices where they are you know now if I only got to ask for one thing that's what I'd be asking for and I would get you it go ahead and break in okay my my big ask of the federal government now would be on prescription drugs I would love to have major reform for prescription drug prices allowing us to reaffirm other countries so that we would stop subsidizing the rest of the world for pharmaceuticals it would drastically decrease the cost of us for our pharmaceuticals in Minnesota and in everywhere in the country and it would be a great change to bring competition and price transparency into pharmaceuticals that can be done at the federal level so I suppose these two can speak to you and you could be that voice there when everybody's chatting about it is that are they I think will work together on issues and we'll cooperate as best we can we all have our different ideas and philosophies but on the prescription drugs the Rhian portation of drugs not I don't know if I really subscribe to all that because what you have our socialist systems that browbeat the companies drive down costs and then all of a sudden worse you know we're subsidizing now it's not good but what I like is something where you have let's say the hepatitis C drug that was developed and it cost seventy five thousand but you're cured and it's a heck of a thing saves a lot of money in the medical care system health care system maybe the federal government Shep bounties for drugs like that make those companies whole so they can drop the price down for the regular you know American customer and maybe we can solve some of those problems that way but you've seen at Minnesota and elsewhere with the price of insulin skyrocketing it's a problem I understand it and and I think you of course the two of you see it every day because you're you're here really with the people each and every day and unfortunately they send me out to Washington too much but let me throw this out the the tariffs China you know trying to get that obviously it would help us in the long run help us a ton as a farmer here what are you guys has thoughts on that I'm going to ask people they want to talk with any of these three we have representative Monson senator Front's and Congressman Hagedorn in the room 507 625 14 20 we four against this whole tariff battle because it's interesting if we win it's great but if we don't our farmers are being beat up I guess I would say from the state perspective that I did not have a lot of farmers in my district worried about Chinese intellectual property theft and I'm waiting to see I think just like we talked about the House and Senate have their prognosis the president has his prerogative and we'll see how it turns out in the end at this point most of the people in my district would take a truce just to call it off and go back we'd see a bump in corn and soybeans and I think that would be helpful i golf with a couple farmers were sitting there having a beverage and I asked him when this spring first started he goes you know what in the short term this is court this will be bad but he was looking at he said but if we win this you open one seventh of the world's economy to these farmers he was he's seeing it as a short-term loss you guys I'm a Republican I believe in smaller government and I've always been for free markets I prefer free markets over you know tariffs and so I'm a free trade free markets guy and I know that we've been getting beat up by all the other countries and what President Trump says about the other countries taking advantage of us is absolutely true and we can't continue to lower tariffs while they maintain theirs and so what he's doing the strategy he's using it has a very great potential of working and I think you should continue to do it it's painful in these you know months or a year or two years that we have to go through this but I think ultimately it's going to allow everybody to lower their tariffs and have free markets now is that what your constituents think you guys are out here running around and you know you're Republican we just ran in elect and you know I told everybody that I'm not a big Tara fan I think that they're good for the governments that impose them in the industries they try to protect but they have diminishing returns and but you know President Trump when he ran on this issue and he said China was stealing our intellectual property intellectual property as the senator says that they were manipulating their currency that they were cleaning our clock in many ways and he said also Mexico Canada and other countries had an advantage he wanted to fix it so he's gone out there and we have a new agreement with Mexico and Canada and the AG groups and others think that's pretty good I intend to vote for it unless somebody can show me why I shouldn't and with with China now it looks as though there might be some movement and by March 1st we could have some sort of agreement at least that's that's the plan or that's the that's the goal and you know I think in the end we have to drop the barriers we have to expand the markets and do everything we can but the people in agriculture the farmers I'd say 19 out of 20 of them that I spoke with they stuck with the president they stuck with the Republicans because before there was a war or a tariff war there was a war on agriculture by the liberal left wing of the Democratic Party on things like waters the United States and regulations the Obama care which was crushing them energy policies they were driving up and I think they wanted they wanted a different you know something different that's what they have with with us but I don't mean to get too partisan here but that's kind of where we are let me it's the DFL is the farmer Labor Party and most of us and again talking for all regular guys we never thought about terrace much then when all this comes out I had no clue that China Canada had like a seven hundred percent tariff on milk that kind of screws the Minnesota milk guy and I'm like I didn't know that you know you guys have to be up on all this stuff which I give you credit for doing it but were you where most York incisions like me just shocked that this was going I guess we all knew China bad I mean China was doing it I had no clue Canada was messing with us like that well Canada has strict limits on how much farmer how much milk farmers can produce you actually have to buy a contract with the government in Canada to deliver milk so you like based on how many cows you have it's a very button-down system you know socialist system that they have with for their milk production so that's why they don't allow milk to come into their kind okay but I mean I didn't know you knew this did this is I mean my eyes are wide I'm like really 700 percent it's not well first of all as far as dairy goes our dairy farmers in Minnesota got a break in the farm bill that's a good thing we also have that particular industry under a little bit of pressure which has to do with the need greater in dairy to grow or you know have competition issues but I would say this on the tariffs it's less clear to me that the United States has been taken advantage of to the extent necessary to put these tariffs out there I'm not an economist just a lawyer from Mankato so we'll see in the result in the negotiations my question was when we had the World Trade Organization which we formed and we got China into we won like 80 percent of our claims so I would just ask the question for all the countries what's wrong with having an arbiter there why can't that be good enough for us at the end of the day what I hear is the price of corn the price of soybeans so we'll see the you know the price of corn the price of soybeans for about five years the commodity prices have been low the input costs have been high our farmers have struggled going back to the middle of the the Obama administration it wasn't necessarily President Obama's fault that's just kind of the way it works so I agree that you had countries like especially Mexico Canada and China and they're going back after our farmers because they know that's where our pressure points are but so far the farmers have said stay the course let's get this done let's let's work it out let's make it better like you did with Canada and Mexico Korea the European Union and let's hope it happens with with China but I but I will also say they don't have unlimited patience and we need to have this resolved as soon as possible that's the message that I I sent the White House just about a week ago amen to that okay absolutely and again I just don't know that the rest of us spend much time in these fields and you guys I hate to say it gotta be jack-of-all-trades I mean you talk transportation I know how much as a lawyer you're a transportation guy before you got hired on you know you guys just have to figure all this stuff out I presume transportations and other things between 35w Falls you know whatever was ten years ago that's a federal thing wasn't it at 35 a federal trunk highways and that bridge yeah the bridge yeah no they were in the middle of it but there were some state aspects of it too the oversea some of the projects but what again back to where you had second tour each other out cooperation between federal and state by the way my position on transportation has taken much money from Washington in the funds and sent it back to the states so people like the senator and the representative and governor walls and others can figure out how to how to spend that money most efficiently here at the local level all right it's tuned a minute so y'all gonna give you smoke you say the Senators money back represent hey gran but walls governor walls would like a tax increase now I thought I've read 25% of the gas tax to make us whole we were talking off air it might be 20 cents to get us to that six hundred million dollars or whatever it is a year yes no is that gonna happen I got two and half minutes are we gonna need a gas tax increase while we have 1.5 billion F left over in the budget well I'm in the Menard I'm in a minority and they in the house so I have very little say but if there is to be a gas tax I will be voting against it and trying to throw every single amendment on that thing I can to try to tank it including the preventing the dog from sitting on his lap while he's going down the road as a member of the minority in the Senate but serving on the Senate Transportation Committee I would support an increase in a gas tax the American Society of Civil Engineers has given us a c-minus on our roads and a d-plus on our bridges we're talking about the two parties roughly agreeing that we're 600 million short over the next 10 years and if we have another bridge go down it's not going to be a question of if we have an increase but how much I think we can work within the parameters of divided government find some compromise maybe make some deals and get it done Margaret Anderson Kelliher who's the new MnDOT commissioner just happens to be a man Cato West grad we met this week she's got some ideas it's time for some leadership and represent hey Grover before we leave I think it's 1818 1/2 cents a gallon taxes federal you'd look into pushing that back down no I don't think they're gonna look to change that at least I don't support a gas tax increase it's disproportionately affects the folks here in the rural areas and you know I think you have to find some some other way to deal with this but roads and bridges roads and bridges roads and bridges let's get that done and then let's worry about some of those expensive 15-seconds rebels that have you got it the gas tax disproportionately impacts roll minnesotans because we drive less efficient vehicles and we make less penny for average so it's a tax on real Minnesota gentlemen thank you very much for coming in I would throw back you dusty I thanks guys it is five o'clock here from excuse me Katie OMA Cato am 1420 FM 102.7 and online at koat.com it's time for ABC

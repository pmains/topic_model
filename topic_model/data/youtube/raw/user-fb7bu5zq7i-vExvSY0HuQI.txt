Mr Speaker throughout my career I have worked to protect vulnerable populations yesterday I was proud to support the consumer protection and Recovery Act which will aim to protect exploited consumers including the elderly who are oftentimes the most at risk the Federal Trade Commission has an essential role to safeguard consumers from businesses that utilize misleading and deceptive practices these Bad actors must be held accountable and the victims of any scam of any scam deserve justice I appreciate the leadership of the house Energy and Commerce Committee to ensure that the FTC has the capabilities it needs to protect all individuals from fraud I encourage our Senate colleagues to consider this important legislation as soon as possible thank you Mr Speaker and I yield back my time

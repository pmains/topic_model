is ross is next um thank you mr chairman and thank you for holding this hearing and to all the panelists for joining us today um the committee members have heard this before but to the panelists i represent the research triangle area of north carolina i represent wake county and the research triangle area has a growing ecosystem of hundreds of innovative and collaborative companies including science and technology firms government agencies academic institutions including duke uh startups and non-profits the ibm quantum hub at nc state university is a cross-disciplinary center of quantum computing education research development and implementation the ibm quantum hub at nc state works with researchers from duke and unc chapel hellhill to help partners develop quantum teams and ex explore promising use cases and promotion of quantum computing in real world applications and so dr monroe uh congratulations on the quantum computing user facility at duke and i want to see how these partnerships work but there's a real world application that we've been dealing with um this past couple weeks on cyber security and how we might be able to collaborate between research institutions um and the private sector and use quantum computing um to maybe prevent some of the kinds of things that we're seeing particularly when we're dealing with 20th century technology that hasn't moved into the 21st century and um i don't know if the committee has dealt with this um earlier i was in another committee meeting but i'd love to hear from you about how quantum computing might help us with cyber security uh okay thank you for the question uh uh congresswoman um so indeed the known killer application of quantum computers is uh code breaking uh uh cracking the most popular data encryption schemes we have um it looks like that application is one of one of the hardest out there we need much bigger machines to do that um that said we we also are this has been said before we're at such an early stage in the game we we know we can shrink the problem we can make it more efficient through software by by being more clever on how we structure not only the instructions that we run the quantum computer but the quantum computer itself how we control it and this is why at duke for instance we're collaborating quite we're starting a very uh large collaboration with with the colleagues you mentioned at nc state and they're experts in computer architecture we make machines and you know this is sort of a marriage that we we really like the direction of that now um making code breaking problems easier is something that won't happen in isolation won't happen by me or you know won't happen by somebody that doesn't have a machine so i think they have to work in unison and you know i've at inq we've worked closely with uh with ibm uh ibm also uh writes software that supports our system the expression of our particular hardware um and you know ibm i think has really you know taken a lead at educating the public on using systems they were the first to put their system on the cloud and we've sort of followed a few years later so it's it's a wonderful ecosystem down here in north carolina but um you know also at the company inq which is a duke maryland startup up inside inside the beltway in washington they they're very close to the national security agency and you know we we're we we understand that communities needs in this field so it's uh i i don't know what else else to say it's a very exciting time for the field we'll take problems anywhere they come from but security is a big one and i think one the one last comment um what's not mentioned so much is the the the energy grid that's a huge logistics problem and i was horrified to find out that apparently i think the way energy is coordinated across the country it's not maybe it's not done very smartly it's not my field i shouldn't comment on that but we do know that's one of the one of the most vexing optimization problems we have and the news in the last few weeks especially here in north carolina is that boy it'd be nice if we uh made that a little smarter in the future i'm not sure exactly how quantum will play a role there but if it's an optimization problem we want to take a crack at it well you anticipated my second question and that is how open are you know some of our big energy companies to your help uh well you know in iq we are you know we're not a company that can afford to talk to 50 different companies in parallel but we do have uh conversations with a few energy companies that have teams on the ground that are ready they want to deploy quantum for their uses these could be oil and gas or uh you know related to big pharma or uh you know developing new fuels it is a researchy time in the field right now but they're very open to working with companies like ours like ibm and so forth and going into the future so in terms of the energy grid that's definitely not my area of expertise um uh yeah so thank you thank you mr chair i've exceeded my time and i yield back

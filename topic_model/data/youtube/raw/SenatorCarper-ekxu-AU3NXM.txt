president last month just hours after Congress passed bipartisan legislation to fully fund our federal government I was privileged to join with Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and former members of the house representatives including our at-large congresswoman from Dell law and Lisa Blount Rochester to lead a congressional delegation to Honduras Guatemala and Salvador three countries that are oftentimes collectively referred to as the northern triangle our delegation was on a fact-finding mission we wanted to drill down on the root causes of illegal immigration from Central America and assess the effectiveness of a new approach in recent years to help improve condition on the ground in those three states on our flight to Guatemala several of us watched as president Trump in order to build his long pomp promised wall declared a national emergency even though while illegal immigration has spiked in the last couple of months across her sword the southern voters if you go back to 2001 through the end of 2018 it's actually dropped by believenot 80% as former chairman of the Homeland Security and government affairs committee I understand the need for secure borders and I've supported efforts to enhance border security security over the last two decades that I've served in his body I've been down to Central America a number of times with people like John Kelly General John Cal Kelly when he was SOUTHCOM commander with jeh Johnson with Ron Johnson both of whom who served as chairman of Homeland Security Committee John McCain and into that part of the world and along the the border border with with Mexico de to better understand what our needs are for border security since 2003 the United States has bent believenot 263 billion dollars that's almost a quarter of a trillion dollars on border security we double the number of border agents so we've deployed hundreds of miles of barriers and roads and places where they are most effective we've funded a highly sophisticated surveillance aircraft equipment drones and airplanes helicopters mile high dear intervals along with motion detectors high-speed boats tunnel detectors and a lot more the the approach on board security and our border of Mexico needs to be multi-layered and it is and in some places berries do make sense a lot of places in fact there's some places actually walls the kind of president Trump's envisioned think of San Diego and maybe Juarez make make sense with a lot of other places where different kinds of barriers make sense some places roads alongside of barriers make sense we we've deployed aircraft when you deployed fixed-wing aircraft had played helicopters we've deployed drones and if you just put them out through by themselves there they're not going to do much good but if you put a highly sophisticated surveillance equipment on each of those platforms they give us the ability to see from our border into Mexico as much as twenty twenty-five miles in all kinds of weather and people's smallest children approaching our board then we know where to deploy our vote and patrol to to meet them in an intercept them we can put the same kind of sophisticated surveillance equipment on gear generals that go up five thousand feet ten thousand feet into the air we can put them on towers that are mobile towers that are stationary along a border as well we can put people on horseback then we put balloon on a similar Border Patrol officers on horseback and the reason why we do that in areas with high vegetation the Border Patrol officer on a horse a big horse can see over the vegetation and pick up people kind of trying to come across the border illegally some places are boats makes sense high-speed boats make sense and other places boat ramps make sense if you don't have boat ramps to can't put in the boat you don't have much mobility those are some of the things that we've done in terms of providing better border security and the encouraging knows is that a lot of us worked a lot of it has worked but we could build a wall from gosh the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean and if that's all we do people are still gonna come to this country not from Mexico not so much from Mexico people used to come in huge numbers from from Mexico if you look back in the history of the last oh gosh especially 15 years most of the folks who were coming here illegally were coming from Mexico across their borders today it's it's quite different there more people Mexicans going back into Mexico then there are Mexicans coming into the United States and most of the illegal immigrations coming not from Mexico it's coming from Guatemala it is coming from Honduras it's coming from El Salvador and the the trek through from the northern triangle these countries right here up through Mexico dark border is over a thousand miles probably closer to 1500 miles depending how yet you want to get there the spike in immigration we've seen in the last several months mostly it's coming from Guatemala from the other mountainous highlands and where you've got a lot of indigenous people and they don't have a very good lifestyle they have a lot of malnourished a lot of stunted growth there and not a whole lot in terms of encouragement of economic and economic opportunity mister mister president the reason why these people trying to get out of here to come up here let me tell you a quick story we have in the southern part of our state such as counties our biggest County we race Norma's numbers of chickens there for every person who lives in the Dell are mister as president there are 300 chickens and we have a lot of chickens in your home state to mr. president but got a lot of and we have a lot of folks who come up from actually this part of the world including Guatemala they come up and they work in poultry processing plants the good workers they work hard they we have a non-profit in the southern Delaware in Georgetown telecoil last fir'aun's it means hope and they worked with indigenous populations the legal and illegal migrants had to come to southern Delaware and a couple years ago as me I was visiting lost friends and they told me this story they told me a story about a young boy and his younger sister who fled that Guatemala we came to to the US and ultimately to della and this is why they came 15 year old boy in Guatemala approached by a gangs and his community and they said that we want you to join our gang and he said they talked to my parents first before I I do that and you know in his mind his parents wouldn't be too excited with that as we talked his person you're not gonna join a gang we don't want you to do that just tell him no and so he just kind of avoided the the gang members for a while but they finally got him caught him and and say well you know are you gonna join our gang and he said I talked to my parents and they don't want me to do that and so I not now I've just thought I could do it now and he said we have a message for you and your parents if if you don't join our gang somebody in your family's gonna die somebody new family's gonna die and when Harvey told his parents and their message and was joined the gang joined again just don't do anything stupid and so we joined the gang and they have to go some through our initiation ritual and as part of that ritual he was called on to rape his 13 year old sister he reported this it was what was expected of him to his parents and within a week he and his sister were on their way out of that country the the gangs in in these countries especially Guatemala they are entrepreneurial they may be involved in trafficking people they may be involved in trafficking drugs they are really good at extortion extorting money from small businesses going to a business and say I want I want you to pay me a protection money if you provide protection money I won't see I'll see that you're not harm and and then the merchants says who are you protecting me from and you're actually being protected from the guy he's trying to extort money from you and if you don't pay the money they'll kill you just like that and the rate of extortion in these three countries from gangsters who do multiple kinds of crimes that's one of their about one of their favors and the reason why people's live lives of misery has a lot to do with us and because we are addicted to drugs the drug traffic through these three countries and we're complicit in their misery we had a Catholic priest our mr. president come and testify before the Homeland Security Committee a couple of years ago and he described a situation where our drug addiction makes life miserable in these three countries and when they try to get out we make it difficult to impossible to get into to our country he the president priesthoods our awareness that day he said it's a little bit like a the fire department visits a house down here and the fire department goes into the house there's no fire the fire department goes into the house they start a fire and when the people try to run out of the house the fire department leaves the house locks the door and drives away and that is really a pretty good example of what we've done in in Central America we've lit the fire we've left that a family in the house and we've locked the door and driven away and that is I think morally wrong and we can do better than that well as it turns out aside from spending two hundred sixty three billion dollars along the border for security in the last 18 years or so someone's come up with a better idea and it's not a new idea it's an idea that's really based on something called Plan Colombia Plan Colombia was developed oh gosh 20 years ago when in Bogota to capital Colombia you had the the FARC the left Gorillaz trying to take down the government you had the drug lords and drug gangs trying to take down the government of Colombia and one day a bunch of gunmen rounded up the Supreme Court justices of Colombia they took him into a room they shot him to death and the Colombia's teetering and questions are gonna be able to make it and some very brave Colombian leaders stood up and said we're not gonna let this happen we're not let these guys take down our country and our president then Bill Clinton and the fellow was chairman Foreign Relations Committee Abidin found common cause with the leaders of Colombia and basically the Colombians developed a plan which would help stabilize their government and enable them to restore order rule of law and economic prosperity and we helped him I'll give one example of what we did our presiding officer put a lot of time in the military one of the things we did is we provided helicopters so that the military of Colombia and the police of Colombia had mobility and they could go all over a very mountainous rigorous country and track down the bad guys and that's what they did with our help we helped them figure out how to collect the revenues they didn't collect many revenues and the wealth of all the people in that country didn't paying much taxes at all and we taught them how to do a better job in revenues and and to use that to help develop their the government institution they in Colombia did the heavy lifting we helped it's like they say in Home Depot mr. president you can do it we can help and then our presiding officers heard me saying the Homeland Security Committee and environment Public Works ready rather can we say many times find out what works do more that Plan Colombia work took a long time reminds a little bit I'm an old Navy guy to return to there's moments like trying to change the course of aircraft carrier you stick with it you could eventually change the course of an aircraft carrier it doesn't happen fast in Plan Colombia has taken years to work but it's worked in about three four years ago when we're starting to see a real surge again in not from immigration illegally into our country but these three countries President Obama called on Joe Biden to kind of take off the shelf Plan Colombia and see if MIT possible develop a central Mid American version of playing Colombia and the idea would be to focus on three or four areas and we would provide some of the money but these countries would provide a lot more and because it's their country it's not our country but we're complicit in their misery so we have an obligation to help them I their moral obligation the three of three areas that the Alliance for Prosperity modern-day version Central American virginal play in Colombia three areas of focus are one economic Hope Economic Opportunity that's one it's one of the major drivers with people getting out of here lack of Economic Opportunity second violence lack of rule of law and three is just corruption corruption that's endemic and there's a federal government national government state local governments in business just endemic and those are the three buckets if you will mr. president did the Alliance for Prosperity was designed to to address we've put up some of the money the other countries put up a good deal more one example Salvador for every dollar we put up they put up seven and we use that money to among other things in Salvador to target 50 of the cities that are most called most crime the most crime and the we used some of our resources but a lot more of their resources and the crime in those 50 cities down dramatically in the last couple of years in the last couple of years Honduras murder rates down by about 35 percent these three countries vie for murder murder capital the world in half for some time murder rates in Honduras down by 35 percent 40 percent murder rates in Guatemala and Salford over the last three years down by half down by half would we still feel comfortable those neighborhoods probably not but it's better than what it what it what it the hunter it's one of the things he did is it they basically fired a third of their police officers replacing with vetted units and with that with that in mind they did a much better job on extortions better a much better job on kidnapping and actually bringing to trial and to sentencing the the folks are committing the the crimes we have USAID working down there and in some of the other San Salvador capital of El Salvador in Guatemala capital Guatemala creating almost like tech centers where young entrepreneurs can start your own businesses and they get some help from us some coaching from us and they are starting to leave in that time we can recovery they they these are beautiful countries lush beautiful beautiful beaches for these sellers places and so they're attractive on the tourism they have for the most part very fertile soil and with the right kind of helping coaching and mentoring they can be much do much better job feeding themselves and exporting a lot of what they what they raise but thanks you're starting to happen things are starting to happen after three years and again it's like that aircraft carrier I talked about mr. president slow at first and then more perceptible as time goes goes by and in South Africa the capital of El Salvador example we use some federal money American money in order to leverage Howard Buffett foundation to literally in the middle of the city go into the 17-acre what used to be a beautiful park later riddled with crime and clean it up make it beautiful again for the people of that city well a won national multinational companies come down and one of these countries in and put millions of dollars into creating a DEA DNA facility to helping the solving of crimes and little by little things are getting better problems social problems in Guatemala the highlands indigenous people and who are still trying to get out of there ninety percent of the immigration coming right now oh that part of Guatemala last thing I'll say is is is this they just had a election in El Salvador four weeks ago mr. president the current the president is seventy five-year-old guerilla leader who is a close friend of Venezuela Venezuelan leader that adores inauguration a month or so ago he's friendly with the Chinese friendly with the Cubans he is leaving stepping down as the president of that country uh a couple months who's going to succeed him then you thirty eight-year-old mayor of sin Salvador 38 year old who's a guest economic development he is free of corruption he is someone that has a good relationship with our embassy there and is highly regarded by by our folks it's an honest guy full of energy and in his campaign that is the first first candidate for president in the history of the country has gotten over 50% it didn't have to go to a runoff it's an amazing development harness social media to be able to get elected and meanwhile there's going to be a presidential election Guatemala in June and the three frontrunners Jimmy Morales is a president there somebody that Vice President Biden I've tried to mentor and initially start out very promising and more recently real concerns about corruption involving his his family but his time as president will expire in about the middle of this year but in Guatemala via the three front riders to to run for president or all women through all women and the person who's believed to be the front-runner Hall is is a woman named Thelma al Dona who is the immediate past Attorney General tough on crime tough on corruption and she's been in this side in this country for some this month and had the opportunity to to talked with Vice President Biden to get some encouragement from him and he is Joe Biden's beloved in Delaware but from some other places to around the country but they really love him here because he's been interested in root causes and not just treating the symptoms of our problems and challenges on the border but actually helping address those root causes and the the fellow who's desperate elected president salva our 38 year old millennial used social media his social media people have now started to help the former attorney general who's running for president of Guatemala as a presiding officer knows my colleagues now most important ingredient the success of any organization I've ever seen is leadership is leadership and we're seeing a changing of the guard a little in terms of age and also in terms of that's where they come from on a scale from from one to one to a hundred the last thing guy I want to mention if I could mr. president find my spot here in the the image without my notes none of this is easy but it it basically says we have a not we have a moral obligation to the folks down here we make their lives miserable because of my drug addiction we ought to help them they've got to do most of the work but but we have to help them and we can't just help them for a couple of weeks a couple of months or a couple of years and we found out in Colombia we got to stick with this a good deal longer and to end a call change the culture help change your culture these countries but I'm encouraged there mr. president to say that that change is happening and we just should keep it keep keep it keep it on there is a sense of optimism it's beginning to emerge in these countries and I think there's some reason to be encouraged that a plan model after Plan Colombia tailored especially for this part of the world can can actually succeed and if we don't give up and especially if they don't give up they very well will PS the cost of actually capturing somebody up on our border is trying to come in illegally detaining them but here in a holding camper of detention center feeding them healthcare eventually deporting them and sending back down to wherever they came from I'm told it's 27,000 dollars a person 27,000 dollars a person these people they Frank that they love their countries and given that they've been given a chance I think much rather stay down here they'd much rather stay down here and they'd like to come up and visit maybe do some work some time and go back home but they they want to have a decent kind of life and and frankly if we will help them realize that they will stay down here and may come up as tourists when we even go down there as tours but we heard that over and over again the last thing we heard down there they love America they love America they're mod they're mindful of what we're trying to do to help them where they're grateful for the help that we're providing and I know a bunch of them met a lot of them down there and some of them live on our state for most part good decent people and they deserve my help and I'm proud of support that this Congress has provided for the last four years for the Alliance for Prosperity my hope is it will continue to do that and continue to use that money to leverage a lot of good work not only those three countries by nonprofits NGOs foundations private companies and together the other will get the job done

John tune back in South Dakota in Sioux Falls South Dakota right now after visiting the Border kind enough to join us he is of course the Senate minority whip Senator always good seeing you you might have heard it end of Matt's report here this idea that encounters are going down the White House points to the trend being their friend what do you think I think it's a couple of things you know one is and think we heard this from border patrol agents yesterday is that it may be going down in the real Grand Valley sector but what's happening is they're shifting to other areas and what the the the criminal element South of the Border responds obviously to where um you know the most resistance is and so as you sort of beef up one part of the board and it's a long border they're moving to other sectors of the Border I they don't believe that there's going to be a significant drop off overall it's just a matter of where they're now you know deciding to cross a lot of that's dictated by how easy it is to get in and out of certain places and and that changes over time so I think overall it's still the border is still an unmitigated disaster the incentives for uh you know those who are profiting Smugglers human traffickers drug traffickers weapons traffickers to continue to try and get people into this country the profits are so big so so huge that the incentives there are are not going away and I think that the administration at least so far has been completely missing in action when it comes to and try and address what I think is a a major challenge not just from the humanitarian aspect of this but also if you look at what's happening in the interior of our country you know States like South Dakota we said this yesterday every State's now a border state because of the drug issue it's all coming across the southern border and then you've got this national security issue as well what we found out at the real real Grand Valley sector is that Chinese nationalists coming across the border illegally are up almost 500 percent over what they were last year so these issues are real they're they're National Security implications obviously and all kinds of illicit activity coming into this country through the southern border at the beehest of a lot of these cartels South of the Border did you see any of that migrant activity when you were there with your colleagues um because in some of the video that I was seeing it looked like there was some activity which is pretty bold if you think about it but what did you say it is and I've been down there in previous trips too and when you go out at night that's when people are trying to come in and there were a couple of groups that were apprehended while we were down there we were out there at about midnight one night and they actually had built these makeshift ladders to climb over the wall but the wall is an effective barrier and the border patrol agents will tell you this simply because even if it doesn't stop them it slows them down enough so that they can catch up to them and but you know the the activity down there particularly at night time gets rather intense and you can actually see some of the activity on the other side of the Border where the cartels operate last time I was down there you know believe it or not there was a there was a dead body floating in the water of the Rio Grande so you know these issues and there were they said last year up to almost 900 people were killed trying to cross into this country and then you couple that with the more than 70 000 people in this country who were killed as a result of fentanyl this last year this is a major crisis I mean like I said it is an unmitigated disaster down there on some of your house colleagues Republican colleagues are interested in impeaching on the security secretary mayorkas how do you feel about that well I mean there's got to be some accountability here and he continues to say and I I mean it just it's almost surreal it blows your mind when it comes up in front of Congress and says the border is secure um this is uh in in the worst way an absolute failure and so I think that you know time for replacement yeah I think that's perfectly appropriate because clearly what they're doing isn't working now I think it starts at the top it starts with the president the vice president I think he's acting on their directives and what I tell people and I believe this to be true Neil is that the majority opinion among Democrats in Washington is therefore an open border and any any steps that the president tries to make to slow the flow so to speak he gets pushed back and you know he's made announced made this announcement a couple of weeks ago about this change they're going to make in Maine he's already getting you know letters from Democrat members of the house and the Senate resisting it and so you know any steps they try and make to secure the board or try to take to secure the border they have to fight with their own party's political base which I believe sincerely thinks that this is uh you know an open border is the is the right policy for the country and you can just see the effects of that the results of that and it's really really pretty staggering yeah they're not all on the same page there Senator always good seeing you thank you for telling us how that visit went and what you discover

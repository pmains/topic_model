thanks Mr chairman the great diversity of this nation is just going to be displayed between Senator markey's questions and mine uh because in my state there are only nine communities where the population is higher than the elevation okay think about that where the population of the town is higher than the elevation of the town the point being Wyoming has extremely high elevations and extremely small populations and EVS don't function as well at altitude you can't go as far on a charge so it's very challenging for States like Wyoming to reduce greenhouse gases through its Automotive sector on our highways you've been on Interstate 80 you know it's a commercial truck transportation Corridor of real significance linking the nation between east and west so um I really understand why Coastal States states with small geography and massive populations want this addressed but in my state I'm concerned that this rule might be an electric vehicle mandate which Congress explicitly excluded during debates on the infrastructure bill or that it will Federal Highway Administration will focus on this to the exclusion of congressional intent to recognize this massive diversity in our country so can you help me know how you're going to balance between the understandable desires that Senator Mark just articulated and the concerns I have in a much different state thank you Senator lamis and thank you for that conversation yesterday and I would say that having worked in Delaware and in Kentucky and in Colorado uh it you know it's it you become very aware of this the what a what a beautifully diverse country that this is and how a one-size-fits all doesn't uh doesn't always work uh there I I would say that um you know when Governor Hickenlooper uh we're working as the cabinet they were trying to get us to buy alternate fuel vehicles for um for all the state agencies and as the dot we had a lot and we did that to the extent but I as I mentioned yesterday you know performance of those vehicles in the mountains at altitude in the cold if you're pushing snow you know you want to make sure that you have the right vehicle for that uh for that context and so my my commitment and and I also want to be clear that this is a rulemaking still open and public comment period so we'll we'll take all of those comments in uh before anything were to come out but but I just want to make sure that you know we're making Common Sense decisions that uh and that's what I would commit to if I am confirmed well thank you electric vehicles and the mileage they can travel between charges is tested on flat ground 70 degrees and it's there's there is no such place in Wyoming so there's no way to get the same kind of mileage out of a charge in a state like Wyoming that you can in the areas where those vehicles are are tested so thank you so much um my next question and thank you Senator Markey for uh your testimony as well I recognize the differences between our two states and I thank you I think you have represented Denver's called the mile high city is it not yes it is so you probably have a lot of experience in high elevations and electric vehicles so we'd look forward to your expertise thank you and he does indeed and I drive frequently between Denver and Cheyenne Cheyenne is substantially higher than Denver this could go on for a while I'll sleep I'll switch to the highway cost allocation study I had a legislation with with another member of this committee that would ensure future congresses had better data by requiring Federal Highway Administration to conduct a highway cost allocation study before the current authorization expires can you provide an update on that study uh uh thank you senator for that question I I'd be happy to more accurately do it uh through qfr if that would be uh acceptable absolutely okay yeah thank you um we talked a little about truck parking I want to bring that up again um uh that as I mentioned the truck traffic on Interstate 80 through Wyoming is phenomenal you'll drive for miles and see no passenger vehicles it's just truck after truck after truck it is truly a ribbon of highway uniting East and West for commercial Trucking purposes and the lack of truck parking is a major concern so I want to get your thoughts on that issue and I I want your commitment you'll work with me to help solve that problem if you're confirmed absolutely Senator lemus I uh um just throughout my time in transportation the the critical importance of freight uh and making sure that we talk about safety making sure that those trucks have a place to spend their their rest time uh is is absolutely critical and I I absolutely commit if confirmed to working with you on this important issue we have been informed that with a looming Railroad Strike it would take almost 500 000 trucks to replace uh the freight that is transported by Rail and so that sort of illustrates how important some of our Intermodal opportunities are in this country I understand that there's an updated Jason's law report that remains unavailable to the public this report outlines the lack of available parking for truckers Nationwide will you will you commit to an expeditious release of that report if you are confirmed uh uh Senator Lopez I I would commit to an expeditious release to with to the extent that I have would have purview if confirmed within Federal highways thank you and I have a couple other questions uh we sort of touched on him yesterday about Wildlife Crossing pilot programs for the record or would you like to be recorded we're gonna have a second round if you'd like oh great I'll probably just stay for the second round man thank you sure

uh thank you mr chairman and uh thank you for bringing us back into committee uh back into this room it changes the complexion uh that the aqua act is indeed well intended i understand that but i still uh like the the ranking member still have serious concerns with it it removes the cost benefit requirement and small system variances from the safe drinking water act i will be offering an amendment that to ensure these existing provisions remain in law the committee also examines the water assistance program at 2021. this bill created will create at the epa and as the ranking chairman ranking member i guess chairman in waiting uh just said that this is uh this is the first time and it establishes a government assisted social program and lastly the committee will have a markup on bills on pfas as i explained last week nearly a quarter of our members are new to the committee and we haven't had a hearing on pfest in two years despite all of our quest for one before last week's markup we need to understand that pfest is indeed a class of over 9 000 different chemicals with varying properties and characteristics and the science on pfas has evolved since this committee last had a hearing yet this bill takes a non-scientific one-size-fits-all approach to address the problem and and curiously mr chairman it includes a unique exemption from liability for airports now airports have been one of the biggest users of firefighting foam like people and pfos pfos and and yes the faa requires uh airports to use it and others like water utilities are also required by the federal federal government to filter their water containing pfas but they didn't get an exemption so obviously this bill is trying to do airports a favor but why not our water systems mr chairman at the proper time i'm curious i'll be interested to learn your explanation of why this committee is favoring one group over another and let's not forget that epa that he has made significant progress in addressing pfas since his bill was since his bill passed the house last year and congress has has already passed key part bipartisan laws to address it so mr chairman let's let's take the time to address the issue in a more thoughtful manner all these three bills before they go to the floor and i yield back the balance of my time thank you i thank the gentleman

the spike in gas prices are a daily reminder that those numbers could change quickly prices are inching closer to the national average today we see the 398 that is more than thirty cents higher than a month ago over a dollar above what we were paying this time last year before the budget debates take total control over center stage in Washington Democrats are taking steps they hope will lower the price at the pump Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal is joining me now to talk about this good morning sir thanks for joining us good morning Alan I know that the Democrats are overall trying to get ahead on this issue you have leader Reid backing the president's effort to repeal the billions in tax incentives for the oil industry the Department of Justice monitoring all fraud and manipulation in the markets you sir have called for more you want a grand jury investigation into this issue issue what is this all about speculation it's about speculation which is at an all-time high unprecedented levels of speculation and potentially illegal market manipulation and of course gasoline prices are becoming absolutely crushing up from three dollars just a year ago now to more than four dollars and twenty cents in Connecticut and crushing not just to consumers but to our fragile economic recovery so I want an investigation by the Department of Justice into potentially illegal civilly and possibly criminally illegal activity using if necessary a grand jury but certainly subpoenas FBI whatever is necessary to uncover the wrongdoing and send a very very profoundly important deterrent message that we will not tolerate this kind of illegal market manipulation but also the people who are betting that prices are going to continue to spiral upward on the bar on the wrong side of events yeah we just have even know for perspective they've gone up in terms of speculation prices of about thirty five percent since the unrest in the Middle East began and they've gone to about forty percent when we all know that we're filling it at the pump but i want to put into perspective sir back in Los Angeles the summer of two thousand eight the residents they were paying close to five dollars a gallon but then the prices it back down as they did nationwide so just the nature of gas prices are they cyclical in nature or do you think we're looking at a new norm here on the high side I don't believe we're looking at a new norm I believe that a certain element and portion of the spike is attributable to speculation and possibly illegal manipulation which is why i believe and investigation appropriate of course i'm also in favor of releasing a part a small part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and I want efforts measures against the OPEC nations which I've offered as legislation along with Senator Kohl and I believe strongly it has to be a multi-faceted solution which long-term will require other sources of energy renewables solar natural gas really we need a national energy policy so you're absolutely right that there have been cycles and to bring down these prices to a more moderate and affordable level we now need this act okay I want to turn the gears here and change up to the house intelligence committees we talk about Afghanistan sir that Chairman Mike Rogers is asked by Andrea Mitchell if bin Laden's death makes it easier to draw down in that country let's listen to that you know two different fights I thank you and I think every country every operation has to be considered differently what we're fighting in Afghanistan now is the resurgence of the Taliban the Taliban is what aided al-qaeda and gave them safe haven in Afghanistan to conduct operations against the United States give me a reactions member of the Armed Services Committee do you expect a troop drawdown because is the Taliban are major problem in Afghanistan hitting the Taliban in Afghanistan and al-qaeda depriving it of any safe havens or places where it can flourish and train and build certainly one of our major objectives and so we're further along toward achieving that objective and I hope we will stick to the timetable that the president has set out beginning with withdrawals and meaningful with this july and i think that the triumph and it is a huge historic crime in killing osama bin laden will enable and bolster that effort to begin withdrawing troops

well thank you mr president i have two words for today crack pipes cracked pipes not cracked pots many of us went to bed last night others waking up this morning and heads are exploding across this nation as we learn that this administration is giving crack pipes to crack heads i think when the history books are written about this president and 2020 through 24 that'll be the picture right next to the president's name a picture of crack pipes being given out by this administration i want to come back to that in a second though i have a picture of my dad today and her dog renny my dad and our family my mom an older brother a younger sister moved off the family farm when i was five and my dad was a proud proud police officer and i remember the day in kindergarten when my dad and our family dog rene came to visit and what a proud moment it was for me in three years my dad was head of the fire department and two years after that he became the chief of police my dad was the chief of police in el dorado kansas for some 25 years my dad represented law in the community he represented right from wrong and he applied that law equally there was a never a gray area for my dad i remember having dinner at my grandma's house one sunday evening and my and the phone ringing we didn't have pagers we didn't have cell phones and all i remember my dad was was saying stand down and my grandma looked at us and said you guys better hug your dad goodbye and i said grandma what do you mean he said well he may not come back and it was a familiar story of a domestic violence of a drunk husband with his wife on the front porch and there was always a 12-gauge shotgun that was never a 16 gauge or a 20 it was always a 12 gauge shotgun and my dad was the person that would go and disarm that person and it happened way too often but i just tell that story just as we reminisce as we know how important law enforcement officers are to all of us and i remember you know you sit around you you listen while you're making homemade ice cream and people ask my dad questions about crime and i think to those crack pipes and my dad always saying that drugs and crime go hand in hand like peanut butter and jelly the more drug abuse there is the more crimes there were in the community i remember somebody asking him why did he why would the police officers be so strict about petty crimes maybe it was a little vandalism maybe it was a broken window maybe it was graffiti i remember my dad talking about you have to set an example that if you allow people to vandalize if you allow people to to do graffiti if you allow people to break windows it's just a cascade of bigger crimes we finished up some town halls this past weekend 15 town halls in the past two weeks and what americans are concerned about is inflation and crime and this is what americans kansans are telling me that they're seeing live out every night on their television set they're seeing two million people maybe six million people cross our border illegally and they see this administration reward them with an all expenses paid vacation trip to any city in america america has seen riots and vandalism on television and this administration and his party applaud them every night we see looting and shoplifting but this administration says don't prosecute last year america saw five tons of fentanyl cross the border illegally across our southern border five tons so think of five big semi trucks loaded with a ton that's two thousand pounds of fentanyl and i remind everybody one teaspoon of fentanyl can kill two to three thousand americans we're seeing our law enforcement officers being told to turn their back on violent crimes to not chase the bad guys america sees this white house and their party turn their back on law enforcement officers and again i go back to my dad i remember it was probably around 2014 and my dad and i were fishing as we often do together probably crappie fishing on a farm pond in the flint hills of kansas my favorite place to be and my dad saying to me you know son i don't think that this president has the back of our law enforcement officers anymore and as i visit with those law enforcement officers every time i'm back and i appreciate them coming to my town halls and having my back but i can tell you that law enforcement officers across this country do not feel like they're being supported by this white house as i think about an america today versus growing up i do think there's been a decay in our culture and this defund the police movement from the radical laugh has made that culture even weaker we have members of this squad wanting to close federal prisons they encourage open borders they want illegals to use arrest warrants to get through the tsa and of course they want criminals to get off the hook there's this culture of lawlessness and again i go back to my generation of this if it feels good do it i remember that saying for the first time on some a song i believe from the early 1970s if it feels good do it and that's the way this country is acting right now and what's the result we see crowds chanting pigs in a blanket fry them up like bacon pigs in a blanket fry them up like bacon you know the next time one of those houses is burning down that one of those people live in i wonder who they're going to call or if they're stranded in a motor vehicle accident who's going to be the first one on the scene and again i go back to thinking about my dad and him carrying out one of my classmates in second grade from a fire and unfortunately the my classmate didn't make it 346 law enforcement officers shot in 2021 73 were intentional 24 officers shot last month the 40 percent increase ambush style attacks increased 115 percent we've never seen a crime wave like this across our nation not since the early 1990s anyway you the united states recently saw the fastest increase in murder rate ever recorded violent crime spiked 14 major democrat-run cities settling all-time highs setting all-time highs for homicide records the numbers continue to go up as i think about advice for this administration i know if they had the will they could fix this problem i know exactly what my dad would tell them he would say treat criminals like criminals treat police officers law enforcement officers like heroes tell them thanks reward them respect them it's time to refund the police folks it's time to secure the border let's hold criminals accountable it was a rare day but i would remember my dad talking at the supper table about someone they'd worked so hard to convict but a judge or a d letting them off d.a letting him off easy we need to prosecute the smallest of crimes we need an attorney general where is our attorney general where is he in the middle of this crime spree where is our attorney general he needs to be tough on crime instead of labeling parents as domestic terrorists and simply america's time to get back to our values the same values that my dad raised raised us on it's time like my dad did apply the law equally thank you so much mr president i yield back

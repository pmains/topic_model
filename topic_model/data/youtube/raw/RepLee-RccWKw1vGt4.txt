Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to commemorate the life and legacy of congresswoman shirley Chisholm last week she previously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom our nation's highest civilian award congresswoman Chisholm is truly deserving of this honor in 1969 she became the first african-american woman to serve in Congress she was the first majority party african-american candidate and the first democratic woman to run for president she was also a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus congresswoman Chisholm our mrs. C as we called her was my mentor and role model the course of my life changed when I met congresswoman shirley Chisholm as a student mills college at that time I was the Black Student Union president and I had invited her to speak her eloquent speech focused on the power of women and people of color to change the world as she said if you don't have a seat at the table bring a folding chair she explained why it was important for everyone to get involved in the policy-making process because too often the voices of women and people of color are earned unheard I know that today many of us including myself would not be here we would not have the privilege to serve and this great body had it not been for shirley Chisholm she is truly deserving of our nation's highest honor I would also want to wish mrs. C a very happy belated birthday she would have turned 91 on the twentieth of November thank you and I yield the balance of my time

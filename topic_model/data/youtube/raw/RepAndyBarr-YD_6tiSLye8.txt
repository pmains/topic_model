madam chair secretary ellen congratulations on your confirmation i look forward to working with you and chairman powell thank you for being here last year in response to the pandemic republicans and democrats worked together on multiple bills that were temporary targeted and tied to covid in partnership with the fed and treasury we were able to direct aid where it was needed unfortunately despite last year's bipartisan cooperation the majority ran through a partisan 2 trillion deficit spending bill that was a keynesian wish list for their pre-covet priorities while stimulative policies may look good in the short term i worry about the unintended consequences for mid and long-term growth i fear the toxic cocktail of massive deficit spending when we had two a trillion dollars of funding still unspent from last year increasing risk of inflation higher long-term interest rates an unprecedented accommodative monetary policy that i fear is addicting our economy on easy money the promise of growth destroying tax increases and an avalanche of regulation which includes unrelated climate and esg errands will stifle long-term prosperity i hope we can work together to mitigate future damage by enacting pro-growth market-oriented solutions to position our economy for the long term thank you and i yield back

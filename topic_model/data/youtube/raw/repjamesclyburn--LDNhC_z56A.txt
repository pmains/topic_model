thank you very much mr chairman uh i'm pleased to be here with you today uh and to the ranking member steele uh members of the committee uh thank all of you for having me as a part of this sharing today as many of you know i'm a bit of a student and lover of history and i took seriously george santiano's admonition that those who failed to learn from history are doomed to repeat it with his words in mind i want to take place today this year and place it in sort of a historical context the 20th century was a time of great economic growth but also a time of significant inequities and widespread racial discrimination while every american was impacted by the great depression black americans were especially devastated by 1932 half of black americans were out of work and racial violence and discrimination were on the rise many black americans were initially energized by the presidency of franklin roosevelt he courted black voters head black visitors to the white house and had black advisors unfortunately while the new deal was credited uh was having uh ended the great depression it was not a good deal for black americans racial discrimination employment marginalized black americans at a very critical juncture preventing them from an equitable economic recovery roosevelt's implementation of social security was significant it lifted millions of senior citizens out of poverty but it did not cover farm and domestic workers for over 65 percent of blacks were employed at the end of world war ii millions of american veterans came home and re-entered civilian life president roosevelt had signed into law the gi bill which promised educational benefits job opportunities and housing assistance for these returning veterans it returned over seven dollars in benefits for every one dollar it cost the american taxpayer and ushered in decades of prosperity in post-raw america again was enormously successful economic program discriminated against black americans for example the veterans administration adopted the federal housing administration's discriminatory raid line and policies should not black americans from the full benefits of the gibo by the end of the summer of 1947 only two not two percent only two of the three thousand gi bill home loans were issued to black veterans the new deal and gi bill are just two examples of how successful and widely celebrated economic programs left out and marginalized black communities exacerbating the rough gap we have today that's why congress seth molten and i introduced a gi bill reservation act our bill seeks to provide the descendants of black world war ii veterans some of the gi benefits their families should have enjoyed this would be one step towards writing it wrong and addressing the wealth gap i often invoke alexis de tocqueville who said that the greatness of america lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation but rather in her ability to repair her faults together we can and we must he need to talk to his words through his commitment this committee's work we must work to dismantle barriers that have prevented black americans from achieving the american dream and identify public policy and business practices to encourage and assist every american to reach their economic potential thank you very much for having me today

I came out to Washington to make sure that we held government accountable to ensuring that it was doing the best by the constituents not just in my district and state but across this country and the clean up Congress Act will help address that and put more trust back in government my colleagues have over the last couple of days even promoted a pay increase for Congress people but as I look at this I see a Congress that's dysfunctional and let me tell you in these last five months I've certainly seen many opportunities for us to clean up waste out here and I think until we get the dysfunction under control and our deficit under control and down to zero then Congress people don't deserve a raise we're in this together and we need to make a concerted effort to let everybody know that it's our responsibility to help America be successful and by withholding increases in pay we can send that message

women of America this is your house and this year pro-choice Democratic women are taking it back with unprecedented numbers and historic momentum EMILY's List candidates alone have the power and the numbers to flip key districts and change the balance of power in Washington we can and we must because when Congress falls in line behind a recklessly dangerous president we say not in my house when a decade of progress is erased with the stroke of a pen we say perhaps when we see Republicans strip us of the right to control our own bodies we say not in my house when we speak truth to power we see change we never thought possible when we raised record sums to support Democratic pro-choice women candidates we take that power into our own hands since 2016 the number of women candidates looking to run for House seats has doubles because it is our house when we see our house lead us toward a darker future we see red but if every EMILY's List candidate wins this year we'd see blue emily's list has launched candidates in over sixty US House districts we only need to win 23 seats to flip the house and Emily's list has already endorsed more than enough candidates in Republican districts to do just that like me and me and me women alone have the power to take back the house for the progressive agenda that's just math so please join us volunteer donate run because a woman's place [Music] is in this house

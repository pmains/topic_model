joining me right now for more Florida congressman Matt Gaetz congressman good to see you good to see you Trish and it's important for context to remember that Venezuela went socialist on the promise of redistributed wealth and now before our very eyes were seeing Venezuela transition from the jewel of Latin America to a failed state that's for sure this is that video again if people trying to bathe themselves in sewer water because they've had no water they've had no food they've had no electricity we are getting reports that some of the powers back on in Venezuela but you know look what nine days no power you wonder how a society can continue to survive like that and you're right and that socialism was really the death sentence for Venezuela and its economy coming in almost twenty years ago let me ask you about where we are now though because we're getting word of more sanctions and I have a question for you congressman sanctions are good why why don't we just dump them all on right away why is this done in stages because if we really want Maduro out shouldn't you just be doing absolutely positively everything we can certainly from a financial perspective to make his life a living hell we should we also have to keep in mind that we're seeking defections and so we're sanctioning many of the people that we a whole hope will ultimately turn on Maduro I'm more worried about the foreign influences that we see playing out in Venezuela whether it's the Russians of the Chinese or most notably the Lebanese Hezbollah that is a big part of maderos government I mean Trish his own Minister of Industry and production is someone who ties their ancestry back to to the Lebanese kind of Hezbollah movement and so my concern is that the people around Maduro want war because failed States turn into civil war look at Syria four and a half million people became refugees and it almost brought Europe to their knees and Congress were receiving reports that a Venezuelan civil war will create nine million refugees in Latin America that will erode borders throughout the region and will create environment congressman I mean there are predictions of eight million refugees leaving Venezuela they've had already three million leave you're looking at inflation at ten percent live there if you have any other uh port any means to go anywhere else you're gonna take it well we if we put US troops on the ground that will be what a lot of these foreign actors want because if that happens you could potentially see eruptions of violence and conflict not just in Venezuela in Colombia we're not at foreign troops yet although that we have heard some calls including from Doug's shown recently on this program and general data last night but nobody wants that okay so we need to be doing everything we can from a financial groups point to first write it you know I always say let's let's lose dollars not lives so what more can we do at this moment in time congressman I think we have to engage Turkey right now turkey is benefiting greatly from their relationship with Venezuela because they're pulling gold out of Venezuela and they're using it to support the Turkish lira and so the best way to go after Maduro is not merely to take unilateral actions for sanctions but to try to engage the people that are supposed to be our allies remember Turkey is supposed to be in freaking NATO they're gonna get f-35 aircraft they need to be our ally in putting pressure on Maduro rather than joining up with other Shia elements in the region that are destabilizing and that would potentially benefit from the transnational criminal organizations taking over the failed state of Venezuela mm-hmm you know a lot about Hezbollah and Venezuela but briefly explain that to our viewers because it's just yet again another reason why we need to care about it a country that's so close to home Iran currently has more than a hundred cultural centers throughout Latin America that they use to go and recruit operatives and we are finding circumstances in Venezuela where people are dying but they're not the people we think they are they're actually of Arab descent my fear is that if you have a massive civil war where hundreds of thousands or more people die in Venezuela that becomes an opportunity for our greatest enemies of the world to insert their operatives in the Western Hemisphere and then use the movement pieces throughout the continent are not who they think they're look we're finding circumstances where we think somebody is a dead venezuelan police officer but in fact when you do the DNA our Arabic by nature and they're not the person that they say they are and so we're seeing the you're seeing two diasporas there's a big Venezuelan diaspora and the minute in the middle east and there's a big Syrian Lebanese diaspora in Venezuela that connectivity creates real national security problems Colonel congressman course is getting at the sale of passports because that's been a very big industry you mentioned the former vice president in Venezuela who's been cited as someone connected to that lots of concerns about you know just exactly what the identity of some of these Venezuelans all over the world actually is congressman gates thank you so much

yeah senator manchin thank you ma'am chairman uh secretary it's good to have you here thank you for being here and thank you for your service and next well let me on behalf of the great people of west virginia and my entire state our deepest sympathy to the families and of the children and the teachers who are lost and you value in a horrible tragedy along those lines school safety has been a major topic of laid of what we could have done what we can do and what we should do especially following that tragic shooting in uvalde in march 2018 president trump appointed then secretary devos to lead a federal commission on school safety that commission found that while there is no universal school safety plan that will work for every school across the country the federal government does and can play a role in enhancing school safety so in your budget the department asked for 129 million to address school safety national activities 23 million dollar increase that includes 24.7 million for new gan grants under project prevent and just 2 million for a proposed national clearinghouse on school infrastructure sustainability to help with technical assistance on school facility construction and improvement which we might maybe recommend you might want to evaluate that and look at that if that's enough to do the job issues such as self-locking doors armed security guards active shooter training for teachers and students bulletproof windows and other training have all been discussed as ways to help students improve the student safety so my question would be on the finding of the 2018 school safety report was an active shooter preparedness and mitigation i know the department has undertaken a review that the report and was wondering what the status of that review is or has been or where you are in evaluating that and if it's been implemented yeah you know we thank you for for that senator we uh take the responsibility to support the safety of our schools our students and our staff uh it's the highest priority you know as a father i can tell you there's nothing nothing more important to me than the safety of my children their peers and their teachers when they're in school our administration is reviewing the report the federal commission on school safety report issued by uh former secretary devos and uh as i said before you know in the budget we do ask for funds that can assist uh you mentioned project prevent 25 million dollars there for projects to support community school-based strategies that help prevent community violence there's also uh funding for uh mental health grants 55 million dollars for school-based mental health grants um you know this is going to be something that's going to be ongoing and while the money is important i think it's really important that the department take lead on providing technical assistance do you have any uh you all monitoring that defining how many schools or school districts are participating in this exactly and because this started back in 2013 with the sandy hook shootings we did a bill at that time which is a background check but we had school safety in that background the manchester bill and that school safety basically we found out that we should harden all first floor schools you know with their windows and doors and bulletproof and lockdown and single entry i don't know how much of that was followed through and schools that took advantage of it or not i can definitely have more information provided to your office happy to follow up with good if they're sure we can monitor this a little bit and also you have the tool of holding some of your federal funds right if they're not and it's so important they got to do everything humanly possible it's awful to look back and say we should have done this or could have done that and i would hope you all would look at that seriously about using the using the one tool you have sure which is the money that goes to them if they're not going to use it to protect our children back in in 1997 a young student from fayette county west virginia was killed by his teacher that same teacher had previously taught at a school in pennsylvania but was dismissed following the string of allegations involving involving sexual misconduct with students that teacher somehow received a positive recommendation just to get rid of that teacher from that school district and shove them down to our school district which has some horrific naming for this and we don't want to go into that talking about teachers and all the things they've said but to allow this to happen we have 130 teachers and teachers aides have reportedly been arrested for sex-related crimes so secretary uh senator toomey and i again introduced a bill that's been put into law put into law so why are states that are not complying with the law still receiving any funding yeah we we take the safety as i said earlier the safety of students uh very seriously uh we published a report that was developed in last administration and we're setting up communication with districts we're going to owe it states and we're going to have higher level of accountability and reporting on what is being done how it's holding them accountable for complying with the report how does that how's that teacher's record get transferred so if if in in indiana uh senator braun's school district is basically going to hire a person that was in west virginia and didn't know that that person had been let go in west virginia for violation to their students you know whatever it may have been and they think they're hiring them with a good recommendation yeah uh how does how does that get in the system we're gonna strengthen the system to make sure that states are complying with the recommendations of the report and the expectations of the report and again it just goes back to making sure we're holding states accountable for following the law and my final question i know my times were not the upward upward round broke a program the only thing i would say on that it's been so it's been such a wonderful program helped so many kids in my state of west virginia but it didn't come out until the week before deadline and just to give us enough time to do the job so if you could sir anything you can do on the upward bound program is a tremendous program thank you okay thank you

and we're also examining a bill authored by my colleague representative Brad Schneider that require providers to prescribe opioids for pain to undergo training on pain management these are targeted strategies among many that we must consider it will also be or diversion and we're also considering legislation from congressman Schneider who I notice here that would require mandatory prescriber education as addition of DEA licensure this would provide ensure that all providers who treat patients for pain with opiates have training on the best practices for prescribing opioids early detection of opioid addiction and treatment and management of opioid dependent patients I know that chairman Burgess I don't know if he was being very critical but seemed to suggest that he didn't like the fact that you know that many of us consider doctors are part of the problem I think doctors are part of the problem now that doesn't mean to say that they're intentionally you know trying to over prescribe or or do anything bad but my experience chairman Burgess is that oftentimes doctors feel that they have to you know prescribe things and and and and address pain problems that comes from their education you know that that's sort of their their obligation and so I think a lot of times we do get doctors over prescribing not because they're intentionally trying to do anything abusive or criminal but just because they've learned in medical school that you know they they need to do this they need to you know take care of pain if people are in pain and so I do think that we need more education I think that many of the older doctors are not necessarily aware of the dangers of over prescribing so I don't I'm not trying to be difficult with you but I do think is something that needs to be addressed and that congressman Schneider's bill does address effectively to bring the epidemic under control we have to prevent new cases of the disease primarily gonna be through cautious prescribing and I'm gonna focus a remainder of my statement on HR 2063 a bill to mandate prescriber education although I do not support the bill in its current form I'm strongly in favor of mandatory education for DEA registrants who intend to prescribe more than a three-day supply of opioid analgesics and I commend representative Schneider and his co-sponsors for introducing this legislation the need for this law becomes clear when we look at the cause of our opioid addiction epidemic and the CDC has been perfectly clear about why we're experiencing this epidemic what the CDC has shown us and we've got a slide up here if you look at the slide the green line at the top represents opioid consumption or prescribing in the United States the red line represents deaths involving prescription opioids and the blue line represents addiction involving prescription opioids the CDC has really been saying that as that Green Line went up addiction and overdose deaths went up right along with it as the prescribing increased it led to the epidemic that we've got today the reason that that Green Line began to go up so rapidly the reason the medical community began prescribing so aggressively is because we doctors were responding to a brilliant multifaceted marketing campaign that changed the culture of opioid prescribing in the United States starting in the 90s we began hearing that patients were suffering because we were too stingy with opioids we began hearing that we should stop worrying about addiction that even with long term use the risk of addiction was much less than 1% we began hearing that opioids were safe and effective for conditions like low back pain where the leading experts tell us they are neither safe nor effective we would have been less gullible if we had just heard these messages directly from drug companies but as we heard earlier these messages came to the medical community from every different direction in particular we were hearing these messages from professional societies the American Academy of pain medicine in the American Pain Society in 1997 put out a consensus statement calling for much greater use of opioids and claiming that the risk of addiction had been overblown even that the risk of overdose death had been overblown my greatest concern with HR 2063 is that it relies on these organizations and other professional groups with industry ties to provide the government-mandated prescriber education one of the most important lessons from the crisis is the need for strict firewalls between pharmaceutical company marketing and medical education had marketing not been so cleverly disguised as education we might not have an opioid addiction epidemic today if we learn from our past mistakes we will not rely on the same industry funded professional societies that got us into this mess to provide the education we need to get out of it it may be hard for you to believe that in the midst of our opioid addiction epidemic that doctors are still over prescribing but we are the United States continues to prescribe more opioids than any other country on earth millions of dollars were spent misinforming the American medical community about opioids but very little has been done to correct the record that is why prescriber education must be made mandatory and that is why the content for the education must be developed and administered by individuals and organizations who do not accept payments from pharmaceutical companies thank you thank you dr. cosgrove mr. Logan you recognized for five minutes please you will see what we can do dr. clown me do you think it's do you believe requiring 12 hours of continuing education every three years is a practical requirement for health care practitioners to prescribe opioids I do think that we should be mandating prescriber education I think that we should allow doctors who don't intend to poor than a three-day supply of opioids to opt out if we had an opt-out then you're not making people take training irrelevant to their their practice many doctors would opt out because three days is more than enough you would reduce the number of doctors able to prescribe aggressively and for doctors who do major surgery or treat cancer they would take the training and I think that is the way to go I'd like to point out that for buprenorphine a medicine much safer than drugs like oxycodone we have an eight-hour training requirement and then we limit the number of patients the doctor can treat whereas for the drugs that are causing addiction causing overdose deaths we have no training requirement and we have no caps on the number of patients that they can prescribe to okay thank you hey you're back with Sharon thanks the gentleman gentleman yields back chair recognize the gentlelady from Indiana miss Brooks five minutes mr. chairman mr. doctor Chladni I'm gonna follow up and I assume you heard from my last from the last panel from DEA that I too am working on a bill but slightly different while fewer hours it comes in part from the President's Commission on combating drug addiction the opioid crisis and it was a top recommendation that all prescribers should be required to have some continuing medical education I know you agree with that ours calls for three hours but it's not just about preventing you know preventing the overdose it's also about education on physicians and and other practitioners learning how to detect of their own patient base that they already have not just the prevention of the addiction but also you know what they how they can learn more about just addiction writ large do you believe that state licensing agencies are equipped to and manage education programs of this type because I know you are not in favor of other organizations we're producing that training what about state licensing or agencies possibly in conjunction with working with Beck's best practices from HHS you know it took a while for policy makers on a state and federal level to recognize that this the opioid addiction epidemic was being fueled by very aggressive prescribing that the medical community really needed to to change course and many state legislators have responded by passing laws mandating prescriber education on a on a state level I don't believe those systems are working the way they typically work is that every doctor in the state who has a registration whether or not they ever intend to prescribe an opioid has to take a course on on pain treatment it's usually online the content for these courses is awful in many cases the courses are taught by the same doctors who were teaching the courses that really got us into this mess I don't think that is the way to go I think this should be done on a federal level linked to DEA registration with an opt-out for doctors who don't want to prescribe more than three days let them opt-out but then they're not allowed to prescribe more than three days that would overnight shrink the pool of doctors capable of prescribing aggressively I like that you're thinking about addiction and you know we really do want to teach more than just how to prescribe these medicines we need to also be teaching people who prescribe addictive drugs about addiction and I will probably be submitting for the record because I have a couple other questions for another panelist about other model programs or ideas you might have on the specific types of courses

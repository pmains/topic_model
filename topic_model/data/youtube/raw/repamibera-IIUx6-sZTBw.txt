bill to dr. burr Thank You mr. chairman thank you for the timely hearing here obviously this is an esteemed panel as a physician who has in public health work in Nicaragua in areas that we're finding an endemic of certainly dengue fever when I was down there but in Alex Zika virus this is going to be a challenge certainly the mosquito we're dealing with is not an easy one to eradicate not an easy one to to prevent but yeah the purpose of this hearing is to make sure we get information out and also to spell misinformation and in epidemics like this that is incredibly important because lack of knowledge because the spread of misinformation certainly can create panic and what we want to do is reassure the public that we are taking this outbreak and this epidemic very seriously but we're doing in a responsible way you know I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses on you know how we're approaching this the steps that we need to take I applaud the president for his request of 1.8 billion dollars how we best can utilize those funds but there's a lot that we don't know I mean we've got to come up with more rapid diagnostic tests we've certainly got to you know understand the extent of folks that are infected but also the fact that the vast majority of folks that do get infected you know probably are asymptomatic we also know that there is heightened risk in women of childbearing age and certainly women who are currently pregnant certainly want to hear the testimony of the witnesses with regards to what we can be doing but as a physician myself certainly one thing we can do in endemic areas is liberalizing access to contraception making sure that more women of childbearing age in endemic regions have access to full contraception this isn't about abortion or not abortion this is about you know making sure that those women who are not planning on pregnant have the ability to prevent that pregnancy until we get a better understanding of what we're dealing with and I would make a strong push in endemic countries to dedicate some of those resources to access to those family planning services to access to contraception to access to birth control again incredibly important for our for US citizens that are planning on travel you know obviously if you're a child bearing age you know we would urge you to take the caution if you're pregnant again I would hear what those travel restrictions are but yeah my sense is we would urge those women who are currently pregnant not to travel to endemic areas in addition I'd be curious you know it is my sense that given the the interconnectedness of the globe we've started to see some Zika virus cases pop up in the United States epidemiologically I'd be curious my sense is these are generally folks that have traveled to endemic areas who are now returning I'd also be curious about the epidemiology in terms of where we're seeing the virus it sounds like you know we may potentially be seeing it and semen we may be seeing in saliva and another body bodily fluids so what we can do in terms of recommendations there again you know I I applaud the panel here again looking at this as a healthcare professional I would urge that we don't panic I would urge that we collect the data the information you know if folks are traveling to endemic areas obviously take the usual precautions to prevent mosquito bites if you're a child bearing age you have certainly take those precautions i would urge that we do use some of the resources that the president has requested to make access to full contraception more available for women of childbearing age in these endemic regions that is one simple thing that we can do to prevent you know the congenital abnormalities and so forth and I don't think anyone argues that that isn't good medicine or in in good prevention so again I'm cured you look look forward to the testimony of the witnesses and again thank you

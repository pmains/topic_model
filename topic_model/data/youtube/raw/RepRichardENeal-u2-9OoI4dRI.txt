hello I'm congressman Richard Neal each February we celebrate Black History Month it is a time to recognize and celebrate the extraordinary contributions that the african-american community has made and continues to make on America's rich and diverse culture this year we recognize a particularly important milestone in our nation's history the 50th anniversary of the passing of dr. Martin Luther King jr. America was founded on the self-evident truth that all men and women are created equal and dr. King along with countless civil rights activists of the 1950s and 1960s used the power of free speech and peaceful protest to change the course of history I am proud to serve in Congress with one of dr. King's closest friends and a true hero of the civil rights movement representative John Lewis of Atlanta Georgia because of the remarkable leadership of people like dr. King and John Lewis two of the most important pieces of legislation were passed in Congress and signed into law the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act were the crowning achievements of the civil rights movement it culminated a long and painful struggle to finally and successfully confront the injustice of segregation and discrimination in our society with their passage people in the American family were no longer judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character and this landmark legislation helped start a process of closure to a long and difficult chapter in our nation's history in the five decades since his untimely death the words and legacy of dr. King continued to inspire subsequent generations of young Americans to become engaged in the democratic process as he famously said the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy the strides this nation has made in the last 50 years are great but there is still much work to be done as we celebrate Black History Month let us remember the work of dr. King and his dream of a more perfect union

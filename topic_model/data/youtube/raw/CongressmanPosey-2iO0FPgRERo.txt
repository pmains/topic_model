the gentleman from Florida mr. Posey is recognized for five minutes yeah Thank You chairman our topic today illustrates one of the great paradoxes of regulation on the one hand governments have sought to regulate prices to protect consumers only to find out that doing that restricts the supply of the good or service and actually hurts those they seek to protect and you know in an everyday perspective I mean a lot of consumers would jump for joy if Congress passed a law that said you couldn't charge over $1 a gallon for gasoline a lot of people be real excited so you really did the right thing but we know what would happen don't we you would have zero gasoline and so you know is it better to pay more than $1 for a gallon of gasoline or not have any gasoline in that regard I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a 1970 Newsweek article by the late Milton Friedman entitled defense of Ussuri there are two more items that I had without objection Thank You chairman there are two more items I'd like to put in the record the first is Ralph's new Gia's classic paper that appeared in a Harvard Business Review in 1930 that showed how half percentage reductions and maximum interest rates across three states was correlated with funding for small loan needs of low-income people and the unfortunate growth in bootleg lenders without objection thank you chairman and finally a 1975 paper from the Florida State University Law Review that details the history a small loan regulation in Florida this paper details the ways the market innovations innovators got around rate ceilings and the articles will help remind us at regulating small dollar loans have a wide range of unintended consequences including denying many low-income people the loans that they need these papers also underscore another important aspect of our hearing and that's regulatory arbitrage interest rate caps in one or more states make incentives for market lenders to innovate to make loans to residents of those states who need them they have done this in partnership with banks in other states mr. Knight what we're all do small dollar lenders or a loans play in our economy do they provide essential financial services so small dollar credit can provide essential financial services for borrowers there's definitely evidence I should say that for small-dollar credit particularly say storefront payday the evidence is mixed as to whether or not access is a good thing or a bad thing but it's pretty clear that or at least some borrowers it can be absolutely essential okay I believe that the regulation of interest rates as I mentioned is the real paradox and some states seek to protect consumers and they make money unavailable to them unfortunately this two-edged sword is difficult to balance sometimes and so you know which aspects you believe is more important protecting from high interest rates or protecting from credit scarcity I believe that protecting from credit scarcity is frequently more important I believe that in a functioning competitive and well-regulated market I mean there is definitely a role for regulation to play consumers should be able to access credit and that they will be able to address their credit needs because frequently they're accessing credit to avoid a greater harm there's always the option to not take a loan but if you're taking a loan to avoid a greater harm that loan should be available to you the CFPB has delayed the ability to repay or mandatory underwriting provisions until November CFPB originally proposed force in the entire ruling can you evaluate general writing provisions in terms of his benefits cost and impact on consumer credit availability sir I'm afraid I cannot do that I have not done a sufficient study of that to have an info opinion okay in fairness lady on the fern from California you enter swine I'm sorry can you repeat the question that you'd like me to respond to you it was talking about the delay of the cfpb rule that they had the ability to pay rule so my comments on we would like to see that in California and that has actually been a challenge to us and part not full but part of the reason we also stepped up to pass our own rate cap of law okay thank you very much I'm extreme I see my time is expired gentleman yields

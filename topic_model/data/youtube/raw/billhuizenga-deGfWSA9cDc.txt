for probably the better part of that five minutes so lacking logic or evidence today's macroeconomic Oracle's endorse unsustainable deficits and unconventional monetary policies the Oracles say the economy would be booming except for fiscal austerity however as the debt clock in this hearing room clearly shows that it is often up not and unfortunately right now but as it often is displaying fiscal policy is anything but austere denying that their prescriptions created a heavy drag on our economy the Oracles point to ever-changing headwinds for example they tell us that an aging population is causing labor force participation to plum bottoms last seen in the 1970s their hypothesis is short on facts however for example median age in the 1970s is a decade lower than today's so if aging is a problematic then the Oracles would predict strong labor participation in the 1970s a even though it is the same disappointing level as today the 1970s is also similar to the 2010s on another important dimension separated by four decades they both suffered from distortionary economic and monetary policies refusing to let facts get in the way of fantasy the Oracles tell us that the American households would even be worse off except for these unsustainable deficits and unconventional monetary policies the evidence well we're doing better than the likes of Japan or the European Union that story might fly in the faculty lounge but it certainly doesn't around the dinner table the star pupil in the class of Central Bank's gone wild has nothing to brag about the American Dream is at a risk pre-recession productivity meant that living standards could double every generation under today's opaque and distortionary monetary policies however productivity has been cut in half the Oracles call this the new normal well I believe they're wrong this is neither normal nor acceptable not too long ago our children could reliably look forward to the doubling of their living standards under today's monetary and economic policies a doubling of living standard might instead wait for our children's children with logic and evidence having left their side perhaps the Oracle should embrace a strategy from Seinfeld's George Costanza mr. chairman I'm not sure we've ever quoted George Costanza in this committee but here we go if every instinct you have is wrong then the opposite would have to be right the Oracles tell us that without their seat-of-the-pants response to the Great Recession our economy would be even further below potential almost eight years post recession the opposite would have had a hard time doing worse today's macroeconomics aim policies at highly educated variables that have little if anything to do with what drives our economy their answer for economic fluctuations is to further distort spending on consumption investment or government but just as businesses cannot hide mismanagement for long behind the income statement manipulations governments cannot mask malaise by diverting money into politically favored national income accounts this pretense of knowledge has grown from a macroeconomic orthodoxy where repeated failures of unconventional monetary and economic policies count as evidence that we didn't do enough Economic Opportunity reliably increases when monetary policy adheres to its vital duty that is facilitating commerce whatever wherever it shows promise throughout our current economic malaise monetary policy has not only ignored this duty it continues to ignore the consequence the consequences of ignoring this duty annually since 2007 the Fed's monetary policy committee predicted that its principal free decisions would trigger a more resilient economy each year reality fell further from prediction and according to the feds own researchers the FOMC quote did not anticipate the Great Recession underestimated the severity of the downturn and consistently over predicted the speed of the recovery a decade of economics free monetary policy is not working because it cannot work returning to a robust economy requires a more firmly grounded and transparent policy that transition cannot happen until the Fed shrinks its balance sheet brings interest rate and credit risks out of the bureaucratic shadows in the same vein policy distortions will remain elevated until the Fed also returns to a monetary policy that does not only that does not only what it can produce an efficient exchange medium so that goods and services which include labour can easily find their most promising opportunities the chair now recognizes the ranking member for the of the subcommittee the gentlelady from Wisconsin is born for

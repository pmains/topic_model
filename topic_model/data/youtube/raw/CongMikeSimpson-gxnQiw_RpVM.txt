on the gentleman from idaho is recognized i thank speaker and i thank the gentleman from washington for entertaining this this motion to instruct i said earlier that we had authorizing committees to do this and some have suggested maybe they don't do their job and the appropriations committee has to do it for i don't think that's right but i will tell you that in the only comprehensive climate change bill that's passed the house the waxman markey bill it exempted all animal agricultural sources from greenhouse gas emissions reporting so we have two bills now that have passed the house and the house has stated they do not want to have to report animal emissions to the epa waxman markey and the interior appropriations bill that passed now remember this legislation or this amendment by mr latham was not in the original interior bill as it came before the appropriations committee it was added as an amendment we affirmatively said we do not want the epa to implement this rule on greenhouse gas emissions from animals we affirmatively said it it was not an oversight that's what the committee said when it came to the full house no one offered an amendment to remove that language i think that we ought to insist on the house language that is in this bill now i'm puzzled a little bit when the chairman says we'll do our best and then stands up and defends the rule what is our best i don't know where we're headed with this now let me tell you how this process works just a little bit pre-conferencing goes on between the house and the senate generally between the staffs they can they talk with the with the the members of congress and so forth but the pre-conferencing goes on apparently the senate didn't like the latham amendment and we caved and we said no we'll we'll drop the latham amendment i think we need to insist on the lathan amendment it's been the only expression by either body of the direction we ought to go that we're opposed to this mandatory reporting by the epa that's going to cost as i think the gentleman from iowa said 115 million dollars a year remember we just gave the dairy industry 350 million dollars because the hardships they're currently suffering and now we're going to impose this kind of cost on them we need to go to conference and when we say we're going to do the best we can if when we go to conference if the pre-conference conference report does not have the latham language in it that means we can offer amendment to put it in the in the language in the appropriation bill but if the senate doesn't have the votes to pass it there then it's dropped and it's out if it goes to conference with the language in they have to get an amendment both past the house and the senate to drop it so it's to our advantage and to the will of this house that it have the language in the pre-conference report before we go to conference and apparently we've dropped it so when the chairman says we'll do the best we can i don't know exactly what that means i'd be happy to yield 99.9 of latham that's pretty good and now i'm really confused i'm really puzzled i'm not i don't understand what the gentleman's saying i i i we all agree that for these small farmers this makes no sense the only people that are going to be under this rule are that are the people who are admitting the equivalent of 58 000 barrels of of oil in these emissions these are the biggest farmers in the country they can afford to do this so this is a compromise and uh and and so we the spirit of latham has been adopted but we we regulate the small number of people 90 i think it's less than around 90 in the country who have these very large emissions i think it makes sense i think it's a decent compromise reclaiming reclaiming my time uh i would yield to the gentleman from iowa i i thank the gentleman i don't know how you can say you got 99 percent when you the amendment is eliminated the fact of the matter is that we're going to be spending millions of dollars whether you're large producers or small producers to figure out who qualifies under this that that's one of the major problems here is that nobody knows for sure who it is and who it is you're going to have to spend as a small producer large producer whatever whole bunch of money to figure out whether or not you actually qualify and the fact of the matter is any of these costs are going to be passed down to the consumers now i know maybe another 30 40 bucks a week out of a grocery bill isn't much for a lot of folks around here but i tell you what there's folks hurting at home that that's a lot of money and the idea that somehow this isn't going to affect the price of food that isn't going to affect the cost of agriculture and to do nothing just have no improvement as far as the environment no improvement as far as waste management no as far as air emissions it will do nothing except add costs to the end consumer and i'm sorry but you know my producers out there know what this is going to cost them each and every one of them because they're going to have to go through a whole process to figure out what they can do and cannot do it's going to add cost and we're going to end up with the families today paying the bill at the grocery store because of onerous regulations exactly like this reclaiming my time and i will point out once again this is the appropriations committee the authorizing committee specifically exempts all animal agricultural source from greenhouse gas emission reporting and yet we're going to report or we got 100 percent of the legislation and the requirement that the epa can't can't oversee the emissions from the ships on the great lakes we need to stand up strong and we need to stand up for what the house voted for not once but twice what the committee voted for and we need to stand up in the conference committee with the senate and i encourage the chairman to do just that and i encourage my colleagues to vote for this motion to instruct and i yield back the balance my time gentleman from idaho yields back the balance of his time the gentleman from washington is right i yield back the balance of my time

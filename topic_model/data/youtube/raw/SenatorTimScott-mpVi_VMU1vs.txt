hey y'all senator tim scott here i wish i could be with you in person but it's great to talk with you all virtually i want to start by saying a huge thank you to all the teachers watching this is national teacher appreciation week but know that you are appreciated every single week of every single year your work is so important because it can literally change and shape the lives of students i remember back in high school when i was struggling i was living in poverty disillusioned and frankly not doing very well in life as a freshman i almost flunked out but i had two amazing teachers that changed my life i had several amazing teachers by the way but i could only talk about two right now mrs lynch was my english teacher i actually failed her class i thought she was tough as nails but what she was really trying to do is teach me to take pride in my work and because of her i'm actually a better student even today many decades later the other was mrs greenberg who was uh i had a great gregarious personality a lovely person and she literally encouraged and loved me in a way that was unconditional i passed her class by the way that was algebra it is because of teachers like those two that i sit here today as united states senator and to all the students watching i hope my story will inspire you to never give up never surrender and always appreciate your teachers they are making a difference no matter what circumstances you find yourself in you can achieve great things if you continue to work hard and always believe once again thank you to all the teachers i hope you have an amazing week god bless you and have a great day

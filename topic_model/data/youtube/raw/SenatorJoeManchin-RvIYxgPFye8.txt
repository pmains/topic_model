thank you and let me again thank the family for allowing me to be part of what is life for so many years and being part of yours too um you know sometimes we start talking about whether your voice trembles a little bit and you you start thinking all the motions kind of build up and i know tracy we were standing there and i know how that you know and caisson song and all that comes by and it really touches your heart but you know today i think would he be very pleased with all of us being as strong as we have been because one of us won't let him down we're scared we we mess up what he's coming back governor but there's so many people here to honor woody and all of you showed up and all of uh the military god bless each and every one of you for your service what you continue to do for our country it's good to be with just uh with governor justice and first lady kathy uh my uh my good friend and my colleague senator capito her husband charlie it's always good working with them we work very close together congressman mckinley and mary's here i saw back there i didn't get a chance to say hi but i saw him earlier dave it's always good to be with you and congresswoman woman miller i think is here too i'm i think she's been here and there's there she is uh let me just say thank you to all of them the marine corps uh commandant general berger uh is here uh general it's always good to be with you and uh sergeant major black and all of you did such a great job we're here to respect woody and uh as the governor said uh uh he wants us to celebrate he really does he doesn't want us to mourn uh woody was he's tough up to the last minute as you know the last living medal of honor recipient from world war ii think about that the last living of the greatest generation the world has ever known the country has ever had i can tell you that it's been 77 years since woody quieted those enemy machine guns on the sands of iwo jima and he is now sadly gone but the ideals that he lived by are not love is not uh has not love of his family his friends and his faith and service the country above all else uh woody lived every day he lived every day as if it were going to give a second chance and he always thought that second chance was not to be wasted if you ever talk to him but one of my favorite quotes by woody was this he cited when his great-grandson cedar is here and where's cedar sandy said him right here when cedar graduated from marine boot camp your grandfather said this he was asked what it meant to be a marine he said by taking that oath you can take my life but you cannot take my country or my freedom if you ever heard him talk that's all it was that was woody williams in a nutshell um i'm going to miss woody uh as much as this family misses him as much as all of you missed him i missed the phone calls i missed the directions i was given how i was supposed to vote and when i didn't how i made a mistake i'm going to miss all of that he's always come into great ideas and one time we were talking and he said joe he says gold star family says do you understand what the gold star families what they go through and how much how much challenge they have and you know we all mourn and honor the sacrifice that was made from their family but they're left to carry on losing a dear member of their families you can't replace he said we've got to support them and do things and i said well i was governor at the time governor justice and i said well we'll do whatever you think we can do and then i always like to ride a motorcycle so i said maybe we'll do a motorcycle i can always get motorcycle that come out all the time and i watch when they rode in it was very special but anyway he said fine let's do it so we did a gold star family run and we've been doing that for the last six years now mind you we ride a little bit hard at times but if you think i ride hard you ought to rob with a wood in that slingshot i mean he was held on wheels would he come screeching in boy i tell you you couldn't go too fast for woody but we did a lot of good raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and been supporting the gold stars and i want you to know we'll continue to do that that is not going to be stopping because i'm afraid woody would come after me in a heartbeat anyway some of the funds went to the monuments as you saw the beautiful monument here was done so well i uh i i keep thinking about all the things that we did do and work together and you you really realize the impact he had he got a ship named after him and i was out there when he uh when they christened the ship i was back here when they commissioned the ship and what i didn't realize was this we knew woody was our hero we all knew that and he's a special person all of our lives i did not know that he was a special person in the entire marine corps and what they've talked about general that you know when you talk about heroism you the definition is woody williams and how he lived his life but not just basically when he was in the service and you talked to woody about you know the sacrifices and everybody says this man single-handedly he says stop it right there there's no such thing as single-handedly especially in the marine corps he says the people that should be getting this medal were the two corpsmen that were the riflemen covering me that got killed while i was doing my job he always i mean just he never he just would stop you right now heartbeat not let you go any further about that um but the greatest was this sunday he allowed me and mara he wanted us to come and we got to go visit him and thank you all so much for allowing that to happen the family so we got there at 10 o'clock i said we can't be late more he won't let us in and sure enough we got there on time so we go in and he was setting up oh he didn't know this but the day before i was talking to dennis mcdonald the secretary of the veterans administration i said dennis i said i'm going to i get a chance to go visit woody tomorrow and i know he'd love to talk to you and he said well man it'd be my honor to talk to him he says can i do that and i said well let's see how it goes so i went to the hospital and i got in there and i said woody there's somebody wants to talk to you and he said well put him on the line i was okay so we got dennis on the line and what he was so tickled and he was pickled for about two or three minutes they told dennis exactly what he wanted to do he says now secretary he said let me tell you about these cemeteries up here he says we have these veteran cemeteries and we have these we have these in these shelters and he said let me tell you it doesn't always the sun doesn't always shine in west virginia and other places of the country we need those shelters to be enclosed and i can see denzel yes sir yeah okay yeah when we passed a bill shelley and i worked on this bill we passed this bill we have three pilots three pilot projects now you can't ethics violation to say okay we want this for one of ours we're doing this bill for us you can't do that but we made it very clear and i think woody made it very clever ones better be done one of the three better be here i can tell you that and i told dennis and no no no too many words i said dennis you don't have many choices on one two you pick two or you want but not one so what he was doing that the fisher house ken fisher the fisher house we work with them woody was so involved in that and that's one of the most beautiful houses i think you all got a chance to it's just gorgeous and that was all because woody wanted families to have someone to visit their loved ones somewhere to go um i didn't realize the magnitude as i said before of woody's of woody's reach but my god it was it was long and it was far uh the thing that reminds me most about woody and i think about how do you honor a person that's been honored and and everything it's it's basically uh and how do you how do you recognize the greatest generation the greatest generation was recognized because they never blamed anybody else they took total responsibility for their life and held themselves accountable at a higher standard we were raised in the same part of the state of west virginia about 10 miles apart from quiet down farmington so i know the area very well and uh woody would always be able to bring everything down to a level that we could total grab and hold on to we're saying that the pledge of allegiance and you you ever notice we have one nation we always for some reason we used to pause one nation under god what he says don't pause you can't pause there's no break there it's one nation under god and he was adamant about that and we and i was very very careful when i was saying it to make sure but one of his uh one of his last wishes that he wanted for the for the for those who served in the greatest generation and the medal of honor winners there was over 470 of them in world war ii his uh his this one of his last wishes was joe that whoever whoever that may be not me it's not because of me or anybody else but whoever that last person to honor the greatest generation in world war ii should lay in state the united states capital now that's not an easy feat well since last sunday shelly and i've been on the phone probably on and off all week trying to work through the rigmarole if you would there's a lot going on there and there's a lot of control nancy pelosi has control of the of the house she's the majority leader so basically they have that the house has control of the rotunda but with that they have the four corners which would be your majority and minority leaders in both so in the senate it would be chuck schumer and mitch mcconnell in the house would be kevin mccarthy of course nancy pelosi well everyone's around the world i mean when we on break like this they're everywhere so i'm trying to find him i said shelly have you found a mitch she said i'm still looking too so we're trucking tracking people down trying to talk to them and i finally found nancy in in europe yesterday we had a nice long conversation and this is a really tough tough situation to get to get lying state there's so much requests for that but i want to announce today that i got a phone call 11 this morning that our friend is going to lie in state at the national capital so all of us working together and david and and and carol and all of us working together to to make that happen because it takes everybody it takes the whole congressional delegation to be in sync and on board with that so david i want to thank you and carol i want to thank you and all of you we all worked so hard on this thing to get it happen so that was what that was one of his last wishes and then when i'm leaving the hospital he had one more now i never heard this one before this was a brand new one he said joe you know how hard it is to get here to the va center now governor this was for you too he said now you tell jim i said i will he says do you know how hard it is to get here you have to wind around he says we need a new exit off of i-64 now i'm thinking i've got to tell governor i said governor 20 30 million we can make this happen i'm sure but that was his last one i says well we got to we got he's a lion state which is unbelievable for for our nation but the greatest generation of all times and we'll announce the date i think we're going to be the second week of july we're not sure the date as soon as the family gets this worked out and we all coordinate this then we'll let the public know how this is going to go so my friend we did the best we could i hope you're not upset with us and we're going to work on that interchange i'm pretty sure we're gonna get the the shelter covered we'll get the sides on the shelter and and uh uh and with the governor sitting here i'm sure put him on the spot we'll probably get that interchange sometime working together but he never quit giving back so all i can say is the life to work with a life well lived is a life that can share with all of us and he shared every minute of his life with us there was never a time that he did not want to make sure that you understood the greatest nation on earth is right here and he was privileged and god did bless us and he blessed us all to have this great nation the freedom and peace that we have and he just did his job so my good dear friend job well done god bless

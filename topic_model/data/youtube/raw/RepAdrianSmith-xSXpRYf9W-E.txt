mr. Chairman I rise in support of this amendment which would direct the Comptroller General to study the current and future availability of pilots in the aviation workforce since the implementation of new pilot training requirements for first officers in 2013 two airlines which provided air service to my congressional district have filed for bankruptcy citing the inability to find pilots as a primary factor in their financial struggles even before withdrawing from Nebraska both airlines had poor flight cancellation records which they indicated was caused by this issue severely reducing employment at these airports in rural areas like Nebraska's third District commercial air service provides a vital economic link for communities which are which are several hours drive from the nearest major airport in an effort to further address the concerns of the seven communities with passenger air service in my district and numerous others around the country this amendment merely asks GAO to study what the current state of the aviation workforce is where it is going in the future and what if anything we can do to mitigate pilot shortages we must do more to address these community's concerns and this study will provide valuable information as we seek to address this problem beyond the direct economic impact on these communities from the loss of these flights these cancellations have also caused overall employment at airports as such as Kearney North Platte and Scottsbluff Nebraska and other airports in a number of other states to fall below the minimum 10,000 required to qualify for full airport improvement program funding I would like to thank the Chairman and ranking member for moving my other amendment in block to provide regulatory relief to the airport's by treating them consistent with how they've been treated previously again I urge support of this amendment we are currently debating which will direct Gao to study our current and future aviation workforce needs and I reserve the balance of my time

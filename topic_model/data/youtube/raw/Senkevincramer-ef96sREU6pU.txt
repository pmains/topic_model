more than 300 acres of north dakota farmland could soon be home to a massive corn mill owned by the chinese company foofang and fufeng plans to invest 700 million dollars to open this mill but the community there is wary and so is our military because state and local officials say this company the chinese company has ties to the chinese communist party and the farmland in question is just down the road from a sensitive military base joining us now to discuss is north dakota senator kevin kramer senator thanks for being with us thank you thanks for the opportunity so senator explain to us what's going on and what you're is trying to be done in order to prevent um the purchase of this land if anything sure so the land purchase i think has already taken place what's at stake of course is that uh fufang as you pointed out a who's who's leader who's chairman is a very active member of the chinese communist party in fact they once uh labeled this person as a model laborer that company wants to build this corn milling facility 12 miles from the grand forks air force base so there's two there really a couple of things if not more here the first one is that china has increasingly purchased up you know food supply chains in the united states i mean they already have a significant amount of the meat processing market in the united states now they've been buying up farm land as well as um investing in in a value-added agricultural you know supply chain um companies and this is this is significant because of course as we saw throughout the pandemic china has a lock on a lot of supply chains i mean they they own 75 percent of solar panels you know for example that goes into a solar panel which relates right to the story you just you just had on on the heat wave in california and where you're going to get your electricity obviously pharmaceuticals the protective personal protective equipment but certainly food as well so there's that but the proximity to the grand forks air force base i think is the issue that has most people concerned because the grand forks air force base is a uh an isr base it's a reconnaissance wing what that means is they fly unmanned aerial vehicles around the world um who you know they rely on a lot of data from space to the aircraft to the earth up and down we just recently uh broke the uh cut the ribbon on a space development agency ground station that would be a station that would be operating low orbiting satellites there's a new mission coming to the ground force air force base in the middle of this decade that would be next generation isr so there's a lot of concern about chinese investment so close to such a sensitive base a couple questions one how are your constituents responding to what's going on here and number two is there any uh interest in members of the senate or congress to compel the bite administration to do something about this including maybe writing legislation that would forbid this kind of thing because you'd have to be naive not to think they're up to something well so you that last point is the first point right you have to be naive not to believe they're up to something and we've seen a lot of that in recent years the china of 10 years ago or 15 years ago or 20 years ago is very different than the china of today second of all we know how good they are at spine we know how good they are at collecting data in both passive and aggressive ways and uh and we know how often they do it with regard to constituents constituents are very concerned uh they've sounded the alarm in the community of grant forks they've signed petitions and yet local leaders have been taking a much more slow process if you will of due process on this investment opportunity but right now you ask could the biden administration be compelled to stop this well they actually can through a process called cyphus that's um that's for a council that looks at foreign investment in the united states cfius and that council is led by the secretary of the treasury and includes all of our agencies such as agriculture commerce and then of course the uh the both the security and the intelligence agencies and so they're taking a good look at it right now and they will make some determination i would think within within days um that determination will be shared with the company and of course with members of congress that seek some insight my sense of it you guys is that this this is not going to happen i firmly believe that before this is done this investment this transaction will be stopped and unwound but okay the local leaders want to see the process play though all right senator kevin cramer thanks for being with us we're going to have to leave it there thank you appreciate it thank you

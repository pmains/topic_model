i'm speaking on rising strong support of this century resolution today's actions is necessary due to representative golizard's shocking depiction of a murder of a colleague and a violent attack against the president of the united states this incendiary behavior cannot go unaddressed the minority leader's failure to hold his conference member accountable leaves us no choice but to proceed with this action i often refer to the hall of this house as america's classroom as members of this august body we should conduct ourselves in a way that we must leave want our students to emulate mr gozar's behavior fails our students fails our colleagues and fails our nation and ideals we espouse i urge united support for this resolution and you back the balance of my time

  MR. SHERMAN: I THANK MY  AMENDMENT AND THIS IS  CO-SPONSORED.  RUSSIA INTERFERED IN OUR   ELECTIONS. A FEW INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY CAN'T GET VISAS TO VISIT  THE UNITED STATES AND NEVER SEE  DISNEYLAND.  THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES REAL   SERIOUS SANCTIONS ON THE RUSSIAN STATE BY SAYING NO U.S. PERSON   CAN MAKE ADDITIONAL PURCHASES OF RUSSIAN SOVEREIGN DEBT.  IT PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR  REMOVING THESE SANCTIONS.  IF THE ADMINISTRATION CONCLUDES  THAT RUSSIA CAN GO ONE ELECTION  CYCLE WITHOUT INTERFERING AND IF CONGRESS AGREES WITH THAT  CONCLUSION THEN THESE SANCTIONS  ARE LIFTED.  AND THE AMENDMENT NARROWLY   DEFINES INTERFERENCE IN OUR  ELECTRICS. IT MAKES IT PLAIN IF RUSSIAN   TELEVISION WANTS TO EDITORIALIZE OR PUTIN PUTS OUT A TWEET, THAT  IS FINE. VOTER TABULATION OR VOTER  RECOMMENDATION PROCESSES WHERE   RUSSIA STEALS INFORMATION FOR  THE PURPOSE OF INFLUENCING OUR   ELECTION OR WHERE RUSSIAN  HACKERS USE FALSE FLAG   COMMUNICATIONS PRETENDING TO BE  AMERICAN AMERICAN WHEN THEY ARE  NOT. WE NEED A SERIOUS MECHANISM TO   PUNISH RUSSIA WHAT THEY DID IN   PRIOR ELECTIONS AND DETER THEM.  THIS AMENDMENT DOES THAT.  I'M PLEAS

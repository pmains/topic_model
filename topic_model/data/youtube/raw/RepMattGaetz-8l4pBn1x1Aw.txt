when American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of d-day 1944 they were just young men of eighteen and nineteen hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war they did not know if they would survive the hour they did not know if they would grow old but they knew that America had to prevail their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn why did they do it they did it for America they did it for us everything that has come since our triumph over communism our giant leaps of science and discovery our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before no matter the trials we face no matter the challenges to come we must go forward together we must keep America first in our hearts we must keep freedom alive in our souls and we must always keep faith in America's destiny that one nation under God must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world [Music]

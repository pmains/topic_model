chairman this week legendary journalist Bob Woodward released a book with determing disturbing details about what's going on in the White House White House chief of staff general Kelly reportedly said President Trump has gone off the rails were in crazy town I don't even know why any of us are here in general Kelly denied some of the comments attributed to him and would were to stay anybody's reporting either way the question it raises is a good one why are any of us here why are any of us up here on this dais are we taking our duty to our constituents seriously are we living up to article 1 of the Constitution this is the people's house we are the American people's check on power check on the administration their oversight of the White House are we going to take that job seriously in July I'm sure many of you are as dumbfounded as I was when we saw the President of the United States stand side by side with Russian President Vladimir Putin he undermined the conclusions of American intelligence agencies the agencies made up of hard-working patriotic Americans who sacrificed so much and go out into the most dangerous situations to gather information to keep our country safe the conclusions in their report have been publicly available since January of 2017 president Trump pretended they didn't exist he ignored the American lives that were on the line to create it in fact there are rumors that he considered Putin's request to allow questioning of some of those very US officials but once again we don't know where the truth lies because the only people in the room were Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin I don't know about you that's not what I expected my president I expect strength in the face of Russian aggression I don't expect our president to blame America when Russia invaded its neighbors when it used nerve gas against against agents in Britain when it attacked the foundation of our democracy if history teaches anything it teaches that simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly it means the betrayal of our past the squandering of our freedom that's how President Reagan said it in 1983 that is a statement with principles at its foundation and our dearest American values at its core you won't hear anything like that coming out of this president's mouth we cannot be complicit in donald trump's abandonment of the principles that use that used to guide us and we have a lot of work to do to restore American values that's the answer to the question why are we even here I urge my colleagues who have now returned to this hearing room to oppose the motion to report the resolution adversely so that we can move forward with mr. Boyles resolution and advance this committees responsibility to protect our democracy by pursuing the truth

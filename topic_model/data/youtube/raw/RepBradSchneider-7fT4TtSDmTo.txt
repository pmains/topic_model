around it through the Small Business Administration the SBA and both been a extraordinary resource and getting the word out and how to apply for this program as you may know in early March we passed the first emergency legislation related to Coba 19 this law included significant funding focus on public health resources as many of you know the legislation also included a designation of coronavirus as a disaster under the SBA disaster loan program for which Illinois nonprofits are eligible you can apply now for these loans and these can offer as much as 2 million dollars towards working capital like payroll rent and benefits including an advance of ten thousand dollars within just a couple of days later in March the President signed into law the second emergency legislation related to the virus included within this bill were provisions to provide paid medical leave paid medical and family leave for workers directly affected by koba nineties businesses and fewer than 500 employees would provide this emergency benefit to workers and then would date they would be able to recoup 100% of the cost so a refundable tax credit I have more guidance on this program on our website Snyder don house gov on how you can implement these programs finally two weeks ago on March 27th the House passed and the President signed into law the cares Act a two trillion dollar economic stimulus package this law includes three hundred and fifty billion dollars in direct funds for small small businesses most significantly under the paycheck protection program these are loans that can be 100% forgiven if businesses including nonprofits retain their employees most nonprofit organizations like yours should be eligible for this and other SBA administered programs from stimulus so now before I pass the

art straight llinois our org so those are what we are aware of at this point we'll see if there's other funds we will continue try to keep this information updated our website but that's some general state and local funds let me turn it over now to Brian's aru a forefront and brown we'll leave it to you to discuss the state related resources for nonprofits thanks so much Brian thank you very much my name is Brian drew and I'm the director of public policy and advocacy here at forefront many of you might know us as the forum we changed our name about 550 forefront and the congressman said of this eight wide Association while my job is all policy and MC related we do a large number of things for our membership base including providing key education to our members we connect our nonprofits and our funders we provide all fuels necessary for nonprofits and funders to building lately and we've been on a little a new road we've been that we've been the key resource with state in terms of non nonprofits and funders for NFC and throughout the state of Illinois so we've been very condemning faced the last month and go over some of the key tasks that we've been talking with members of Congress state representatives and we'll go over some of the resources that we have at the state level one of the many things we have been doing at forefront is advocating to our federal and state officials on the impact this pandemic has had nonprofits throughout the state with the congressman's help we have been successful in many key efforts in providing relief especially in the first three packages Washington has put out in terms of code relief and we're currently advocating for more in the fourth package I know I've been getting this question a lot over the last month now so there's some some items here that we're gonna be going over and what we've been advocating for some of the aspects along with our sister organizations throughout the county is about the country I'm sorry is making sure that nonprofits are involved in any sort of relief effort that comes out of the federal government we're also currently advocating for nonprofits with more than 500 employees to be eligible for the forgiveness aspect of the payment protection program alone as you know we have nonprofits such as the YMCA thresholds nonprofits who do direct service social work so we're advocating for that as well we're also fighting for the self-insured nonprofits and I know this has been a big issue we had a big survey out and many many people have brought up this issue with the self-insured nonprofits we're happy with the result we had in the last Kerr's Act which provided the states with money to cover 50% of self-insured nonprofits and we're hoping we're in contact with the state government and we're also in contact with the federal government to make sure and to hope that the other 50% will be covered as well because we know that having them on the hook for a large sum couldn't mean the difference between you know closing their doors when this is all over with so we know that nonprofits we're gonna be advocating for them at the at the state level we're also advocating at the state level to ease the restraints of reporting and monitoring for their state contracts and adding more flexibility by grant makers and that's a huge part of forefront as well we do have rent makers and we are in contact with them with foundations and the private foundations to try to alleviate these stresses of program dollars to try to change that into to change that into general revenue dollars to keep the doors open we have put out a survey a few weeks ago and many of you on the phone call on this webinar probably have answered we had about 1400 responses and many of our asked at the state and federal law of our state and federal leaders have been from these responses so we thank you for adding our input to give me a better understanding of what we should be fighting for both at the state in Springfield and in Washington so if you take a look at our website we are updating it almost twice a day sometimes every few hours we're updating with more information at my forefront at work as you see on the screen here we have links to our webinars how to how tos on the SBA loans all the policy updates coming out of Washington in Springfield all of the different fronts throughout the state are set up and I'll go over them in a second and we also link to our sister organizations who have been who have just given us a very very valuable information our goal for friend is to make this information as streamlined as possible and to help all of our nonprofits throughout the state so you'll see some more updates later this week we just had a big phone call this morning with about a hundred funders both public and private foundations we had our state treasurer Michael farik's on the phone as well to discuss all his office is doing to help small businesses and nonprofits throughout the state we he told us this morning that there will be a fund some sort of relief fund by the state treasurer's office once we get that details on that we'll put that on our website and I'll share with the congressman's office as well and they also have the charitable trust that's on which apply people can apply nonprofits with a million-dollar budget or less can apply up to $25,000 for a grant so the information is extremely valuable on-site and we're doing everything we can to help our nonprofits through through this I'm available by email if anyone has any questions I think break has it posted here and I want to thank the congressman for giving me the time and and this time I just want to go over some of the statewide funds I know the congressman had he mentioned some of these but if you go to our website I think on the next slide I have it there if you click on maybe it's not on this on this part I'm sorry so anyone right under this slide here would you go to the website you'll see our website which is separated we have almost 30 different counties here that have different funds so you have a meter DuPage County and report Fox Valley run Lake County not Warren important odd cities Oak Park in blue county each of these has a fund we also have it separated by who's accepting applications and when so you have the Archdiocese of Chicago the Chicago Community Trust in United Way Community Foundation's all across the state have some of her own funds and you could find that all with links on our website to get exactly what you know in closing I want to thank the congressman first time and thank you for having me on here and like I said if you have any questions he's a sweet job great Brian thank you so much appreciate all you're doing and we can get the links everybody as well let me now turn it over to both Steiner to discuss the SBA resources for nonprofits Thank You congressman for shitty opportunity to be here on both side I am the district director for the Illinois district of the Small Business Administration and I look forward to sharing a little bit about program the primary program that's available for nonprofits right now the paycheck protection program so if we're good next slide be awesome next ayat so SBA in partnership with the Treasury is responsible for delivery of this program which is a two and million dollar forgivable loan for eligible small businesses and nonprofits on the nonprofit side what are called out as eligible are 501 C 3 s and 501 C 19 trans organizations basically the gist of the program is that you you look at your average monthly payroll a 12-month look back and using that average monthly payroll and payroll expense I should clarify permit times a multiple of two point five determines your loan amount you are eligible for in essence the intent is that it gets you through approximately eight weeks of a role given your average they're all this is a loan fully guaranteed by the federal government and it's made through a lender of a private-sector lender so you would go to a lender to apply for this program the kind of metrics for it are to fault one is from a from a funding standpoint once you're the funding that you receive in order to receive 100% forgiveness of the loan at least 75% needs to be used for payroll there are other eligible uses of this loan including rent mortgage interests utilities but the primary focus of the program is on payroll and payroll expenses the second qualifier in addition to seventy-five percent is your full time equivalent headcount levels so looking for you as the borrower to maintain your account we don't have the exact calculations right now and what it looks like you say you know you go ahead count reduces some amount and or them you know you don't fully apply seventy-five percent of the proceeds for payroll or payroll related expenses but that should be forthcoming next slide please next slide so again you can apply through any existing SBA 7a lender or any federally insured depository institution or federally insured credit union and Farm Credit institution that is participating in addition we are rapidly expanding the number of lenders that support the program they have a streamlined participation agreement process where they can get access very quickly to get into the system lenders actually began taking applications April 3rd 2020 the last day you can apply for the PPP as we call it is to 30th 2020 I'm next slide okay so if you are interested you think you're eligible and you want to apply a couple things that you need to do number one I would recommend that you pull down the application from the SBA website you can find that as va.gov ford slash crone virus you'll see that it's basically a two-page application with a lot of details written on the third page if you understand what you need to provide essentially what you're going to be pulling our payroll records for the prior 12 months so that could be either a 12 month look back from now or it could be looking at your 2019 payroll payroll and payroll expenses wanna clarify to you when you look at your payroll expenses it's not just cash compensation is other benefits that you may provide the expenses related to other benefits you may provide to your employees that includes things like healthcare benefits fireman contributions paid sick leave all those sorts of things would be included in the payroll and payroll expenses a full list can be found on the interim final final rule which we also found on our website at the same place as I mentioned you take the average monthly payroll multiply times 2.5 and then that would define your maximum loan amount yes I please so we talked about the approved use of pro see things that they can be used again as payroll costs cost related to continued group healthcare benefits during periods of paid sick leave insurance premiums basically those ancillary benefits that you provide to your employees as well as the cash compensation mortgage interest payments payments utility payments interest payments on any other debt obligations incurred before February 15 so a lot of different uses but what what I would like to make sure you take away from this is that that 75% applies to the payroll costs and payroll related expenses so it's really important to know that's what's gonna determine or your forgiveness so I'd like to kind of walk through the whole process so people understand what happens from A to Z so you if you are interested in applying you pull your payroll records your other payroll expense records together you determine what your monthly costs are you reach out to your bank and you touch base with them and you identify what their process is some some banks have actually created their own portals so you go in an electronic or maybe they take the paper documentation but you're gonna want to find out from your bank that you're going to our lender that you're going to work with you submit your application at which point the bank does their diligence basically verifying that you provided payroll information that supports your application they send that to SBA we approve it at SBA as long as everything's there and appropriate the bank receives the authorization at which point they will make just an initial disbursement or full disbursement depending on what you've agreed to as part of that process seven weeks from that point of disbursement you will likely re-engage with your bank and they'll ask for additional documentation to basically assess the use of funds for that that loan so that's how they're looking at you to provide evidence that you spend at least 75% of the funds on on payroll and payroll expenses from a forgiveness standpoint in addition you know that the overall use of proceeds was appropriate for the the rules of the program assuming you provide that more than 75 percent payroll payroll expenses headcount remains consistent with what you put in your application that documentation will go back to the SBA for to apply for forgiveness once that's approved the US Treasury on your behalf pays off that loan with the bank and you walk away you have no more obligation or that basically that loan is erase if you don't receive a hundred percent forgiveness and any remaining funds or remaining amount of that disbursement would then roll it would basically continue on as a as a loan with a two-year term at 1% from the date of initial disbursement so that's kind of the process in a nutshell there's no collateral requirements there's no no personal guarantee and again I want everybody to be really clear on this this is based on your historical payroll it is not based on a credit analysis or anything like that solely based on payroll history so I'm excited all right so if you are going through this process we always recommend that if you're having difficulties or trying to figure out how to navigate it reach out to a Small Business Development Center score or Women's Business Center they can provide insight into the application application process and help you with that you can find a location sp4 slash local assistance next slide and again the latest and greatest information about SBA programs will be found at sba.gov forward slash coronavirus you can also go to sba.gov ford slash disaster a lot of good information there for the Illinois district office if you want to send us an email you need to fix it and it's the best way to get in touch with us is a Illinois guide do SBA that govt so with that I'll hand it back to you congressman bow thank you that was great thanks so much but it bow am Brian let's now go to questions we've got some questions that people sent with their RSVP so we'll start there but we'll also take questions as they come in the first question is from James from CCDC in Glenview what happens with unemployment claims by employees which are charged back to the nonprofit organization great question under the cares Act there is a 50% federal match for UI claims by nonprofits i des Illinois Department of Employment Security is still working through guidance for nonprofits and we'll send that information out as soon as we have it for Bryan do you have anything yeah pretty much everything that you do so yes the federal government requires the state to pay 50 percent we are working to advocate for the state to up that hopefully and then we're also working with the federal government to seafood company as well great great thing I think we have some callers if you're not Bo or Brian if you're not on mute if I can ask everyone to put their phone their phone or computer on mute we're getting some background noise but thank you for that and the next question is Ken from adelante Center for Entrepreneurship in Waukegan any guidance on how applications will be evaluated for nonprofits it show an inconsistent revenue stream because they rely on grants for funding bo I'm gonna throw this to you but I think it's really a function of right that's right yeah so it's solely a function of your control they're not looking at revenue stream at all it's just based on your historical payroll again there's some other caveats on that other that can be calculated then I refer to the Treasury released FAQ two days ago but generally speaking you're looking at that 12 months of payroll and payroll expense great thank you Mario from Madeline Park and Recreation District as a government agency do we qualify for any resources mário right yeah president in bow may have some other guidance from SBA but within the letter of the law not yet I'm advocating for local governments to get more funding in the next iteration of legislation we've done the three bills in March we're gonna do a looks like an update on the cares Act call it cares 1.1 before getting to cares 2.0 which should come out in the next couple of weeks I would imagine I've written both to Speaker Pelosi as well as governor Pritzker about this issue advocating for local agencies to be able to have access to funding bo do you have anything about SBA resources that would be available to government agencies we do not generally have any any resources now okay Carolyn from Highwood Chamber of Commerce what can local chambers do to assist local businesses with the application process for the various federal and state programs is there service provided to assist businesses with the process in knowing whether they are eligible well first of all the most important thing that Chambers can't and have been doing so thank you for this and something is get the word out about these programs to your members we rely on you to make sure that all businesses are aware of everything that's available and the Chamber's have been really doing an amazing job so again thank you the other piece I'll say is that the Chamber's have the ability to be our eyes and ears you're talking to your members if you hear anything any concerns we should be aware of please let us know as soon as possible Brian or beau anything from your perspective on what chambers can do or of chambers yeah so from the standpoint of eligibility for the program generally speaking that would be something the banks going to go through as they look at their due diligence for the process certainly chambers can get familiar with the eligibility requirements for that all of the eligibility requirements for the PPP program are on our website so definitely encourage people to look at the various eligibility restraints around great the next questions from Stephen online the E's got question for you Brian can you expand on what the state of Illinois has what funding mechanisms they have in place offering $25,000 grants that you mentioned for nonprofit organizations with an operating budget below 1 million dollars yeah so this exists even prior to the pandemic the state treasurer's office has a charitable trust grant up to $25,000 for for nonprofits with a million dollars or less budget they've always had this but they have three different types of but categories so you have to fit in the food programs categories and that talks about food pantries summer feeding programs and then they have the housing category and they have the workforce in economic development if you go to their website Dillon weight treasurer gov they do have those but they are also opening up another sort of grant they haven't given the details yet but once I great thanks Brent Karolina from Waukegan Public Schools asked I believe our get our district will receive a significant amount of funds to provide technology due to remote learning needs does this include providing Wi-Fi for families in need if not are there funds that nonprofits can access to assist with providing Wi-Fi Kelly this is a huge issue we've been talking about it on a number of our Congressional Caucus calls we're seeing this not just in our communities but commuters across the country the cares Act included funding for expanded educational resources for remote learning but we are aware that the access to the Internet is a major problem for many of these families we're looking at providing more resources and trying to press the providers to get internet into various places different localities are taking extraordinary measures such as taking on new school buses that aren't running the routes anymore and trying to set them up as hot spots in neighborhoods but really that this is a much broader issue of closing this digital divide which we hope to make significant progress on but in the meantime we've got to get access to the Internet because that's how these schools are communicate communicate with their students right now so we're very much focused on it Brian are there any state specific resources that would be available to communities for supporting access to the Internet this is something that we've been talking about with our funders and privately the private philanthropy is trying to help with this but I'm also advocating at the state at the federal level to try to close that divide considering a partner Brian but yeah Carol in a week we are pushing that on that Sally online asked can we apply for a economic injury loan if we also apply for the PPP loans my understanding is that you can do that correct Bob yes that's right so the key the key element to consider without any PPP and the idea is this is that you're using the proceeds for different purposes so if he's the PPP is primarily intended towards payroll and you receive an economic entry disaster loan that's you're using as working capital for other stuffs that you need to run your business day-to-day then that is the appropriate instance where you can have access to both programs oh great thank you Richard from the oldest Society of Physicians and Surgeons my understanding is that 501 C 6 nonprofits are not included in the cares Act provisions this is a major problem he did not emphasize that I will emphasize this is a major problem since we depend on dues for our members so I understand that most of them are now paying dues is likely the last thing on their mind yeah Richard I agree the the 501 C 6 organizations were excluded from the cares Act the PPP program they are eligible for tax credit provisions and for economic injury disaster programs we I can tell you we press to have them included in in the first round that the Carrey's Act time came from the Senate that wasn't there we hope to get that addressed I've heard from a significant number of these 501 C 6 groups including chambers of commerce trade associations etc and hopefully pick that up bow is there anything I'm missing with respect to these 501 C 6 organizations you know what you stated is my understanding as well alright and Brian are the resources that forefronts aware of them might be helpful so what you mentioned we have on our website we don't represent the trades or the in the sea sixes but I'm in contact with their lobbyists and I know they're fighting to try to get included in the forth package but if you go to our website the c6 is can go to our website and look at the economic disaster relief program Tom and it does have a lot of information there for them as well all right Bo throw this question you I added another column yesterday as well if someone if a company hi this is from Stan online if a non-profit or company hires someone mid-year so let's say August of 2019 how do you calculate the average payroll if they were only on payroll for five months of the twelve months last year sure so the general payroll calculation again is going to be based on the average 12-month payroll so you would take your aggregate twelve months here old payroll expense added together well recognize that doesn't account for somebody that you know the full costs of that other company in the loan there are some other ways to calculate your average monthly payroll which are in this thank you the treasurer you put put out but it's it's not complicated but there's just different options I'll make sure that the congressman's office has that FAQ and we can call out that specific area so that you can take a look at it and see if there might be a different way to calculate the average monthly payroll that would fit better for your particular business situation great thank you and um I want to make sure the people on the call know you guys are not alone we're working on your behalf but also a lot of folks we have almost 200 people on this call just to give you a sense of the scale the next questions from Georgia from Phoenix Family Health Center in hi wood we are a frontline medical clinic that needs funding to stay open the uninsured and underinsured in Lake County what is our best way to get emergency funding to keep our doors open boss I'll start with you you talk about how these institutions can apply for SBA resources sure so I think the biggest the biggest program that can help because most organizations one of their biggest cost drivers is there a role would be the PPP so in that for the Paycheck protection program I would highly recommend that you contact your current bank and talk to them about applying for that program if they do because you apply through a bank or other lender that's participating in the program if they are not participating in good SBA's website we have a PPP lender finder and you can put in your zip code and give you local entities around you that provide that program as soon as a non-profit you would also be eligible and my understanding is we're so accepting application or we I know we're still accepting application for the economic injury disaster loan program so that is a program you could apply for through the SBA directly you go to our website and the intent is that those proceeds are used for working capital needs so that could be anything from it could include payroll but it could also include other other ongoing utilities other things that you need to pay to keep the lights on and the in the organization moving so you can still apply for that the the one thing I would say is that there are funding levels for the PPP are the greatest so you know encourage you to take advantage of that because that's probably gonna be the biggest bang for your buck but it certainly can apply for the economic injury disaster loan program as well great Thank You Bryan anything you want to add honestly what Moe just said is kind of alright great George I'm gonna have my team reach out to you directly as well there's those other things especially when we get to health care we've been trying to press the administration to open up the ACA exchanges to give more people access so many people are losing their health care if they lose their jobs so we'll reach out directly as well but thank you thank you for the question next questions online question from John is payroll protection available for 501 C 3 S with more than 500 employees again my understanding is it's a 500 limit cap but Bo am I missing anything so actually the for nonprofits there is no size limit on the size of the organization from a personnel standpoint however you would still be limited to the 10 million dollar maximum amount of the loan God okay so is that the the loan cap is the same but for the employee size they don't have great thank you Chris from Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Glenview asks our religious organization is eligible for PPP bones economic injury disaster loans Sally similarly online asked can you clarify which of these opportunities apply for faith-based institutions so Bo do you want to touch on that one yes so generally speaking yes religious organizations are eligible for both the economic injury disaster loan program and the program I would refer you to placed on the SBA website specifically addresses that topic I'd to review further but I can't generally speaking yes great thank you and I'll share that there is a SBA handout attached with frequently asked questions for religious organizations that's attached to the wagon webinar document and we'll send it out following this this webinar the next questions online question from Philip well we need to rehire any are all furloughed workers with PPP loan funds bo can you explain how it works that if company has laid off workers applies for recieves alone what they do with bringing their workers back sure so so the basically when you make application you're going to be providing your your headcount level my understanding is this your average monthly full-time equivalent headcount level so once you receives a loan then the expectation is that you will either maintain your head count or you will rehire those people that maybe you've had to layoff because of the shortfall in very quickly rehire people so if you want to apply for the PPP and be eligible for forgiveness for that loan you will have to do two things your criteria one is that you are using at least 75% of those funds on payroll and/or payroll expenses and number two is that you're maintaining your full-time equivalent headcount and you'll have to provide evidence that you have people on staff during the direct for the duration of the time to when you work with your bank for forgiveness well great thank you and online says not all SBA lenders are ready to process the payroll protection program applications is there concern that funding will be depleted before all banks are ready to process the applications and the one day on subject I know what Congress intended to do and what the spirit and intent was of the law I will say we are very much aware that there were some problems with the rollout last week this is moving very quickly and I think we're working also very quickly to close those gaps but there are also some structural problems and one of which is we allocated 359 billion dollars in the cares Act we would have liked more we fought for more we weren't able to get that negotiations with the administration there is now discussions to increase the three hundred and forty nine billion by 251 billion to write about six hundred billion dollars which is just a a it's a large number it's mind blowing number if so we're working to expand that so again we're telling everyone to apply with some urgency the sooner you get you in get in the sooner you are going to be processed but we're trying to make sure that we do not run out of funds as well both you want to add anything to that I know I think you carted thank you okay Debbie from North Shore YMCA we're especially interested in your thoughts on the second relief bill for small businesses and nonprofits that will treat self-funded nonprofits fairly by increasing the federal unemployment insurance reimbursement for self-funded nonprofits to 100% of costs as currently written section two one zero three of the cares Act will subject nonprofits throughout the country to crippling payments to their state unemployment statistics later this year while other employers were like me we have little or no additional cost from these layoffs Debbie I hear you're saying that the care is acting act at a 50% federal share of this cost for nonprofit lady unemployment claims we're working to a get better guidance and also provide more assistance as as well Brian you mentioned four fronts working to cover the other 50% yeah yeah we're working right now we're currently talking to Senator Durbin and Senator Duckworth to try to put that ass into a bill to get to get the other 50% covered because I've had conversations with the state they can go past the 50% if they chose to were also working state government does he pass great thank you next question from Carolyn or Katherine I'm sorry is there a list of financial organizations that are accepting applications some say they're closed and not taking any more applications Kadim there is a list a couple places one is the Illinois SBA district office website you can get a list of vendors if you guilt if you google Illinois SBA office and click on the first link and from there click the Illinois resource guide it includes a list on pages 29 to 32 it's also on the sba.gov website and go you may have something to add there as well yeah I think the key is to go to SBA's website again at sba.gov 4/4 no virus where you can find a PPP lender portal or letter finder I'm sorry where you can put in your local information and awareness you put your zip code in and it will show you the local lenders that are supporting the program great thanks Sean online asked if we furloughed employees prior to applying for our PPP low and we reinstate them at the time we receive the loan proceeds will we still be eligible for loan forgiveness so it's a timing question at what point do you have to bring back for a lot of employees to still qualify for free I'm sorry Sarah we're gonna go brainer yeah if my understanding is correct either have to hire the employees back or be at the level of which you apply it by June 30th I have that right though I think it's it's not entirely clear in the in the interim final rule the the key is you know from a from a I think the way it says it is to rehire quickly yeah is there something that something that effect so it's not specific I just note that to be offered forgiveness and your bank on that you know there's that 75% threshold and then what I would do is I would touch my bank when I'm going through the lending process and see how they're going to look at what you need to provide from the standpoint of your headcount information that they're going to need to support the forgiveness process great thank you and I'm going to pick up on something Bo you said it's also important the guidelines that are coming from the administration are still interim guidelines these are not final guidelines and you continue to push for more clarity and clearance when I say we pay its everybody it's me it's poets everybody else trying to get that guidance so some of these things are still moving targets but for the most part I think you had the clarity certainly time to apply for the loan applications kyla from bits and bytes cybersecurity education corp in deerfield how can we make up for lost income generally are there options available for nonprofit activities Brian are the best practices for how these organizations can make of us income and access grants during this time yeah so there's two things that we're doing the first one is if you go to our website I believe we have webinars up and we're going to be having webinars on how you can make up for lost income through virtual means through different sorts of summits to do everything a lot more digital the second part of that is that we are working with funders to work on a mechanism where we can make the program dollars that you originally received and to have leniency on those to make them more into general revenue proceeds rather than program dollars so that's something that we're working as well okay and the websites my forefront org yep great Bo how about for the PPP or eid al loans are there restrictions on the use of funds yeah I mean it's the biggest things that you'll find with both the EIA l in the and the PPP is they're not intended to refinance other day acceptor and very limited in very limited circumstances so especially from the IDL rate is for working capital means you can't buy it you can't buy a building those sorts of things from a PPP loan you are limited to a payroll rent mortgage interests utilities are what are called out in the roll alright great thank you embalming I confess I'm not sure the answer in the next question although online asked in the PPP loans be applied to salaries that are covered in part by state grants I do not know the answer to that question when you have kind of be almost might be looking at a kind of a duplication all right so Brian oughtta let me suggest this again it's it's on the screen our website or email address our phone drop is know and we'll try to get an answer to that but again there there's so many different scenarios that we will try to answer that Katherine asks what response do you have to the reports that the large banks are prioritizing their applications with largest customers first smallest customers last Katherine I've heard this from a number of places our goal is and we put in in guardrails and safety mechanisms to have the oversight to hold the SBA accountable for administering the program transparently and fairly and so I'll be focusing on this there is the issue of banks have said that they're processing their clients first before taking on new clients or new customers and we're working on on addressing that as well but the most important thing is we have that transparency hopefully we can avoid situations like what we're talking about Bo do you have thoughts on this you want to add no I mean yeah just I think you mentioned it congressman everybody's this is a massive program that's being implemented very quickly so the banks along with SBA we're all working very hard to make sure that we have capacity that we can serve as many business owners as possible so I can attest that you know the many lenders that I speak with are trying to do as much as they can to help the small business community so stay persistent I will be my number one recommendation Press Inc you identify a lender whether your existing lender or some other lender because things are changing constantly we are introducing additional lenders to the network as 14 P P P so don't definitely don't give up keep persisting in your efforts to apply for this this program absolutely and I also add that as Treasury has asked for this additional funding 250 billion dollars one of the things that we have pushed for in the house and I'll continue to advocate for is more of the additional money getting to our community banks or local banks tallip as well Andrea from the fraternity and sororities yr 501 C 7 organizations not yet included in the cares act for the Paycheck protection program do you anticipate these nonprofits being added for eligibility I think that I don't have a short answer Andrea's is why not I think the second half of the question though do we anticipate our goal is trying to push this out as far and wide as we get it and you know that the answer may be it wasn't included because it was just missed I don't think there was anything intentional I don't know if there was anything intentional but our goal is to fix the things we missed either with cares to 1.1 this update additional funds or in Kerr's 2.0 the next bill so anything else or Brian anything else on 501 C 7 s to be honest no we don't deal with too many of them and I don't know why they weren't included online we know if the idea is a 501 C 3 organizations we applied over 10 days ago bo do you have a answer on that one first application yes so 501 C 3 s are eligible for the IDL my understanding is that those applications are being processed and from the standpoint of the Eid of advance those dispersed offenses should start coming within days okay great Andrea you know for this question as well the goal was to get them out quickly I just think the system is being so overwhelmed that that quickly takes on different meanings for as you get through the process denied from the ahmadiyya muslim community in zion asks how can faith-based communities be actively involved in supporting our communities during this academic thanks for the questions it's a really important question I consistently say and I've had calls with different nonprofits this call it is our our nonprofits and the various organizations like yours that is going to be critical and holding together that the fabric of our communities so some of the things that people can do is looking out for their neighbors taking care of people who live alone or shut-in looking for people who are are are struggling individuals who are supporting our food banks volunteering for meals and wheels donating blood are again part of the story of the heroes of this crisis and I know that the food banks are staying open we're trying to get more funding for them the other thing I'll say to every organization now when I imagine this is going to carry on long past the emergency phase of this crisis is the promotion of social distancing and you know simple things like washing your hands for 20 seconds just encouraging all your members to follow your CDC recommendations Brian thoughts on how faith-based communities can help in supporting communities I think that like you said congressman the best way is social distancing I think pretty soon hopefully we'll see the curve flatten over the next few weeks in Illinois and the best way to do that is social distancing so that's one of the best ways we can do it all right great we're getting to the ends of the hour I think two more questions Clawd online says I'm a personal trainer and president my business and the only worker do I meet the criteria to be available for these programs the simple and short answer is yes sole proprietors independent contractors qualified self-employed you can apply for PPP either as a sole proprietor sole proprietorship or as an independent contractor lenders are are able to start accepting applications from such entities beginning tomorrow if you visit sba.gov slash PPP you'll see the list of those lenders again well anything else on when you're the only worker in your business no no congressman you nail that okay thank you last question is from Matthew from Grace Lutheran in Libertyville all of our employees are not covered understanding unemployment insurance as we do not pay in will clergy and lay staff still be covered in case of layoffs or SBA loans available for other purposes than paycheck protection what are the terms bo how does this replace this apply to clergy and lay staff of the church like Grace Lutheran things are organized a religious institution is eligible apply for a PPP for their employees but again I don't know how things are structured within that framework yeah and I was he was asking an employment shirt so it's not an SBA issue oh yeah so and that was my mistake so I think from unemployment insurance Matt I'm sorry I don't have a direct answer we'll get back to you on that how it applies for clergy on that and with that let me just say thank you to everybody for

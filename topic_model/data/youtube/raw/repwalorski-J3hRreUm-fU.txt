good afternoon i'm congresswoman jackie rolorski and i am so excited to welcome you to medicare 101. you're joining this virtual session because you want to learn more about enrolling in medicare i don't need to tell you how important this program is medicare is a sacred commitment we've made to our nation seniors i know firsthand how vital medicare is because my mom lives with us and relies on it that's why i've introduced a bipartisan bill to simplify the overly complex medicare enrollment process and improve education and outreach the beneficiary enrollment notification eligibility simplification act would protect seniors from unnecessary late enrollment penalties gaps in coverage and unexpected health care bills i hope congress passes these bipartisan reforms soon i also believe that part of keeping our promise is providing hoosiers like you the information and assistance that you need free to secure benefits you deserve as we approach this year's open enrollment which begins october 15th and runs through december 7th it's important that you understand the basics of the medicare program and have a chance to ask questions and get answers from experts all free i am so glad you're here today that's why we have a case worker from my staff jan faker from our rochester office as well as a medicare specialist from indiana state health insurance assistance program they're here to share their knowledge answer your questions and help you understand what you need to know about medicare my office is always ready to assist any way we can so don't hesitate to reach out i'm grateful for the opportunity to serve you and i hope to see you out there in our community soon now i'd like to turn over to jan to start medicare 101 well good afternoon and thank you for joining us for jackie valersky's medicare 101. i am jackie's constituent for medicare my name is jan faker and i'll be moderating today's medicare 101. i'm delighted to welcome back my colleague john williams john williams has been a medicare specialist with a state health insurance program uh called ship that's a big boat state health insurance program since 2012 john comes to us loaded with experience he was with the social security administration for 38 years and before that with medicaid for six years so he has all kinds of experience and we are just really blessed to have him today as i said before my name is jan faker and i've been on three different members of congress's staff for the past 26 years the last five years almost six years on jackie's staff with a specialty of medicare health care and social security and you'll have to bear with us today because uh john and i both are senior citizens like most of you and the technology is something that we're going to work through here today now here's our outline but before we start i always like to say that medicare is like a newborn baby it arrives with no instructions so that's why jackie is very passionate about presenting these medicare 101s it's an opportunity to learn about medicare in a simple fashion and we're not marketing or selling anything we're here to educate now for the past five years john and i have been doing these medicare 101s throughout all the counties of jackie's second district but this year because of the pandemic we decided it would not be appropriate to do these in person so that's why we're doing what we've all been doing the past six months zoom and facebook live all the virtual presentations basically i'm going to talk about what's new in 2021 for medicare john is going to talk about what is medicare who is eligible when do i enroll how do i enroll he's going to talk about medicare parts a and b and medicare supplements or medigap i'll then teach a little bit about medicare part d drug plans and then john will come up and sort of wrap it up with some medicare part c advantage plans and then we'll take some questions so what's new last week i don't know about you but i got my medicare new handbook now cms that centers for medicare and medicaid services that's medicare began sending out the medicare new handbook i call it the medicare bible although not written by the hand of god it is inspired by government experts and you can get all the answers to your questions in the medicare and you handbook but let's face it usually when john and i do these presentations we always ask who really reads all 125 pages of that and we always seem to have one overachiever it says i do and we're like good for you but for the rest of us that's why we present medicare 101. not exactly new but in 2018 medicare be just redid the medicare cars cards and you probably know why because the old cards had your social security number and that was a huge security issue so the new cards have you'll see this one's one eg4 it has numbers and letters it's unique to you the cards also have the date that your part a and part b are effective you can see here it's march 3rd 2016. now a note about your cards guard them like a credit card you don't just leave them laying around you should really only give your medicare number to your health care providers your hospital your pharmacist and a note of caution medicare nor social security neither one of them will call you unless you call them first or knock at your door so don't be scammed what else is new in 2021 i always get asked this when we do our medicare 101s what's my cola for my social security well that's not really a medicare question it's something that we all care about and that will be released on october the 13th that's the cola and i always like to add that the cola last year i think it was 2.3 percent or maybe 2.8 percent we don't know what it's going to be this year but it's based on the consumer price index it is not a percent that congress or the president or anyone just randomly picks it is based on inflation of course we know 2020 has been really a crazy year so we really don't know what that's going to be it is the cons the cpi when that comes out they will announce this on october the 13th we're sort of hearing just um one point something we don't know and then what's my medicare part b premium because we know if you get a cola many times your medicare part b premium will also go up i like to say the lord giveth and the lord taketh away but that'll be announced later on in october 2020 or october of this year 2021 that should say and we do have a really great handout about your medicare costs that will sort of review what john is going to teach you about medicare medicare part b all the handouts by the way are available on jackie's website we'll show that website again and it will all the phone numbers and website addresses will all be um shown to you again at the end or you can download them i put them on a word document for you probably the biggest news for medicare in 2021 you might have heard president trump earlier this summer talk about insulin costs there is this year coming in 2021 with part b what's called a senior savings model that is one of the medicare part d drug plans you can get if you are diabetic and take insulin for a maximum of a 35 copay for that insulin and it's a broad range of insulin so we'll talk more about that at part d it's new and we're sort of learning about it too but that's going to be a fantastic benefit and now a word about medicare annual enrollment or why is my mailbox exploding why is my phone ringing with medicare healthcare companies wanting to market me their product that's because every year from october the 15th to december the 17th is medicare annual enrollment and what about all those sports old sports guys and celebrities trying to sell me something and really how does pat boone know that i'm going to be 65 it's a mystery to me but we do know its annual enrollment period just by our mailbox at our telephone and the television commercials during annual um enrollment you can enroll in a plan you can disenroll you can switch medicare advantage plans or your part d drug plans and the changes are effective january 1st of 2021 but first let's learn about medicare and i'm going to bring john up and he's going to teach you about the different parts of medicare john williams from ship well thank you jan for all that wonderful information and for the kind introduction and i want to thank congresswoman jackie walorski for letting me participate in medicare 101 in her district again this year i appreciate her willingness to help you folks out to learn more about medicare i think most of you know what medicare is i don't think i have to tell you but in case there is someone that's not clear on it medicare is federal health insurance and it does include hospital and medical and drug coverage now who's eligible for medicare well to start out with i think we need to explain that it's only available to us citizens or people who have illegally resided in the united states for the past five consecutive years but they must also either be age 65 or older or if they're under age 65 have received social security disability benefits or railroad retirement disability benefits for 24 months or less or if they have a diagnosis of als which stands for amiotropic lateral sclerosis in other words lou gehrig's disease they don't have to wait the 24 months before their medicare starts they begin their coverage as soon as their disability payments start and then medicare is also available at any age to people with a diagnosis of end stage renal disease in other words people who need a kidney transplant or need to be on kidney dialysis okay so when do i sign up for medicare well there's several opportunities and your first chance to enroll is called your initial enrollment period that's a seven month period of time that starts three months before you turn 65 it includes your birthday month and ends three months after your birthday month that's your first opportunity and your best opportunity to enroll in medicare if you enroll in medicare before you turn 65 your coverage actually starts the first day of your birthday month but if you wait until your birthday month or later to enroll during that initial enrollment period your part b coverage doesn't start until one to three months afterward after you apply depending on how long you've waited to enroll now you already may know that some people are automatically enrolled in medicare without having to even lift a finger those are people who are already receiving social security benefits when they turn 65 for example or those that have received social security disability benefits for 24 months now if you're under age 65 you do have to wait the 24 months of receiving social security or railroad disability benefits before your medicare starts unless you've got als lou gehrig's disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in those situations medicare starts the first month that you receive the disability benefits from medicare or from social security excuse me well if you need to enroll in medicare how do you go about enrolling well that has to be done through the social security administration and unfortunately at the present time social security offices are not open to the public that means you can't walk in your social security office or set up an appointment to go there to apply for medicare so you have two other options you can contact or call social security at 1-800-772-1213 they're open monday through friday seven a.m to seven p.m to set up an appointment to apply for medicare online or pardon me on the phone or you can apply online at social security's website and we've shown the website address here excuse me our phone key our recording device keeps uh dropping down here [Music] social security's website is triple w dot dot and if you want to go directly to the place where you would enroll in benefits after the gov the gov you'd put a slash mark benefits slash mark medicare now if you apply for medicare before your 65th birthday month you should get your medicare card in the mail and plenty of time so that you have it at the beginning of the month that your medicare will start some people say that medicare is a lot like alphabet soup and i guess that's because they both have letters on them well most of you have heard that there's different parts of medicare and in this situation there are four parts part a hospital insurance and by the way part a only helps pay for inpatient hospital stays it does not pay for observation status stays but part b of medicare the medical insurance part covers doctors charges in or out of the hospital things like emergency room services ambulance services observation stays in the hospital etc part c is another name for an advantage plan and then medicare part d is the drug coverage under medicare remember medicare is a type of insurance and there's some terms that most insurance policies and companies use we want to make sure that you understand what they are uh the one is a premium that's the fixed amount that you pay every month for your health insurance or other insurance including your medicare part b now in some situations uh your medicare part b premium would come out of your social security benefit if you're getting it if you don't get social security you'd have to mail or send your part b medicare premiums directly into medicare then of course if you enroll in a medigap policy which we will talk about or an advantage plan perhaps or medicare part d drug plan perhaps and we'll talk about those later you may need to send in your premiums for that coverage directly to the insurance company that offers those plans that you enroll in a common term here is out of pocket maximum that would be the maximum amount you paid during a policy period which would generally be once a year and after you reach the out of pocket maximum your plan typically would pay 100 of its covered services for the rest of the year but that does not include your premiums you'd still have to pay your own medicare plan premiums advantage plan premiums for example separately from the out-of-pocket max another item or another term that we hear commonly is a deductible and that's a set amount you pay out of pocket each year or each benefit period before your plan begins to pay two terms that are fairly similar here in most people's minds are co-insurance and co-pay but there's actually a difference a co-insurance is the cost you and your health insurance plan uh pay on a split percentage basis such as you pay 20 and the plan pays 80 percent whereas a co-pay is a fixed dollar amount you pay when you receive medical services such as 10 co-pay for an office visit let's say with an advantage plan and i apologize here i had not advanced the slides here properly all right let's take a look at the first part of medicare medicare part a inpatient hospital insurance remember we were talking about deductibles and co-pays and coinsurances medicare part a does have a deductible for each benefit period and that would be basically each spell of hospitalization that you have and the deductible this year is one thousand four hundred eight dollars per benefit period now that covers your stay there for the first 60 days in that benefit period if you were to stay in the hospital longer than 60 days you would owe a co-pay of 352 this year for days 61 through 90 and then if you stay in the hospital longer than 90 days through days 91 to 150 your co-pay would be 704 per day that adds up to quite a bit of money unfortunately that's why a lot of people like to buy medigap policies because that will help to pay that deductible and the co-pays under medicare part a if you choose to enroll in a medigap policy and we will talk about that in a moment part a of medicare also helps to pay for skilled nursing facility stays after someone has been in the hospital as an inpatient for three days in a row prior to going into the skilled nursing facility medicare part a covers the first 20 days of skilled nursing facility care with no co-pays but for days 21 through 100 the copay would be 176 dollars per day in a skilled nursing facility that's another reason that some people like to purchase medigap policies to help pay for those co-pays if they go into a skilled nursing facility under medicare there's some other things that medicare part a also covers such as blood while you're in the hospital home health care of a skilled version or a skilled variety after coming home from the hospital or being released from a skilled nursing facility and of course hospice care for terminally ill patients who choose to just receive palliative palliative care rather than medical treatment during their terminal condition the second part of medicare that we're going to talk about here is medicare part b medical insurance part b helps to pay for doctor's visits in or out of the hospital outpatient hospital services such as emergency room care and observation status care while in the hospital some home health care of a skilled nursing variety after one leaves the hospital or in another setting durable medical equipment like canes walkers wheels chairs oxygen diabetic supplies things of that nature lab tests of an outpatient on an outpatient basis such as blood work for example and the wonderful preventive services that medicare part b has such as the annual wellness visits the screenings for different illnesses and specific shots or vaccinations that are covered under part b there is a deductible for part b of medicare and that's an annual a yearly deductible this year the deductible is 198 dollars but after that medicare has a co-insurance medicare pays 80 percent of its approved charges for medical treatment under part b and you the patient would pay the additional 20 uh that's another good reason that some people decide to buy medicare supplements or medigap policies to cover that co-pay of co-insurance of 20 percent we may have mentioned earlier that there for most people there is no monthly premium for medicare part a in other words you don't have to pay anything for that coverage every month however part b of medicare does have a a premium a monthly premium of 144 and some people who have medicare part b if their income is high will have to pay an additional amount added on to their premium and the threshold for that is for an individual a single individual if their annual income and that's their modified adjusted gross income is uh more than 87 000 they would have to pay more than 144.60 per month for their medicare part b and for joint filers with a modified adjusted gross income of more than 174 000 their premiums would be higher than the standard one forty four sixty now if someone does not sign up for part b of medicare when they're first eligible for medicare which typically would be at age 65 and then later on they want to enroll in part b they may be subject to what's called a late enrollment premium penalty and what that means is that they would pay an additional 10 percent added on to the normal premium for every 12 months that they were not enrolled in part b and could have been and that premium penalty goes on forever in other words as long as the person has medicare part b they would have to continue paying that premium penalty now there are some situations though where people can and probably should decline medicare part b when they're first eligible and they could do so without having the late enrollment premium penalty that i talked about later if they earlier rather if they later sign up for part b and that's available to people who are still actively working or their spouse is still actively working and have medical insurance coverage through a large employer group health plan now we're not talking about a retiree plan here we're talking about a plan offered by an employer based on an employee's active work and coverage with a large employer those people typically don't need to sign up for medicare part b because medicare would be secondary payer to the large employer group health plan but you know later on they can enroll in part b such as when they retire for example now if there's any question in your mind whether you want to decline part b of medicare we suggest that you call the social security administration at 800-772-1200 and get a better explanation that fits your particular situation about whether it would be wise to decline part b while you're still working or your spouse is still working and you're covered under your employer's large group health plan and i think that would just be prudent advice it might also be good advice to ask your employer for what they call evidence of coverage if you're still working and covered by their plan in case there should be any question later that you had that coverage now when you do retire or if at any point you lose your employer group coverage while you're still working you have an eight-month window of opportunity to again enroll in medicare part b without any late enrollment premium penalty and any delay in getting the coverage started several times when i was talking about deductibles co-pays co-insurances with medicare part a and medicare part b i said that there might be that might be good reason for some people to want to buy a medicare supplement in other words a medigap policy to help pay those deductibles co-pays and coinsurances left over from medicare part a and b well those medigap plans are not actually offered by medicare they're offered by private health insurance companies okay and there are approximately three dozen private health insurance companies that offer and sell medicare supplements in other words medigap policies to people who live in indiana um becomes a little bit overwhelming for some people so the state health insurance assistance program ship of which i'm a part is a part of the indiana department of insurance and the department of insurance has a website where you can look to see how much the different insurance companies charge for the medicare supplements in other words what their premiums are for medigap policies the website is triple w dot i d o i dot i n dot g o v slash medigap when you go on that website it doesn't ask for any personal information however it does ask for your age and your zip code and the type of plan you want and we will look at those plans in just a moment and whether you use tobacco products as well as your gender and then the software associated with that website lists out the different insurance companies that offer the plan you've identified based on the premiums they charge all the insurance companies that offer that plan offer exactly the same benefits the only difference between them will be the premiums in other words the amount they charge their consumers for that coverage every month a wise consumer will probably not want to pay any more uh in the form of monthly premiums than what they have to now we encourage you to download off of jackie wallerski's website the handouts that we have today including this one which is also page 72 in your 2021 medicare and you book it shows the different medicare medigap supplements that are available um some people become confused because the medigap plans are also labeled by letters much like the parts of medicare are labeled by letters in other words there's many gap plans a b c d f g k l and m m and n excuse me and then of course they're the medicare parts a b c and d if you look at the chart on page 72 of your medicare and you book for 2021 or you download this hand handout from jackie walorski's website you can see what each of those letter plans covers so that you can better compare what one offers compared to what the others offer when people get ready to enroll in a medicare supplement the best time to do it is around the time that they're both 65 and their part b starts at that point they have a guarantee issue period that lasts for six months where they can buy any medicare supplement from any medigap policy company that offers them with guarantee issuance in other words they ignore pre-existing health conditions but if you wait after that six month period of guarantee issue rights is over then very likely the insurance companies will medically underwrite any new applicants for coverage and they do have the right to refuse to sell a policy to an applicant based on pre-existing health conditions the affordable care act that started in 2010 largely did away with pre-existing health conditions for employer plans and other health insurance plans but that did not carry over to the medicare supplement plan industry so they are still allowed to medically underwrite people before selling them a medigap plan if the person is outside their six-month guarantee issue period that starts at the point that the both are age 65 or older and are enrolled in medicare part b therefore we advise people to pick the medicare supplement level that you think you're going to want to use for the rest of your life because if later you decide you wanted a different level of coverage you might not be able to change the level of coverage in other words get a new policy either from your original medigap policy company or another insurance company if you've got pre-existing health conditions that the insurance companies don't like based on your individual case and because those premiums are likely to go up on those medigap policies as people get older we also suggest that people select an insurance company to buy their medicare supplement medigap policy from that they think they're going to want to use for the rest of their life because again there might not be the opportunity to change that company later based on pre-existing health conditions so jan faker is telling me that it is now time for a quiz oh there we go it's quiz time okay so jan you have a quiz to give these fine people right i wanted to emphasize that uh there will be a space for time between the time that john comes up and i come up because we are practicing social distancing and have our mass on today um so did i mention there was a quiz well there is um i imagine by this time your head is probably spinning hang in there we're going to simplify this as we get through and by the way um all the things that john talked about is a handout called 2020 medicare costs all those deductibles premiums it is 2020 because again we don't have the 2021 medicare costs we also have this that shows that medigap slide that he showed i'm also going to show at the end i'll show this would be our final slide but i put it on a word document all the website numbers contact information for everything and every agency that we talk about today it's all in one document for you and then i have a document that i'm going to talk about which is medicare part d but first let's get to that quiz and by the way uh if you're submitting your questions we didn't want to tell you that facebook live will cut us off at an hour and a half so we will end at an hour and a half if we don't get to your questions again please i'll show that slide at the end you can email john or you can actually go back onto jackie's website this um lorsky.house.gov backslash medicare that you're on and resubmit your question and we will get those questions answered for you in fact many of them if they're too hard for me i will definitely have john get in contact with you so let's have a little quiz here when are you eligible for medicare this is probably the question that we get the most because it's confusing because social security different program you can retire at 62 or you can retire at 65 or you go all the way up to 70. so it gets really fuzzy we're not talking about social security we're talking about medicare so lock in on this medicare age 65 medicare age 65 and unless of course you fall into the categories that john talked about if you've been on social security disability for 24 months or als medicare age 65 you want to enroll in your initial enrollment period three months before your 65th birthday the month of your 65th birthday and three months after your 65th birthday notice how i've msi 65 we get that a lot because it's confusing so that is your seven month initial enrollment period if you're not actively working and you want to take medicare you need to contact medicare if you're not not already on benefits during that initial enrollment period so you can get that guarantee issue if you want a medigap that will not look at pre-existing conditions so important and that's why it's important that you're watching this so that you can make those decisions because they're lifelong decisions as john said you really want to find the medigap company that you feel comfortable to stick with for the rest of your life next question what is medicare part a when we do these live we get lots of answers but i bet you all said hospital insurance that's right and it does pay for other um benefits one of the great benefits is up to 100 days in a skilled nursing facility we have a wonderful benefit so medicare part a hospital i bet you know the next question what is medicare part b what is medicare part b if you all said medical insurance doctors visits outpatient services think of that as outpatient think more of part a is the in the hospital okay so all your outpatient services are part b and by the way john didn't specifically say this but vaccines are covered by part b and as we get the flu vaccine it's covered by part part b and as a coven 19 vaccine is developed it'll be covered by part b how do i enroll in medicare hmm you know we used to say you could just truck on down to your social security office but they're not open now remember social security administers the application process of medicare so in order to enroll in medicare you need to contact the social security administration you can do that by calling them and making a phone appointment or you can apply online and again we will give you those numbers again at the end but once you've enrolled in medicare you're done with social security as far as medicare goes they only do the enrollment process from there you deal with medicare by the way there's not a medicare office i get asked that a lot why are there not medicare offices you have a medicare 800 number we'll talk about that where you will do if you have any questions how much does medicare part b pay how much does medicare part b a doctor's office pay 80 percent of medicare's approved amount so let's do an example you go to the doctor he charges you 100 medicare says oh no we only approve 80 so medicare part b will pay 80 percent of that 80 which is 64. and who's going to pick up that other 16 the 20 well you will unless you have a medigap or a supplement what is a medigap supplement well we just answered that it also picks up part a deductibles and co-pays because part a as john said and again you'll see that on the handout that says 2020 medicare costs and your co-insurances and it pays for part b that 20 so how do i buy a medigap supplement did you say through health insurance agents or you can do it yourself on the website that john gave you that's from the www the indiana department of insurance that's what that idoi stands for dot in dot gov backslash medigap and it will list all the medigaps that are available in your county as john explained we will give that website as well and it will have the phone and the error the phone number for those companies you actually could call yourself and enroll yourself um i do recommend that if you're looking with an insurance agent ask around find an agent who deals with um who who specializes in medicare supplements and who deals with many supplement providers not just one that he may refer he or she may represent i think they call that a broker is probably so that you get the best um best price well done you got through your first quiz i hope you didn't have too much test anxiety on that so now we're going to talk about medicare what i go i have to remember this there we go medicare part d medicare part d what does that stand for i could never keep medicare part a what's that a hospital medicare prop b i'd have to think about it medicare part d drug plans d for drug that i can understand so it is for coverage for prescription medications not over the counter and not from canada it's voluntary but there's a lifetime penalty if you don't enroll when you could have that would be your initial enrollment period or if you continued active work and you have that employer coverage that's better than a part d plan that's called creditable coverage you don't have to take it right away just like you can decline part b you cannot pick up part d if you have creditable coverage and you will not get a penalty you must have medicare a and or b in order to enroll and again they're like a medigap they're sold by private medicare approved part d drug plan insurance companies and there are 30 plans in indiana in 2021. now how does part d work it's like an insurance policy you have a deductible the annual deductible for the 30 plans can be from zero a year to 445 a year that's regulated by medicare the monthly premiums in 2021 are going to go from seven dollars and 30 cents to 80 and 60 cents so if you see that the deductibles are between zero and 445 and the premiums range from seven dollars and 30 cents a month to up to 80 some a month what does that tell you that tells you that you need to find the medicare plan that is best for you at the lowest cost because there is a vast range of costs and benefits now it's like i say part d is like health insurance after the deductibles met the plan must pay at least 75 percent you pay 25 now in saying that there are medicare part d plans who add a lot of benefits and really like to spice up their plan and they may pay more than 75 you may have to pay zero for some certain medications on your drug plan that's important information for you to know now you may have heard of the gap or the doughnut hole it's gone but it is still what's called an initial coverage limit the gap or it used to be that when you reached a certain limit in 2021 that's going to be 4 130 that both you and your company paid for your prescription drugs there was no coverage and you had to pay 100 now it is that the company your drug plan must pay at least 75 and you pay 25 once you reach that limit and there is a catastrophic limit um i think it's over six thousand dollars that once you and your company have reached that you only pay five percent your company pays the rest so the the gap is gone because gap means there's no coverage but there still is some payment that you have to do um or you might have to do depending upon your plan now when do i enroll again when you first enroll in medicare or you can enroll in the annual enrollment period if you somehow missed your initial enrollment period of the part d plan and that's right now going to be october 15 through december 7th remember that annual enrollment period october 15th to december 7th pearl harbor day every year is when the annual moment period is and during that time you can check and shop around for part d plans and enroll or switch plans and your coverage is effective january 1st i always like to say help my parents um with their part d plans and every year i would come shop and compare plans and if i could find one that i thought was more cost effective i switched them every year you can do that and you don't have to worry about calling your current plan and feeling have some guilt and remorse that you drop them your new plan will disenroll you from your old plan so how do i find with all these premiums and deductibles and my goodness 30 plants how do i find the plan for me i always like to say you need to find your unique plan not your mother's not your spouse's your spouse has different drugs than you do different needs and i always say you're only one doctor's appointment away from that big prescription that's really going to hit you in the wallet so every year we change the plans change you need to shop around probably one of the best things to do and since you're all on zoom and facebook you all do internet is to go to the wonderful drug plan finder tool on www.healthcare.gov you can do this yourself if you go there there'll be a a a button to hit for drug plan finder or enter your drugs you will see it on there find a drug plan and it'll ask you a few questions you know where you live a few things and then you type in your prescriptions and then it'll ask you your milligrams or what kind you know how often you take it i'll ask you a few questions and when you're done you hit my drug list is complete and that tool will calculate and take your individual drugs and go out to all 30 of the drug plans in indiana and calculate premiums co-pays deductibles with your drug list and it will then calculate the least costly annual cost at the top and it'll list all 30 plans with the most expensive at the bottom and i did that for my parents every year and if i found one that i thought was better i would just switch you can actually enroll right off that website so if you don't feel comfortable uh getting on the drug plan founder i bet you have a grandchild that will help you or you could call 1-800 medicare have your drug list ready and i always like to say at this point the presentation this is the best free advice you're going to get all day whenever you have a medicare problem of any sort with your medicare benefits you can call the 1-800 medicare number and when you hear the automated message say agent and you will be transferred to a real live breathing person and you can avoid the phone messages in the phone tree if i always say if it doesn't happen right away see it a little madder and a little louder agent like a customer service agent is what you're asking for and it's great you'll be transferred to a real person you also can work with ship that john is from the state health insurance program that's what they do if you didn't know ship is federally funded to each state's department of insurance specifically to help medicare beneficiaries with their benefits and that's what they do now during the pandemic they aren't taking as many in-person counseling sessions usually their counselors all of the united st indiana that you could make an appointment with but you can call them and they can do some limited in person because they usually work out of council and aging's and most of them are closed but you can call ship at 1-800-452-4800 and they will help you and again have your drug list ready the big news and it is so new that i'm going to give you the information that we have um this is what we have um i took this right off the medicare website seniors who use insulin will be able to choose a plan in their area that offer insulin savings through the part d senior savings model and provides a coverage of a broad set of insulins for no more than 35 copay per month that's remarkable now we aren't as familiar with that but if you use the drug plan finder we are assuming that if you put in insulin that it will bring up one of these senior saving model programs we're not quite for sure how that works but you will definitely want to get some help i would say if if you're not finding that you're paying 35 on this plan when you go to drug plan finder call medicare or call ship and they certainly can help you find those plans are going to be amongst the 30 that are there but 35 copay for a broad range of insulin is wonderful so that's really big news this year so your head may be spinning we've talked about medicare and you're still kind of wondering okay but she hasn't hit about medicare advantage plans so this is the point i always ask everybody to lock in because this is crucial if you get this you are on your way we talk about traditional medicare that is the government's medicare it is a government program and that's part a hospital part b doctors medigaps and a part d drug plan okay so if you were to take those four traditional parts of medicare the hospital the doctor the benefits of a medigap and a drug plan and you were to bundle them up and you were to take them out of the government program medicare and give them to a private health insurance company you would then have medicare advantage part c plan i'm going to do that again because it's so critical take the benefits of a part a hospital part b doctor a medicat supplement and a part d drug plan and put them all together all four of them and hand them over to or put them under the administration of a private health insurance company you would have a medicare advantage plan now it is privatized health care but they're highly regulated by medicare they offer the same benefits that part a and part they have to give you the same medicare benefits but there are advantages and there are disadvantages probably the biggest advantage is that the cost some of the monthly premiums are as low as a zero per month so i'm going to bring john back up he's the expert he can talk to you about medicare advantage plans and then we'll wrap it up and try to take as many questions as we can okay jan thank you very much i'll take my mask off here all right let's look at the next slide here what are the differences between original medicare and medicare advantage jan used the term traditional medicare some people call it original medicare that would be a medicare part a part b you can add a part d plan you can also add a medicare supplement a medigap plan okay that's original medicare the medicare part c advantage plan includes the benefits of medicare part a medicare part b medicare part d some of the benefits of a medigap supplement and then many of these advantage plans offer additional benefits too that medicare itself does not offer like dental and vision coverage some include hearing aid coverage some include over-the-counter medicine allowance to buy things like aspirin and incontinence supplies etc um it's sort of a preference now there are some advantages and disadvantages to using medicare part a a pardon me original medicare and a medicare advantage plan let's take a look at those for example with original medicare you can go to any doctor or hospital that takes medicare anywhere in the united states in other words that's about 95 of the medical providers in this country and i think you'd want to focus on trying to use ones that accept medicare assignment that's where the medical provider accepts medicare approved charge as its full charge and in most cases you don't need to have a referral from your primary doctor to see a specialist of course unless the specialist requires that well let's compare that with advantage plans in many cases you'll need to use doctors or other medical providers that are in your plan's network or service area in order to get the lowest costs under the plan some plans won't cover cover services from providers outside of their network and if that were the case you would be responsible for paying the whole bill yourself unless it was a true emergency okay so in some cases with some advantage plans you also may need to get a referral from your primary care physician to see a specialized i think there's a big difference there in how original medicare and medicare advantage plans allow you to receive your treatment from your doctors and hospitals and other providers well that was quick jan i guess it's time for another quiz thank you john i hope that it's beginning to make some sense now um let's see let's review what's a medicare part d easy right you all remember prescription drugs not over the counter not from canada medicare coverage for prescription drugs how do i buy a medicare part d plan well if you said from an insurance agent or you can go to www.medicare.gov to that great drug plan compare you can buy a part d and by the way we talk a lot about ship because they are wonderful and they can help you they do not help you to buy plans they don't sell anything that's all that's why they're so wonderful they don't market anything they're just giving you great advice and helping you understand your benefits what is an advantage plan and i hope that by now the light bulb has gone off that you understand the difference between an advantage plan and original medicare are you thinking an advantage plan combines medicare parts a b and d and some of the features of a medigap and it gives it to a private health insurance company it is managed care they manage your care you do need to go to their hmo their ppos you'll see networks and those are all the things that you need to check to make sure that your deck doctor your hospital are all in the networks or that hmo however it is you need to make sure it works for you and it could be a great advantage or a disadvantage so you're saying i'm still a little confused so let's wrap it up here maybe this will be helpful original or traditional medicare definitely costs more per month for a supplement we know that you first have to pay your 144 dollars medicare part b premium then you need to buy a medigap and we know that it costs more usually when you enroll it's around a hundred dollars and it goes up every year based on your age or your where you live it goes up incrementally not a lot but it does those increases must be approved by the indian department of insurance so they can't just randomly jack up prices too high but i know i like to say that when my mom and dad were 65 they enrolled in a medigap and by the time dad was 96 that medigap policy was 330 dollars a month that's a lot of money per month but dad in his last two years of life was in and out of the hospital at least three or four times and in rehab at least three times there is no doubt he literally racked up hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars with the medical bills and because he had a mini gap he never saw a bill he never had to pay that so that's really important he could go if you have a medigap you could go to any doctor anytime anywhere in the united states that accepts medicare i used to say that i think my dad went to the doctor when he was 94 just because he was lonely one to talk to somebody that's a medigap it was great there are no co-pays no co-insurance they're all covered by a medigap no surprises now this is really important we haven't talked about this if medicare does not cover medical expenses outside the boundaries of the united states if you're on a cruise and you cross the international boundary line and you're no longer in the united states and you slip and fall medicare will not pay for that medicare will not pay for that transport but some many gaps cover international travel so if that's something you do it is important to you you need to consider that now let's go ahead and take a look at medicare advantage plans they cost less per month there's no doubt some of them are free or zero i should say they're not free they're zero per month but they are managed care you will see networks and ppos and hmos you have to have to do it their way in order to get the biggest benefit at the least amount of costs there are co-pays and coinsurances for separate services if you have a bad year you could have co-pays on your x-rays or on on your lab on your ambulance run on your chemo there are co-pays on a lot of the services no not all advantage plans if you go to their hospital many of them will waive those co-pays but if you have a bad year you could rack up a lot of expenses most advantage plans do have a cap they all have a cap those caps i've looked i've seen some at five thousand six thousand dollars so if you have a bad year you could have five to six thousand dollars worth of hospital bills with an advantage plan because of all the co-pays and remember most advantages we think almost all of them do not cover international travel so if you're a snowbird and you like to go to florida you're probably going to want a medigap because the medicare advantage you have to go to their network it's always going to be in the state of indiana okay so if you're a snowbird or you like to go on cruises it's probably better for you for a traditional medigap traditional medicare but if cost and you really can't afford the cost of that then you look at a medicare advantage 30 million medicare beneficiaries have advantage plans and are very pleased with them so that's maybe helpful to you to try to understand the difference and maybe give you some ideas of what you should look for but again you can talk to someone from ship by calling them and they will go over those benefits with you also don't forget that all of the handouts that we talked about today are on jackie's website at wallorskyhouse.gov medicare you can see that there we have my medicare part d handout we have this one that has all the contact information and i'm going to show that to you in the next slide but i have it on a word document so you have all the resources that we talked about today we have the medigap plans that john referenced and this one is when he talked about medicare and b this is medicare 2020 cost we don't have the 21 21 costs or 20 21 costs yet but this will talk about all those deductibles and really be helpful to you it also has on the second page what we call the um adjusted or the um income requirements that if you make a lot of money and you're gonna have to pay more this will tell you at what income your modified adjusted income will fall under so at this point i'm going to put up this slide because it has all the information if we don't get to your question today we um we're going to try to get to as many as we can if we don't get to facebook does kick us off at one and a half hours so if we don't get your questions you can again resubmit that question there where he says the handouts wolorski.house.gov backslash medicare and if you go there it'll say submit your question or you can email john directly he is the expert and he has graciously um allowed us to share his email address there johnwilliams.ship gmail.com or you can call me at jackie's rochester office so if we don't get to him today we're sorry we're going to try to get to as many as we can so john i'm going to step over here and we're going to read some of your questions okay john we have our first one it says after listening to your presentation today i think i want to change my plan how do i do that okay well that's a good question jan of course it does depend on what type of plan the person wants to change for example maybe he wants to change from a medigap to an advantage plan well that can be done during the annual open enrollment period october 15th through uh december 7th for the advantage plan to start january 1st so that person also would need to contact his medigap plan and let him know that he's switching to an advantage plan so that the medigap plan could terminate its coverage as of december 31st but maybe that person already has a medigap plan let's say a plan g and they decide they want to switch to a media plan c if they're outside their guarantee issue period which is that period of time that starts when they're both age 65 and have medicare part b and the following five months in other words the total of six months if they want to change to a different level of coverage from for example a plan g to a plan c they would likely be medically underwritten by the insurance company and if they have pre-existing health conditions the insurance company does not have to switch their plans another example of changing plans might be from wanted by advantage plan to another well that's something that can be done during the annual open enrollment period october 15 through december 7th for the new plan to start january 1st and uh medicare's actually extended that a little bit until march 31st so if someone starts out at the beginning of 2021 with an advantage plan and they want to change to a different advantage plan they can do that during the period january 1st through march 31st the new plan would start the following month okay another question about that same thing is what if you want to switch from a part d drug plan to another part d drug plan that can be done during the annual open enrollment period january pardon me october 15th through december 7th for the new coverage to start january first okay john we have anthony from knox and he said is medicare medigap plan f being discontinued and what is the cost for medic medigap g and what are the disadvantages he's a very astute medicare person isn't he he knows what's going on here right for people that are just becoming eligible for medicare in 2020 or later in other words they're turning 65 this year or in a subsequent year or they're going on medicare this year or later because their disability benefits have been uh paid for 24 months they would not be able to enroll in a plan f medicare supplement for many years that's been the most comprehensive medicare supplement plan available the plan g now replaces that for most people that are just going into medicare and uh the plan g is very comprehensive also but it does not cover the uh part b annual deductible which this year is 198 typically the premium for the plan g is uh cheaper than the plan f by more than 198 dollars a year so it doesn't make sense for most people to even think about buying a plan f if it is available to them it's only being discontinued for people who are new to medicare starting this year or later remember there's about 24 to 36 i'm not sure several dozen medigap insurance policy or companies selling those policies and they all charge a different amount so it's very important that people look at the insurance company as well as the plan that they want to enroll in to see what the premium cost would be here's what anthony also asked john i have read that you receive better care if unhealthy with medicare than a medicare or whatever medicare with a medigap than a medicare advantage program and he's referring to nursing home quality to doctors in other words he's saying do you get better care with a medicare medigap with doctors in nursing homes over a medicare advantage he asks is this true well like jan mentioned at one point the medicare advantage plans have to cover the same types of benefits that original medicare covers that means that they cover hospital care and medical care i don't think the quality of care is any different between using original medicare with a medigap policy compared to using an advantage plan but often the advantage plan limits the amount of time that someone can receive care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility so i think the issue more is with the length of time someone can receive care rather than the quality of the care using an advantage plan compared to original medicare you know john i must say um at congressional offices that's one of the things we do we help folks with their medicare benefits or irs or immigration whatever federal program and i of course work with medicare and that probably is the question i get the most is from folks who are on an advantage plan and their spouse or their mother um they're being pretty stinned you use the word stingy the medicare advantage as far as letting folks stay as long as you could with a medi gap it's that length of saying what they'll approve that seems to be the difference we have a question from thomas from elkhart he said i am 58 my wife is 62 and we don't plan to retire and collect social security until we're 70. good for you do i or she need to sign up for medicare before we retire at 70. okay well assuming you don't want medicare until age 70 you would not need to enroll in medicare until then as long as you're still working and covered by a large employer's group health plan a lot of people nowadays are putting off or delaying uh applying for social security benefits but they have to decide at age 65 or anywhere between age 65 and the time they retire as of whether they want to enroll in medicare or not if someone's covered by a large group health plan based on active employment then typically they don't need medicare and most people in that situation if they enroll in any part of medicare are only enrolling in medicare part a that's because medicare would be secondary payer for hospital medical and drug coverage to the large group plans coverage based on active employment and as secondary payer medicare usually pays little or nothing left over from the employer plan in other words it rarely pays any or all of the deductibles and co-pays from that plan so jan do you have other questions i'm sure we do let's take a look here richard from south bend and you had mentioned this john already he's already a medicare beneficiary and why are there pre-existing conditions indiana in indiana for those have medicare supplements and you did talk about that but go ahead and you might answer that again okay uh the affordable care act started in 2010 and it largely did away with pre-existing health conditions being a part of whether an employer plan for example would be able to cover a worker or one of the workers dependents that pre-existing health care exclusion did not carry over to medicare supplements in other words the medigap plans so outside of the guarantee issue period where a person just turns 65 for example and enrolls in part b they have a six-month guarantee issue period to buy a medigap plan regardless of pre-existing health conditions would be generally the only time that pre-existing health conditions would not affect a person being able to get a medigap plan for example if you wait until the seventh month after you turn 65 and your part b starts insurance companies that sell medigap plans would be able to refuse to sell you a policy if they did not like their your health conditions and that's not just in indiana that's in all states some states though have uh given a little more leeway to that guarantee issue period but indiana has not okay we have janelle from goshen hi janelle can i sign up during the open enrollment period in october if i don't turn 65 until january great question okay well janelle if you're turning 65 in january you don't need to be concerned about the annual enrollment period for medicare part d or advantage plans your initial enrollment period for medicare is going to start three months before your 65th birthday month so if we count backward from january we would have october as being the first month of your initial enrollment period if you want your medicare part b to start in january you would need to enroll in medicare between october 1st and december 31st if you wait until january 1st or any of the following three months your part b coverage would be delayed by anywhere from one to three months after you apply so janelle i think really it's very easy to get that confused you're asking about the medicare enrollment that is different from the open enrollment or the annual enrollment annual enrollment is where you can check and shop for part d plans or switch advantage plans so you're looking at your initial enrollment period at 65 three months before the month of and three months after rick says i understand that some medicare advantage plans now include coverage for assisted living can you comment well this is news to me oh it's news to me too jan i have not heard that so rick if you can give us some more details on that jan and i would love to hear about it that's something new to us and he has a follow-up question what is the latest about hospitals holding patients for more than 24 hours under observation status okay well the 24 hours means that if they're going to hold somebody in observation status they have to notify the person in writing within 24 hours of that um there's no requirement that a person automatically be made an inpatient if they're going to be in the hospital for more than 24 hours in observation status so i think maybe again you're thinking about something that's a little different than what the observation status rule uh states oh here's a great question from leslie what year is that that's magi that's not what came to visit jesus at the manger by the way that's modified adjusted gross income um calculated on and that is for the um the increased premium premium on your income for 2021 is 2019 the year that your income is based on to figure that out okay they look at the most recent federal income tax return that a person has on file to determine their magi and their magi then would be used to affect their current year's medicare premium in most cases if someone is applying for medicare in 2021 their either their 2019 or possibly their 2020 federal income tax return would be the most recent one but let's say for example that they base your premium your medicare part b premium on the magi from your 2019 federal income tax return and then you find out after you file your 2020 tax return that your magi has reduced considerably you can contact social security and request that they review that magi amount early based on your 2020 federal income tax return if that would make a difference in the amount of your premium we have some great questions dave asks what happens if i sign up now for part b and later my wife gets a job with group insurance coverage that includes me all right well that's a good question dave if your wife works for a large employer and you're at least age 65 you would be able to withdraw from part b of medicare and possibly part d if that group health insurance from your wife's job also has drug coverage and then later when she retires or if you lose that coverage you can immediately re-enroll in medicare part b without any late enrollment penalty or getting the coverage started and the same thing would apply to enrolling in a part d plan at that time here's another great quest question from joseph so can we really get dental vision and hearing now since i am 100 disabled from the va do i still have to pay for my medicare i think he wants to know does he need to enroll in medicare right all right so if you have va health care benefits and you only have medicare part a then in order to get an advantage plan which would be where those dental and vision and hearing benefits would come from you would have to enroll in part b uh in order to have an advantage plan you have to enroll in part b so your next opportunity to do that likely would be january february or march of 2021 with the part b coverage starting in july you would have a special enrollment period to enroll an advantage plan between april 1st and june 30th of the year that you enroll in part b so that it would take effect in july when your part b starts and then you'd have dental envision coverage and perhaps hearing coverage from the advantage plan if the plan offers that okay and yes he would have to pay for that yes you'd have to pay your yes and you very likely would have a late enrollment premium penalty on the part b if you have been without part b for more than 12 months we have a question from donna and i'm not so sure it says how does it work if you have medicare and medicaid and john you might briefly describe the difference between medicaid and medicare all right we'll do we'd already said that medicare is a federal health insurance benefit and for people age 65 or older and some people who are disabled medicaid is a state health insurance benefit for people with low income who don't own much money or property also for people age 65 or older or disabled people it is possible to have both medicare and medicaid if you qualify for both so if someone has medicare and medicaid uh the state of indiana will pay their medicare part b premiums in other words they don't have to pay that 140 460 every month out of their social security payment for part b the medicaid would also automatically cover the medicare part a and b deductibles and co-insurances and co-pays as long as they use doctors and hospitals and other medical providers that accept medicaid okay the medicaid also would provide them what they call extra help on a part d drug plan and that means that they would not have a premium for their part d drug plan there would be no doughnut hole in other words no coverage gap there would be no deductible in the part d drug plan and the co-pays for the drugs would be very inexpensive compared to what they would normally be okay we're getting one last one in or maybe that was the last one i think that was the last one what do you think that was okay okay here we go just popped up someone asked and they didn't give us their name they said what plan does john plan on getting all right well uh just so that you know i think you probably already do know because i worked for social security for a long time i'm a retired federal employee and i carried my federal employee health benefits into retirement with me it serves as my medicare supplement i do have original medicare and it also provides what they call creditable drug coverage which means that i don't need a part d drug plan it also helps to pay my medicare part b premiums would you believe it sends money every to me every year to help pay my part b premiums um i've signed up for some additional dental and vision coverage through that plan and oh by the way it provides a free hearing aid to me if i need one so i'm going to hang on to that as long as i can afford to pay the premiums the premiums are sky high as you might expect they're not free i've often told people that if i can't afford to pay the premiums on that at some point i may consider enrolling in an advantage plan it's unlikely that if i drop my federal employee health benefits that i would be able to have guarantee issue rights for a medicare supplement because of the medical underwriting which would mean that if i wanted any other coverage it would very likely have to be an advantage plan and if i were looking for an advantage plan it would be one that covers my doctors and hospitals and drugs at the most economical cost with the lowest annual out-of-pocket maximum involved and is do you think that's a thorough enough answer there one thing i don't think you mentioned john was that advantage plans do not medically underwrite correct that is correct and that's a good point jan advantage plans do not medically underwrite now currently still in 2020 if you try to enroll in an advantage plan to use this year they would not be allowed to enroll somebody who has end stage renal disease but starting in 2021 they can which means that there's an awful lot of people that have been without a medicare supplement because they couldn't pass the guarantee issue or pardon me the medical underwriting if they had end-stage renal disease who will now be able to buy an advantage plan if they want one okay well john that's the end of our questions we really thought that we would have to cut them off but again if you have uh further questions after watching this you're going to be able to watch this again you can also the powerpoint will be available if you have questions you can email john directly again you can see his email address there if you have medicare questions or social security you can call me at congresswoman mallorcy's rochester office and by the way you may wonder why is a congressional office doing this your congressional offices are there to help you with a federal agency if you're having difficulty and you've tried to get an answer you've tried to get a response and you can't we do everything from help with immigration that ppp program lost stimulus checks um va social security health care um you name it usda you name it and and we will try to help you but if it's specifically about medicare or social you can call me at the rochester office if not you can call jackie's mishawaka office and i didn't put that number on there but it's five seven four two zero four two six four five she's located here in downtown mishawaka and um that's where the other staff are that handle the different issues so that's it for medicare 101 we really appreciate you joining us we hope it's been beneficial to you and again um make great decisions do your homework listen to this again and know that knowledge of medicare is empowerment because those decisions that you make will be lifelong so thanks everybody goodbye

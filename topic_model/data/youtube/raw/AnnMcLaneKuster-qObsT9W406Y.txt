my name is sue and i'm here volunteering tonight for annie kuster's campaign for congress for the women's phone bank i support annie because she shares my values when it comes to women's rights she's pro-choice and i am as well and i find that annie has a really unique take on women's rights because as an adoption attorney she has seen the very difficult decisions that families have had to make i also find that i support her because she does not want to privatize social security and i feel that as a woman women have often made less than men and we know that the lilly ledbetter fair pay act is hopefully going to help with that but i found historically women have always made less than men and social security has always been an extremely important benefit for women in their older years in addition to medicare for this very same reasons so those are reasons that i support annie kuster for congress and so i hope you'll join me in supporting her

thank you mr franklin is recognized for five minutes thank you mr chairman and many of my questions have been answered but uh yeah i do want to echo what many others have uh i'm stunned that a department that consumes uh more of our discretionary resources and any other department of government didn't see fit to just a handful of years ago to decide it was worth auditing where all that money was going but i i'm encouraged by the progress i do have a couple of uh well just specific questions diving into some of the data that was presented to us um this would be for ms jenkins again but with respect to the navy uh the nfr's you know notice the findings and recommendations i did notice that the navy has more of those from fiscal year 19 than all the other services combined is that just a difference in the way that the navy was conducting its audits or were there just more problems and then just kind of have to ceaselessly and maybe not is the success of all those findings does that have anything to do with the decision that it's no longer uh as high a priority program and uh and your personnel numbers are being cut um sarah i would say uh the number of nfrs it's it's a sign of progress for us um as i said you know we open up doors and we ask and embrace the audit and we ask the auditors to dig in deep look at every process and every element and quite frankly we ask them to give us detailed findings so that we can address them at the lower level of detail so the more and more that we're getting insight from them the more uh you know of course um the more we get after it i would say that a sign up progress for us has been the amount of remediation that we have been able to accomplish from the number of just the findings that were resolved um every year over 20 of our findings we resolve them but most importantly and i said the benefit that we got and the progress i've shown is through the journey um we got year one in 2019 we were able to demonstrate 100 accountability of our real property the past three years or two years or rather we have closed five material weaknesses across all three audits that we have because we have two for the navy and then um one for the marine corps um and then just we're talking about systems so one of the large number of our findings are around the business system environment and how complex it is and we've been able to shut down systems that five of them so far and then we are on target uh to get on one um accounting system for the navy or two accounting system coordinator but at the end of uh this year and one for the for the marine corps um so uh as i stated uh previously on that on the lab audit uh personnel it is again uh resizing the organization um to match the number of audits with a plan audit statement we have i'm not a personal expert but my understanding is that those personnel are going to be put in other positions that matches their their skill set so we're going to be retaining those skill sets and while we have the nav audit as an internal audit function within the department of the navy we have a complete separate workforce that we have expanded over the few years the number of uh skill set and expertise we have that is focused on building the internal controls and all the work that comes in as a result of the financial state in order to get after remediation okay thank you and this question would be for mr glenn um it appears you know the services are doing their respective audits and i'm just wondering as these results are being looked at is there is there any way to or are you looking at these from a holistic perspective to see if there's some trends that are being picked up in one service that may not have been picked up on audits and others but would have applica application to them because obviously uh despite the best audits you're not going to catch everything true um yeah the communication across the department is is good so where wanted he's making progress we're quick to highlight it so others can learn that's that's been one of the cultural changes that the audits driven is really more of a collaborative front that a lot of times the services are confronting similar issues and we hold weekly meetings on mondays called financial fin-ops financial operations where we talk about the issues talk about best practices or ways to to solve it so this yes is the short answer okay thanks just one final comment as far as the sense of urgency you know when we put our minds to it we decided uh we wanted to put astronauts on the moon by the end of the decade and we did it in less time than we're talking about getting a clean audit here so it seems to me that if we really were really serious about this we could focus the energy and resources to get it done sooner but with that mr chairman go back

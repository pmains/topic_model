this isn't just a doorway to a school it was my doorway as a public school kid to opportunity and I want to make sure every child has that same chance for a better life but Rick Scott's education cuts are closing that door on Florida's kids spending almost 200 dollars less per student than when I was governor and cutting bright future scholarships in half when I was governor we brought both parties together to open the doors of opportunity not close them and together we can do it again

[Music] uh thank you um the chair has had to go to another hearing so I'm going to ask my questions and then Senator Reid will follow on uh first of all welcome to all of you particularly um uh my constituent uh Mr Marielle who we're proud to claim as a new jerseyan so it's good to see you I just want to make one comment and that is is that the system as it is isn't working for us so if we think the system as it is is working just fine then something is wrong uh I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of chairman Brown's Fair access to financial services act but in my view in order to root out discrimination and promote Equitable access in the financial system we need to start at the top with our Regulators right now there is a staggering lack of diversity in leadership positions at the institutions that set and enforce the rules of the financial system as a result black and Latino communities lack representation at the table when these critical decisions are being made so I'd like to ask Miss rice Miss Nelson uh what are the consequences of under representation of minority voices among Financial regulators sure I'm happy to start off there Senator Mendez Menendez and thank you for the question so I think it's it's critical because bringing a diverse representation to the table when rules are being set increases the likelihood of creating a more accurate role it also increases the likelihood of ensuring that we have the right data brought to bear I mean that is one of the reasons that we had the foreclosure and financial crisis in 2008 because we had the wrong data right we were being informed by the wrong information uh in the lead-up to the crisis but it also makes sure that it makes sure that the rules that we craft are accurate and we're considering how those rules are going to impact all market segments so it's extremely important yes I would agree and and I think this panel demonstrates that when we're looking for diversity it is important that we have a diversity of thought A diversity of experiences people who understand the plight of communities that suffer the racial disparities that we've outlined today and people who have not traditionally had access to credit access to equal Financial Services those who have experienced direct discrimination based on motive or based on impact because those voices as as Ms rice has said will impact how we think about policy and how we create policy that can remedy those harms and not perpetuate them well I can tell you from my own experience of 30 years in Congress between the house and the Senate if I and others like me were not here issues that are critically important to our communities would just not be either brought up or pressed and that doesn't mean that others aren't well intentioned but they're not doing it they're not putting political capital on the table to make it happen one of my concerns has been the Federal Reserve it has a well-documented diversity problem and it's 108-year history the Federal Reserve has never had for example a Hispanic Regional Bank president and this is an institution that's making some of the most important decisions in our economy let me ask you the FDIC found that nearly 6 million households in the country are unbanked these families have no access to checking accounts debit cards credit cards instead they use cash for day-to-day purchases and another 14 percent of Americans are underbanked which means they rely on money orders and other alternative Financial Services to complete transactions Mr morial in your work have you found that the unbanked and underbanked populations are disproportionately people of color they're disproportionately people of color and the reality is is that in community cities that are banking deserts payday lenders Check Cashers uh informal lenders proliferate and they rent money at the usurious interest rates they rent money on abusive terms and they proliferate and if you go into any Community Across America you can go into Newark or you can go into Jersey City or you can go into Patterson in New Jersey you can go into Providence you go into Philadelphia Pittsburgh Scranton or Harrisburg and you go on the black and brown communities you're going to see an active effort to use television advertising radio advertising Street teams to Market these types of services in these communities so it's a double-edged sword the banks are not there but the Predators are there and it has a negative impact on black and brown and underserved I might even add such is the case in many rural communities such as a case in many communities that happen to also be white or Asian underserved underbanked communities are a Haven a breeding ground for predatory Financial practices one final question and then Senator Warren is next uh according to the New York Times Wells Fargo conducted fake interviews with women and minority candidates for positions that had already been filled the bank reportedly undertook these fake interviews to artificially boost diversity statistics in an attempt to satisfy an internal goal to interview at least one woman and one person of color for each position that information that uncovered by the New York Times is not only highly offensive it suggested to me of a systemic bias and discrimination at the bank but raises questions of a broader pattern Miss Nelson if a bank is bringing in candidates of color for positions they already feel just to create an illusion of diverse hiring practices uh can we say that bank is making a good faith effort to promote diversity equity and inclusion uh no we cannot we cannot I think it's quite clear that that's a and that speaks to the culture right absolutely and and it speaks to the the notion that there's already uh an idea as to who is worthy of working at a bank and who is pre-selected as a preferential candidate in that workplace and that candidates of color have already been ruled out of the equation thank you very much to Senator Warren

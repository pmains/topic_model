mr chairman thank you very much for the time um uh mr rupert you use the term collaborative aren't the federal agencies supposed to coordinate with local units of government yes absolutely and i think from my perspective that's one of the the um exciting aspects of of of infrastructure is it provides the support for us to you know have more capacity in that direction and also to develop those relationships to provide the community support for that to happen mr chairman i would just say to you that this is a very important distinction in terms collaborate versus coordinate they mean two very different things and i think the agency people know that coordinate is treating people as equals at the table local state officials that they be treated as equals when you're uh making that decision rather than where it's the all-knowing people up here in the federal government that are dictating to local units of government that's a great frustration local and state officials have mr rupert you emphasize climate change and your testimony i believe and then also in your questioning with representative westerman so with us being told that's going to be decades in the future that this is going to continue why would we spend all kinds of money on this um if it's not going to do anything to fix the problem or fix the quote-unquote problem well clearly the vision and the strategy is to make progress um and to start on that progress and you know the the the the very real um experience that you know we see in um you know interior wildland fire programs across the land man i mean the the those effects and that consequence are very real this trajectory that we're on with impacts catastrophic intense wildfire and um and we have that and you know that that's and you know that's due to climate change i know that the impacts on the ground that we're experiencing are very real so let me enter into the record here if i may here's the forest service timber harvested data from the early 1900s to 2014 very easy to see the peak that we had back in about 1990 and it's if i may enter that thank you very much mr chairman um what if it's as a result of lack of harvest the lack of management the point our ranking member has been making consistently that it's a lack of management that is causing this problem more than anything else i think this is a terrific document that we should all look at very closely because maybe that is where our problem is i would just also add living near lake superior we were told and i see extensive weather data due to a job i had previously coming to here and from 2004 to 2011 lake superior was at a very low level historic low levels and we were told it was climate change well lake superior now is back at historic high levels as a result of the extreme precipitation or high precipitation we've had in the last 10 years and we're being told it's climate change that is causing that and for a lot of people you just go um [Music] is there anything that climate change can't change can't do um miss hall rivera you s i think you use the term historic investment in your testimony i think it said significant down payment so you're going to come back looking for more money is that right well congressman uh thank you for that question you know um i think we have to be realistic about what this problem is costing us as a nation and you made an important point we have to do increased management and we need to use all the tools for doing that that includes timber harvest and that includes hazardous fuels treatment and um these are not inexpensive um endeavors you know it's expensive to treat fuels it's expensive how much do that work how many jobs have we lost since 1988 as a result of the lack of harvest on the national forest well i don't have that figure in in front of me congressman but i can tell you that uh we've shifted um probably we've lost 40 percent of our non-fire workforce in the forest service and so we're having that challenge just within the forest service we've lost a lot of our capacity and our expertise in timber harvest when are we going to reach the asq well i i know we do meet allowable sale quantities on some of our forests but we don't need it on all of them so we have more work to do um how are we going to accomplish this without litigation reform well you know what uh we are appreciative of the reforms that we have received and including the fuel break ce that we talked about earlier and you know we're open to working with all of you on additional tools that can help us increase our fuels treatment appreciate your answers uh mr sherman i just submit to you um we've got a huge litigation problem here um i understand that there's um multi-million dollar organizations across the country that do nothing but file lawsuits and uh they've created a real problem and a lot of that problem you see right in this chart that we entered into the record and but i think we should also look at the number of jobs that we've lost the number of businesses that we've lost um in america especially in the west as a result of shutting down harvest on our national forest we will not correct the problem that we have here without having active management and getting litigation reform if we don't reform nepa um it is not going to happen we will be here 10 years from now talking about the same thing thank you so much for attending today and i yield back mr chairman

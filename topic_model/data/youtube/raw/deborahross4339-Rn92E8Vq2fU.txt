mr chairman thank you very much uh miss ross uh thank you mr chairman and i just wanna thank um representative lofgren for all of her work on both of these bills um in north carolina the success of the research triangle park which is the area that i represent is largely due to the work of um foreign companies coming to north carolina bringing their industry bringing their employees and um and then of course the agricultural success that we have in north carolina is largely due to a lot of work from immigrants and both of these bills will make an enormous positive difference to people who have been literally the backbone of much of the economy in north carolina and people have been begging for these bills so i want to thank you i want to just ask one question um we have a lot of highly skilled workers in my district who bring their children here legally and then those children age out at age 21 and so they're not necessarily in the full dreamer category but could you tell us how this um how the hr 6 deals with those um those children who come with uh parents on visas yes um yes that is the one significant uh policy change that has been made uh to this year's uh dream act uh the 2021 dream act allows the sons and daughters of non-immigrants admitted under the e1 e2 h1b and l1 temporary work visa program to be eligible for conditional status those categories are treaty traders treaty investors h1bs are people skilled in specialty occupations and l1 visas are employees of multinational companies you're right you can have uh and we had a bill last congress that passed overwhelmingly in the house and got stalled in the senate the h-1b program uh is for highly skilled individuals uh you have to do a test of the labor market to make sure there's no american available to do the job that's being offered and then the person is eligible for an h-1b visa and their dependents are eligible for h4 status i'm just using this as an example well then we do something that really doesn't make any sense at all there's a certain number of employment-based visas uh allocated under the law but we divide them up by country and so you have the country of iceland which has a population of 350 000 roughly and the population of india which has a population of 1.2 billion roughly and they have the same number of visas allocated to them and so you end up with these big delays when when applications are made for legal permanent residence which again requires a pretty rigorous uh labor test so that you can prove there's no one here to take this job and you end up with people from larger countries in these huge delays waiting for their visa number to come up even though they've already been approved for a visa it's taking so long that in some cases their children who've grown up here uh reach age 21 and they're in a very serious uh problem area because they're no longer eligible for their dependent status they're required to go home to india but their parents are legally in the united states so there's no one to go back to in india they can't necessarily get a student visa because student visas require that you show an intent to return to the country of your birth which they can't show because they've grown up in america and even if they were able to meet that criteria they have to pay foreign student tuition so it's really a mess and it's certainly not the fault of these young people who just like the dreamers were brought here as children went to school did their best got you know a's and worked hard and now they're out of luck so we're treating those kids the same as the dreamers they can go ahead and get on their path to legal status well um i want to just thank you for including them i want you to know that i've heard from dozens if not hundreds of them and their families in my district their families are really huge huge contributors to our community and um just another reason why we need to get this bill passed get it to the senate and have it be law thank you mr chairman and i yield that thank you there

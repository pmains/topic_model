now a few years back the grocery chain Krogers fired two former Christian employees in Arkansas after they refused to wear logos representing the rainbow gay pride flag Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton didn't forget about that when Kroger's CEO came in front of the Judiciary Committee begging Republicans to just instantaneously support their latest merger they expect Republicans who are traditionally more supportive of free enterprise to come to their defense and I've cautioned them for years that if they silence uh conservatives and Center rights uh voters across the country if they discriminate against them in their company they probably shouldn't come and ask Republican Senators to carry the water for them whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers I'm sorry that's happening to you best of luck joining us now is Senator Tom Cotton Senator this is a lot bigger than just about one merger and one grocery chain is it not I mean this the trans agenda and the corporate you know woke agenda is infiltrating every aspect of corporate life through ESG and other liberal initiatives yeah Laura very much so a lot of these large publicly traded corporations have in effect become an arm of the democratic party in this case you had Kroger that didn't just discriminate against two bible-believing Christians in Arkansas firing them for refusing to wear what they perceived as a gay pride symbol um and being sued by the Trump equal employment opportunity commission and settling it you also had them uh forcing their employees to go through things like critical race Theory training or gender ideology Based training you've seen this in Georgia where Brian Kemp stood up to Delta and Coca-Cola for falsely uh defaming the law that they passed last year that made it easier to vote but harder to cheat as we just saw in the big turnout Ron DeSantis standing up to Disney World corporations for a long time have come to Republican politicians and expected us to stand up for them since we are traditionally more friendly towards the free enterprise system to stay the least than Democrats but when they do things like silence our voters the way big Tech does or in this case at Kroger discriminate against star voters they need to think twice because I certainly am not going to do and I've been warning them for years privately and I just finally said it publicly that when you come here and you expect us to defend you after you attack our voters my position is going to be I'm so sorry that's happening to you I wish you all the best well I think it's not even a it's not even an open question at all that big business is now aligned almost 100 percent with Democrats and every single social issue I mean almost every single one it's certainly on climate change but Senator I also want to get into what's happening with this Tick Tock issue because a number of states across the country are going after tick tock on security grounds we got Indiana's AG just sued them for exposing minors to sexual content but the White House is apparently considering some type of agreeing to some type of concessions National Security concessions supposedly made by the parent company watch Maryland and South Dakota became the latest two states to ban tick tock on state devices is the federal government is the president considering doing something here so um I'm not going to comment on a tick tock while a Sophia's the committee on foreign investment in in the United States uh review is ongoing the Biden Administration is focused on challenge of certain of certain countries including China yeah well Tic Tac told Fox Business that they're confident that they're on a path to fully satisfy all reasonable underlying reasonable U.S national security concern senator why should Tick Tock be present in the United States at all in any way shape or form given what we know about bite dance and the CCP shouldn't be present in the United States Laura there's a lot of things that you just point out there that are bad about Tick Tock the way they expose minors to Violent depraved degrading sexual material or young girls to uh videos about body image issues stuff that they would never let Chinese teenagers see or the risk to your data security and your privacy but if you take a step back and look at the bigger picture why in the world would rely allow a chinese-owned company which has to answer to the Chinese Communist to be one of the largest media Platforms in our country would we ever have allowed Soviet Russia to own a major newspaper or a major broadcast network during the Cold War of course we wouldn't have and it's very disappointing that my Administration is sending signals that they might tolerate tick tock's presence here in the United States despite the grave threat it poses to all Americans Senator are you confident that Mr McConnell's going to beg off for this Omnibus spending bill it sounds like that's the direction we're going I mean he's made the point publicly that the Democrats have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on their domestic priorities over the last two years it would be a Folly for Republicans to agree to spend even more on those Democratic domestic priorities just as the ransom to get the money that our troops need if the Democrats continue to insist on that I see a short-term spending bill into the new year when the new house Republican majority can provide us some fire Support over in the Senate and we can get a better Bill a better deal for what the American people voted for Senator thank you

all right so the autocrac cannot be appeased they must be opposed Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia never so that's the big speech the big line President Biden striking that defiant tone during that speech in Warsaw yesterday right around this time in fact rallying the West to Stand Fast against Putin and the assault on Ukraine we're entering year number two for that war at the end of this week Senator Roger wicker out of Mississippi the top Republican Senate armed services committee sir thank you for your time we got a lot to get to uh in the next couple of minutes so here we go Wall Street Journal China Russia and the U.S red line on Ukraine here's the key paragraph President Biden's visit the cave on Monday was an important symbolic display of American support for Ukraine and credit to him for traveling into a war zone but the bigger Ukraine news in recent days may be the public alarms coming from U.S officials that China could soon provide Russia with military aid if that's the headline that comes away from this the great powers of this world have now taken sides what do you think senator well Bill thanks for having me on and I absolutely agree with that paragraph on the Wall Street Journal and frankly from from the their entire editorial today I think the the best way to keep China at Bay is for Ukraine uh and our NATO allies who are helping them to actually win this and and uh so while I appreciate what the president said yesterday and and uh again today with the other European leaders I I wish he would match that with action and and Supply more of what we know we're going to have to give them to win uh immediately rather than than parcel it out and um and we need to avoid the foot dragging that we've had for the last year the rhetoric is great uh diplomacy start uh stops at the water's edge and we ought to all applaud the president for for uh supporting Ukraine and The Bravery of zelinski but but he needs to match that with action some seems to have changed in the mind of President XI of China and I don't exactly know what it is I'd put this question to you he had been keeping Putin at an arm's length distance for quite a while I remember Putin said he thought that they were best friends and it turned out actually China wasn't so enamored and wasn't going to fully support and that they were actually wrestling and aghast at the attacks on civilians and then now they're there today his foreign minister the Chinese foreign minister in Russia talking to Putin and they're apparently working out some sort of summit between Putin and XI what has changed in the Chinese president's mind to make him think that this is a good move now I I don't know that anything has changed here's what we need to remember both Putin and she are are dictators and they're expansionists and um the the desire of President XI to take over Taiwan and other areas in the Western Pacific has not changed um I think the best way to stop him is for Putin to lose his war of aggression in Ukraine and and that is absolutely possible this year if if we give them and the the West joins in with giving them the weaponry and the missiles and the air power that they need so uh to me um he's still um wanting to to play footsie with uh with Putin but um if Putin loses she is much less likely to make an aggressive mistake in the Western Pacific well can I ask another question about what uh the president's message was uh he talked yesterday about a nuclear power plant being built on behalf of Westinghouse an American company out of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to be built in Poland I did did that come as a surprise to you and if so where's that talk in this country it's something that we had not been briefed on I had not heard anything about that and and of course we certainly realized that that one of Putin's tactics is and one of his strategies is to deprive the Ukrainian people of power and and light and heat during the remainder of this very cold winter so we we ought to be helping them um to stay alive and stay warm uh of course a better way to do it would have been American liquefied natural gas which we have plenty of and which we're able to give them but the the main thing is that they need the weapons to fight as aggressively as they're willing to fight without any American troops and um and and frankly Bill we there's been a three-week offensive on the part of the Russians and they have gained very few meters and taken huge uh losses their casualties are almost 100 percent fatality and and Russia's offensive this late winter has failed Ukraine is in a position now we give them what they need uh to win and I think uh that'll do a lot to to give us some support in Congress and an American public opinion that indeed our money is well spent and being matched by the NATO allies that is being questioned Roger wicker thank you Senator thank you trench warfare in southeast Ukraine as you well point out thank you senator for your time thank you

thank you madam speaker i rise to yield one minute to the our democratic leader the gentlelady from san francisco without whom there would not be an affordable health care act and we greatly appreciate her efforts minority leader is recognized for one minute thank you madam speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding madam speaker more than two years ago we put forth a vision for america's middle class to ensure health care would be a right not a privilege for a few but a right for all americans today and yesterday the past two days as they have done more than 30 times in this congress republicans are set to take away that right over the past two days we have heard the talking points of the health insurance industry they're trying to drown out the facts and the facts are these what is the takeaway from this debate the takeaway is that the protections house republicans are voting to take away from america's families today up to 17 million children have the right to health care coverage even if they have diabetes asthma leukemia or any other pre-existing milk condition put an x next to that republicans want to take away protections for children with pre-existing conditions today all young adults have the right to get insurance on their parents platform on their parents uh policy republicans want to take away the uh that right from america's students and young people where do we have that coverage for young adults put an x next to that today 5.3 million seniors have saved 3.7 billion dollars on their prescription drugs republicans want to take away prescription drug savings for seniors today small business owners have used tax credits to help them afford insurance for already for two million additional people and and the bill is not fully in effect republicans want to take away the tax credits for uh businesses uh to uh help their entrepreneurship and job creation today nearly 13 million americans are set to benefit from 1.1 billion dollars in rebates from health insurance companies republicans want to take away those cost savings from america's families today american women have free coverage they have a right to free coverage for life-saving preventive care like mammograms starting in august when will gain free access to a full package of preventive services no longer will it being a woman be a pre-existing medical condition but republicans want to take away those protections for women and all americans many across the country have heard republicans colleagues claim that very few people are affected by the pre-existing mission provisions of the law the fact is the republicans are wrong the fact is you be the judge 138 million americans have a pre-existing medical condition i asked our friends on the other side of the law aisle do any people you know anybody with breast cancer with prostate cancer with asthma with diabetes the list goes on and on people with disabilities with this bill that you have on the floor today you will take away their right to affordable coverage and that's why the american cancer society opposes this repeal effort on behalf of 13 and they're quote 13 million cancer patients and survivors who need access to adequate and affordable coverage that's why they oppose this repeal effort the american cancer society do you really know the millions of people living with a disability with this bill you take away people with disabilities right to quality affordable care that's why easter seals wrote that quote millions of parents of children with disabilities are breathing a huge sigh of relief knowing their children will not be dropped from their insurance do you know any parents of children with diabetes or asthma or childhood leukemia do you know any with this bill you will take away the right of these children to affordable care throughout their lives that's why the american diabetes association on behalf of the nearly 26 million americans with diabetes urged us to oppose this bill to quote protect people with diabetes who for too long have been discriminated against because of their disease my republican colleagues are taking away patient protections for millions of americans protections you as a member of congress already enjoy i think that that's an undermining of fundamental fairness you repeal this bill which means you keep your federal health insurance benefits while you take these patient protections away from the american people what a valentine to the health insurance industry when i think of people protected by this law i always remember the powerful testimonial at a hearing last year from stacy ritter whose twin daughters hannah and madeline are both cancer survivors at four years old died they're twins at four years old both were diagnosed with leukemia hannah and madeline face stem cell transplants chemotherapy transplants chemotherapy and total body irradiation yet over time stacy said we ended up bankrupt even with full insurance coverage today hannah and madeline are happy healthy 13 year olds and according to stacy quote my children now have protections from insurance discrimination based on their pre-existing cancer condition they will never have to fear the recision of their insurance policy if they get sick they can look forward to a lower health insurance cost and preventative care we pass the affordable care act for people like stacy hanna and madeline we passed it for some of the people we heard from from today at an earlier meeting and madame speaker asked unanimous consent to submit their statements for the record thank you i urge my colleagues to think about them and to think about stacy and her children when they cast a vote to take away their rights and protection here's what the affordable care act is about strengthening the middle class honoring the entrepreneurial spirit of our country putting medical decisions in the hands of patients and their doctors this is about addiction prevention wellness it's about the good health of america as well as good health care for america it's about restoring and reigniting the american dream and living up to the vows of our founders of life liberty and pursuit of happiness a healthier life the liberty and freedom to pursue happiness as defined by your own passion your own talent your own skills your own aspirations if you want to start a business if you want to be self-employed if you want to change jobs you are not job locked because your decision about your job your career and your life has to be predicated by your health insurance company that's what this freedom is in this one week from the fourth of july that we celebrate with this bill with this affordable act now to make the american dream a reality for all republicans must stop this effort to take away patient protections from americans let's review them again gop taking away from americans this is the takeaway from this debate take away the republicans say protections for children with pre-existing conditions take away prescription drug savings for seniors take away coverage for young adults take away preventive health services for women take away the no lifetime limits so important to so many families in our country we must work together on america's top priorities job creation and economic growth this bill creates four million jobs it reduces the deficit it enables our society to have the vitality of everyone rising to their aspirations without being job blocked as i said american people want us to create jobs that's what we should be using this time on the floor for not on this youth bill to nowhere built to nowhere that does serious damage to the health and economic well-being of america's families i urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill and let us move forward together to strengthen the economy and to strengthen the great middle class which is the backbone of our democracy with that madam speaker i yield back the balance of my time

welcome back real investment in real infrastructure helps american families it makes workers more productive which means their earnings rise but the monstrosity biden's handlers sent him out to announce this week was not an infrastructure plan it was an infra cover for a corrupt payoff to democrat union donors less than six percent would be spent on roads and bridges the whole thing's a con and here to help us sort it out is south carolina congresswoman nancy mace who's on the house transportation and infrastructure committee um you really care about infrastructure we've talked about that before what do you make of this well i think the biden administration should rename the package as the green new deal because almost half the money being spent in this monstrosity as you clearly defined it could be spent on green neal deal type of wasteful spending and you have the left defining redefining child care as infrastructure social justice as infrastructure care giving as infrastructure the majority the vast majority of the bill 70 of the bill has absolutely nothing to do with what we would call transportation and infrastructure and i don't know how you sell this to the american people with a straight face steve and so what do you think is going to happen in congress you hear them talking about oh we're hoping it'll be a bipartisan bill i mean you're going to be right there um uh you know dealing with it what what do you think is going to happen what are you what's going to be your strategy on this well they said the same thing when we had the last round of the coveted stimulus package they said it would be bipartisan there would be unity and there wasn't any they did it through a budget reconciliation process we're hearing that could happen with this package we're not sure yet we've got to do everything we can to fight the wasteful spending this is not an infrastructure package this is not bipartisan and so far this year in the biden administration they're talking about seven trillion dollars in new spending when you add all of this up in the spinning we've done so far in the in this infrastructure package and so i don't know how you how you do this and in the meantime to to afford this package they want to present the largest tax hike in american history in the middle of a pandemic i don't see how we can move forward with this at all and just finally on infrastructure what would you like to see if you had a free hand in terms of let's say you could write an infrastructure bill what would you have in it i would certainly invest more in our roads and bridges it should be more than five percent of the package there's just one percent that's going to airports alone less than one percent is going to ports and inland waterways i mean we we have we have so much to recover from from the pandemic businesses are suffering we have supply chain issues we have issues with our ports and the supply chain i mean this is we should be investing in infrastructure across the board we shouldn't see investment for instance there's 175 billion in electric vehicles being invested here i would love to own an electric vehicle i have friends that own them but uh you know you just can't that kind of investment should be done in the private sector and then meanwhile they're going to spend 200 billion to make our power grid greener the power grid they just overloaded with electric vehicles i just you know i just i don't understand it it's not logical it doesn't make any sense

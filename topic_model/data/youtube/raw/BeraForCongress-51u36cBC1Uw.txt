I'm a single mom with pre-existing conditions having healthcare means I can take care of my son it hurts me to see politicians trying to take health care away from people like me dr. Ami Bera is fighting to protect my healthcare I am so grateful there are so many others like me who need medical care and I trust dr. Berra to look out for us [Music]

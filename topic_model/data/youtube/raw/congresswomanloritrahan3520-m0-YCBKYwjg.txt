Thank You mr. chairman and thank you for referring to me as doctor even though it was maybe my mistake I'm grateful for the panel and grateful for dr. and Mrs Hayes testimony dr. Schar you were kind enough to join me for a couple of tele-town halls in the past few months and you were sounding the alarm throughout in terms of our preparedness for and maintaining a state of readiness after we get through this first wave but I want to ask about something different just because it's been touched upon a bit but as you all know there's been a fair amount of misinformation around kovat 19 some silk still claim it's no worse than a seasonal flu which we all know that's far from the truth our president was prescribing hydroxychloroquine despite the fact that it wasn't meant for use against cope at 19 and back at our last teller town hall several weeks ago you gave another good example you said every day we hear from the president that we have enough tests so we don't have enough tests so I worry that the sum total of misinformation as well as the diminished trust in public institutions from the White House right on down it's harming our ability to effectively communicate the urgency of following proper health and safety protocols and this misinformation may make it especially challenging for contact tracers may be complete strangers to those from whom they are soliciting information what can we do to combat this misinformation and increase our odds of ensuring the level of compliance necessary to beat cope in 19 both this current wave as well as the next if and when it comes so congressman Trainor thank you and then thank you for having me on your telethon halls which as you know I very much enjoyed um this is a huge problem look the pandemic is hard enough right the worst pandemic in a century combating it is hard enough throw in combating that on top of all the misinformation is making it extremely difficult when as you said we continue to have people downplay it we continue to have people say that we have more than enough testing more than enough capacity to deal with this and yet the evidence is clear hundred and seven thousand Americans have died as of this morning we do not have this under control so what would I like to hear I would like to hear from our nation's scientists we had before this outbreak the world's leading Public Health Agency I want to hear from the top scientists at the CDC I would like to get a daily briefing from them about the state of the virus the number of infections and how our country is doing we have not heard from the scientists at the CDC now thankfully we have heard from dr. Fauci and dr. Burks there is nobody more respected than dr. Falchi I would be delighted to get a daily briefing from dr. fountain but we need to get the science and evidence and data from the scientists we need them in our public sphere and we need I believe we need Congress's demand from the CDC and from the White House that scientists speak about the state of the virus and how it is that we're going to get our way through this very very difficult time

thank you mr chairman and my question is for miss daniel davis here we are again talking about a five-year plan at least sell within the gulf of mexico i've never seen such slow walking in my life to the detriment of my home state of mississippi referring again a report prepared during the obama administration and i know you served under the obama administration looked at greenhouse emissions from offshore operations under various leasing scenarios under the no leasing scenario the report concluded that net greenhouse gas emissions would actually increase as the country would simply turn to imported oil produced in areas with less environmental controls to meet oil demand ms daniel davis what are your views on pausing lease sales and slowing permitting given that this actually hurts the administration's goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by forcing the nation to turn away from cleaner u.s produced oil thank you senator and i i want to you know reiterate that that leasing is ongoing uh onshore and offshore of course the the the court ruling on lisa 157 has been referenced here um and as as far as permitting um that too has been ongoing onshore so what is your your answer and can you tell me about forcing the nation to turn away cleaner oil that is produced uh what are your views on that so i think i'm um sort of thinking about the role that i have at the department and my awareness around uh you know onshore and offshore production and that it has continued and you know stayed at a level that is historic which means the revenues coming off royalties have been produced people have kept working uh and in fact i think there's been an uptick in activity as as we're coming out of the pandemic so that's really my orientation is is sort of thinking about the role i have at the department and the work that i'm doing with the bureaus on you know moving forward with the oil and gas leasing program so you think that it is appropriate and that you're going in the right direction there that is your opinion well i do feel that we're moving forward with the leasing program onshore and offshore and that you know again production has continued permitting has continued there are over 9000 permits available on the onshore public lands that could be utilized and we've witnessed the byte administration pleading with russia and opec for oil and natural gas instead of increasing domestic supply and we continue to dig ourselves into a huge hole by tapping into the strategic petroleum reserve we know the oil and gas natural gas will be part of the u.s energy portfolio for decades to come so why is the administration so determined on constricting domestic production and forcing us to rely on adversaries for our emergency stockpile please make that make sense to me so the the secretary holland i know when she appeared before the committee certainly um you know confirmed what you said that oil and gas will be a part of america's energy signature for a while as we move toward a more clean energy economy and um i i just with sort of production ongoing and so many um permits available to drill onshore and and offshore uh production where we have uh leasing areas of up to 70 available that aren't being produced right now i i feel like we're in a a position where there is a lot of um you know sort of production activity that can continue and will doi timely fulfill its statutory obligation to have a new five-year program in place in a timely manner so there is no gap between the existing plan and the commencement of a new one so boehm is absolutely working forward on the next five-year plan as you know i think probably better than anyone oxla is a very uh prescriptive law and they are following the process carefully um so that we get some good outcomes do you have any idea of when we can expect it to be finalized so again um you know boehm is working carefully on the required analysis we were in the position when we came in of uh i think you're probably where the previous administration had put forward a plan it included a number of sensitive leasing areas proposed you know pacific atlantic florida and then they had not really taken any action for about three years so there is a lot for boehm to sift through and we uh of course have overlay of um you know litigation and rulings which actually also inform the analysis and look in that they're doing so i don't have a timeline for you here today but they are absolutely working forward on it but i mean six months 12 months 18 months no idea so i again this sort of falls into the um the deliberative posture with regard to the department and the the secretary's authorities and decision making and i'm just not in a position to get ahead of decisions that she would be making with regard to this program okay i think i'm out of time now thank you mr chairman

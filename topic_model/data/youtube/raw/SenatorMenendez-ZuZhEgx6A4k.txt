one it's great to be here with you back in elizabeth i thank the madam administrator for uh hosting us on behalf of the mayor who would have loved to have been here but i understand the challenges that mayors have having been one myself so i appreciate it but we have three distinguished members of the elizabeth city council and i'd like to ask them to stand up and take a bow thank you all for joining us today councilman waldman and christie councilman glover thank you all and we are also joined by someone who's very important because he still has to cast a vote for what we want to talk about today and he will get that chance later this week uh but that is our incredible congressman who's going to retire uh at the end of this year but is doing fantastic work and writing the final glorious chapters of his time in congress congressman albio series thank you congressman very much and we appreciate uh our state senator joe crying is with us thank you senator crying and mayor turner of elizabeth who works with congressman series thank you for being here as well mayor uh did they stamp your visa did they like [Applause] i want to thank the director of the center and most importantly to all of you for allowing us to come and visit with you today thank you so much we're here because sometimes we use the word historic and sometimes that word is overused but the bill that we passed in the senate on sunday and that the congressman is going to vote on this week we will then be sent to the president for his signature is historic and i will explain to you why it's a game changer has critical investments in our nation our state and in our communities as the name suggests the inflation reduction act it will help reduce inflation which is squeezing so many hard-working families in our state and in our country but beyond this critical help the law is the most significant federal action in history to bring down the cost of prescription drugs and to deal with the challenges of climate change in our country that's why we're here and that's why we're so proud to share with you what this means for our state now the benefits of this law are revealed in the numbers more than 1.6 million seniors on medicare and that includes me i have well past the magic threshold um in new jersey we'll see really don't laugh too hard congressman you're not too far off so uh uh it's all good it's all good that we can be in our golden years and still working hard more than 1.6 million seniors on medicare in new jersey will see relief at the pharmacy and their doctor's offices due to lower drug prices and thanks to a provision that i authored and led on and is included in the law no one no senior on medicare will ever have to pay more than maximum and now i've taught the seniors who have had thousands and thousands of dollars in prescription drug costs that will be capped now totally at two thousand dollars per year out of pocket medical expenses and to the extent that they do have to pay i'm proud that my smoothing provision will give them flexibility to help pay the expenses over a period of time so instead of getting hit with it all at once to the extent that there's that cap and you still have to pay something you can pay it over a period of time and something senator booker and i work so hard hard on for diabetic patients on medicare the price of insulin will be capped at 35 a month it's well over a hundred dollars a month for insulin it will be capped permanently at 35 dollars a month imagine that 35 a month instead of hundreds of dollars you're spending now and on top of all of this that we focus on seniors more than a quarter of a million residents in new jersey will continue to afford care through an extension of the affordable care tax credits you know when we passed the american recovery act we extended and enhanced the tax credits for people who buy health insurance under the affordable care act well that saved the average new jersey family six thousand five hundred dollars a year and now that has been made for the next three years a continuing extension was supposed to expire that will continue for the next three years that they'll save that six thousand five hundred dollars per year on average and then there's a few other things here we make the most significant investment in climate and energy spending where we seek to bring down emissions by 40 percent by 2030. that's only eight years away from now 40 by 2030 that means we all get to breathe cleaner air we all get to begin to deal with the challenges of climate change that creating these heat waves and creating challenges for people with respiratory illnesses to breathe it means that we will work towards stopping those northeasters that are coming the flooding in kentucky the wildfires in the west that's all a result of climate change and so we will actually do something about as seniors bequeathing to the next generation of new jerseyans and americans a planet that they can ultimately enjoy and then if you're in the possibility for a new car but you've been holding back because you really would like to buy an electric vehicle so you don't have to depend on gas anymore this law extends and expands the current tax credit for seven thousand five hundred dollars for a new electric vehicle you have to buy a car and you buy an electric one you get up to seventy five hundred dollars for that electric vehicle that's a big down payment on buying a new car it also ensures that we have 30 billion dollars nationwide in production tax credits to accelerate u.s manufacturing of solar panels wind turbines batteries critical materials that creates a domestic clean energy economy and so our friends in labor because we put provisions in here to make sure that there are that men and women who work in organized labor are going to be able to advantage themselves of these jobs new jobs that create clean energy at the end of the day it's also going to have nine billion dollars in consumer home energy rebates that will be available to extend energy efficiency tax credits uh that can help someone in their home make it more energy efficient so in the winter there's less energy costs to spend heating and in the summer there's less energy costs to cool your home and the other thing it does and as i sit here stand here and see uh the port area here which so many of our residents in elizabeth and newark and other parts live in it has three billion dollars in environmental justice block grants three billion dollars in neighborhood access and equity grants three billion dollars to reduce air pollution at our ports among other things that means we finally can breathe cleaner air instead of having all the trucks polluted and the last thing it's not the last thing the last thing i'll mention 20 billion dollars to support climate smart agricultural practices well right next door in newark there's this great company called and they actually make some of the greatest fruits and vegetables and they do it indoors vertically instead of using land they actually do great fruits and vegetables vertically indoors that type of company can prosper and grow so these are just all provisions how we in new jersey of course in america but we in new jersey will benefit from this law but it's going to make a difference particularly for seniors you know my mother came to this country in search of freedom [Music] she was a seamstress in the factories of hudson county she worked long hours often pricking her fingers and in the twilight of her life she faced a terrible disease with alzheimer's and she would not have lived with the dignity that she deserved without medicare and her social security check but the cost of prescription drugs for her was enormous and my sister and i had to help her and we proudly did so mom could live with the dignity and the twilight of her life but now because of this law no senior has to choose between between putting food on the table keeping their home and having access to life saving enhancing drugs and that's what a great nation does to help those who live with dignity in the climate of their life so i can tell you someone who's worked in the halls of congress at the end of this year for 30 years there are moments that you really remember in the work that you do this is one of those moments so many of its provisions beyond the drug pricing and health care savings have long been democratic priorities that we've been trying to get you know cleaner air lower costs for new jersey families a brighter future for our children and grandchildren it's an enormous victory for our planet as well and so i just want to say this was not easy we had a lot of torturous twists and turns senator booker and i spent nearly 24 hours with some of us when we were younger we call an all-nighter although in those days it was a lot more fun than what we did this time but we had nearly 14 hours of republican amendments and i say that because you know they were 98 99 of all the amendments offered were republican amendments to do what to stop all the things i just talked about to stop the prescription drug lower cost to stop the investments in energy to stop as a matter of fact democrats had in the law not only if you were under medicare that there would be an insulin cap but if you're not in medicare and you're a diabetic and have insulin costs we were looking to cap it in the private insurance market too unfortunately republicans went to the parliamentarian the person who basically decides balls and strikes and rules what's in and out and knock that provision out otherwise everybody in our country whether they're on medicare or not would have had that limited cap that shows you the difference between who's standing with you and who's fighting for you at the end of the day so i will say that we are proud of this moment we are proud to be able when we say we are fighting for you in washington the proof is in the pudding and this is the proof with that let me introduce my colleague a tremendous champion that made so many of these provisions possible senator corybook

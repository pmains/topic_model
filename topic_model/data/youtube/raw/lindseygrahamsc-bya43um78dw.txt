in tonight some Republicans centers coin for a joint select committee to further investigate Benghazi Senator Lindsey Graham is one of those he joins us so now before we get to a joint committee a joint select committee I'm curious did you see the president's press conference saying which he was asked about Benghazi and were you satisfied with his answers it was disgusting I can't believe it I guess you didn't like them then well no I mean spend me once shame on you spend me twice shame on me does the president the United States really believe the American people to run by the story he told today that he called Benghazi a terrorist attack from the get-go his administration for weeks after the attack tried to convince the American people there was no al Qaeda involvement this was a spontaneous riot caused by hateful video generated in the United States and there no there was no pre planned terrorist attack we're not stupid in America and we're going to keep pushing why do you think they happen we've got the 12 revisions that were another news organization ABC kitchen wit that's the first and then you have the what he said today is that he called it terrorism a week you know we've all got the record on September 12th when he said to Steve cross six days later Letterman two days after that Univision and then we have one more at four days later to the view the next day he's going for the UN we got the whole why does he keep saying cuz it worked seven weeks before the election he was able to basically intimidate the romney campaign the mainstream media thank god for fox and CBS and a few other outlets basically have allowed eight months to go bye go bye and where he gets away with it he's got the new york times who's talking about it Maureen Dowd too scared of a little blood yesterday why because people like us had been pushing whoa okay Greg Hicks came forward alright well those who over all those news organization could take the bow for whatever they did or didn't do but now we're at a point was also the whistleblowers okay all right we're now at that point so why is the right what I don't get is why the president is still taking the position today he believes that he can keep denying the obvious and it will work well it's caught up with him the fact of the matter is this administration manipulated the evidence that was abundant about a terrorist attack if you put in one column all the evidence of a pre-planned terrorist attack involving al-qaeda in the evidence that says this was a spontaneous event caused by video it's not even close there's really no evidence to suggest what Susan Rice said and the President himself said it for two weeks this is seven weeks before an election they did not want to destroy the narrative at bin Laden's dead we're all safer well now we are eight months later we've got the 12 we've got ABC with the with the email saying 12 revisions we've got the other record and now you want you've been asking for a select committee Select Committee you've been asking for it do you have any sense that the leadership which is you have a Democratic majority in your house and the Senate give any indication Senator Harry Reid to go along with that well no Harry Reid's night it's been so disappointing to see my Democratic colleagues who are all about getting to the bottom of [ __ ] failures you know when a brigade came up I said this is not a few MPs this is system failure when people said in the bush administration arax just a few dead Enders things are going well well they weren't we didn't have the right strategy Benghazi is a failed foreign policy strategy I wish and pray and hope that one Democrat would take what happened in Benghazi as seriously as the IRS John Thune deserves a lot of credit he was on this before anybody else about the IRS targeting conservative groups now we have a hearing and everybody's outraged what about four people killed by Al Qaeda back terrorists eight months ago and our government lied about what happened to him what about the death trap that was created called Benghazi consulate what about the seven and a half hours they were being attacked and nobody could come to their aid where is the outrage there the American people deserve answers and our president has been misleading he's been manipulating the evidence and people under him have done the country a great service those in harm's way feel very let down we're not going to stop Carson Mike Rogers says that he has other words yes so da you have other words so absolutely what do those whistleblowers say that's different from what we've heard from great well they're going to I'll let them speak for themselves but i'm tired of whistleblowers it's eight months since the attack and not one survivor has been allowed to come forward on their own without fear of losing their job it is now time for the congress to tell this administration we have an independent duty not the accountability Review Board appointed by Secretary Clinton the Congress has an independent Duty we should call every survivor before the Congress protecting their identity if necessary their identity if necessary to get to the bottom of this I can't believe after eight months the American people have not have not heard from one survivor it's other than a whistleblower Sarah thank you sir thank you

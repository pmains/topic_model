senator michael bennett of colorado is one of the architects of the child tax credit uh and he joins me now senator this has been um one of your central focuses as a us senator um i was gonna say your life's work but that's maybe a little overstating things but but but it's i will say chris i ran a virtually unnoticed campaign for president on the on this idea you know i forgot about that but you didn't know i'm kidding i i i it's true you did you did you did you did run on that no but in all seriousness like you have worked so hard and i know sherrod brown and others have worked with you to have this happen it's been there first of all what's the takeaway just substantively if you're saying okay we ran the experiment we tried it for a year what is your takeaway about its success failures what you think of it it's been one of the most successful domestic policies in generations we've cut childhood poverty almost in half we've reduced hunger by a quarter just think about that for a second we reduced hunger in this country where we have one of the highest childhood poverty rates of any industrialized country we're 38 out of 41 and the poorest people the poorest generation in america are our children and what we've said is this we don't we don't have to accept that as a permanent feature of our democracy our economy and it has worked exactly as we expected it would which is people spending money to pay the rent to buy groceries and really importantly to buy a little extra child care so they can stay at work to support their families i want to read you some reporting about your colleague joe manchin who i think is you know it's pretty clear he's not super on board with this of course he voted for the american rescue plan that piloted this for this year um huffington post reporting that he has told several fellow democrats he thought parents would waste monthly child tax credit payments on drugs instead of providing for their children according to two sources familiar with the senator's comments and i have to say that mindset is not limited to the center i think there's a lot of people who say oh you're just sending checks to everyone what are they going to do with the money i think the anecdotal evidence in colorado is people are spending it as i described it i remember when the first checks went out i met mom after mama across the state who were saying that we were able to buy back to school clothes for our kids without bankrupting our families these are the choices by the way people are having to make when we've had an economy that for 50 years has worked really well for the top 10 and hasn't really worked for anybody else finally we have a tax cut for working people after we've cut taxes for the richest people in this country by to the tune of six trillion dollars i can make all kinds of arguments about that why that's welfare why that's not needed this is a time when kid when when families really need the help and that's why we have to find a way to bridge the gap we can't allow january to come without uh continuing the enhanced child tax credit that's we're going to fight to do well we all know there are no rich people who ever use their money to buy drugs but um on terms of the other thing about that chris the other thing about that chris i've been in the senate now for 12 years i've been there in the chaos at the end of a session when rich people's tax cuts are expiring we never have any trouble extending those and here we find ourselves in this position in fact where thanks to joe biden and the work of sherrod brown and kamalaris and cory booker and others we've actually got a massive tax cut for working people and we're going to say what we want to raise taxes in the middle of this pandemic and double childhood poverty it makes it's completely irrational well so you've got i mean unless the lay of the land is different than i perceive it it's you got one guy to convince and he doesn't seem to be on board well he's not on board and that that guy is my colleague joe mentioned we have a difference of opinion about this but you know no one in the senate has a monopoly on wisdom and i think that it is very clear that in other countries that have a child allowance like the child tax credit the workforce participation rates are actually higher because it's easier for people to stay at work when they've got a benefit like this because they can buy child care if the car breaks down they can get it fixed and all i want to plead with joe manchin about is let's give it a chance to actually work we've only seen it for six months and the early reports are extremely positive let's let it go and and see whether he's right or whether i'm wrong and let's try to come to an agreement on other things that i may not agree with but am willing to vote for in order to pass something for the benefit of the american people which is of course why we were all sent to washington to begin with in theory that is gonna that's gonna be at the top of the priority list in the new year i think something can be worked out here maybe we'll have you back to talk about how that is i remain hopeful that something this good is not going to be destroyed for no reason senator michael bennett have a great holiday sir thank you thanks have a great holiday chris

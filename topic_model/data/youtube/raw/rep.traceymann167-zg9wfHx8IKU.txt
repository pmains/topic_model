uh thank you chairwoman and thank you chairman costa and i recognize johnson for having this important hearing today uh this is crucial to the ag industry um as we know it you know i'm glad that we're doing this subcommittee hearing frankly i'd like to see this be a full committee hearing because i'm hard-pressed to think of any issue facing agriculture in america today that's more important than what we're seeing in in the cattle markets and the importance of the beast industry specifically to american agriculture it's also very important to my district to represent the big first the largest beef producing district in the country our family's farmed and fed cattle for 120 years i grew up in a feet small feed yard preconditioning and doctoring sick calves so this is near and dear to my heart personally as well i'm also a proud k-stater and i'm really glad to see a lot of k-staters here as well uh a lot of concerns about what we've seen over the last 20 months you know my first question uh would really be to uh both dr jacobs and dr lusk you know congress and the usda have allocated hundreds of millions in funding towards additional slaughter capacity to help small and medium meat and poultry processes over the last couple of years obviously a an announcement more recently as well there's currently a shortage of shackle space but as many of you mentioned you know the cattle industry like any business is still subject to the basic economics of supply and demand so my question really is this how do we ensure that taxpayer dollars create the maximum shackle space possible in other words how do we spend these dollars the most efficiently to uh to move the needle so to speak and uh dr lusk and jacobs if you're dr jacobs first and then maybe dr les if you'd weigh in on that i'd appreciate it yeah thank you um you know these these investments i think what my testimony what i would say is that i think these intestine these investments should perhaps think about focusing more on the indirect investment so direct investment in shackle space unless we unless we know for example that that gets these processors these small and medium to a a point where they can be profitable on their own without the support and then without the subsidation i would question that but and that's why i think a study is needed to understand what is the minimum what are the minimum capacity requirements to get these processors get small and medium scale what in other words what is medium scale what gets them to a minimum efficient scale where they can be profitable um apart from subsidiation i am i do support the indirect investments and things like workforce development ensuring we have the right policies in place making sure that the field the playing field is leveled in terms of regulatory burden and regulatory requirements but short of that investments in shackle space are one time it's a one time shot in the arm and i just i would want to make sure that that could be sustainable beyond any investment period great i think anything to add to that um any different perspective dr lusk yeah well first i appreciate the question that think about using taxpayer dollars wisely and efficiently and i would agree with dr jacobs and you know the things that really come to me to mind is is you know what do you do to increase the size of the pie to improve that overall demand so some of it is market access issues you know increase that size of pi by having access to more consumers in different parts of the world or to improve quality and improve what consumers are willing to pay that has a longer run benefit for the entire supply chain the other aspect to i think is innovation productivity improving innovation some that we've talked about the labor issues um that's a way to improve capacity in effective capacity is maybe some automation there but also just efficiency and i think there's you know again beef cattle is in competition with a variety of other foodstuffs and we're in competition with producers all across the world for a place on consumer's dinner plates and so we have to continue to find ways to be more efficient make responsible use of our natural resources well i i agree you know my last question would be for a doctor uh hearn your testimony suggested that there is an exceptionally high likelihood that cow kef producers would receive a lower price for their cattle if government mandates would if the government would mandate certain required percentages of negotiated cash sales could you explain that more and why do you believe that to be the case certainly so i think the first step is is understanding the benefits that that amas bring to the marketplace as i've mentioned both the testimony and the earlier question amas allow packers and cattle feeders to both reduce reduce their supply chain risks better manage inventory better utilize their cattle feeding and cattle processing capacity and reduce their marketing and procurement costs both of those sectors of the beef industry are margin operators so the price that they're willing to pay for the upstream input into their production system is very much determined by what their operating costs are if we increase operating costs at the packer level packers are likely to pay less for fat cattle if we reduce the price of fat cattle and increase the operating costs of feedlots then they are likely to pay less for calves and feeder cattle so i readily admit that price discovery is necessary but we have to recognize that it does have a cost and if we eliminate or reduce the benefits of amas that also has a cost and with cow calf producers being primary producers and not margin operators they have no one else to pass on the burden of that cost yeah great well thank you all i see my time is expired so i yield back thank you

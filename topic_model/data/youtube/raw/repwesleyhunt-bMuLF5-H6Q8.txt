when they look at the numbers and they know that 98 people on the terrorist watch list came in in fiscal year 2022 how do they justify allowing so many people to come in our country without vetting them it's completely Un-American when 911 hit I was a sophomore at West Point and my class is one of the first classes to actually go to Afghanistan and Iraq to Fight Against Terror and what we did was we took a vow to Say Never Again on our watch and now we have a president that's allowing people on the terrorist watch us and by the way those terrorists watch us for a reason and we are allowing them to enter our country indiscriminately and that puts us all at risk it's very frustrating to me because I'm somebody like many of my classmates from West Point that decided to go serve our country to rent the country and rid this threat to our country from terrorists abroad and now we are a lot we are allowing them to simply walk across the border the answer the answer is no and I think Jim Jordan and our committee has a plan on getting this back on track to keeping our country and the American people safe again just so few people like Henry Clay are Democrat who understands the problem I just can't believe what Democrats can't see a place where they could come and join you in this because it's so important uh Congressman Wesley time machine really quickly I'll tell you I was talking to someone from Mexico and they said you know we thank America for this because a lot of these guys are drug dealers a lot of them are taking Fentanyl and they're leaving our country to come to America so we're glad you're cleaning up Mexico I thought haven't thought about that perspective oh my goodness oh of course ma'am look this is this is a great place to be this is the rarest country in the world if there's a reason why people are risking their lives to get here all right Congressman thank you very much for joining us on this Thursday

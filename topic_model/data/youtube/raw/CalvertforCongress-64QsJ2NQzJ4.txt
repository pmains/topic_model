In Joe Biden's America families are facing 
a new crisis every week. Food costs are more   than 10 percent higher than just one year ago.
Gas prices in California are at record highs. Crime rates are surging. Homelessness plagues 
our cities. The southern border is wide open.   An average of one person in Riverside County is 
dying every day from fentanyl. This is Congressman   Ken Calvert and I've had enough. I'm sick of the 
excuses. I'm tired of the lack of accountability.   America's problems have grown worse under 
President Biden's leadership. Our nation is   going in the wrong direction. The only way to 
get back on track is to end Democrat rule in   Washington and that's exactly what you can do 
this November's election. If you care about your   future in our country then you cannot sit 
out this election. I'm asking for your vote   this November. I'm Ken Calvert candidate 
for Congress and I approve this message

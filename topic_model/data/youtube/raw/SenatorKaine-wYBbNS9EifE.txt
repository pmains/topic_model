BUT REPUBLICANS, A MORE IMPORTANTLY SOME CENISIST DEMOCRATS, WILL THEY GO FOR THAT PLAN? JOINING ME NOW, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TIM KAINE. HE IS A MEMBER OF THE ARMED SERVICES AND FOREIGN RETITIONS COMMITTEE. SENATOR CAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING BACK TO THE SUNDAY SHOW. PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS ASKED CONGRESS FOR 3:43 BILLION DOLLARS IN AID TO UKRAINE. TEN BILLION AND SPENDING TO DEAL WITH COVID HERE IN THE U.S.. CAN CONGRESS DELIVER ON THAT? >> JONATHAN, WE HAVE TO. THERE IS ONE OTHER BIG. WHEN WE HAVE A COMPETITIVENESS BILL TO MAKE THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE IN T WORLD, IT HAS BEEN PENDING IN THE SENATE. IT PASSED IN THE HOUSE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. IT IS MY OPINION THAT WE WILL DO COVID AID, UKRAINE WADE, AND THE COMPETITIVENESS BILL. >> REPUBLICANS ARE REPORTEDLY BLOCKING THESE SPENDING BILLS BECAUSE THEY INSIST THERE IS ANOTHER FACTOR. FORCING A CONGRESSIONAL VOTE ON TITLE 42, WHICH ALLOWS BORDER AGENTS TO TURN AWAY MIGRANTS AT THE BORDER USING A HEALTH EMERGENCY OVER COVID. DO YOU SEE AT TO BE A MAIN ISSUE, HERE? >> I THINK, JONATHAN, HERE IS MY PHILOSOPHY. BILLS THAT ARE ON THE SENATE FLOOR, WE SHOULD ALLOW AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AND VOTE THEM UP OR DOWN. SO, YES REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THAT IS PART OF THE COVID BILL, SINCE THE TITLE 40 EMERGENCY REGULATION OTHTHE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WAS JUSTIFIED BY COVID, THEY WANT TO VOTE ON THAT. AND OUR JOB IS TO VOTE. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF A VOTE. WE NEED TO GET TO THE COVID BILL UP ON THE FLOOR. IF THE REPUBLICANS WENT OFF FOR A TITLE 42 MEMO, WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND SEE WHAT'S THE AMENDMENT IS. AND WE SHOULD VOTE. BUT WE SHOULD NOT LET THE THREAT OF A CONTROVERSL AMENDMENTS SLOW OUR PACE DOWN AND GETTING THE BILL DONE. BECAUSE OF WEATHER AND STUFF IS WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. I THINK WE CAN GET TO A COVID BILL, UKRAINE BILL, AND THIS COMPETITIVENESS ACT. WE CAN GET THEM ALL UNDER THE PRESIDENTS DESK BETWEEN NOW AND -- IFIF WE WISH. >> ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IN MIND. PRESIDENT PROPOSED A 33 BILLION DOLLAR SPENDING BILL FOR UKRAINE. ON TOP OF ANOTHER MULTI BILLIO DOLLAR SPENDINBILL FOR UKRAINE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING THAT THIS WAR, RUSSIA'S WAR ON UKRAINE, COULD GO ON FOR YEARS. HOW LONG WILL CONGRESS SUPPORT THESE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR AID PACKAGES FOR UKRAINE, AND HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT SUCH SPENDING? FOUR PRIORITIES THAT DON'T HAVE TO DO WITH THEM HERE AT HOME? >> JONATHAN, I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED IN VIRGINIA. THE ARMED SERVICES INFORMED RELATION RIVERS IN THE STATES, THEY ARE VERY MILITARY HEAVY. AND ALSO ONE OF NINE VIRGINIANS IS WARNING ANOTHER COUNTRY. I HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED BY VIRGINIANS ALL OVER THE STATE  SUPPORTING THE U.S. AND OUR ALLIES TRYING TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT UKRAINE WINS THIS ILLEGAL INVASION THAT RUSSIA CHOSE TO VISIT UPON THEM. AND SO, YOU ARE RIGHT. THE WELL IS NOT UNLIMITED. WEJUST DID ABOUT 14 BILLION DOLLARS, HALF MILITARY AID AND HALF HUMANITARIAN AID, A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. WE HAVE NOT RELEASED IT ALL. WE ARE RELEASING CHUNKS OF IT AS WE GO. WE WILL DO THE SAME WITH THIS NEXT PACKAGE. I THINK WHEN A WAR CRIMINAL ENGAGES IN AN ILLEGAL INVASION, THE WORLD HAS GOT TO STAND UP TO IT. NOT TASTY U.S. BUT OUR ALLIES. ANDTHEY ARE. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO KEEP DOING. NOT JUST FOR RUSSIA'S SAKE. OTHER AUTHORITARIAN'S AROUND THE GLOBE HAVE TO SEE THE DEMOCRACIES WILL UNITE TO DEFEAT WAR CRIMINALS WHO WANT TO WAGE ILLEGAL WARS. >> WE HAVE GOT LESS IN A COUPLE MINUTES LEFT. WE HAVE TO SWITCH GEARS TO VOTING RIGHTS. REDISTRIBUTING FIGHTS THAT HAVE GONE ON ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY. SOME GD FOR DEMOCRATS, SOME NOT SO MUCH. WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON THE FIGHT OVER REDISTRICTING, AND THE FIGHT OVER THE RIGHT TO VOTE? >> ON THE REDISTRICTING, I THINK, JONATHAN, THAT REDISTRICTING HAS BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT STATES. THERE ARE BEEN SOME SUCCESSFUL LAWSUITS AND SOME FAILED LAWSUITS ON BOTH SIDES. I DON'T THINK THAT REDISTRICTING FROM A CONGRESSIONAL STANDPOINT, WILL EVENTUALLY CHANGE THE MAP TOO MUCH. IN PARTICULAR DISTRICTS IT DID, BUT IN TERMS OF LIKELIHOOD OF GAINING CONTROL I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY A WASH. WE WILL SEE IN NOVEMBER. BUT THE VOTING RIGHTS BATTLE IS THE ONE THAT JUST REALLY GRABS ME. WE HAVE NEEDED TO DO VOTING RIGHTS TO REFINE TO JANUARY 6TH THE EFFORTS TO DISADVANTAGES 80 MILLION PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. IF I DEFER TO DO SO. AND WE ALSO NEED TO RESPOND TO EFFORTS IN REPUBLICAN STATES THEY MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO. ALL SEVEN OF MY DEMOCRATIC PARTY COLLGUES, WHO ARE ROBUST VOTING LEGISLATION, WILL NOT SUPPORT SENATE RULES CHANGES TO ACCOMPLISH IT. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE REPUBLICAN VOTES YET. SO WE HAVE TO WIN MORE SEATS OR KEEP TALKING TO REPUBLICANS AND FIND WAYS TO GET THEM TO AGREE, WITH, IF NOT EVERYTHING WE MIGHT, WANT AT LEAST SOME SUBSET OF IT. BUT I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS. I THINK JANUARY 6TH DEMANDED A PROTECTION FOR VOTING RIGHTS. THAT ITHE ONLY ANTIDOTE TO THE KIND OF VIOLENT DISENFRANCHISEMENT EFFORT THAT WE SAW. AND THUS FAR WE HAVE NOT DONE IT. >> WINNING MORE SEATS. THOSE ARE THE THREE KEY WORDS

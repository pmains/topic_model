the problem is you look at these bars on this phone when I go home there are none right there no bars on this phone so we're not even close to talking about 4G or 3G or any G where I live we're not even close if you see the map on the advertisement the Verizon footstep and by the way I think all of them were this way I'm picking on you forever guys did you see that or advertisement listen do you agree with that map I've only had the chance to be in Missoula which had great coverage but I've not been the rest well let me tell you something Missoula and Big Sandy is a hell of a lot different to say that and and and I it's a 75 mile drive for me to Great Falls from my farm and I bet I don't have coverage 25 miles and yet that map's all red you don't talk about that [Music] I know there's plenty of folks out there that say things like why do these guys even live in rural America they didn't they knew they didn't have the coverage when they moved there I've got to tell you I looked at my grandfather's diary from 1915 and you're right he said you know dammit there's no cell coverage out here we got to do better folks it's not working thank you

madam president reserving the right to object um uh i strongly disagree with senator lee's uh proposal amending the um the what has been agreed to not agreed to but what has gotten every single member of the senate but for one i want to also say madam president that i was on the floor about 10 days ago i think on the subject of this and i i want through the chair for the center of utah to know i didn't even mention who had had who had objected while while i was here but it was one out of a hundred senators this bill passed the house of representatives with all but two votes it passed with every single vote from the colorado delegation and we have we have the gamut of people you know in from colorado the bill is strongly supported by of my friend ken buck who i ran against in 2010 and if ken were here he'd say there's very little upon which we agree i hope there's more than he thinks we agree on but we definitely agree on this and so let me just explain madam president why we wrote this bill in five days as the senator from utah has said we're going to mark the 80th anniversary of executive order 9066 which began the forced dispossession internment of over 120 000 japanese americans during world war ii two-thirds of them were citizens of this country american citizens forced out of their homes into camps by our own government by their own one of those camps was a match in the eastern plains on the eastern plains of colorado where the federal government detained nearly 10 000 japanese americans against their will most of them had less than a week madam president most of them had less than a week to get rid of virtually everything they own and crowd onto buses and trains with no idea where they were going or what was going to happen to them some of the first arrivals at amachi were kids younger than the pages that are on the floor here today with us who were forced to build the camp where their own families were interred during the duration of the war the conditions were horrible the walls didn't always reach the ceilings the windows weren't always sealed it meant that snow blew in during the winter dust blew in during the summer this is what our government did to our fellow americans to children forced to work in the fields to grow their own food in the jail that the united states of america had committed them to and what's even more remarkable is that despite this treatment one out of ten of the people at amachi still volunteered to serve during the war a higher rate than any other camp in america think about that they were willing to defend the very government that was detaining them that had locked up their children that's how much they believed in america even when america turned our back on them and i had the opportunity to visit amachi a few years ago with john hopper a high school prisoner a high school principal in grenada who worked with his students to create the imachi preservation society they've been taking care of this site themselves all of these years collecting items from all over the world that former prisoners have sent back because they want people to remember they want a memorial to their captivity and year after year these high school students and their teacher have worked to restore the site so that the next generation of coloradans could learn about what happened if we're up to me madam president every student in colorado and throughout the american west would go there throughout our entire country and learn about the americans of amache the men and women who are held onto hope year after year who supported one another who forged a community behind the barbed wires of this site who never gave up on the united states of america even as it was in turning them on their own soil and after i visited the site i introduced a bill with senator hickenlooper to make amachy part of the national park system so that it would have the resources and recognition it deserves for years to come we have to get this done madam president because the survivors of omachi are growing fewer and fewer in number each year we have to keep the memory of what they went through alive for the next generation that's what colorado wants madam president i have a list of over 70 groups that support it from the asian chamber of commerce to the colorado council of churches to the town of grenada who owns the site today so madam president i asked unanimous consent to enter this list into the record without objection thank you madam president this bill wasn't controversial in colorado and it wasn't controversial in the house where republican congressman ken buck whose district this is took up the bill with joe nagoos a neighboring congressman amachi's in kent's district in prowess county and i said that the bill the bill passed the house 416 i think it was to two and it wasn't controversial in the senate energy and natural resources committee were passed with bipartisan support from the chairman and ranking member and that's why i came here two weeks ago to pass the bill by unanimous consent consent but now there's there's been an objection and i should mention by the way that this site is less than one square mile it is a tiny tiny fraction of even the county that we're in and it seems to me that we shouldn't if we believe in federalism at all we shouldn't be blocking colorado's right to preserve less than one square mile the way we see fit that we shouldn't have to reduce the public lands of the united states by an equal amount and i'll say in that connection madam president that i formally object to the to the senator from utah's motion for this reason the land here is owned by grenada it's already public land the town has said it wants to donate it to the national park service i have a letter from the town making this intention perfectly clear so it's not even private land that's been becoming public it's public land transitioning from a local government to the federal government at the request of the community and they're not asking for anything in return and i think that's an important point that the that the senator from utah has raised and we've worked with the the town to show that they're not asking for an exchange they want to donate the land as their patriotic contribution to america to protect this part of our history and i would think all of us here should agree that unless it's hurting somebody else a town can do whatever it likes with its own land just like a private land owner can do with their own land i also let me stop there madam president see whether the senator from utah has any reaction to that i will formally object to his motion and and i'll stop there and i've got other things to say but i i hope that maybe we can get to an agreement based on what i would offer so i object objection is heard madame president senator from utah yeah a couple points i i i don't think we're far off in where we are on this um it is um it is true that um it's not an expanse of land that is as big as some other land transfers we see one square mile on the one hand a lot of people would regard that as as large 640 acres uh the acreage equivalent of one square mile i would note here this isn't uh i wouldn't call it a federalism argument that we have to allow this there are federal implications to this that extend far beyond what a a local unit of government might want to do is what happens is when you transfer it into the federal estate we do incur additional obligations to make sure that that land is maintained and managed appropriately it does cost money and it it takes an expense off the books of those who would otherwise be maintaining it so it's it's not without any consequence at all and nor is it a matter of simple uh operation of federalism to say that we should allow this in in this circumstance i would note moreover that um we've come closer on this the amendment that i offered a moment ago that my friend and colleague the senator from from colorado objected to is one that would allow this to happen but would require an offset to be made by the appropriate federal land managers within one year of the transfer of this land there's nothing about that that strikes me as particularly unobjectionable particularly given the fact that the federal government owns and manages about 30 percent of the land mass in the united states and in my state and in colorado it's much more than that but um there's nothing about that that should be particularly objectionable that said the senator from colorado has has changed this legislation in a meaningful way and because i've got a desire to honor those victims of this horrific event in american history and the senator from colorado has offered up a separate solution uh one that would involve donation rather than acquisition by the federal government and although that also raises some concerns in that over time i think we've got to watch this because the more we enhance the federal land footprint the more difficult it will be for the federal government to keep up with the maintenance backlog but given that this doesn't directly impact concerns quite the way uh uh the those same concerns might be implicated if we were having to purchase it at the outset um i'd be inclined if if my friend from colorado were interested in offering that amendment uh to withhold any objection from that while noting that it's it's my hope and expectation that moving forward we can be more aware of these issues and that as we see the federal land footprint increasing we can take steps as a body to make sure that uh there's some natural stopping point uh even before we turn to what i i believe we still got to turn to which is the commitment made at statehood uh that still needs to be honored madam president senator from colorado i thank the i thank uh through the chair of the to the um through the present the senator from utah and i think let me start madam president by saying that i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of calendar 255 h.r 2497 further i asked the bennett amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to the committee reported amendments be agreed to the bill is amended to be considered read a third time in past and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table is there objection this is all happening on the fly right now so i'm actually going to withdraw that in the spirit of what senator lee has said hopefully we can do this later today we need to make sure that everybody has the benefit of seeing the language and then we'll be back later to do this so i thank the senator from utah and i will spare him the rest of my speech except i think he deserves to hear this and i think everybody here deserves to hear this which is when the enr committee took up took this legislation up this fall here's what the survivors from amachi wrote to the committee and i just want to put their words into the record before i withdraw during world war ii as their their their words during world war ii we were forced to live as prisoners in our own country along with our parents we were forced from our homes tagged like animals and sent to the desolate prairie of southeast colorado where we lived in trauma a constant presence of armed guards barbed wire and suffering too large to describe in one correspondence our families suffered loss of jobs homes property and businesses and many of us lost family members many of our parents went to their graves without even an apology from their country our nation still has a long way to go to learn from this mistake and our community both old and young continues to suffer from anti-asian hate crimes increasing to this day our national parks and the stories they honor reflect our values as a nation adding amachi to the national park system would allow us to protect a unique story that has largely been forgotten and can only be told through the power of place with each year that passes there are fewer of us we are counting on you to see us through and because of the discussion we've had tonight we're going to have the chance later to be able to do that i thank my friend from utah and i thank the presiding officer i yield the floor

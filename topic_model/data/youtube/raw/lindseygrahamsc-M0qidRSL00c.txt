fire last month when we learned that the Department of Justice had seized phone records belonging to journalists doing their jobs well if that isn't enough new reports this morning revealed the National Security Agency has been secretly collecting the phone records of millions of everyday Americans joining us now Senator Lindsey Graham with his thoughts what do you what do you make of this senator is this a big deal for Americans millions and millions of millions of Americans who phone records were apparently given over to the government should we all be concerned well I think we should be concerned about terrorists trying to infiltrate our country and attack us and trying to coordinate activities from overseas with inside the country under the FISA law you just can't track people's phones calls you got to have a reasonable belief that the people you're monitoring in terms of monitoring conversations are one of the persons is involved in terrorism so you're trying to date a mind and find out you know these numbers that we know are in the hands of bad guys who are their calling and then once you find a match you can you can monitor but you just can't monitor people definitely unusual to you that this administration says that they don't believe in the war on terror yeah it seems a bit unusual the war is over but we're trill still trying to track the enemy yeah the president speech was toned death we're very much under threat radical Islam is is on the rise throughout the region homegrown terrorism is one of my biggest concerns is happening in our own backyard and I'm glad the NSA is trying to find out what terrorists are up to overseas and inside the country well senator I don't know about you but I've got verizon that means the government is too okay you and I and a lot of us here in the studio have been tracked by the NSA following all of our phone detail apparently this program will expire on june the 19th unless it's renewed why do you think somebody somewhere is leaking this to this UK newspaper so that we would know about it right now you know that's a good question but I'm a Verizon of customer I don't mind Verizon turning over records to the government if the government is going to make sure that they try to match up a known terrorist  yeah it was somebody in the United States I I don't think you're talking to terrorists I know you're not I know I know I'm not so we don't have anything to worry about I'm glad the activities going on but it is limited to tracking people who are suspected to be terrorists and who they may be talking to are you are you sure yeah that's what's supposed to be but are you sure they're still doing that yes I'm sure okay that's what there's are you it's not the hundred million customers that their original report said all right so sure we should be doing this okay good so you're not alarmed all right Susan Rice for the national security advisor to the president replacing Tom Donnelly your reaction well Greg Hicks the number two in Libya who was the last guy to speak to Greg Hicks alive who told the system this was a terrorist attack and made the terrorist organization was demoted the person who got on TV four or five days later and told the American people there was no coordinated terrorist attack this was a result of a spontaneous riot caused by hateful video a complete misleading untrue story gets promoted that's all you need to know about this administration professional people doing their job who do not tow the party line get demoted people who tell the political story that the White House would like gets promoted she is now the National Security Advisor I will work with her where I can the world is falling apart Israel surrounded by radical Islamist I don't know why he chose her but her credibility is love with me and others but we will work with her senator let me ask you this because the judge earlier on the show Judge Napolitano said that this appointment would not preclude her from still having to testify about what happened okay so what happened that week before she gave the talking points on Benghazi let me ask you this why has she not been called to come under oath to say to the American public who told her to give this time done point this is a great question we have subpoena power in the house three things I want to know why would we heard for many survivors IVA distort a small forest writing letters of administration please make the survivors have been guys available so we can hear from them but really happened they refused to do that we don't know who was the meeting on Saturday before her Sunday TV appearance that took the talking points that were very accurate and turned out to be a bunch of garbage who was in that meeting and what did and why did they decide what they did and let Susan Rice answer questions why did you say the embassy or consulate was substantially significantly and strongly secured and why did you say al Qaeda was decimated that's not part of anybody's talking points why is she hadn't why has she not been called the answer for the misleading information she gave to the American people and finally where was the president during the night of the attack and why did he for two weeks write this off as a spontaneous right caused by video when there's no evidence to suggest that Benghazi is just beginning for me is not not close to being over sure will she will be Susan Rice will be the president's top advisor on national security issues are you confident she's up to the job she's got a good background in national security but after Benghazi can I trust her can you trust her she's going to have to establish well that's right why would you pick somebody who is clearly in the eyes of many of us here took a national security event and made it a political event seven weeks before the election she was an empty vessel you know they poured misinformation through she needs to be held accountable for what she did in Benghazi but it is the president's pick and we are at war and Israel is under the gun and we're under the gun so yes I will work with her but we live in a world where if you do a job like Greg Hicks and you tell the truth you get demoted and you go on TV on five different shows and you tell a story that's politically beneficial not remotely connected to the facts you know you get promoted one guy that gets demoted the other person gets promoted all right Lindsey Graham South Carolina senator and verizon customer thank you very much for joining surprising system ur not talking to terrorists either okay let's keep it that way thank you soon all right a major

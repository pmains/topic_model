MR. CARPER: THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. MADAM PRESIDENT, AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS, WE WILL SHORTLY VOTE TO INVOKE CLOTURE ON THE NOMINATION OF DR. HENRY CHRISTOPHER FREY TO BE ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR OF THE E.P.A.'S OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HIS NOMINATION. CHRIS FREY, AS HE IS KNOWN TO HIS FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES, IS AN OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVANT, A DEEPLY RESPECTED SCIENTIST AND AN EXCELLENT CHOICE TO FILL THIS LEADERSHIP ROLE AT E.P.A. THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROVIDES THE BEDROCK OF SCIENTIFIC EYAL SIS -- ANALYSIS WHERE WE ESTABLISH OUR CRITICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE E.P.A. IS ABLE TO PROTECT THE AIR WE BREATHE, PROTECT THE WATER THAT WE DRINK AND THE LAND WE BUILD OUR COMMUNITIES UPON BECAUSE OF THE ROBUST SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROVIDED BY WHAT IS CALLED O.R.D., THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. DR. FREY'S NOMINATION RECEIVED A BIPARTISAN VOTE IN THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS. HE HAS THE EXPERIENCE, INTELLECT AND INTEGRITY TO LEAD THIS INDISPENSABLE OFFICE. I'M EAGER TO SEE HIM CONFIRMED. I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING CLOTURE ON HIS NOMINATION. THIS IS ABOUT RESTORING SCIENCE AS THE GUIDING FORCE IN E.P.A.'S WORK. THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. I YIELD

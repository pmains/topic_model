well thank you mr chair uh and ranking member thompson we've had a busy week in this committee and i appreciate that i'm looking forward to discussing the snap issues today deputy under secretary dean and your testimony you talk about how snap is a powerful tool to address hunger and hardship and yet the biden administration is pushing an agenda of poverty by continuing to incentivize people to stay home not seek employment not utilize the employment training programs that exist through the usda at a time when there's a business on every corner that really needs employees i mentioned in the committee's cattle hearing yesterday but it's worth repeating we are currently seeing the largest increase in food prices in 40 years i keep bringing up inflation in this committee because it's warranted these benefits have always been intended to be a tool to get people back on their feet from a hard time not an economic incentive to stay on the sidelines to that end the department conducted its annual cost of living adjustment just last year and then increased benefits by way of an accelerated debatable thrifty food plan update i believe there is still a focus from this administration and fns to increase snap benefit allotments and expand eligibility even further just yesterday democrats blamed meat packers for high prices even when producers said inflation related to wasteful pandemic spending supply chain issues and a lack of workers was the cause for these increased input costs and subsequent food prices seems obvious that the department wouldn't be able to quantify mere rumors of price gouging when adjusting these prices so why does the administration insist on finger pointing when it comes to the root cause of high prices it's worth repeating that there are currently 11 million work-ready adults certified by their state workforce agencies who are receiving snap benefits but could start working immediately to fill the over 11 million open jobs in the united states getting these individuals to work could ease supply chain issues immediately and that would do that would be done by increasing domestic production and productivity until this administration pushes to do a better job of matching people with these jobs and disincentivizing disincentivizing the coveted culture of not working these problems that we're talking about today are only going to persist so mr chair i want to say thank you for allowing me the time to make these remarks today i don't have any further questions of the witness and i'll give back the balance of my time

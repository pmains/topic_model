Thank You mr. chairman there's definitely a trust gap between taxpayers and the IRS and the IRS as information technology systems are a great example of why the IRS has an urgent need to overhaul its IT system some of which date back to the kennedy administration but repeated mistakes both big and small undermine our trust in them take the 12 million dollars they spent on a new email system they couldn't use the Inspector General report revealed the IRS bought it quote without first determining project and infrastructure needs integration requirements business requirements and whether the subscriptions were technologically even feasible or take the return review program or the RRP the new fraud detection program came in years behind schedule and hundreds of millions of dollars over budget here are just a few of the reasons the IRS cited when it put in when it put the RRP into a strategic pause in 2014 they said it was to determine the priority and direction from IRS senior leadership they said to articulate in a line on our our P's role in the broader business vision they also said to ensure clear and concise understanding of scope cost and schedule with contractors and finally budgetary constraints it's clear that unforced errors are turning vital projects into boondoggles we could be applauding the IRS right now for buying a system off the shelf instead we're scolding them for not asking the most basic questions before buying it I hear complaints about the IRS s budget and I think about that our RP senior leadership gave no direction no one knew how to fit it into the big picture and contractors were totally out of the loop everyone essentially ran in circles until they ran out of money you know what here's what we do know more money cannot fix failed leadership or a broken culture letter guidelines codified rules and more intentional strategic planning can that's why I last Congress I introduced HR 5360 to the IRS information technology Accountability Act and I was happy to see the critical work being built on in this Congress with the introduction and markup of the taxpayer first Act I truly believe if we do instill more accountability that Contracting practices and better strategic planning the IRS really can get on the right path at the end of the day this will be this will greatly benefit the American taxpayer ensure that the IRS is working for them in an effective way I'm proud that we're taking important bipartisan steps to close the IRS is trust gap I urge my colleagues to support HR 1957 the taxpayer first act with that mr. Chairman I yield back thank the gentlelady

ron wyden was first elected to Congress in 1980 and began serving his Oregon Senator in 1996 he quickly gained a reputation as a consumer advocate and a strong and effective leader senator Wyden serves on the powerful Finance Committee is chairman of the International Trade customs and global competitiveness subcommittee he also serves on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and as an active member of the aging budget and intelligence committees and so to have somebody who is such a knowledgeable advocate at the same time as someone who is so highly regarded it's a great combination on behalf of the technology industry but he's so accessible that's the thing love the compliments but he was not his high horse he wasn't too good to talk to us it was more than happy to continue the conversation all the way into one of the Senate buildings and up the elevator and we continue the conversation about why he's such a great friend to technology one of the only if not the only member of the Senate really gets technology that means understanding what intellectual property means in the digital era it supposed to be understanding that balance between innovation and dissemination Ron White was concerned is not scoring political points it's about taking on tough issues and getting things done he goes to great lengths to avoid the political posturing characterizes so much of DC right now be working across the aisle with Republicans and figure out how to put Medicare on a sustainable foot some people criticize members who do this I think we ought to clone widen along with Republican representative chris cox road section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 which established the principle that backbone providers network operators and individual sites can't be held liable for the actions of their users and customers senator Wyden was the first Senate opponent of pippa legislation he promised a filibuster after it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee this delayed a Senate vote and gave opponents breathing room to spread the word about the legislation innovation drives America's economy and Ron knows we need to support policies that encourage innovation and entrepreneurship and that's exactly what Ron did with the open act supporting an open Internet ron has been ahead of the curve and he saw the shortcomings of the protect IP act and he knew that America could afford an Internet policy that were trampled on our innovation economy people outside of Washington don't always realize that how you devise copyright rules can have a tremendous impact on technology innovation section 230 got it right and make sure that people who've done something wrong are not held responsible for the actions of others for the reason then thoughtful approach you took to the people on the cell phone legislation you recognized very early on the potential harm that this legislation could cause in particular the damage it could cause to the free flow of information in the internet you even said when members of Congress that are understand the internet they'll see it as a world of opportunity to create jobs and foster innovation they'll see it as an opportunity to improve education and economic mobility and most importantly to cultivate the sort of government our founders intended in which we hear and learn from our constituents but if not for senator Wyden's principled stand and putting a hold on HIPAA and the Senate we might be living with Pippa today as the law of the land but instead we're able to celebrate a great victory with people coming together all across this country to say no to a bad bill and keep the internet free and open for innovation defending the internet and Internet freedom became something that brought us together in a way that really showed his strength and his determination and to be honest his willingness to do something whether we're going to win or not unfortunately we did senator Wyden is willing to transcend today's hyper partisan environment to address issues critical to our nation he has been a champion of the internet early and often senator Wyden fully understands the transformative power of innovation from the earliest days of the commercial internet he has been an aggressive defender of this new technology he offered the internet Tax Freedom Act prohibiting states and municipalities from placing discriminatory taxes on internet access senator Wyden for your courage for your passion for your defense of free speech and innovation you are a true

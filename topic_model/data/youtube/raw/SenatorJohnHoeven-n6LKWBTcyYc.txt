get at the keystone pipeline it did not win approval in the senate last night it was defeated by just one vote fell one vote short of the 60 needed listen to senator elizabeth warren talking about it the gays were 59 the nays are 41 the 60 vote threshold having not been achieved the bill is not passed all right republican senator from north dakota john hoeven he joins us now from capitol hill he co-authored the bill with mary landrieu senator i don't want to be harsh but i think you've lost the pipeline will be approved in the new congress got that but the president's going to veto it and you don't have the votes to override i i don't want to be harsh but it looks to me like you lost and the green is one well you can maybe argue that for this round but i don't think that's the case at all because i think we will pass it i really had not anticipated bringing up the bill and tell the new congress senator landrieu wanted to but the votes weren't there 59 votes though continues to move us forward in the new congress we'll have more than 60 votes as you say though the real challenge will be uh president vetoes president obama is likely to veto it and then we'll have to figure out how to override but you can't really can you i mean you need 67 votes in the senate to override odds are you are not gonna get them i i hate to go back to this but it's the same old story isn't it you can't win this one i think we can and i think we'll win it on the merits i mean i i think we'll win because it's about energy and jobs it's about national security it's about energy security and the american people overwhelmingly support it 60 70 in the polls so this is about working for the american people versus special interest so i think we will win it we may have to combine my bill with some other legislation maybe some other energy legislation or an appropriations measure but i think we will get to that 67 uh vote threshold and ultimately win it on the merits do you think you'll have to throw in some strings um just a few caveats to make sure that it's not a full let's not it's not just build the pipeline no you're going to have to chuck a few things in there that say well we'll do this as well and we'll do that as well a quick pro quo's here and there you think you have to do that maybe it may be a two-step process we bring it back pass it the president vetoes it we may not be able to override directly however you've got the litigation in nebraska which should be resolved by then so we may if not as you say we may have to add another energy measure that brings us a few more votes okay we admire your um optimism there sir and uh we'll get it who can get it okay i didn't want to be harsh senator john hoeven thanks for joining us i appreciate it thank you thanks stuart

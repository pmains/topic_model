let me bring in Connecticut Democratic congressman jim Himes who sits on the Intelligence Committee congressman good to see you what's your thought here at what point should the u.s. become involved militarily well it's not clear to me Richard that there is a point at which we should become involved militarily other than to go after those terrorists are those groups al Qaeda amongst them that really are not so much about the sunni-shia sectarian warfare that we're seeing in the region right now or perhaps not about the modernizes versus the kind of Caliphate gang there those people who are going after us are legitimate targets I do think and obviously I will listen to whatever it is the president wants to propose but I do think that getting the United States of America involved in a regional religious sectarian war would be a profound error what would you support as the President does come to Congress tomorrow and saying he may want to do several things you know he could include drone strikes airstrikes etc what if anything might you support drone strikes well look first I'd have to make sense of the situation think about what we're considering doing here we would be getting militarily involved on behalf of a Shiite ruler and Iranian proxy if you will fighting Sunni insurgents not just across the border in Syria we are doing the exact opposite of that we are supporting Sunni insurgents against a Shiite Iranian proxy in the form of President Assad so I mean that's question number one which is what is the overarching strategy question number two is what do we think we're going to achieve by by some form of military action whether it was bombing or drones look if you could convince me and you'd have a hard time doing it but if you could convince me that there was something we could do kinetically that would bring everybody to the table shut down the conflict that is breaking out in this country I'd be open-minded to it but boy I'll tell you that's a pretty high bar to convince me that anything we would do would be to do anything other than make the situation worse congressman is you know in recent history payments have been made by the US government to Sunnis certain Sunni groups what would the solution be if you were to have to give one to the president well you know the first thing that needs to be done of course is a real effort to try to reduce the violence and reduce the hostilities you know we have backed Prime Minister Maliki for a very long time he has returned the favor of course by being fairly authoritarian with respect to how he treats the Sunnis in his own country so one thing I might suggest to the president is let's get the Maliki to actually call a conference where the Shiites the Sunni and the Kurds are represented at the table to try to work this out peacefully and look if they are so bound to determine to fight this out if they are going to have the kind of Sunni Shia warfare that we're seeing in the region frankly if that's what they want to do we're not going to stop them from doing it and I'm not sure we should be risking art remember when we talked about airstrikes we're talking about pilots in the air we're talking about an awful lot of money and we're talking about a very uncertain so again my level of skepticism here is pretty high for any sort of military involvement by the United States as always great conversation connect at congressman jim heintz member of the House Intelligence Committee thank you so much thank you Richard

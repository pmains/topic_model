you think it can't happen yes there are politicians hitting new lows AOC voting against the latest stimulus bill even her hometown liberal newspaper slamming her for that speaker Pelosi get this well she's entertaining the radical measured of guaranteed income and now she's saying the travel ban that saved countless American lives wasn't quote this great moment because it didn't go far enough no Democrat supported it and Trump got bludgeoned for it congenital liar Adam Schiff he seems worried trumpets may somehow keep people from voting in 2020 buh-buh-buh-buh crazy and then disgustingly shift is even claiming that failing to impeach Trump meant that thousands of Americans were dead Wow meanwhile a story published by the Biden campaign the Trump supposedly owed the Bank of China millions yeah that was a lie they had to retract that comrade de Blasio mayor of New York taking leisurely strolls in the park way away from his home in Gracie Mansion here with reaction Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee House Judiciary Committee member my gates congressman a Florida Governor I look at these comments something at all Trump wasn't tough enough on the travel ban and and and and if trumpet you know would have acted sooner I'm like wow do they have any shame they don't have any shame whatsoever and the only thing that's worse is the fact that the media doesn't have the integrity to call them out they they aid and abet the Democrats for saying such outrageous things and they go after the president all the time they misinterpret they miss represent everything the man says like he was telling people to go swallow light bulbs and drink Lysol he never did either of those things but on the other hand they give a free pass to the loons like Nancy $13 a pint designer ice cream Pelosi they let ship off with talking about fifty thousand people killed by the president's action many more were saved than that it's just bizarre it truly is one thing about AOC I got to give her credit for this Shawn people think she's maybe not smart she's smart enough to become a pretty significant part of pushing the entire Democrat Party agenda waste so far to the left that they've fallen off the edge you know and if things haven't gotten worse bad gates I mean Schiff was pushing impeachment you were in the middle of all that they weren't focused on China the president was focused on China we know what he did January 30th ten days after the first case of corona and America but the travel ban in place that got the crap beat out of a forum while ship was pushing his phony impeachment I don't think impeachment will be viewed by history as having saved any lives I only wish my Democrat colleagues would spend half as much time working with this president as they tried to spend removing him from office Americans deserve to know who's fighting for what Democrats are fighting for illegal aliens for upgrades to the Kennedy Center and for bailouts for blue states I mean I don't understand why New York can't collect bail money from their own criminals but they expect to be able to collect for non coronavirus expenses from the people of Florida maybe out there in California Gavin Newsom would think about not giving free health insurance to illegal aliens before asking the rest of the country asking for California's budget deficits that they had well before coronavirus and meanwhile Republicans were actually trying to leverage the strength of this economy for our people for our workers for our businesses and I think that's ultimately well so how does this play out in the twenty seconds each we have governor Huckabee in 190 days I think the president ultimately wins because I just want to believe the American people aren't as stupid as the Democrats are playing them to be they can see for themselves and they know that the Democrats get elected they lose their liberties it's not about losing an election they lose their liberties and that's what's at stake how does it play out Matt Gaetz in 190 days the principal question in the upcoming election is who can bring America back Donald Trump has done it before and Joe Biden it's pretty obvious he's not playing with a full sack of marbles right now and I don't think he'd be able to even bring himself home much less bring America back from this crisis that has been inflicted on us by China and their lack of transparency time for the media asked Joe some questions let's see ten interviews number of weeks eighty one questions not one about Tara Reid well has a lot more corroboration than any of the Cavanaugh accusers

just a couple of other questions for you all to kind of dig a little deeper and sort of the nuts and bolts of how some of the changes might might affect people who are suffering today and are probably listening to the shells and you know what's Congress going to do to actually get some relief for for my loved ones and my household one issue I'm going to ask you dr. Thompson because you've been looking at these issues a whole host of issues and and cost issues as well do you have an idea of how much the shortages are costing the federal government in the form of reimbursement for costlier drugs in other words the the kind of example that comes to mind is a brand name you know drug that Medicare was say paying for went generic it's now on shortage so I assume in some instances that brand name drug is being prescribed so if that's the case how many brand-name drugs are they are there like that and if you could give us some sense of the cost that would be very helpful because I think one of the issues this committee will have to wrestle with is certainly we're going to look at ways to get more affordable generics these injectables in particular out to people are suffering but people are going to say well that's going to cost some money and if dr. Thompson can enlighten us on whether the government is now spending even more money on these costly or alternatives in terms of the shortage that might be a way to you know make the case that look we can hold the cost down you know here by cutting the reimbursement for the costly alternatives so do you have any sense of what the government is paying as a result of these shortages for brain we're just now beginning to drill down into our data to try to find some some correlation to help answer that question I think others may have a better answer than I do this but but clearly when if there's a brand name product available that product costs more in just the cost how many how many drugs can you give us a sense of how many drugs there might be would it be five would it be ten would it be twenty how many drugs even if you don't have an exact number might fit this category of you know brand name being reimbursed say by Medicare when there is a shortage you know sir I probably have to get back to you a significant number I would say a significant number so there's possibility that this inability to fix the incentives may result in significant additional costs to taxpayers to Medicare for not dealing with the shortage I think that's a plausible thing all right to ask his let me ask you all one other one maybe we just kind of go down down the row if you're listening you know to this you or a loved one is you know is suffering you're waiting and hoping for for treatment and I've I've sort of reached the point working in these health care issues I was director the gray Panthers for a lot of years before I came to the Congress working with senior citizens people listen to these debates and they want to know when there's going to really be a solution available and of course just plucking a date you know out of the air is pretty hard to do but let's take the kind of situation where if the reimbursement issue was addressed in this committee some combination of the policies that we're talking about here today and as you know dr. Conte I have some real questions is about the relationship between physician and the manufacturing you gave some thoughtful you know answers on that but let's say that issue is resolved how long would it take to get these drugs produced and out to patients senator Cardin was absolutely right people consider this urgent priority they don't want to hear about how it's going to take take eternity so as we wrap this hearing up if this committee gets it right in terms of these reimbursement you know changes how long would it take to get the drugs you know produced and out to patients I think that is one of the key questions in this issue um unfortunately I think the time fame varies quite substantially buygeneric firm and also by drug in terms of responding to these type of incentives and i have seen estimates of anywhere between getting production up and running from four months all the way to seven years so would it be fair to say again i want to use the terminology that i used with dr. Thompson because my sense is that there are significant additional cost to the government for paying for costly or treatments because the shortage is not being dealt with would it be fair to say of you dr. conky that a significant number of the drugs that are in shortage could get out to people say within six months he said four would that be a fair characterization I don't okay any of you others want to comment on it on a timetable cuz this is what people who are suffering wanna hear and that's why senator Cardin asked you know the question they they want to follow these debates but they want to see that sense of urgency any of the others want to give us a sense of the timetable I think the economic incentives and changing the pricing environment we talked about here today is important for getting new manufacturers into space and for expanding capacity to manufacture these drugs but it's not a short-term solution in my view in terms of the next six months type of solution because switching over an existing manufacturing line to make a new drug you're probably looking at a year under optimistic situations standing up new manufacturing you're looking at to 27 years and probably closer to seven years to stand up a brand new facility de novo so that's a long term solution to make sure that these markets don't get into trouble again in the future I think shorter term we need to look at the existing capacity it's been taken offline that's our best bet of trying to alleviate the show with in the next six months and I don't think there's any I don't think it's a sure bet that that's going to be a very efficient process game those facilities back online they're they're not mutually exclusive there can be efforts to absolutely deal with expanding capacity in the in the short term but but I continue to believe that people want to hear how long it's going to take to get at the root you know root cause I mean we're wrapping this this hearing up and and you all have been very very helpful and you know for me what it would comes down to dr. Cobb is what you said several hours ago when when we began to have you and and you know wonderful practitioners on the front lines in this fight against cancer like you know dr. Drucker to have to say to patients every day in America drugs that will relieve your suffering and relieve your your pain they aren't available we're not completely sure why and having all kinds of debates and in Washington DC that's just not acceptable so we've got to find a way to speed this up we've got to find a way to speed this up in terms of both the short term that you just touched on a moment ago in terms of capacity and then we've got a shorty that kind of period for dealing with the root cause of the problems is not acceptable in my view to say to cancer patients well we'll see what we can do in seven years that that's just not right would any of you like to have the last word with the last word going to our witnesses with that you all have been very helpful and that you're going to see significant bipartisan interest in this and obviously this committee has jurisdiction over a key part of it and led by senator hatch we're gonna get at it thank you all

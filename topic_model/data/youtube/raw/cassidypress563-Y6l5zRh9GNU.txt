a doctor's oath is a powerful thing in louisiana we have bill cassidy a doctor that doesn't treat his patients like a number someone who looks at his talents to heal and says how can i do more bill cassidy if i invite him into my humble home that he would be just as real as my next-door neighbor he he didn't look at my husband's hair or he didn't look at my husband's disease and say you know come to the earth or something he he said here's here's people that need my help and he helped he helped enough to save my husband's life i have been a tv anchor and reporter for the local cbs affiliate in baton rouge for about 20 years i would call bill for an interview or a question and he would come right over come straight from the hospital scrubs and all and sit down have a jacket do i need a jacket or is this okay because this is who i am and go right into whatever topic that the question was about but when it comes to health care it was amazing how this man who has spent his life as a public servant would go above and beyond especially for those in most need if i were going to describe myself i described myself as a man of faith the husband of dr laura cassidy a father of three wonderful children i'm a doctor who's worked in a hospital for the uninsured for the last 20-something years teaching medical students in residence and enjoying every minute of it when i was in high school i wanted to do something to be fulfilled but didn't quite know what that would be and i had seen doctors as a pediatrician but really had no contact with the medical system and so at some point when i was a senior in high school they thought i had cancer it turns out i didn't have cancer i had a lymph node biopsy didn't have cancer but almost like this came into my life to expose me to this wonderful field called medicine and that's when i decided to go into pre-medicine at lsu and was fortunate enough to get accepted to medical school and it's been everything i thought it would be when i met my husband we were both so wrapped up in medicine as residents as you spend most of your life in the hospital and you're you don't have very good social skills those skills your brain has developed but your social skills are awful clearly i i liked who he was we were both are christians we had our faith in common we went to church together i liked his intellect and i liked his uh somewhat his sense of humor you would think traveling together would result in vacation time not so with this dynamic duo we went to swaziland together after we were married you see another cultural perspective you see diseases that you don't see here in america you see delivery of health care in a different way so it was challenging that's challenging because you don't have all that we have here in america but it was a huge blessing and we enjoyed it together my husband was a patient of ill cassidies back in 1999 my husband worked at georgia pacific he's a very hardworking man and he i noticed the difference in him he started having to eat a lot of candy and do a lot of couldn't stay awake i mean was having problems then i went to my doctor and he did some blood work and we found out that bill had a really bad liver disease he was in stage four in stage liver disease as a matter of fact i can't explain i can't say enough about how personal the man was because he i mean he made it his mission to make sure that you were so informed that you knew you know he he trusted what i would say because the only reason he trusted me is because he knew he had groomed me to do exactly what i needed to do for him to be able to know what was going on and in our case when i thank god every day everybody had my husband dead and 11 years later we've never had a problem and my granddaughter has a paw paw you know my son is fixing to have a baby and he will have a paw paw and i have a husband and my children have a daddy you know georgia pacific has a real good paper mill worker never shying away from his patients once dr cassidy makes friends he never forgets a face i was in a chamber of commerce being in denham springs louisiana bill cassidy was invited to the meeting there at the chamber he was all the way across the room i mean you know a football field from me you know and he saw me at that distance and he came charged and he was standing there talking to important people and here i am clear across the room and he made a mad dash to come over and speak to me and as he approached me what he said was gwen davis how are you doing what's going on how are you feeling he remembered me as a patient but here he was remembered my name he had not seen me in almost three years here i was at a chamber and he wanted to know how i was feeling and what i was up to that's taken time i mean i do consider bill my best friend and i would say the feeling is likewise since we have the same background in medicine since we've been married for 23 years we have three children my mom has lived with us his mom lives with us now we've just been through a lot together and i'm glad to call bill my best friend you

thank you very much mr chair my bill would modernize the so-called fiscal system for onshore oil and gas production on federal land this includes the share of revenue that oil and gas companies pay to taxpayers for the resources they extract on public land it also includes the rental fees that they pay to lease that land from taxpayers and the minimum amount that they have to pay to acquire that land in the first place parts of this fiscal system are more than 100 years old there is not a single commodity or in industry that is the same as it was even 40 years ago let alone 100. why are we still managing our energy resources like cars or just replacing horses and 65 percent of the country doesn't have electricity modernizing the fiscal system is just common sense it would also generate more than 12 billion dollars in government revenue half of which would go back to oil and gas producing states that's why this bill has bipartisan support in the senate with senators grassley and rosen leading the companion in addition my bill would require onshore oil and gas companies to keep better records and pay inspection fees so that government watchdogs can make sure taxpayers aren't being cheated call me old-fashioned but i believe that corporations should follow the letter of the law and that the government should have the tools to enforce it taxpayers are not getting their fair share under the current system but you don't have to take my word for it this bill is endorsed by groups across the political spectrum from taxpayers for common sense to the project on government oversight to the wilderness society and almost everything in it is based on recommendations from the non-partisan government accountability office i have my views on the oil and gas industry and on climate change and on transitioning away from fossil fuels but this bill isn't about that it's about basic government accountability protecting taxpayer dollars and the reality that natural resources management has changed in the last 100 years thank you

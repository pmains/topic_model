this present want to talk for a few minutes about where we are with corona virus response and the Supplemental I think both all senators have an opportunity to be updated again today this is not a new place for us to be this time last year the Labor and Health and Human Services Appropriations Committee held a hearing on emerging threats and at at that point we were experiencing the second largest outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo antibiotic resistance was a global danger and there was a there was a flu outbreak bigger than we had seen in a long time so one year later we're still fighting the Ebola outbreak in the DRC antibiotic resistance continues to be a global problem and according to dr. Tony Fauci the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease the flu we're seeing this year's shaping up to be one of the worst in decades you know several thousand was Americans die every year from the flu usually at least 35,000 sometimes as high as 75,000 I think about 350,000 Americans have died from the flu in the last decade we're now facing a new danger the Coe bid 19 danger that's the new corona virus that we hadn't seen before as we learned with Ebola patient zero who doesn't know they even have this yet can board a plane or a cruise ship they can be in another country or an even another continent in a matter of hours and this lessons once again reinforced this is like all other diseases it doesn't know any boundaries that's we're no longer living in a world where our health can be separated from the health of other countries last week the number of new coronavirus infections outside of china outpaced those inside china for the first time maybe the good news is china is beginning to see something headed in a different direction but the bad news is infections in Iran and Italy and South Korea and Japan and other places this has moved into Europe now and in South America a case was just announced in Brazil but this is kind of that moment mr. president where we have some opportunity to do everything we can to prepare for the worst but we still have the option of hoping for the best that's what happened with SARS that's what happened with h1n1 to some extent it's what happened with Zika who didn't turn out it turned out to be bad for the people that had it but not as bad as we anticipated at one point it might be disturbing to see the first deaths in the in the state of Washington but certainly the message to us is be more vigilant and be better prepared that Congress in the last five years has increased money that doesn't count whatever we do this week and next week has increased money for preparedness by 44 percent a year ago we created for the first time mr. president an infectious disease bond our colleague in the House Tom Cole one of the major proponents of this to let the Health and Human Services people have access to money immediately because of that they had a hundred and five million dollars that they wouldn't have previously had to be able to spend immediately to help contain this problem where it can be contained to bring Americans back here particularly from China to keep them in a known location for the 14-day incubation period to see if anything happened all of that was possible because we've given them the flexibility that they hadn't had before the first line of defense funding has been there we're now moving toward a conclusion of what we can do to make more money available for a vaccine back to vaccine takes a while we're not going to have a vaccine for awhile we're gonna see be continuing to talk to doctor pouchy and his team about this we're working with experts at the what's called Barda the biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to move those vaccines quickly but even if we had a vaccine we'd be if we had a vaccine in 18 months that would be the u.s. world record to develop a vaccine here with the safety that we would think it would need to have so that anybody could take a vaccine and with that vaccine this particular virus would likely be dealt with so you know there's no treatment right now there's no cure right now but the treatment is to handle these issues in the way that we can in a public health system that's been built over decades there are 50 states the District of Columbia all have local public health providers we're going to have new money available to work with them but again the preparedness money that they've had for the last five years should have been used in a way and I believe was used in a way that gets them all more ready to deal with this than they otherwise would have been we need to continue that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have what they need to improve the surveillance systems the testing systems that we're going to find quickly that there'll be a test that will be approved by FDA that allows people to check in a number of locations and have that processed in a number of locations that test to see if in fact you have what you thought was a worse than usual cold or maybe you it was a not worse than usual cold sometimes this particular disease doesn't evidence that much happened at all and because of that I think there's probably at this point a bigger number of people who we think would be a percentage of people that would have really negative consequences even death from this disease rather than all the people that had it and didn't know they had it we've learned in the past through outbreaks of a flu strain that we didn't have a vaccine for of Ebola of Zika that what we do to protect people in other countries winds up protecting people here we have to be sure that we understand that a lot of our fate in this has been determined and will continue to be determined by what we do to first try to contain this virus and secondly to provide the money to be sure that when it we do have an outbreak which has already begun in our country that it's an outbreak that is really held at the lowest possible level of people impacted and if you are infected by this disease that you have the ability to work from home to do other things Hospital not always the place to go and we're working with state and local health officials right now to see that that happens the money that's been used I think has been used effectively clearly we're trying to agree between the House and Senate and the administration of exactly the right number I would say that at this point the administration has been the most agreeable to whatever money we want to provide but obviously would like to have that money provided quickly I feel confident we're going to have the resources to deal with this I feel confident that this will be a problem that will not impact more people than would usually be impacted by something like the flu but again we need to prepare for the very worst hope for the very best but our job right now is to prepare for the worst things that could happen with having the funding available so that we don't have to go through a couple of weeks again we're of easy determination should have been reached you know one thing we could have done is give the administration exactly the amount of money they asked for we could have decided to spend it differently two weeks ago and then get into a discussion of what we need next that's not the course we decided to go down we trying to come up with an amount of money it appears that would get us through this entire incident with this virus but it's time to get that done hopefully we'll see a bill filed later today and the house able to vote on that bill before they leave this week once that number is done I think it will be seen it's almost certain that the Senate will be able to deal with that bill and approve that number and we're going to move forward I think again we're gonna move forward in a way that minimizes as much as possible the impact that this has on families and on individuals and this president I look forward to you and I both having a chance to learn more about this even today and to learn more as we move forward and the big thing we need to learn now is what the amount of money we need to have to spend and how we allocate that money for a vaccine and other things

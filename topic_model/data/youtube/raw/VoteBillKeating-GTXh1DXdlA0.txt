Hi, Iâ€™m Congressman Bill Keating.  Since the Democrats took the House We passed hundreds of bipartisan bills that deal with health care voting rights Security and integrity in our elections Protecting our environment Lowering prescription drug costs Common sense gun safety And so much more. Simply put Democrats have a plan to deal with the issues that directly affect working Americans. Mitch McConnell knows that the majority of Americans agree with us on these issues. Mitch doesn't believe the American public is smart enough to realize that not allowing a vote on these issues in the Senate is the same as the GOP voting against it. What's the Trump McConnell plan for America? There isn't one. Trumpism works for one person and that's not you. Please help us get this out to as many voters as possible.

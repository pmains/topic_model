three weeks ago the farm bill was defeated because democrats were strongly opposed to the assault on nutrition programs and quite frankly some right-wing republicans voted no because they oppose nearly all government programs rather than trying to moderate the bill by working with democrats rather than compromising republican leaders have veered sharply to the right trying to win back the republican tea party as you voted no shortly before 8 pm last night the majority posted a 608 page bill online announced the meeting at 9 to consider the bill the majority violated their own rule of allowing at least three days to review legislation before a vote i have a copy of the bill right here this is the bill 608 pages have my colleagues read all of the 608 pages i can't wrap my mind around the shameful nature of this moment a moment when we're moving forward with the farm bill and leaving behind 47 million of our nations hungry there's nobody outside this body who supports this bill who cares about the values that we all profess to have within these walls so again taking food out of the mouths of babies that's a good policy i don't think so vote no we are the congress of the united states of america the most powerful nation on this planet and we can take care of all of the people imagine referring to the nutrition title of the farm bill as extraneous the 47 million people who are on snap are not extraneous they are important they are part of our community children young babies the elderly and disabled the audacity to split off the nutrition parts of this bill is so stunning it would be shocking except this is a house of shocks i would say it's one of the worst things you've done but there's such stiff competition for that honor that i can't really fully say that there are poor children in rural areas that i represent and i will never turn my back on them

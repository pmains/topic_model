when Washington voters passed an issue dove 601 it meant lawmakers would need a two-thirds approval for any new tax when Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown tried to pass a 42 cent increase in taxes on liquor lieutenant governor Brad own declared that measure two have failed for not meeting the two-thirds rule so Brown chose to sue Brad Owen and the voters of Washington to get the tax raise she wanted it really bothered me that you know the majority leader of the state Senate Lisa Brown was suing to overturn a popular law a law that wasn't just passed once but several times McKenna says it all came down to defending what the voters wanted in eastern Washington tax control measures had up to 70 percent support from both Republicans and Democrats so light we're not talking about a marginal idea here or something that passed on a fluke the voters have been emphatic that they want this kind of limitation in place McKenna says a change in the members of the Washington State Supreme Court helped Brown overturn the two-thirds rule permanently despite the will of voters it means that state lawmakers may now pass any new tax with just a simple majority it's absolutely about having a free hand to raise taxes senator Brown never saw a tax increase you didn't like I never saw a fiscal vania min wish she didn't think taxes needed to be raised and that's because her allies are all about having more and more and more government money and as a member of Congress you can bet she'll go in and she'll want to raise taxes on every one of us as much as she thinks she can get away with because that was her mo that was her philosophy as a state senator that's something we can't afford we cannot afford Lisa Brown in Congress

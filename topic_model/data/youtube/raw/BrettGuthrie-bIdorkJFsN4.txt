the gentleman from Kentucky the chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of HR 1839 which extends the important Medicaid money follows the person program until September the Medicaid money follows the person program allows certain Medicaid beneficiaries such as the elderly or individuals with disabilities to Trance to transition from a health care facility to receiving care in their own homes it does not force patients to leave a facility if they don't want to since the money follows the person program was created over a decade ago it has successfully helped over 88,000 individuals receive care in their own homes I've worked with congresswoman Debbie Dingell on the bipartisan empower Care Act which extends the medic the Medicaid money follows the person program for five years urge my colleagues to support HR 1839 to extend the program until September and I will continue to work with congresswoman Dingell to get the empower act across the finish line and I yield back my time

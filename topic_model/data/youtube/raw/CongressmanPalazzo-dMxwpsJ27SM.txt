thank you mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have five legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous materials today i stand here to recognize and honor without objection thank you today i stand here to recognize and honor the service members of the national guard and reserve components over the last few years our national guard soldiers have been more in the spotlight than ever before these men and women prove true to their motto of always ready always there as they face some of our nation's toughest times we have seen guardsmen from all over the country help in ways we never thought would be needed or possible from a five-month deployment to defend the u.s capitol to assist in an attempt to secure the southern border to aid in our health care workers in the delivery of coven 19 vaccinations and other coved related assignments these men and women left behind their loved ones and livelihoods to assist all americans when we most need it today is an opportunity for members of the house to thank these brave soldiers for the tremendous work and sacrifice our guard and reserve service members have endured since the first muster of militia forces to present day there are a lot of issues that divide our nation and congress but i know for certain that support for our national guard and reserve continues to be bipartisan and i'm proud of the work we're doing to assist these soldiers their families and the mission i have said this before but not all members have a military base but almost everyone has a national guard armory and national guardsmen in their district i look forward to hearing from more of my colleagues today as we take this moment to thank them for their service i now recognize the gentleman from hawaii and the co-chair of the national guard and reserve components caucus mr kahaly well here you can come here okay mahalo congressman palazzo for organizing this special order hour to celebrate the

highlight its growing role in our nation's competitiveness and strategic level defense priorities in my now 21-year career of service to our state and nation i've seen the hawaii air national guard transform from a quiet off the radar c130 f-15 and kc-135 squadrons out in the pacific to a lethal and almost full-time composite associate squadrons the hawaii air national guard's 154th wing and their flying squadrons serve alongside active duty counterparts flying c-17s and f-22s as well as the kc-135 each and every day active duty pilots flying with guard pilots side by side deploying overseas an important aspect of my job is to listen and hear from our men and women in the national guard and many of my policy proposals are the result of hearing directly from our guardsmen for example members of the guard contacted my office last year to raise their concerns about the number of days a reservist can serve on active duty as a result my colleagues and i authored the 1095 rule amendment act legislation that increases the maximum number of days that reservists can serve on active duty to maintain mission readiness we are pleased that this legislation was signed into law and took effect last month this is a huge victory for national guardsmen across the nation and ensures the full capability of our most talented reserve component members without affecting end strength limitations now i believe we can all agree that our success the success of our national guard is directly linked to the strength of our leadership the hawaii national guard is positioned as a key strategic defense priority for our military in the pacific and for that i would like to personally thank the adjutant general of the hawaii national guard kenneth hara for his direction in leading the guard in hawaii general hara has been central to our state's early success with the covet 19 pandemic he and his team have been pivotal to the coordinated effort between our states counties and

regiment the mississippi rifles for over 250 years brave americans have answered the call to service to protect both their homeland democracies abroad and to conduct disaster response or support to civilian authorities during a crisis our reservists and guard members bring a unique skill set to our armed forces leveraging their expertise and real world experiences from the civilian workforce to bring an exceptional and innovative perspective to our national defense in addition to deployments overseas guard and reservists are employed across the broad and diverse mission set whether it is responding to civil unrest in our nation's capital defending our borders providing relief from hurricanes or other natural disasters as well as responding to the covet 19 pandemic i will tell you the guard did a yeoman's work in the coveted response and it was much less by building testing sites by giving vaccinations by helping with all the logistics we would not have gone as smooth without our guard as of today the mississippi national guard has forces deployed in support of four combatant commands around the world during the pandemic the mississippi national guard activated approximately 1700 service members that administered more than 765 000 vaccinations 226 000 tests and processed more than 109 000 lab samples supporting the mississippi department of health our logistics professionals traveled more than 665 000 miles throughout our state to deliver more than 58 million pieces of personal protective equipment to our hospitals long-term health care facilities clinics and testing sites since the global war on terror the guard has shifted from a strategic reserve force to an operational reserve deploying in support of the same conflicts fulfilling the same mission sets and seeing the same combat against our enemies as the active component within this service has come great sacrifice and i would like to honor the fallen guard heroes who gave their lives in service of our country and its ideas in the global war on terror in addition to the countless other guard lives lost in world war ii korea vietnam and the persian gulf one of these heroes is sergeant first class sean m coley who i had the privilege of serving alongside in the 155th brigade combat team in iraq who was killed in an action in iraq february 3rd 2005. in his memory i introduced and had passed the house resolution that led to the congressional gold star family fellowship program act named for sergeant first class sean cooley and specialist christopher horton both who were guardsmen

national guard units dating back to 1636 the guard has a proud history and has shaped and defended our great nation in my home state 199 years ago home state of texas stephen f austin formed the texas militia now known as the texas army national guard and then 100 years later the texas air national guard was established and since their inception these courageous service members have been the first responders to many natural disasters many in my own district where we have routinely seem to have hurricanes they have helped to maintain civil order and they have deployed to the southern border to protect our sovereignty but their service doesn't stop there the guard augments our active duty military offering complete warfighting capability at only 30 percent of the cost at a moment's notice they respond to the call of our country in southeast texas you'll find the 147th attack wing at ellington field where they fly the mq-9 reaper and are combat mission capable and proven ready to provide critical isr and air-to-ground strike capabilities additionally they have responded to the crisis at the border and played a vital role in storm preparation and recovery the 147th is a prime example of the benefits of the national guard and i have no doubt that this wing will continue to succeed and lead into the future and speaking of the future we must create a space national guard mirroring the newest branch of our military focusing on missile warning space intel electronic warfare satellites and many other capabilities the collaboration between active duty and space guard would seamlessly provide ops and mission support from above as a former member of the texas army national guard i stand firmly behind you guardsmen who are willing to be called upon at any moment with every capability to do any job including in space and i offer my heartfelt admiration and appreciation and so with that i would yield back thank you thank you thank you representative babin for your service not only in the military but also in the u.s house of representatives and also thank you for what your texas national guard is doing to try to secure our border in texas and so at this time i would like to recognize representative mike carey mike carey is also a former army guard officer he represents 18 000 guardsmen i mean actually ohio has 18 000 guardsmen and nine major commands army and air and so we thank you for your service and we thank you for participating tonight thank you okay congressman for nearly 400 years the u.s national guard has served as a vital component to our nation's war fighting and peacekeeping capabilities guard members are stewards of equipment resources necessary to assist in times of need and are always ready to respond to our nation's challenges both at home and abroad as a former officer in the army national guard i know that the guard is so much more than a weekend a month and two weeks a year to to those who serve it is about service to our nation and always being ready to answer the call is about our neighbors helping neighbors ready to respond to anything from a natural disaster drug seizure or even a cyber attack members of the guard are essential to provide the capabilities to accomplish the state and national priority priorities that we have in the buckeye state the ohio national guard is always ready always there since 9 11 more than 25 000 ohio soldiers and airmen have been deployed all over the world over the last two years just as the guard members across the country have done the ohio national guard members have been lifesavers throughout the covid 19 pandemic more than 2 thousand ohio national guard members were deployed at 18 testing centers and 62 hospitals across ohio as part of a critical and general support teams they prevented a crisis of care by providing patient monitoring transportation staffing administration testing and vaccinations and even food distribution i saw their i saw their work firsthand as a drive through a testing site in columbus where guard members collaborated with the ohio state university to ensure that more than a thousand ohioans per day could be tested during the national testing shortage it was an amazing operation that could not have worked without the experience and the efficiency of our national guard members in conclusion we cannot thank our national guard members enough for what they have done to keep us safe and what they will continue to do throughout their service thank you thank you congressman carey i know you're the state's very proud of your support of the ohio national guard and all the military services that you have there at this time it's a huge honor to recognize burgess owens he represents utah's fourth congressional district where a state that has 11 major commands and commands and over 7 500 guardsmen fortunately we represented burgess serves on the judiciary committee and the subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security so i know you appreciate our guardsmen and our service members and you're looking out after the homeland so thank you for being here thank you thank you so much i appreciate that i rise today to honor the national guard members in utah and across our great nation since 1636 members of national guard have proudly served our communities and our entire nation today and every day we are incredibly thankful for the commitment to serving others and keeping us safe these past two years have been especially challenging for the airmen and soldiers of the national guard who have stepped up when the nation called and provided much needed support to our communities from logan to st george they provided direct hospital support during the height of dakota 19 helped fight firefighters across the american west and provided a calm and collected response to recent episodes of civil unrest they performed under some of the most serious and difficult conditions in recent memory while also balancing their responsibilities as parents spouses employees and even business owners i've had the privilege of meeting many of these fine men and women from the officers or the ncos of the 19 special forces group to privates assigned to the 67th field artillery brigade i've been impressed by their selfless service and commitment to duty utah is truly blessed to serve as a proud home of camp williams and over seven thousand of these remarkable airmen and soldiers these brave men and women are always ready and always there utah is one of a kind spirit of service and the members of our national guard are no no exceptions each and every day they faithfully live out their mission to provide military forces to assist our state and federal authorities in times of emergencies they stand ready to protect utahns and americans from enemies both foreign and domestic interact quickly in the face of national disasters or emergencies thank you for serving utahns and americans safe i yield back thank you representative owens at this time i'd like to recognize congressman bergman from michigan's first congressional district representative bergman was a lieutenant journal in the united states marine corps with semper fi sir and he's also notably the highest ranking combat veteran to have ever served in the house of representatives well thank you fellow marine and fellow guardsmen mr palazzo your your dedication to being one of the co-chairs of the garden reserve caucus it reminds me of continued service that members of the garden reserve do every day in communicating to the general public the value of what it means to have a ready garden reserve but also here in congress the continuing education for all of our members so that they understand in their states that the importance of maintaining a ready garden reserve you know may is is a national military appreciation month so is june so is july so was august so is september i would suggest to you we should be thankful continually for the men and women who always are standing by at the ready when our country needs them whether it's a humanitarian assistance mission a disaster relief mission a border security mission a mobilized go to the fight kind of mission anywhere in the world our garden reserves stand ready but in that readiness comes the requirement to properly fund the garden reserve and in the military it is always a competition for resources but i believe the combination of states because the governor of every state is the commander-in-chief of their guard units reserve units different story they're under the command of the different services but the readiness and the support that is offered by each state and its governor to ensure that their guard units are ready to go whether they're army guard whether they're air guard no matter what it is is essential to not only the state readiness but the overall readiness that we need as a country in the very complex world in which we live but a special thanks tonight to the families of those guardsmen and reservists because those guardsmen and reservists they work a monday through friday job let's say and on on friday night when a lot of their peers leave their jobs and go home to go play golf or go fishing or whatever they're packing their they're packing their kits and going to drill weekend or a two-week annual training or whatever it is so they the sacrifice of time that the guardsmen and reservists make at the expense of their family time is something again we should never never take lightly and always remember because it's those young children who wonder why mom and dad is not around on saturday and sunday but then they see the picture of them wearing the uniform and doing the the kind of duty that that we need in the united states of america we cannot thank the family enough and having said that in thanking the family the commanders of the units know very well that good training time means that you're busy you're doing good things and if there's nothing to do secure and go home and spend time with your families because it's the family that keeps everybody together and speaking of keeping things together employers a lot of times don't understand the sacrifices that their men or women are making on the weekends they just see them you know as good employees monday through friday so i thank the employers and there's a a group called the employer support of the guard and reserve they've got done a great job across the country to ensure that the relations between the guard and reserve and the employers are such that there's no misunderstanding of why a person may ask for a day or two uh extra to leave for extra guard duty to do a longer drill weekend so my thanks to the thanks to the employers as well on a little personal note when it comes to michigan in fact today i met with the the the adjutant general of the michigan guard and as a state michigan has some very very very unique and productive training areas we're a state with a lot of water around us we've got a lot of woods and camp grayling in kind of the central part of lower michigan really is an example of what a national guard base training base could and should look like around the country multinational exercises every year exercise northern strike the alpena combat readiness training center we are one of the few areas where the fighters have unfettered access to unrestricted training areas to do live ordinance and we need to have our pilots and our air crews and all our shooters ready to go and i'm proud to represent that part of michigan that houses camp grayling and of course selfridge air national guard base down kind of closer towards detroit it is a base with the future because of one of the few bases that is not a joint base where you have military and civil aviation going together so the ability of the of the air guard of the air force reserve of any of the reserve components that fly to put capabilities at selfridge airport at selfridge air national guard base is a win-win for not only our defense posture but you know quite honestly for the state of michigan when it comes to providing bang for the buck in the defense dollar i could tell you about a lot of stories over a long time and in my command my last command as the commander commanding general of the marine corps reserve whether you're a marine a sailor an airman a soldier soon to be space guardians in the reserve component coast guard the men and women who serve the missions that they are ready to do give me confidence that our ability as united states military to not only go to the fight but to do the things that are the humanitarian assistance disaster relief we're in good hands because of the commitment of the men and women who wear the uniform so my friend congressman palazzo thank you for leading this thank you for calling attention to the fact that without our garden reserve we are less ready as a country thank you thank you general bergman i appreciate it being over the fourth marine division gives you insight that many people don't understand and being able to connect the relationships between the actual serving member their family and their employers extremely important at this time i would like to recognize my my colleague from the great state of mississippi he represents mississippi's third congressional district michael also serves as the vice ranking member on homeland security so he definitely takes homeland security and national security very seriously and he he loves the guard so much he even hired a retired adjunct general to serve on his staff so thank you for being here thank you the people of the great state of mississippi are grateful for the service of the 12 500 national guard service members of our state and for the leadership of general durr bulls our guardsmen are dedicated to keeping mississippi safe by providing response to disasters and by serving our nation on domestic and foreign military missions during floods and hurricanes our guardsmen transport and rescue civilians inundated by high waters and after the storms national guard engineers repair infrastructure utilities and provide logistic support to citizens with 65 readiness centers statewide the mississippi army national guard can quickly respond to any number of events at a moment's notice and the mississippi air national guard operating from the 186th air refueling wing the 187th once to the 182nd air wing and the combat readiness training center

their lives on the line in defense of our nation today and every day we honor their service and sacrifice guard members serve a unique mission safeguarding our country as a whole and protecting the individual states that make up our nation including my home state of georgia from assisting at covet 19 testing sites and maintaining law and order during violent demonstrations to helping out during extreme weather emergencies the georgia guardsmen always answer the call to serve and this service regularly extends beyond the peach state such as at the southern border where there are over 100 georgia national guard troops assisting border patrol agents in handling president biden's out-of-control border crisis additionally georgia currently has combat forces at all six geographic combatant commands serving our great state and our nation around the world in fact members of the georgia air national guard's 165th airlift wing were deployed to europe in response to russia's unlawful invasion of ukraine georgians are tremendously thankful for their service in this vital mission and we continue to pray for their safety overseas our nation is forever grateful for all of the past the current and the future men of the national guard and we thank you for your duty to our nation and dedication to our freedoms thank you and i yield back thank you congressman clyde at this time i'd like to recognize congressman elsie from texas sixth congressional district he's a graduate of the u.s naval academy flew 860 helicopters f4 tomcats fa-18 hornets and super hornets served five combat tours in afghanistan and two in iraq and if i may just know you're since you're a graduate of the naval academy i actually happen to serve on the board of visitors for the naval academy um but my best experience was in 2011 a little team called southern miss golden eagles from hasburg mississippi was able to travel up to annapolis and um put a beat down on the naval academy it only happened once

there are over 6 500 texas national guard members stationed on our southern border why are they there to protect us as always they're there to defend every man woman and child in this country we

people by the hundreds of thousands 105 000 last year dead by fentanyl they're there to save the women and children that are they're being bought into this country for the purposes of the sex trade modern day slavery for many national guard members their love for country and a is a calling to protect it and that attributes to years of service just like red oak resident and veteran captain henry

and he's still with us today and still married to billy after 73 years while captain sterling's story is a remarkable one it's not uncommon we have outstanding men and women all over this country who

it's my pleasure today to recognize the members of the united states national guard that call our district home the first congressional district of georgia is home to every military branch every branch of the military in america home to moody air force base kings bay naval base hunter army airfield and fort stewart all of those in the first congressional district of georgia make no mistake about these great installations they were placed here along the 110 miles of pristine coastline for a reason it is because of our great weather and it's because of our proximity the port of savannah and the port of brunswick in addition to those branches of military and to those military bases we also are home to the combat readiness training center at the air dominance center in savannah the air dominant center is home to the air national guard here in savannah and unfortunately the president in his budget for fiscal year 23 has proposed closing the most efficient the most utilized combat readiness training center here in america the one located in savannah and oh by the way the one that is about to complete a 24 million dollar hangar built for stealth for for stealth fighters unbelievable in fact they've invited me they've invited me to the ribbon cutting yes to be held in september the first of september with the intention now of this administration wanting to close it down the first of april of next year no wonder taxpayers get so upset about wasteful government spending this is the most ludicrous thing i have ever heard on top of that think about the world stage that we're in right now madam speaker do you realize that we are potentially on the brink of world war three think about it russia has attacked ukraine an errant missile a mistake and they hit a nato country all of a sudden it triggers article five all of a sudden we're in war three and this president and this administration are talking about closing a combat readiness training center you got to be kidding me we ought to be opening more this is the most ludicrous thing i've ever heard the savannah combat readiness training center represents the most uniquely cost efficient taxpayer investment thanks to the shared airfield between the national guard bureau and the 165th airlift wing this can't be allowed to happen this has got to be stopped and i'm prepared to do what it takes to ensure that it doesn't i'm here today to say that i appreciate that i value members of the georgia national guard and members of the united states national guard and that we're going to do everything we can to make sure that the combat readiness training center in savannah stays open god bless our country god bless our troops and god bless the national guard thank you congressman carter for those

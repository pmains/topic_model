for what purpose does the gentlelady from North Carolina seek recognition mr. speaker by direction Committee on rules I call up House Resolution 741 and ask for its immediate consideration the clerk will report the resolution house calendar number 152 House Resolution 741 resolved that during further consideration of the bill HR 4078 to provide that no agency may take any significant regulatory action until the unemployment rate is equal to or less than 6.0 percent instant 102 B strike employment and insert unemployment gentlelady is recognized for one hour Mr Speaker I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be amended by the amendment I have placed at the desk is there an objection mr. Speaker I reserve the right to object gentleman is recognized on this objection Mr Speaker I think we should have an explanation here the clerk read the technical language but as I understand it what happened was that the bill that we were voting on yesterday and will vote on today has an error and gets employment unemployment confused and this is a bill that would correct the error in the bill that we debated yesterday so I wonder why do we now need a unanimous consent is this a are we correcting the correction it's the old Latin phrase Chris custodiet Ipsos custodes who guards the Guardians I guess today the question is who corrects the collectors if she would explain why we had to get a bill to make a correction and now we have to have a unanimous consent to parity to correct the correction what is the error and I appreciate his asking the question because it gives us an opportunity to do a mayor couple that's my my my ability to quote Latin this morning in response to the gentleman from Massachusetts yes there was a very minor error in the rule that was passed just day before yesterday and that was that two letters the letters you the letter n were left off of one word and if you general I would take back tight I'm PP to say if that's the case if the letters you and enveloped out knowing the animosity on that side to you n I can understand why psychologically that would have happened I yield again to the gentlewoman the then in preparing the correction for that inadvertently two numbers were reversed in the number for the resolution so I don't have a quote from Murphy's Law a Latin quote from Murphy's Law but I will say that it appears as though in the attempt to make one correction unfortunately another mistake was made and we would like to move on in his expeditious of fact fashion as we possibly can because we know our colleagues and we are looking forward to a weekend of work at home I I do think this is more than simply a double ever it's a matter of haste and I it is relevant because and I would just take exception to the general Chang well it's important that we get this done right away i think frankly the problem has been that in these past couple of years and to some extent before we haven't met free grow enough i understand people would like to get back to the districts they represent but i think that this is emblematic of our not having enough time to deal with it this is what happens when you try to do too much too soon people on the other side were critical some of the legislation we passed financial reform bill they said it was to encompass a but it went through a much more thorough process than this very controversial even all comprehensive bill we're dealing with today this is a bill that we're dealing with today that deals with every single subject that comes before this Congress because it would put severe restrictions on the adoption of regulations about federal forum about health about the environment about occupational safety about transportation safety and yeah it is a problem when you try to do too much too soon I would like to house to understand where we are procedurally it's my understanding that the house yesterday spent the better part of the day devoting debating a bill which said that regulation should not take effect until unemployment hits ninety-four percent is that the gentleman's understanding yeah that parently that was what was in the bill because and and they said it was a typo that they are the words though that is you and then which I web say there's certainly quality here the day before yes a the mistake was letters today it's numbers I suppose tomorrow will be astrological signs then it's my understanding we found ourselves at the present moment in a situation where the correcting rule that would have fixed the word unemployment to be employment itself has an error in it the error was in the first substantive page this was not buried somewhere deeply so just to reinforce the point that a lot of people didn't read the bill that error which was very much a gentleman oniel that my understanding was is in the fourth paragraph of the first subsequent and if the gentleman wants me to I would yield to the gentleman from North Carolina mr. speaker we are all human beings a mistake was made and then in attempting to correct the mistake an extraordinarily minor mr. other mistake was made as was quoted this morning by one of our colleagues our time is very precious don't waste it by playing gotcha Jennings to make a pre for bipartisanship with this excessively partisan bill that is being put through in such a procedurally inappropriate fashion with major concerns about every aspect of the federal government given ten minutes of debate at nine and ten o'clock at night to be voted on 21 no that's a mistake secondly as a gentleman and the judge and I point out and this it is not simply a mistake was made but it's a mistake that would easily had been caught early if people would read the bill and I stress this because when we did some of the other legislation finance reform health care there was constant repetition of the argument on the Republican side you haven't read the bill nobody's read the bill well you haven't read this bill apparently mr. speaker the house should review the speaker I withdraw my unanimous consent request the bill before us here referencing HR 783 is the Thomasina e Jordan Indian tribes of virginia federal recognition Act of 2011 this act extends federal recognition to several tribes in Virginia and establishes their relationship with the federal government the only problem now with the discussion of this bill is that the corresponding change indicated in the resolution doesn't really make sense as up to this bill again this is a bill that establishes several tribes and yet a corresponding change is being made to the definition of the unemployment rate which I can't find in the bill so I'd like to ask my colleague miss Foxx we're in the bill is the reference the unemployment rate that is being changed in this resolution the gentleman is referencing the wrong bill as the gentleman would see we are dealing with he was quoting the wrong resolution we're dealing with changes to house resolution 783 we reclaiming my time again I looking at the thomas registry HR 783 it's called the Thomasina te Jordan Indian tribes of virginia federal Mr Speaker I and now it's unclear whether we're talking about a tribal recognition bill or a non-existent bill a bill that has not been introduced if there is no out h.res if there is no hrs 783 we are referencing a non-existent bill unless it references to set HR 783 from a previous session but in any event these matters need to be corrected before we can proceed in in any manner Mr Speaker we are not dealing with a House bill we're dealing with House Resolution 783 just one ask the gentlelady from North Carolina what is House Resolution 783 we're having trouble locating it that does not exist mr. speaker

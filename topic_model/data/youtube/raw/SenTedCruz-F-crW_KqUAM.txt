good morning everyone and welcome to our conversation with the newly elected senator from Texas Ted Cruz I'm rich Lowry editor of National Review and as some of you might know I've had a little bit of a complicated relationship with Donald Trump but we had a little bit of a breakthrough I think a while ago I went back to my office and I found this brown envelope from the White House on my desk I was very curious what this was I opened up the envelope and it's this ripped out copy of one of my columns that ran in New York Post and I consider the New York Post the nation's newspaper more importantly the president United States considers a near post the nation's newspaper and this is a column I'd written about how Trump was just such a dominating political and cultural presence there's really no escaping him even for Republicans who want to try to and I thought I had a lot of incisive trenchant commentary in this column made no impression on him what he focused on was the headline that the New York Post editors had put on his column which was there is only Trump and Trump had taken out his black sharpie circled the headline wrote a big arrow down to it and wrote rich so true Donald J Trump so we're going to talk a little bit about nationalism and about the border crisis and Senator a one thing that really came out of this shutdown fight and the contention over building more barrier at the border is we kind of smoked out a foundational issue where you had top Democrats Nancy Pelosi among them saying walls themselves are immoral you had Democrats saying comparing our border barrier to the Berlin Wall the barrier of a totalitarian society meant to keep its people inside rather than people coming legally from outside and this raised the question if you think barriers are immoral what are you gonna do with the barrier we have and someone you know a lot about robert Francis O'Rourke actually answered this question in an interview and said yeah let's break out the bulldozers knocked down the border wall we have in El Paso Texas what do you make of this look I think there's a technical description for what's going on which is that Democrats have gone bat-crap crazy that's a that's a political science term if you look at the medical dictionary it's under B it is in fact a psychosis look they have they're getting more and more and more extreme on every issue think back to the State of the Union the State of the Union was a display of just how radical Democrats have gotten where they embraced you know you know they sat there embracing late term abortion now some of us are old enough to remember Bill Clinton standing there and at least claiming he wanted to see abortion safe legal and rare I wasn't telling the truth but he was at least emphasizing rare that's no longer the position of the Democratic Party they are now for late term abortion up till the moment of birth or if you're Ralph Northam after birth I mean that's that's crazy stuff on immigration you used to have Democrats who would say well yes we should secure the border and we should have amnesty that was the old Democratic position and a lot of Republicans now their position is no don't secure the border at all let everybody in and have amnesty I mean it is disconnected me if you look at the fight over the border wall it's important understand it wasn't about substance so in 2013 not too many years ago Chuck Schumer and every single Democrat in the Senate voted in favor of 350 miles of new border wall the shutdown we just had a month ago was over 234 miles of new border wall same new border wall now look I'm not smart enough to explain how you're for 350 miles of new wall but willing to shut the government down to stop 234 miles of new wall and at the end of the day it's real simple it is emotional visceral hate this is not based on logic they don't have an argument here is their reasoning Trump equals wall we the Democrats hate Trump therefore no wall that's it so let me ask you because I think one of my great frustrations watching how this played out I imagine same is true a lot of people in the room today is Republicans had unified control of government in Washington DC if I'm not mistaken for two years yes and how was it that we only came to focus on achieving one of the president's signature promises when Nancy Pelosi was becoming Speaker of the House what happened in the prior two years that there wasn't funding for the barrier it is a very good question let me say both good and bad let's start with the good I do think with the Republican president Republican majorities in both houses I think we won some big big victories the last two years we shouldn't lose sight of those we pass an historic tax cut the biggest tax cut of a generation that included among other things repealing the Obamacare individual mandate we've repealed job-killing regulations and we're seeing the lowest unemployment in 50 years we're seeing wages going up we're seeing the lowest african-american unemployment that has ever been recorded we're seeing the lowest Hispanic unemployment that has ever been recorded which is why the mainstream media won't cover those facts at all I'm getting there I'm getting there just it's just getting warmed up as I said there's good and bad I'm going to talk about the good first we've also seen strong constitutionalist judges confirmed on foreign policy we're in the middle of the biggest military rebuild since Ronald Reagan we've moved our embassy to Jerusalem and we pulled out of the Iranian nuclear deal those are big big victories and their victories that is conservatives we should be grateful we were able to deliver on now you asked quite rightly why didn't we finish the job on immigration why didn't we build the wall why didn't we deliver on more promises I agree with you we should have done much much more and I can tell you last summer starting in August I did a long presentation to Senate Republicans that said look if you look at history unified control of the federal government both houses of Congress and the presidency it's exceptionally rare for Republicans it's it has happened a total of eight years since World War two and I said that everyone recognizes there's a real chance we're going to lose at least one house of Congress in November if that's true I think at the time there were a hundred and eighty-three days to go and I entitled the presentation carpe diem seize the day if we have a hundred and eighty-three days left to legislate let's do that and what I urged is let's use vehicles that the Democrats can't filibuster in particular let's use something called Budget Reconciliation which you know y'all will remember was the vehicle that we passed the tax cut on in 2017 what matters about reconciliation is it's immune from filibuster so you can pass legislation and the Democrats can't stop it and what I urged my colleagues and I urge the president I urge the vice president I urge the administration let's take up a budget reconciliation and let's build the wall let's fund the wall let's get it done and I want you just to imagine if they had taken that advice if we had had that fight and you had seen Elizabeth Warren screaming on the Senate floor to stop at Bernie Sanders pulling what little hair he has out of his head in september/october and it culminated with Republicans standing together funding and building the wall I'll tell you right now rich I don't think we would have lost the House of Representatives so let's let's dig a little deeper because I I talked about how in the border fight you saw some foundational issues surfaced and I think the one that that really is deepest here there's a question whether we should have borders and the question of the legitimacy of the nation and the nation state and of nationalism and there's kind of a loose notion out there the National is something the Prussians came up with you know these jackbooted thugs really in the Western world the foundational nation for the way we think about this was ancient Israel God says to Abraham I will make of thee a great nation and he does and read in numbers there's a enormous path passage where God actually sets out the borders of Israel like he's a surveyor it's gonna go around this hill down here go over here and what's so amazing about this story is there's gonna be a distinct people with a distinct territory and they never give up that idea of the nation no matter what tragedies and catastrophes befall them you have Jews revolting against Rome to reestablish their nation and amazingly you know two millennia later they do succeed in reestablishing their nation and in 1982 Menachem Bagan Prime Minister of Israel they find the bones of some of the Jewish rebels from the last revolt against the Romans in a cave somewhere they excavate these they bury them with military honors and Bagan says dear fathers we are here in this place and we'll never leave ever again in a nutshell that is nationalism that is concern for your own nation and I'm curious senator how you think about this issue that Donald Trump was brought to the fore has been hugely controversial he's been criticized by the great and good all over the world including the president of France saying that that there's something wrong with this attitude towards the nation you know the very opening words of the movie The Godfather our it's a little bit later the opening words are I believe in America let me tell you look I believe in America and one of the things that drives the media and drives the far-left crazy about President Trump is that he's willing to actually stand up and defend America [Applause] there are many pathologies that afflict the left but one of them is a fundamental embarrassment about America's greatness you saw that with Obama you saw it when he started his presidency going on a worldwide apology tour where those on the left are embarrassed they're embarrassed about our prosperity they're embarrassed about our freedom you know we saw it manifested actually just this week if any of you all happen to see it in a really idiotic rant you're wondering who because there are a lot of people that can cut it could have made that but this particular one was Bill Maher and Bill Maher had this rant about he said red states want to be blue states where the cool people and they want to be just like us now let me point out it was precisely that arrogant condescending smug superiority that is why Hillary Clinton lost and Donald Trump won in 2016 and if you desire to lead interacting with your fellow citizens saying you guys are a bunch of dumb ignorant boobs that need to shut up and listen to me is perhaps not the best message I'll also say as a Texan I can say authoritative ly no Texan has ever desired to be from any other state in the country or the history of the universe [Applause] in fact people from the blue state California are moving in vast numbers by the way the blue states with high taxes high regulations their people are fleeing because they don't have jobs we saw it look when New York chased Amazon out because a bunch of New York socialists said now by the way let's pause for a second what on earth was Amazon doing you're doing a nationwide search where do you want to base your second headquarters I know New York City you almost deserve the pestilence that happens to you if you go into that willingly going okay they're a bunch of crazy socialist let's go there what do you think they'll do when we get there but the center you got it you got to focus on is aoc said the three billion dollar a windfall that's gonna accrue to New York from chasing on Amazon you can be commissioned a lot of cows with that kind of money I look minute magic money by the way let me say I support cows I hope to see PETA supporting the Republican Party now that the Democrats want to kill all the cows but when it comes to defending America who we are look look we are a nation of immigrants my dad came from Cuba with nothing but when you come to America as an immigrant you come because you want to believe in you want to be part of you want to be an American and I'll tell you being the child of an immigrant makes you love and value and cherish the incredible freedom that is this country and so let me just close by saying the men and women of CPAC the young people of CPAC it's going to take every one of you speaking out volunteering energizing giving money using your voice because we're going to see a crazed assault from the left more unhinged than anything we have seen now there's also the good news if we turn common sense conservatives out we can win [Applause] ladies and gentlemen Ted Cruz thank you very much [Applause]

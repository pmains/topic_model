uh thank you mr chairman and thank you all for being here this morning and participating in today's hearing farm bill conservation programs as we all know have generally generated wide bipartisan support in congress and wide adopting white adoption amongst farmers and ranchers the extensive participation in conservation program i believe comes from the flexibility for individualized operations incentives for locally led and voluntary efforts and coordination with state technical committees in regards to climate specifically i think it's important in my priorities would be to make sure that whatever we do is producer-focused voluntary not at the expense of other programs and also make sure that we don't penalize our early adopters and things that are already happening um to that effect i guess my first question would be to you uh mr connor you know for decades producers across the big first district my district in kansas and the country have taken advantage of incentive based programs by voluntarily making changes on their farms and ranches to be efficient stewards of their resources recently and i'm starting to hear a lot from producers that have been implementing no-till practices for decades but they would not qualify to participate in carbon market programs because their practice is not considered new in some cases these producers were told they would need to farm conventionally for two growing seasons just to qualify for for carbon market programs can you expand on the importance of voluntary conservation efforts and discuss why it's important for congress you know to make sure that we don't hinder or penalize our early adopters it's a great question congressman let me just say that our the importance of these programs is is really um top line and and not only because they have been effective in the past and as i noted earlier these programs have solved many of the challenges that we have faced in american agriculture before and done so in a way that again has been income enhancing and that's that's the bottom line in terms of our recommendations and we believe that that can be done here for the early adopters this is something the the the food and ag climate allies struggled with i will just tell you that we ended up with a recommendation that simply uh suggested that there be a one-time payment in addition to what other subsequent payments may be coming down the pike a one-time payment to those early adopters to compensate them for you know the work that they have done on their farms and certainly not to penalize and i would even add a worst-case scenario where they might tear up conservation practices only to be able to collect you know for the new ones and and obviously that that's just borderline stupidity to have that kind of policy in place so um we struggled with it we came up with a recommendation but it's certainly an area in the farm bill where we want to work with this committee to develop what is the appropriate concept compensation for those early adopters because they need it and should get it yeah no i appreciate that and appreciate how producer i'm focused your your organization group is on these issues i heartily agree um one last question would be for a doctor outlaw one of my top priorities in my role on this committee is protecting crop insurance it's absolutely vital to our ag producers all over my district all over the country we want to make sure that we protect crop insurance so that producers can sustain their operations year after year even in the face in the face of uncertain weather my question is what do you consider the role of crop insurance to be when dealing with uncertain or extreme weather events and how should crop insurance enter into the overall conversation we're having about climate practices well i think it's very involved the weather patterns local weather patterns has helped define a farmer's aph which helps define their coverage and so crop insurance and conservation programs go hand in hand the the issue i have and what i testified too was that trying to link those together in my opinion is not a good idea um primarily because you can you can always create winners and losers with with programs and if if as as an example of your producers in your state are not able to take advantage of some of these programs then they wouldn't get the premium discounts that some of the folks are suggesting would be out there so i i suggested in my testimony that people need to pay really close attention to trying to link these programs together there are many programs and many outlets through usda to get money to producers to do climate friendly practices climate smart practices it doesn't have to be tied to crop insurance thank you all my time is expiring with that i yield back thanks mr chairman

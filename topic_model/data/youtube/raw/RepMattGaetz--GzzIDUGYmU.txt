what made the economy grow what reduced the bureaucratic burden in our society and what actually made our communities healthier cleaner it's just technology for you yes thank the gentleman for yielding and with all due respect the gentleman from Arizona he's very weird in that he runs his congressional office like a think-tank where people contemplate the ways the technology can improve healthcare and the environment in a non-partisan way because these are not issues that have anything to do with whether someone is a Republican or a Democrat but just so many of these ideas that we the gentleman and I have discussed for years failed to make their way into a the most dynamic economy and market place in the world which is the United States of America and so my question for the gentleman is how do we go from the innovative space of great American's coming up with sensor technology to action in the Congress or within our government that is that is worthy of the great people we serve and I yield back to the gentleman and thank him for the gentleman be willing to enter into a colloquy so we can just go back and forth I would okay look you're one of my buddies from Florida you actually get this but you also know I actually love the technology disruptions because none of us have figured out if it's Republican or Democrat yet which actually makes it possible for us to do it now eventually we will break it into partisan because everything has become weaponized and partisan around this body but right now think of this this is a natural gas electric facility it can power 5,000 homes it is up and running outside Houston it doesn't have a smokestack all the a co2 so all the carbon is captured they actually came up with this brilliant technology that the carbon actually flows through and I believe in fact my understanding of the engineering it helps spin the turbines and then the excess carbon that's that's generated is saved and sold we actually have a tax credit that was we adjusted I hopefully made it more robust as we did tax reform that if you want to take some of that carbon and put it and concrete our piece of plastic are do it for certain types of oil recovery those things will generally yield for a question was it a refundable tax credit excuse me was it a refundable tax credit it's actually a tax credit according to the amount of tonnage you produce sorts of production yeah and and but the beauty of it is that model has said we've actually already created a value on this carbon and if you don't put it into the environment but actually use it for other things as a filler and plastics as a filler in concrete and putting it back in the ground to enhance recovery we're already doing it and this technology isn't utopianism it exists it's already running it's already power well how many times around here we talked about that we could actually have a hydrocarbon generation that without a smokestack the technology exists we if we're gonna talk about you know a green agenda we actually all need to sit down and actually meet with the really smart researchers and scientists and actually understand the math and science that science is way ahead of where our heads are at and you have some you know amazing technologies coming out of your state right now on everything from bio generation to the ways to manage the environment well and I would ask the gentleman you know as as we try to take these good ideas that seem to not be emerging from the federal government but from the several states from local communities that are doing some of their own great work you know I feel at times like you got one party here that thinks that big government's always the answer you got another party that thinks that big business is always the answer and at times these technological solutions come from neither they they come from the creative class the innovative class that's actually a brilliant way to phrase it brilliant and look my continuing thought experiment and this is a little beyond where we were going but it makes the point you know visit Washington DC or a bunch of other locations now they're not going to give you a straw are they're going to give you a paper straw the math is and this actually I believe comes from the United Nations not percent of all the plastic in the ocean and and look it's a big deal that I'm looking at my data here roughly eight million tons a year plastic goes in the ocean you're from the coastal state comes from ten rivers eight of them in Asia two of them in Africa if you actually really cared about plastic in the ocean that eight million tons we would actually take our environmental policy our trade policy our foreign aid policy and say we're going to actually help these ten rivers that are responsible for 90% of the plastic in the ocean and work on those but instead we do these feel-good absurd theatrical things of my community isn't going to do straws don't we feel better that we did something for plastic in the ocean it had nothing to do with plastic in the ocean it's these ten rivers let's grow up and stop the political theater and so what what is what is the get-out-of-jail-free card so that we can liberate ourselves from a policymaking climate that seems to be more robust in virtue signaling than actually following data I knew you were gonna say virtue signal look is a little bit sarcastic and I and I mean it more to be slightly in the humor side one of the first things every member of Congress should put into their budgets is the ownership of a calculator because we functionally work in a math free zone where our feelings become public policy instead of the baseline data where we can actually have a impact making our society in the world healthier more economically prosperous and if you were actually genuinely cared about plastic in the ocean we got ten rivers 90% of the plastic we know exactly where they are focus there instead of the absurdity of the straw at your local whatever well I appreciate I appreciate the gentleman mentioning our oceans as someone from a coastal state that means a great deal to me well and coming from Arizona we have sort of this utopian view that one day Arizona may become a coastal state well based on the current rate of climate change you may get your wish but on earthquake yeah it doesn't it doesn't strike me as an enviable outcome I but I do thank the gentleman again for for yielding some of his time for this discussion and it is my sincere hope that this is a discussion that we can have with members of Congress from urban districts rural districts liberal members conservative members because as the gentleman correctly points out these are actually solutions that do not lend themselves to a partisan tilt and I'm sincerely hopeful that the gentleman will continue to lead on the subject I yield back and I thank the gentleman you're very kind thank you for the colloquy

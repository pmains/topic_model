mr. president those of us who have had a chance over some time now to work with the former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich knows that he is a man of ideas and often thinking well beyond the moment I had a chance the other day to read a paper that he'd prepared on president Trump's moon Mars development project and I want to borrow heavily from his thinking as I talk about this project today it's an important time we just spent significant time remembering appreciating looking back at the 50th anniversary of American astronauts landing on the moon and returning safely 50 years goes quicker than you might think but really for the first time in that 50 years we're really at a point where there is a chance that we could cease to be the leading power in space we decided we were going to lead become the leading power in space we became the leading power in space we have been the leading power in space but that's not necessarily a given and you can only last so long living on your past accomplishments President Trump on the 4th of July made this comment he said I want you to know that we are going back to the moon very soon and someday soon we'll plan an American flag on Mars my guess is that that was received was sort of the same amount of skepticism that President Kennedy's challenge was 50 more than 50 years ago now there's no question that the Artemis project that President Trump is talking about is not the Apollo project 50 years later this is no longer an effort just to get somewhere and get back we know we can do that it is an effort to look at where we might go next and why we might benefit from that you know in May of 1961 President Kennedy challenged the Congress by saying we should commit our to achieving the goal I was talking about the goal of getting to the moon we should commit ourselves to achieving the goal before this decade is out and landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth pretty heavy skepticism I think 58 percent of the American people polled that they were opposed to doing that why would we send somebody to the moon why would we want worry about whether we could get them there and of course if we got them there we want to get them back but there was great skepticism so almost a year later a little over a year later at Rice University President Kennedy tried again to explain that he said we chose we we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard that's one of the famous quotes that if you look back at President Kennedy's challenge to the country you hear we're going not because it's easy but because they are hard he said went on to say because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one we are willing to accept and he said we are unwilling to postpone and we intend to win there's nothing wrong with in America who wants to win there's nothing wrong with in America who doesn't want to take second place there's nothing wrong wrong with in America that wants to set a standard that everybody else could hope to achieve we've been caught a little flat-footed in the in the mid 50s when the Russians put a satellite in space the Sputnik and Americans would go out and see if they could measure when it was passing over that you put something up there that appeared to perpetually be there and then there was a cosmonaut in space but President Kennedy said we don't accept anything more than the opportunity to meet and meet big challenges and show what we can do to test ourselves so the Vice President of the United States vice president pence said at the National Space Council in Huntsville Alabama on March the 26th of this year he said 50 years ago is one small step for man became one giant leap for mankind had to be really trying to avoid it to not hear that quote last week as it was being repeated over and over going over and over again but pred the vice president said but now it's time for us to make the next giant leap and return American astronauts to the moon established a permanent base there and developed the technologies to take American astronauts to Mars and beyond that's the next giant leap according to the vice president you'll note here that the direct connection between the moon development and going to Mars as the president put it is there it's the reason to go back to the moon it's the reason to do what we can to understand the moon our goal is not just getting to the moon of course we've already done that our goal is to be there and to do that in a way that works for us now john Marburger the vice president george w bush's science advisor said in 2006 the moon is the closest source of the material that lies out of Earth's gravity this closest place we can go and get material that can be used with 3d printing and all sorts of things things are possible to construct on the moon that weren't possible to construct anywhere in that same way just a few years ago the first phase of science on the moon would be a lot like Antarctica I haven't been to Antarctica I'd like to go sometime but you know we don't go we don't have people on Antarctica because Antarctica is an easy place to live we have people staying all the time on Erica to see what we can learn by being on the the continent of Antarctica all the time the the next phase of the Moon would be like that where people go to the moon they stay on the moon look at opportunities on the parts of the Moon where we believe there's ice and I know the formula for this if you've got ice you've probably got some form of water and if you can got what got water lots of things can happen that might not happen otherwise this is a project that will inspire others to want to be part of it whether it's Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk or Richard Branson or Paul Allen who has passed on but was intrigued by the moon they are all people that have great private resources you know the founding of America was founded on a public-private model Jamestown Pilgrim plantation the East India Company all were private individuals with government sponsorship trying to make something happen that wouldn't happen otherwise that I'd suggest mr. president can happen on the moon in Newt Gingrich telling of the challenge on the moon he repeated that great story of what happened at Wollman Rink and how it might relate to what can happen on the moon if you're just not bound by the normal things that bind a lot of people every person thinking about the Moon Mars project according to former speaker Gingrich should look at what Donald Trump did at the Wollman Rink the Wollman Rink was a very popular site for ice skating in New York City in 1980 when it broke down and it totally broke down the city of New York spent six years and 13 million dollars trying to fix the ice rink fortunately I guess for the city of New York and ice skaters that go there the abandoned ice rink happened to be within sight the president Trump's apartment and he kept complaining about the ice rink the failure of the city to do anything about the ice rink finally Mayor Koch Mayor Koch just said to the to Donald Trump well why don't you fix it if you think this is so easily done and he did he fixed the ice rink in four months for two and a quarter million dollars I remember the city door he spent 13 million in failing to fix the ice rink two and a quarter million dollars the first year after the ice rink was fixed 225,000 people skated on the ice rink and one reason that the president was able to do that as a private citizen was he just wasn't bound by the things that bound most people he wasn't bound by the things that bind the government the historic project to fix the Wollman Rink achieved the goal of a fifth the cost and 118th the time that the city had used not to get it done and ice skaters flourished well the same kinds of things can happen if we look beyond their normal boundaries of what could happen in this project that the presidents talked about in March of this year again going back to the vice president and remember by the way on the that the effort to get to the moon President Kennedy turned that project over to the vice president president vice president Johnson and said you're going to be in charge of NASA and you're going to be the point person on the moon project so there's a little history there maybe repeating itself when in March of this year at Huntsville Alabama the vice president outlined the principles that we could use to meet the goals that the president had established for our efforts in space now principle one mr. president was established a big goal and then stick to it remember why do we go to the moon to start with not because it was easy but because it was hard established a big goal and then stick to it failure to achieve our goal to return astronauts to the moon in the next five years according to the vice president not an option principle to be prepared to reach outside the traditional bureaucracy to new entrepreneurial private companies if it's necessary to get the job done and we're known to say we're not committed to any one contractor we're not committed to any one company if our current contractors can't do what we think they can do we'll find new ones if American industry can provide critical commercial services without government development then we'll buy into that project and share it with them if commercial rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the moon in the next five years then commercial rockets will be the way we return to the moon and principle three said be willing to change the bureaucracy rather than abandon the goal if we call on NASA to not just adopt new policies but to embrace a new mindset that really begins with setting a bold goal and staying on schedule a new mindset matters failure is not an option the willingness to postpone our goal as President Kennedy said almost 60 years ago not an option principle five was be determined to change the bureaucracy in fundamental ways NASA must transform itself into a leader more accountable organization if NASA is not currently capable of landing American astronauts men and women on the moon in five years we need to change the organization not change the mission and then principle five which by the way mr. president I know in your case this is coming from private business this might be your most important principle urgency must replace complacency the hardest thing to achieve in government is just to drive to a result and that fifth principle that the vice president set out is exactly that it's not just competition against our adversaries it's frankly competition against our worst enemy complacency competition against our own willingness to believe that things aren't going to happen that clearly can happen this is a great goal it is a step being the moon and beyond it's a step outside our solar system two other solar systems in our lifetime may not see much of that but it's not about our lifetime this is about a step into the future I applaud the president and the vice president for their leadership here I look forward to applying those five principles and by the way I think almost all of those principles are five principles we could apply to government every day and have a more effective government if we do

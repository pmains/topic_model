uh thank you madam chair and um thank you very much to congresswoman fatkowski for bringing this bill forward i too am a proud co-sponsor the roe versus wade decision has been the law of our land for nearly 50 years and today the house is stepping forward following the current supreme court's failure to uphold decades of american jurisprudence i want to associate myself with my colleagues remarks about the importance of this bill which will protect reproductive freedom for people across the country so that everyone has the same access to reproductive health care the bill affirms what our constitution and international human rights bodies long-held that access to reproductive health care is central to health and to equality women living in texas should have the same access to care as women living in california i also want to highlight this discrepancy between the rhetoric and policies of opponents of reproductive freedom and mr morelli highlighted some of these things but i want to highlight it particularly on the subject of medicaid these opponents claim to be pro-life to be working to protect families and babies but almost always these are the same people who oppose medicaid expansion we see that in texas and we see that in my state of north carolina in the united states today babies who don't get prenatal care are more than five times are five times more likely to die than babies who do get prenatal care prenatal care is one of the many critical forms of health care that medicaid covers so sadly several of the states that want to limit the right to reproductive freedom will not extend these medicaid benefits medicaid also provides postpartum care coverage to new mothers and the american rescue plan gave states the option to extend that coverage from 60 days to 12 months postpartum care protects new moms from a variety of serious conditions that can develop following birth again sadly many of these same states have not taken advantage of that expansion if you want to protect babies it's simply hypocritical to claim to be pro-life to support the draconian texas abortion ban while simultaneously opposing medicaid expansion this spill does nothing to force women to have abortions a woman should have a choice along with her family her health care provider and her conscience this bill simply makes sure that all women in this country have the same choice i look forward to supporting it on the floor thank you i yield back

thank you mr chair uh last tuesday during his first state of the union address the president highlighted an issue i know my colleagues care deeply about and that's youth mental health the issue has been one of the center pieces of my legislative agenda in fact in march i joined the chair congressman cardenas to introduce youth mental health and suicide prevention act legislation to support positive mental health promotion and suicide prevention programs in high schools the bill would authorize hhs to establish a grant program for school districts to strengthen behavioral health services awareness and address mental health and suicide prevention needs additionally i have worked with congresswoman caster to continually advocate for kids safety online aiming to create online spaces that have a positive impact on youth mental health through the kids internet design and safety act or kids and most recently my office has been investigating online suicide forums and the ways they encourage and provide instruction to struggling youth these are big issues they require new regulations new funding streams and agency resources today we're talking about something that may feel simple to a lot of folks changing clocks but changing clocks can impact teen mental health and that is what i want to explore today dr malo can you speak as to why a consistent sleep pattern is important for teen brain development and mental health i referenced in my written testimony a consensus statement of the american academy of sleep medicine on health and the consequences for our kids i was fortunate enough to be one of the authors on this it was published in 2016 but i think things are even more grim these days with with teen mental health and we basically talked about what are the consequences when kids are not getting the sleep they need and we specifically talked about mental health including risk of self-harm suicide thoughts and suicide attempts so i really appreciate you bringing this forward when kids sleeping better they are less apt to take a role in risk taking activity and suicide issues and the best way i think there's a few simple things our country could do at either this the state level with the with the later schools part times that's been brought up um by others today and then of course um having more light in the morning to promote sleep which would be the um the permanent standard time uh and i still command you for bringing that up because i think that the mental health of our our children is is critical right now thank you doctor um and professor uh calendrillo how could extra sunlight in the evening encourage outdoor play have you seen any data regarding an increase in outdoor play correlating with less screen time for children i really appreciate that question and i i agree with everything that dr maloney said but i actually think that the mental health issue and certainly the screen time issue these are all bettered by permanent daylight saving time not permanent standard time no kids going at 4 30 a.m or 5 30 a.m or 6 30 a.m in the morning they do that at 4 30 or 5 30 or 6 30 p.m um and that's what gets kids outside like my kids enjoying outdoor unsupervised and by the way you know in terms of the mental health goals right you know there is a big problem with with seasonal infections or depression uh if you don't have sunlight in the part of the day when you're awake to use it which is the afternoon and evening 99 of the public awake kids are awake they're not only half of america is weak in the morning uh we need to i think both i think the depressions uh statistics the health outcome measures the other economic measures all would be served moving that power into the part where more people can use it well thank you for that mr beckwith do you have anything to add um i am not a doctor uh so i don't really have any comment about mental health i will briefly though um the comment that moving the clock ahead one hour once a year is dangerous really begs the common sense question if that's true we have bigger problems if you look at your colleagues every sunday or monday majority of your cogs are returning from their districts they're returning with one two three hours of sleep deprivation and let's not even talk about the ones from hawaii alaska so if setting the clocks ahead one hour is dangerous flying east is deadly yeah thank you for that look mental health challenges have become a national crisis and as a mother of five this issue hits home and it's worth thinking about a variety of legislative approaches that could address the problem including putting an end to changing the clocks thank you mr chair i yield back

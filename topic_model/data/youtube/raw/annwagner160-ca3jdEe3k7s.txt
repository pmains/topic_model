Thank You mr. chairman and secretary Pompeo thank you for your your time here this morning on January 3rd president Trump ended kasama salaam on his brutal brutal reign of terror that killed and maimed countless Americans and coalition forces and threatened many more to come as we've heard today and many times over for too long Tehran has been permitted to act with impunity against US allies US interests and personnel I was proud when the administration acted decisively to restore deterrence in the Middle East just as I was proud when former President Obama succeeded in his decision to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan this was a defensive move to strike one of the world's most powerful terrorists who was organizing against attacks against Americans in Iraq in defiance of UN Security Council resolution 2231 I applaud the president for making our red lines clear to the Iranian regime attacking Americans is never acceptable and when American lives hang in the balance Iran will be held to account for its actions the Middle East is a safer place than the United States is as you said clear and consistent in its intentions soleimani successor mr. secretary as head of the cuts force is male Connie was Salah manias counterpart in countries east of Iran Afghanistan Pakistan and Central Asian Republic while sulla money's headed operations in the West the secretary are you concerned that Connie will seek to expand Iran's malign activities in Afghanistan and how is the administration mitigating the risk to US interests so I can say more about Iranian activity in Afghanistan in the classified setting but I will say in this forum they share a long border there is a history of Iran engaging in activity inside of Afghanistan to act as a spoiler we've seen just these last six days a significant reduction in violence in Afghanistan and we are watching closely to see if the Islamic Republic of Iran begins to take even more active measures active measures that undermine our efforts to peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan and just as importantly put our American soldiers who were on the ground there in both the Kabul area and in the West at risk as well yep this guy had this as part of his his territory we are we are very mindful that that's an area he knows well and might well seek to expand Iranian activity both through the goods force in otherwise I'm glad you're on top of it how did the Soleimani strike change the IRGC standing in Iran and have we been able to take advantage of any loss of prestige through information operations in Iran Soleimani was a strategic target there was strategic deterrence that resulted from that strike he was absolutely a terrorist he axel lutely had American blood on his hands he absolutely intended to kill more Americans in the immediate future but he also occupied a position which was very close to the Ayatollah and there is no one that is going to be capable of replacing that strategic input that he was be able able to provide to the Ayatollah and therefore we believe that only did we achieve the battlefield deterrence that his departure now has led to but we also have changed the calculus inside of Iran and the understanding your point about the the redline it is not possible for the Islamic Republic of Iran to have been surprised by the action as president Trump too we had communicated clearly that the loss of American lives would result in a strike of significance that would impose real costs on Iran so we exercise deterrence by making sure they understood what America was prepared to do and then when they took actions that were inconsistent with the things that we had told them we executed against that very quickly media reports this week's show that the Vice President of Iran as well as Iran's top health official have both contracted Karuna virus are you able to comment on the potential destabilization of Iran were there senior political leadership to be deathly ill or even perhaps die specifically does the state have concerns about a void in leadership as it relates to their nuclear program and the cuts force I don't have it I don't have very much information about beyond what we've seen in the open press reporting and as I said earlier we're gonna do what we can on the humanitarian side to assist the Iranian people against building out their systems inside of the country I think of your time I yield back

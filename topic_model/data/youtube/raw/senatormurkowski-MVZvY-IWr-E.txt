uh i look forward to the opportunity to discuss the president's budget request this morning in a number of specific activities that the budget uh proposes to support i appreciate my colleague and the chairman leading off with a discussion about fire it's uh it's pretty tough in alaska right now we're up to about 2.8 million acres burned already we had 13 new fires just in the past 24 hours the smoke issues particularly in the interior have been a real challenge this summer but we've seen it out in other parts of of the state as well it's dry and the good news for us right now is that the rains are coming and and that's a positive but uh we need to make sure that we're not just praying for rain as the as the policy here to make sure that the fire threat doesn't doesn't bring about further damage obviously some some differing views on the committee here in terms of our energy resources and and how we utilize them to the benefit of our country uh certainly to the benefit of places like alaska which is a of course a producing state so i'd like to talk uh about a few of the uh the the issues um and i'll be a little parochial here just to start off but on friday the bureau of land management released a draft uh supplemental eis for the willow project within the npra and i think you saw the press release on that i welcomed that step i can't stress enough the need for the department to to move forward with final approval for the willow project it is my very sincere hope that the department will will soon be able to issue permits so work can begin on this project during the the upcoming winter season 22-23 we have had the conversation madam secretary i've had the conversation with the president i've had the conversation with just about everybody in the administration that will listen to me on willow because i i firmly believe that we need to have a realistic plan for the future of our energy supply and i think that alaska definitely fits within that plan um the chairman mentioned the the near record high gas prices that that families are are are seeing um it's bad all over the country but if you're in a community like yakitat i i follow the the the weekly gas prices in various communities around the state yakitat is paying about seven dollars and 25 cents uh a gallon for fuel it's just tough and so they're asking me what what are the tools that are available what can the administration be doing what can congress be doing to to help to help dampen these price increases that we're seeing and and for me it comes down to to the basics of of economic supply and and demand and i am one who believes very strongly that that the administration and here in this country we need to use those tools at our disposal to increase domestic production to improve our energy security particularly as we're seeing the the global disruptions and and the unrest and i've i've said it before and i'll say it again alaska stands ready willing and certainly able to be a big part of that solution all while we insist on on meeting the highest environmental standards in the world the chairman has mentioned the five-year plan for the offshore oil and gas that the department recently proposed and again given what we're seeing here at home over in europe i truly truly believe that our national security interests require that we increase our domestic supply of these resources including from from our offshore areas um you know i've heard i've heard the reference before that that oil is is an addiction i recognize that we have a reliance on it but when i think of of an addiction like a heroin addiction i think about it as as as something that there is no there is no upside to to heroin addiction um our our reality as a country is that we have a resource that not only we need right now but the world needs right now um and it is not just to fuel our vehicles i think we're we're we're moving to to different transportation fuels but that is a transition but everything everything that we we use practically has some aspect of petroleum in it and and so until we can figure out what that substitute is this petroleum base that really powers and moves and and allows us to function as a modern society is is something is something that is in demand and again we can choose to to look to others to meet that demand and make ourselves more vulnerable more reliant on others and particularly others that don't even like us or whose environmental track record is awful or whose human rights track record is awful so i uh i have said as we transition from a a fossil-based society a transition requires that there be a a path forward that is sensible for your economy and and sensible uh really technologically and so we got a lot of work to do there i feel strongly when it comes to the five-year plan that the administration has has to move move and move quickly to finalize a plan that keeps at least the current acreage available for offshore leasing including in in my state but your proposed plan included the option of holding no lease sale at all which i i think that that's unacceptable um for the department to even consider a five-year plan that would include no lease sales i just don't think makes sense and i i think it's actually harmful to our economy and our national security the national interest demands the administration avoid a costly gap in leasing and that it conducts offshore sales i want to see annual sales in cook inlet not one sale every five years failure to have meaningful oil and gas programs including in the 1002 area where the administration is illegally disregarding the law will reduce domestic investment at the worst possible time for our country and for our global allies i think the president needs to focus on places like alaska not saudi arabia not venezuela not iran and then and then work with us to achieve just that so i've said before madam secretary alaska is is willing uh and able and ready to increase our nations and our allies energy security all we really need is permission from the federal government to get moving get those permits and and we are there another area where i'm hoping to see progress with the administration is in its commitment to mineral development i do appreciate the the president's invocation of the defense production act and the department's budget request to support uh critical mineral efforts i think again um making sure that we are focusing on on supply where we have the supply and we certainly have that in this country matters domestic supply matters to our energy security it also matters to our mineral security um and like oil and gas one of the keys here to meeting this challenge is for the department to actually make mind permit determinations in a timely manner we've heard not only in this committee but we've certainly heard in the energy committee that if we want to be competitive globally if we want to be a producer and not just an importer we cannot afford for it to take 10 years to permit a mine on public lands i want to work with the department to ensure that our our vast potential is realized in alaska whether it's gold or silver or copper all of our critical minerals but it seems that for every step forward we take on policy we're taking two steps backwards on projects um perfect example of that is the ambler access road just kind of stunning that the administration has openly conflicted its commitment to supply chain security and deliberately set back one of its best options to improve it ambler has a guaranteed right-of-way under a 1980 law under anilca that the federal government has to has to abide by i do understand of course the need for tribal consultation i strongly support it but that can occur even as access project continues so telling ambler to stop all work and lose a field season i think is is a ridiculous approach that undermines any credibility the administration may be seeking on mineral security we what we need here is a strategic focus to reduce our dependence on china and russia other adversarial nations but not not an incoherent approach on minerals so madam secretary to an area that i think we have much more agreement on and that's working together to provide resources to our tribal communities whether we're talking about public safety and justice natural resources construction programs working uh with our tribes uh throughout alaska and in indian country i think that this has been one of those areas where we do have bipartisan support we do have bicameral priority we know that the approach appropriations process is never quick it's never easy but as we work through the process i do think it's important for us to continue this bipartisan approach to these issues to ensure high priority program areas like pl2 programs are funded and then i want to to to wrap my remarks by thanking you for coming to alaska to hear from so many alaskans the trip that you took to to not only visit with people who came to anchorage to meet with you the the meetings that you had but also your travels to see firsthand some of the unique challenges and opportunities i think this is particularly illustrated by our visit to king cove and your opportunity to hear from residents about the critical need for a life-saving road so i do appreciate that and value the time that you gave us for that so as you consider this and other alaska specific issues i hope you will build upon the experience that you had on the ground and consider the views of those most directly impacted by departmental decisions i know that um there are many areas where where you and i just we don't see eye to eye on on some of these matters related to alaska but i appreciate your willingness to work with me on areas that we do have agreement um and i am ever hopeful that as you're you're continuing to hear from alaskans you will come to understand our state and the potential that it has really as a as an economic center and and what we can provide and contribute for energy and mineral security well at the same time an equal priority is to to protect uh and care for our lands and our people we need a lot from the department more than we're getting right now but thank you thank you for being here um mr chairman i appreciate a little indulgence with the uh with the length of time and opening but much to be said this morning

I thank chairman Goodlatte and ranking member Nadler for your commitment to our veterans and thank you for bringing this legislation before the committee today I briefly like to recognize my Florida colleague and veteran Tom Rooney first for his service to this country but also to thank him for his ongoing commitment to his fellow veterans through the preventing crimes against veterans Act that we introduced together the legislation before us today was born out of the recognition that current law simply has not kept pace with the growing sophistication of scam artists and fraudsters seeking to take advantage of America's veterans I'd also like to thank Greg Dover of Palm Beach County Veterans Services who has highlighted this ongoing abuse of our veterans by scam artists and has helped make the case for this legislation I've heard too many stories from my own constituents veterans survivors and families who have been taken advantage of through so-called pension poaching schemes these scams that target the Supplemental Aid and Attendance pension benefit in one case a veteran responded to a solicitation with the hope of securing additional pension benefits he was met with high-pressure sales tactics in his own home the sales representative tried to convince him to apply for benefits that he did not want and that he was not eligible for in addition to filing an improper claim on the veterans behalf the scammer lied told the veteran that he was required to enter into a long-term home health care contract to receive the benefits pension poacher's combed through South Florida's senior communities to find targets in one case after a high-pressure briefing at a senior community a scammer filed inaccurate claims on behalf of the veteran that intentionally withheld spousal income in order to unlock additional benefits veteran paid excessive filing fees of over $600 but that wasn't the worst of it the VA eventually learned about the additional unreported income they learned that the veteran was not eligible and sought to claw back nearly $50,000 in overpayments by the time the veteran was left in financial ruin the scammer had disappeared and could not be found as our senior populations continue to grow more and more aging veterans will require assistance with activities of daily living that the Veterans Aid and Attendance benefit can provide the application and financial eligibility requirements offer an opportunity for scam artists to take advantage of our older American veterans with empty promises and often with hidden consequences aging veterans and their families are forced to wade through a thicket of complicated health and financial issues under stressful circumstances they shouldn't have to do it alone but they certainly shouldn't be taken advantage of either by scammers who wrongly claim that they are looking out for our veterans the daunting process of applications and appeals can make veterans survivors and families attractive markets to sophisticated fraud artists companies an individual scammers seek to build trust in a moment of need to sell them phony financial products in the end veterans are left with their life savings and other assets out of reach and additional benefits that are rounded directly to the scammer the Federal Trade Commission and the Florida Division of Consumer Services provide public awareness resources to assist veterans families and veteran's service organizations to help them avoid known scams but there are currently no criminal penalties that are imposed when scammers violate prohibitions against charging fees for benefit assistance services this leaves law enforcement and consumer protection agencies with limited resources to combat these terrible schemes this legislation will provide law enforcement with the tools necessary to fight back against penchant poachers and other scammers it will root out scam operations and it will protect our veterans from falling victim to these ploys I urge my fellow committee members to import' to support this important legislation I thank the many veterans groups who are supporting our efforts as well and I thank the Chairman and the ranking member again for their support and I yield back the balance of my time

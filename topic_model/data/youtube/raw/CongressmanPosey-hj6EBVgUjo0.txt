i thank you chair roman waters one of the charter purposes of the sec is to facilitate capital formation last week member of the committee asked secretary yellen how the administration's proposals to increase capital gains taxes qualified dividends and corporate tax rates would affect the competitiveness of american companies given your responsibility for capital formation and the research of the sec my question is how would those new taxes impact the competitiveness of the united states to attract capital investment in the world economy um congressman posey i i think that our remit is about the capital markets and if it's all right i think i should leave to congress and the other parts of the executive branch to sort through taxes um but in terms of our markets it's about transparency it's about disclosure it's about protecting against fraud and it's facilitating these vibrant capital markets regardless over the decades congress has decided on high capital gains and low capital gains but we sort of are uh leave that to others and then try to facilitate through our rules the most vibrant capital markets for capital formation well that's that's a good walk around the block but you know you know one of your charter purposes is to facilitate capital formation and i'm just trying to find out if more taxes on corporate america and working americans is the right direction to go from your perspective again i i do appreciate the question and if i weren't in the current role i might have a lively discussion as a professor at mit but in the role that i have right now it's really to facilitate capital formation through the tools that congress has given the sec the tools of anti-fraud anti-manipulation and a focus on registering exchanges so that there's the really efficient efficiency in the middle of the market those are the those are the important tools whether uh congress raises a tax rate or lowers a tax rate okay and you know just an assumption i'm sure nobody else in the world is thinking this right now but you know the refusal to say yes or no kind of indicates that the answer is probably one you don't want to give and that in fact the higher taxes are going to actually hurt your ability to i i i i respect that i just think that i mean there's things that you want me to discuss crypto and china disclosures and the pcop and the structure of equity markets the structure of treasury markets but i think you'd want me to leave tax policy to congress and the executive branch well setting the policy is definitely the job of congress and the executive branch just one i think the average common person in the street would think that you know the chairman of the sec would have an opinion about whether we should tax american companies and american people and american families more uh if that helps you do your job or if it doesn't help you do your job uh what best helps to do do a job is discussions like this of course and and trying to get the right resources to the sec and then and then working with my fellow commissioners to try to uh enhance our capital markets given that rapidly changing technology i think tax rates again are the remit of congress and the executive branch well i'm not trying to beat yep and so i don't want to be the dead horse you know we'll just leave this subject for now uh given the time you've been at the sec have you identified any regulations or restrictions on capital markets that you think could actually be relaxed and if so but restrictions could be relaxed so it i think in each of these reviews and and particularly as we review the treasury market structure and the equity market structure what i've asked is how can we in the 2020s ensure that they're most resilient and efficient and i think that that's really a critical thing that we can do and the efficiency in the capital markets might as you said be turning a dial or changing some of our our current rules i'd also say in the crypto space when i i said publicly that these platforms come in talk to us get registered these trading and lending platforms it's highly unlikely with with 50 100 or sometimes thousands of tokens that they don't have securities but if they come in and they say you know that transfer agent rule doesn't quite fit or this custody role doesn't quite fit for these uh new forms of capital formation we should get into those discussions and talk about how we stay true to the mission that congress wants us to do but if we need to adjust some of these uh you know sometimes very technical roles that were written in in a different environment we should see what we can adjust thank you very much time has expired

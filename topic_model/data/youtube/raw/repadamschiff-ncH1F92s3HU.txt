, TRYING TO REBUILD THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE. >> JOINING OUR DISCUSSION NOW IS CHAIRMAN ADAM SCHIFF, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. HE IS JUST BACK FROM THE MUNICH SECURITY CONFERENCE. AND CHAIRMAN SCHIFF, LATEST INTELLIGENCE THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE BEFORE US, OF COURSE, IS THAT WE ARE NOW HEARING THE SOUNDS OF WAR IN UKRAINE'S CAPITAL CITY. >> SADLY, LAWRENCE, I THINK A FULL INVASION IS UNDERWAY. THE RUSSIANS WILL TRY TO DECAPITATE UKRAINIAN DEFENSES. THEY WILL, IN ADDITION TO THE CYBERATTACKS, THEY ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE AIRSPACE AND GOING AFTER UKRAINIAN MILITARY ASSETS. TRYING TO DISABLE THEM WITH THEIR OWN KIND OF SHOCK AND AWE. UKRAINIANS WILL FIGHT, BUT I THINK THEY WILL BE OVERWHELMED INITIALLY. WHEREAS, IT WILL BECOME VERY COSTLY TO RUSSIA OVER THE LONGER TERM. AND, SADLY, I THINK THAT THE COSTUME CASUALTIES WILL BE HIGH. I THINK THAT THE LOSS OF RUSSIAN TROOPS WILL ALSO BE HIGH. RUSSIAN MOTHERS AND FATHERS WILL SEE THEIR SONS COME BACK IN BODY BAGS. THIS IS PUTIN'S WAR. THIS IS NAKED AGGRESSION. AND I THINK IT IS DISASTROUS. >> TODAY, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY IN A FACT PROMISED THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN -- REAL AND POWERFUL RETALIATION TO HIS INNOVATIONS, SAYING YOU WILL SEE OUR FACES, NOT OUR BACKS. SO, YOU JUST REFERRED TO RUSSIAN BODY BAGS COMING BACK. THIS IS GOING TO BE -- THE PROMISE WAS MADE BY THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT TODAY -- A REAL ALL OUT WAR. THEY WILL WAGE TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY -- >> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. AND LAWRENCE, IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE THAT INITIALLY, BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS HAVE SUCH SUPERIOR FIREPOWER. THEY MAY VERY WELL BE ABLE TO QUICKLY OVERWHELM UKRAINE'S MILITARY AND DISABLE LARGE PORTIONS OF IT. RUSSIAN, OR RATHER UKRAINIAN MILITARY ASSETS -- PROTECTING THE RUSSIAN INVASION FROM -- THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO MOVE TO DEFEND KYIV QUICKLY ENOUGH, BUT NOT THE LAUGHS, THE UKRAINIANS ARE A TENACIOUS PEOPLE AND THEY WILL DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND. THEY WILL DEFEND THEIR ABILITY TO DECIDE THEIR OWN DESTINY AND NOT TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE KREMLIN. I THINK THIS WILL BE A VERY COSTLY ENDEAVOR. I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT NATO ALLIES, THE WEST, AND ALLIES BEYOND THE LAST, WILL SUSTAIN CRIPPLING SANCTIONS OVERTIME, AS LONG AS IT TAKES, TO COMPLETELY DEBILITATE THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY. TO MAKE THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE FEEL THE FOLLY OF THEIR LEADER IN INVADING THEIR NEIGHBOR. AND WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS A FAILURE FOR PUTIN OR WE WILL SEE MORE OF THIS. WE WILL SEE MORE OF THIS WITH CHINA AND TAIWAN. WE WILL SEE MORE OF THIS FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. I THINK NOTHING LESS THAN THE INTERNATIONAL -- AND THIS IS A MOMENTOUS AND TRAGIC DAY WHEN, ONCE AGAIN, WE SEE A DICTATOR IN EUROPE TRYING TO REMAKE THE MAP OF EUROPE BY USING HIS MILITARY POWER. >> YOU HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM THE UN EXECUTE READY -- I WAS STRUCK BY ON DAY ONE OF THE SANCTIONS, THE GERMAN PIPELINE WAS PART OF THE SANCTION PACKAGE. THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO THAT. IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES WAS SHARING PRECISE INTELLIGENCE INDICATING THAT WE WERE THIS CLOSE, WE WERE A DAY OR LESS THAN A DAY AWAY FROM ACTUAL INVASION? >> I THINK THAT CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO IT. WE SAT DOWN WITH THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR AND WE HAVE BEEN SHARING INTELLIGENCE WITH OUR ALLIES VERY CLOSELY. BUT REALLY, IT'S A TRIBUTE TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR GERMANY. IT WAS NO EASY MATTER, I THINK, TO COME TO THE POSITION THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO KILLED US PROJECT. BUT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO KILL IT. AND WE ARE DETERMINED TO KILL IT NOW THAT RUSSIA HAS SO AGREE JUST SLOWLY INVADED ITS NEIGHBOR AND VIOLATED NATIONAL LAW. WE CAN'T ALLOW RUSSIA'S CONTROLLING RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO BE LEVERAGED OVER OUR ALLIES AND SO, IT'S MOSTLY A CREDIT TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE AND TO THE CHANCELLOR THAT THEY SHARE THE RESOLVE OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. EVEN THOUGH GERMANS WILL FEEL ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES MUCH MORE DEEPLY THAN WE WILL IN THE UNITED STATES. >> WHAT CAN YOU TELL AMERICANS TO EXPECT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS WE WATCH THIS ON FOLD FROM YOUR POSITION AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION, BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ODD COUPLE OF WEEKS WHERE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN SHARED BY THE PRESIDENT. >> I THINK WE CAN EXPECT THAT WE WILL SEE A MASSIVE MILITARY CAMPAIGN BY THE RUSSIANS THAT MAY VERY QUICKLY OVERWHELM UKRAINIAN FORCES. I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD JUDGE WHETHER THAT CAMPAIGN BY PUTIN WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE FIRST HOURS, DAYS, OR EVEN WEEKS. THIS WILL LIKELY BE A LONG CONFLICT AND TRAGICALLY, A BLOODY CONFLICT. YOU WILL SEE RUSSIAN CYBER ATTACKS ON UKRAINE. THERE IS THE DANGER OF RUSSIA ESCALATING WITH CYBERATTACKS ON OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION AND INCLUDING POTENTIAL ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES, TO WHICH WE WILL BE FORCED TO RESPOND. AND I THINK YOU WILL SEE CONTINUING PROPAGANDA OF -- AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND ELSEWHERE -- RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA TRYING TO BLAME UKRAINE, TRYING TO PUT ALL THESE PHONY PRETAX, AS IF UKRAINE WERE PLANNING SOME ACT AGAINST RUSSIA. THAT IS ALL A BUNCH OF RUSSIAN MISINFORMATION, BUT WE WILL SEE A LOT MORE OF THAT AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF DEFENDING DEMOCRACY IN UKRAINE. AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK IS REALLY AT STAKE, WHAT TERRIFIES PUTIN AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS OVER TIME. -- BRINGING DEMOCRACY CLOSER AND CLOSER TO HIS DOOR -- AND A SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRACY AND UKRAINE IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER PUTIN'S DESPOTISM. HE CONSIDERS THAT A DIRE THREAT TO HIS REGIME AND I THINK THAT IS MOTIVATING A LOT OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF,

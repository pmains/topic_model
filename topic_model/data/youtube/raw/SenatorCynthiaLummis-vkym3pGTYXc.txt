wyoming republican senator cynthia lummus is with us now and senator good morning to you thank you for your time good morning bill what should we do next you come from the state that produces a lot of energy and a lot of oil right away we should permit our natural gas lng terminals that could take lng to europe that's something that would have a very rapid impact we should also have oil and gas lease sales on federal lands my power act that was the first piece of legislation i sponsored would have required us to continue to lease oil and gas and permit oil and gas drilling on federal lands we have signed multiple letters to the white house explaining strategies they can undertake immediately that will have impacts to benefit the prices in and including uranium for the united states my state is number one in producing uranium but we buy over half of the uranium for our nuclear power plants from russia and its allies 90 percent of that is imported these are numbers that we need to change we were energy independent we need to become energy independent again both the president and the press secretary spoke about oil sanctions yesterday take a quick listen here nothing is off the table we're considering it it's very much on the table but we need to weigh what all of the impacts will be so that's about sanctions and whether sanctions should include sanctions on russian energy and i have to imagine i know people from wyoming pretty well that if you're looking at this situation having sanctions but not having them touch any of his energy sector doesn't really make a lot of sense well the white house is just mistaken about its approach to energy in the united states our energy is cleaner our natural gas is cleaner it was europe that shut down nordstrom 2 not the white house they have their head in the sands when it comes to energy policy on the global arena it's ridiculous for the sec to be considering the social cost of carbon at a time when prices are going up dramatically blackstone has already provided esg guidance that is being implemented the sec doesn't need to pile on this administration is piling on making it more expensive for europe more expensive for us and we continue to use russian energy at a time when we shouldn't and we don't need to because we have our own supplies there might be some daylight on this but it may not come fast enough for for our own needs and the concerns you're raising there one more point here when you were elected the senate uh in 2020 uh you came on fox and you made it clear that wyoming was open for business for cryptocurrency and crypto mining for bitcoin uh well just yesterday and this week some senators are suggesting that crypto is a way for russian oligarchs to go ahead and invade the sanctions that have already put in place is there something to that you know the major exchanges uh are complying with sanctions they are sanctioning people that uh are subject to sanctions uh who are in russia now uh so uh i have a bill that will bring uh cryptocurrency in its entirety including bitcoin ethereum al alternative uh cryptocurrencies as well as stable coins and central bank digital currencies into our regulatory system uh we'll be re unveiling that next week okay so but as you wait on that i mean i mentioned this window again about energy discussions too maybe that happens with policy or not but is there an opportunity for for russian leaders to use crypto to avoid what what you're trying to do which is the pinster economy now the major uh the answer is no the major uh coinbase for example the major exchanges are complying with sanctions and if you have private keys they're unable to accommodate the capacity for uh the use of cryptocurrencies to dodge sanctions okay so the answer is no we're watching it appreciate your time for coming on today senator help us thank thank you for helping us understand it all we appreciate you thank you dana

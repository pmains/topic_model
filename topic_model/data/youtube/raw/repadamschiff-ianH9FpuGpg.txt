D DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO UNDERMINE  THE ELECTION RESULTS. >> WE WILL BE WATCHING FOR SURE. RYAN NOBLES, THANK YOU VERY,  VERY MUCH. WE ARE JOINED BY DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU ARE ALSO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. YOU JUST HEARD RYAN'S REPORT. WHAT DOES YOUR COMMITTEE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH FIRST OF ALL, IN  TONIGHT'S HEARING? >> WE HOPE TO TELL THE OVERALL  STORY OF HOW CLOSE WE CAME TO  LOSING OUR DEMOCRACY, AND HOW WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS. THE MULTI-PRONGED EFFORT TO  OVERTURN A PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION, THE FIRST TIME IN  HISTORY. WE HAD A NON-PEACEFUL TRANSFER  OF POWER AND WHAT LED UP TO  JANUARY 6th AND WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT DAY PUT TO REST THESE  CLAIMS AS REVISIONIST HISTORY  THAT THIS WAS A NORMAL TOURIST  DAY AND THIS WAS LEGITIMATE  POLITICAL DISCOURSE. SO WE WANT TO TELL THE OVERALL  STORY AND WE WANT TO DO IT IN A  WAY THAT WILL ENGAGE THE PUBLIC  AND WE WANT TO SET OUT WHAT WE  INTEND TO SHOW IN HEARINGS TO  COME. >> YOU RECENTLY SAID FORMER  PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE AUTHOR  AND THE ARCHITECT OF THIS PLAN  TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION, CLOSED QUOTE. WILL YOU PRESENT NEW EVIDENCE  TONIGHT TO MAKE THAT CASE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? >> YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE, I  THINK, A MIXTURE OF EVIDENCE  THAT WE WILL PRESENT THIS  EVENING AND IN THE NIGHTS THAT  FOLLOW. SOME OF WHICH THE PUBLIC HAS  SEEN. MUCH OF WHICH THE PUBLIC HASN'T  SEEN THAT GO TO JUST HOW ONE  THING LED TO ANOTHER. ONE ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN THE  ELECTION LED TO ANOTHER  ULTIMATELY CULMINATING ON THE  VIOLENT ATTACK AT THE CAPITOL. WE'LL BE DISCUSSING IN THE DAYS  AND WEEKS TO COME. THE PRESIDENT'S ROLE IN EACH OF  THESE LINES OF EFFORT AS WELL AS WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID  CRITICALLY AND WHAT THE  PRESIDENT DIDN'T DO WHILE THE  CAPITOL WAS UNDER ATTACK. SO WE'LL BE COVERING ALL OF THAT CERTAINLY WITH A THOUSAND  INTERVIEWS THAT WE'VE CONDUCTED  AND OVER 100,000 DOCUMENTS WE'VE OBTAINED. THERE'S A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION AND THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS HOW  TO DISCERN WHAT IS THE MOST  IMPORTANT, TO SHARE WITH THE  PUBLIC AND HOW TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT CAN BE EASILY DIGESTED  GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE  EVENTS.  >> THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAS  ALREADY BEEN IMPEACHED TWICE. HE WAS ACQUITTED TWICE AT THE  SAME TIME. YOU WERE THE LEAD IMPEACHMENT  MANAGER IN THAT FIRST TRIAL, BUT TRUMP REMAINS FOR ALL PRACTICAL  PURPOSES STILL THE DE FACTO  LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  AND A VERY POTENTIAL BE  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 2024. DO YOU BELIEVE THESE HEARINGS  WILL CHANGE ANY OF THAT? WELL, THESE HEARINGS ARE NOT  AIMED AT THE MIDTERMS OR AT THE  NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THESE ARE AIMED AT TRYING TO  PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY FROM  ANYONE WHO POSES A THREAT TO IT  FROM ANYONE WHO WOULD TRY TO  OVERTURN A PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTIONS IN THE FUTURE AND PART OF, I THINK, PREPARING THE  COUNTRY AND EXPOSING ALL THAT  WENT INTO THE LAST ATTEMPT IS TO INOCULATE OURSELVES AND MAKE  SURE THAT WE DON'T GO THROUGH  THIS AGAIN. THAT'S REALLY OUR OBJECT WHICH  IS TO EXPOSE WHAT TOOK PLACE AND ALL OF OUR EFFORTS TO INTERFERE  WITH THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF  POWER AND ULTIMATELY WE INTEND  TO PROPOSE REFORMS AND PROTECT  OURSELVES FROM ANY KIND OF A  REPETITION. >> AND WE WILL BE GETTING, I'M  ASKING, WILL WE BE GETTING NEW  INFORMATION RELEASED TONIGHT? >> OH, YES. THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE NEW  INFORMATION TONIGHT. YOU WILL SEE AND HEAR THINGS  THAT HAVEN'T BEEN AIRED BEFORE,  AND I THINK THAT WILL BE TRUE OF EACH AND EVERY HEARING, BUT THE  CHALLENGE, WOLF IS BECAUSE THE  PUBLIC HAS LEARNED ABOUT MANY  EVENTS CONTEMPORANEOUS AND  LEARNING ABOUT THEM, SOME OF  THIS IS IN THE PUBLIC EYE, BUT  MUCH WILL BE NEW, AND WE HOPE  THAT WHAT WILL BE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE WAY WE WEAVE IT ALL  TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT IS THE WHOLE STORY  HERE? WHAT TOOK PLACE AND HOW DO THE  PIECES FIT TOGETHER? THESE PIECES THAT WE'VE BEEN  HEARING ABOUT FOR MONTHS AND  MONTHS. HOW DO WE

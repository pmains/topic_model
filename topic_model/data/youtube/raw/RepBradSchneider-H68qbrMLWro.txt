madam Speaker in a few days our nation
will celebrate Veterans Day a time to pause give thanks and honor the brave
men and women who have served our country those men and women who've worn
the uniform of our nation who have sacrificed so much for us deserve more
than just words in return we owe them action that means keeping the promises
we have made to our veterans to provide skills and offer opportunities as these
men and women transition to civilian life to provide a lifetime of health
care that they have earned and were guaranteed to support access to mental
health services including to those with other than honorable discharges who may
have been improperly dismissed from the service due to undiagnosed brain
injuries or PTSD to end the scourge of veteran homelessness as we have done in
Lake County in my district in Illinois today and I am proud of the bipartisan
legislation I introduced to reauthorize the boots to business entrepreneurship
training program for veterans previously passed in the house I here's my
colleagues in the Senate to similarly support this and other important
programs this Veterans Day and every day I hope we will all be 10 men the
gentleman has expired as Americans and honored those who have served us as a
small token of our men gentleman has expired for whether this is a gentleman
from California seek recognition

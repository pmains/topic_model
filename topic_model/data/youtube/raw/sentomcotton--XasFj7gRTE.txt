joining me right now is Arkansas Senator and author of the book Only the Strong reversing the left's plot to sabotage American power Tom Cotton is here Senator it's great to see you thanks so much for joining me and I want to get your take on Joe Biden's speech last night well uh Maria uh maybe not democracy is on the ballot but the Democrats are on the ballot and that's what really worries Joe Biden is that he knows the American people are going to deliver a resounding verdict next week against people are tired of it that's why we're going to win a big victory on Tuesday well how you feeling about it how many seats do you think the GOP can take in the Senate well Maria I don't want a hazard a guess on a specific number I'll leave that to the pundits I'll just say we're going to win the house and the Senate and it's going to be a comfortable majority in both well look I mean it's not just economic policy that people are outraged by but even foreign policies so the U.S is now working to remove Iran from the United Nations Commission on the status of women Iran's supreme leader said yesterday that the United States should not be considered Untouchable uh talk to us about what's happening in Iran we've seen the pictures of the courageous people women on the streets look at this shot 120 000 people on the ground in Berlin uh basically protesting the supreme leader is there a revolution underway right now in Iran and we're not hearing anything about it from the Biden Administration yeah well what began as a protest against mandatory headscars for women has morphed into a widespread protest against the ayatollahs themselves we should be celebrating championing and supporting the brave men and women of Iran you don't see Joe Biden doing that because Barack Obama didn't do it either I write about this in Only the Strong Iran's the nuclear deal with Iran was about much more than just their nuclear program because of course it didn't start stop that program it actually supercharged it it was about Barack Obama and the progressive left in America believing that we were to blame for our decades-long conflict with Iran Barack Obama and now Joe Biden want us to atone for our supposed sins and pulling our horns and treat Iran like a normal Nation that's why Barack Obama stood on the sidelines when the Iranian people rose up to demand their rights in 2009 and that's why you see so little action right now from Joe Biden what we should be doing is supporting those people saying we'll never re-enter that nuclear deal we're never Grant sanctions relief to the ayatollahs and putting more pressure on their murderous regime yeah well I want to talk more about your book it just came out this week Only the Strong reversing the left's plot to sabotage American power I know you write about the service your service in Afghanistan and your experience watching Afghanistan fall Senator thank you for your service to this great country and tell us what the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan meant for adversaries who are now on the March well Maria a Chinese Communist propaganda Outlet shortly after The Botch withdrawal from Afghanistan referred to the Afghan effect and unfortunately I think our adversaries see an Afghan effect you know it's not a coincidence that Vladimir Putin began to Marshal troops on Ukraine's border just a few weeks after we left Afghanistan as I right known this strong it's much like our withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975 with those horrific pictures of people cleaning the helicopters flying off our Embassy in Saigon for which Joe Biden Bears some responsibility as a young Senator he voted to cut off military aid to the South Vietnamese government and that led to five years of Soviet communism rampaging around the world until Ronald Reagan was elected president and I fear that as long as Joe Biden is President we're going to be living with this Afghan effect because our enemies know that Joe Biden is not up to the job of protecting America's interests well I mean I want to get your take on the strength of this country right now Senator because you know you write in only the strong about the Communist party but right now their Navy is it bigger than the US's Navy what are we doing to offset the you know strength continuing resources coming out of the Chinese Communist party do you see this Administration putting anything in place to stop the ccp's goal of overtaking the United States is the number one superpower no Maria and as I explained in Only the Strong the decline that so many Americans since it's not an accident it's not bad luck that's happening to Joe Biden it is declined by Design it's because the progressive left is at best ambivalent about America when was the last time you heard a Democrats stand up and unapologetically unabashedly celebrate and defend America and our history and our role in the world going forward in the future that's why they undermine the sources of our power like a strong military like birds flying south through the winter Democrats always cut the defense budget when they get into office they also have a very tenuous relationship with our military and that's why they use it for politically correct social engineering projects while the Chinese are building the largest Navy in the world too many Democrats in Congress are worried about whether drill sergeants are using the right pronouns for our troops well that's right and frankly as an American citizen I'd like to see more acknowledgment that we need to toughen up and I'm wondering if the GOP majority whether in the senate or the house after the midterms can change anything in terms of defense spending in terms of waking us up frankly I don't want to hear about the defense department talking about transgenderism talking about you know these social issues I want to hear about readiness yeah Maria help is on the way for our military once we win next week we were able to increase Joe Biden's woefully inadequate defense budget last year I think we'll be able to add a little bit more this year it's still inadequate in no small part because of Joe Biden's runaway inflation but next year will be a horse of a different color a lot of what we need for America and what we need for allies like Taiwan are relatively straightforward manufacturing challenges you know missiles and Rockets and so forth these are not aircraft carriers or submarines that take years to build with enough money committed to make sure that our great defense companies and our workers like those in the Camden Industrial Park in South Arkansas to know that they can run more lines and they can add more lines to their factories we can build up the munition stockpiles that we need here in America and that also allies like Taiwan need to buy from us yeah I mean at this point there are contracts in place that Taiwan was supposed to get armaments but we haven't sent them is that right what's the hold up in terms of sending Taiwan what we've already agreed to send well I think I think there's two main points one one is mechanical one is political the mechanical point is that it's just hard to manufacture the number of weapons that we need on our manufacturing lines right now because there hasn't been enough demand they haven't had the certainty to add more workers more shifts even more lines with that long-term certainty they will but then there's the political will as well that I think Joe Biden's Administration is constantly fearful of provoking Xi Jinping when we should be making Xi Jinping worried about what the United States is going to do to protect our interests not the other way around and I believe Anthony blinken just got a uh you know another uh basically talking down to him from the Chinese Communist party just this week um we we continue to see weakness on the world stage unfortunately Senator we're going to be watching thanks very much for being here this morning we so appreciate it and congrats on the book thank you Maria

yes good afternoon and thank you so much for joining us for our third teletown hall whether you're joining us for the first time or you're returning a second or third time welcome our country is navigating through an incredibly uncertain period you undoubtedly have many questions and concerns right now and i want to be sure that you and your families have the information and support you need to stay healthy safe my office has been assisting constituents day and night to get them connected with resources they need to stay on their feet we've been working with the food and drug administration and health and human services to advance potentially game changing technology to improve covid19 testing we've been advancing local production of personal protective equipment and we've been connecting healthcare providers with ppe manufacturers my office has been able to work with the department of state to help get nearly a hundred constituents who had been stranded abroad back to the united states so please call us at 978-459-0101 if you need assistance in any way we are living through unprecedented times we've passed two hundred thousand diagnosed cases of covid19 nationwide including nearly 8 000 in massachusetts this morning we received the latest unemployment figures a record-breaking 6.6 million people filed for unemployment about twice the number from just a week before we must remain mindful that every single one of us has an urgent responsibility to lessen the impact of this crisis all of the life adjustments we've been asked to make including social distancing washing our hands frequently disinfecting our surfaces and staying home will continue to flatten the curve and ensure that our health care workers can meet the surge of patients and ultimately save lives just last week hours after our second teller town hall i took safety precautions myself by driving down to washington rather than flying to vote on the third emergency funding package my team both here in massachusetts and in washington have been teleworking for three weeks adhering to social distance protocols and mitigating the spread of this virus like you i have made a lot of changes at home and at work my two young daughters are home from elementary school until at least may 4th my husband and i are working from home sometimes even sharing an office we're doing our best to keep everyone occupied learning respectful and upbeat but it's challenging we all miss seeing our loved ones we miss having dinner with our friends and organizing play dates for our kids this weekend my youngest daughter caroline will turn six and we're literally orchestrating a family zoom call for when she blows out her candles these are difficult adjustments and staying connected to our friends and family is so important for our mental health we can and we will get through this together as we continue to face this crisis head on everything we do should give each other confidence that we will stick by one another through through thick and through thin okay before we meet our panelists of the night i'll briefly recap what congress has done so far on march 6 we enacted the first emergency supplemental package it included our first big burst of aid to support our health care providers and state and local health boards as well as investment in research for a vaccine money from that 8.3 billion dollar package is working its way into our communities now on march 14th we enacted a second more comprehensive package the family's first coronavirus response act it provided emergency leave to workers free coronavirus testing and helped ramp up unemployment compensation it also supported food aid for children who are out of school due to coronavirus and need access to a nutritious breakfast and lunch it provided 300 million dollars to our food banks so that those in need won't go hungry and 250 million dollars for meals on wheels a great program that i saw up close earlier this year when i helped deliver warm meals to our seniors in hudson last friday we passed and the president signed into law the 2.2 trillion dollar relief package the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act otherwise known as cares this is the largest release package ever passed by congress and it will send direct cash payments to more than 150 million households establish loan and grant programs for businesses to help them maintain payroll and survive this downturn in particular it includes 350 billion dollars for a new paycheck protection program under the small business administration it will offer loans of up to 10 million dollars for small businesses and non-profits to continue paying their employees additionally the first eight weeks of payroll loans can be forgiven the package also includes 10 billion dollars for sba emergency grants for up to ten thousand dollars to provide immediate relief for small business operating costs and it provides 17 billion for standard sba business operating loans but with a promise that no payments will be due for at least six months this aid is available for both current borrowers as well as new borrowers of programs like the sba's 504 7a micro loan program it also expands and extends unemployment specifically it adds 600 to unemployment insurance for everyone who receives state unemployment benefits it waives the waiting week so that those in need can get help straight away it adds 13 weeks of unemployment for those who have exhausted their state unemployment benefits and it makes self-employed and gig economy workers eligible for unemployment insurance benefits under a new federally funded program the last big part i'll flag is the bill's 100 billion dollars for a health care marshal plan this is geared toward ensuring that health care providers are armed with everything they need to take care of those who fall ill i'm sure we'll get into the marshall plan a bit more later but now i'd like to welcome our guest president and ceo of emerson hospital christine shuster who will give us insight into the virus our response and safety protocols thank you for being with us today christine thanks so much for having me today congresswoman trahan and for all of us at emerson a heartfelt thank you to you and your team emily wu and david for all the work you've done to help us over the past month lori on a good day you are engaged and supportive of our community during this national crisis you fought for all hospitals to get the needed supplies and the equipment that we need to care for our community you're always checking in on us asking how we're doing when i know your plate is full in fact one of the times we talked you were driving back from washington and clearly it had a very long day but before your day ended you wanted to check on emerson there's not anyone else that i would rather have representing us at this challenging time for those of you on the call who don't know me i'm a nurse and i've been the president and ceo of emerson hospital for the past 15 years it is a wonderful hospital where everyone is pulling together during this pandemic we have outstanding physicians and dedicated compassionate staff who are working 24 7 to ensure that we have what we need to care for our community during this crisis and i look forward to answering your questions tonight back to you thank you woman thank you thank you christine we are so fortunate to have such talented experienced administrators at the helm of our of our community hospitals and without further delay let's get to your questions uh as many of you already know who have attended multiple teletown halls we receive so many questions through our submission portal and we do our best to select questions that are representative of uh of the concerns we receive and we'll answer as many as we possibly can so the first question is from gene r from methuen who wants to know quote i'm interested in hearing how the stimulus checks will be issued and when they will be issued so i'll take this one christine um gene's question seems to be at the forefront of everyone's mind what comes next so the cares act includes direct cash payments called recovery rebates twelve hundred dollars for each adult and five hundred dollars for each dependent child those who earn seventy five thousand dollars or below will get the full rebate but the the rebate is incrementally reduced for those who earn more than 75 000 or couples who file jointly and earn more than 150 000. the incremental reduction means that those who earn more than 99 000 will receive no recovery rebate and similarly couples who file taxes jointly and earn more than 198 000 will also be ineligible for the rebate so just yesterday we got news that the treasury and irs will make about 60 million payments to americans through direct deposit in mid april the checks will be issued in reverse adjusted gross income order so those who earn the lease will get their rebates first for most taxpayers no action is necessary for social security beneficiaries who do not file returns the treasury and the irs also announced yesterday evening that these beneficiaries will not need to file a simple tax return to receive their rebate recipients will receive their rebate just as they would their social security benefits for all other taxpayers who do not file returns the irs expects to release a simple tax return which will contain only a few questions including your name social security number dependence and deposit information the irs will use your 2018 tax filing information or your 2019 tax filing information for those of you who have already done your taxes this year to determine your payment amount the recovery rebate will be deposited directly into the same banking account reflected on your tax return you can find more detailed information by checking our website or visiting irs.gov backslash coronavirus which will have the latest information gene i hope that answers your question christine this next one is definitely for you uh jessica p writes is it possible to get tested if you think you have a mild case of the virus it's hard to know whether you're able to support others like picking up groceries without knowing if you have the virus or not i hear many people have mild symptoms and common symptoms like headaches or a dry cough it's just hard to know what's allergies and what's serious so that's a great question jessica and one that that is asked frequently it is really hard to know if you're experiencing spring allergies especially because a lot of the trees are budding right now or if what you're experiencing is something more serious the best thing that you can do if you have any kind of symptoms at all is to call your primary care physician now they're going to ask you lots of questions about how you're feeling they may even ask you to take your temperature and they may ask you to have a telehealth visit with them or they may ask you to come in to be examined in person or to have testing but the best thing that you can do if you feel fine and you're worried and you need to help someone but you're really not having any any true symptoms is to practice the social distancing and the single most important thing is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water that's the best way to combat this virus if you have to cough or sneeze to do so into your elbow and make sure that you're using sanitizer like purell if soap and water is not available and i know it's hard but try not to to touch your hands to your face your nose or your eyes and you know if possible try to use a grocery service where they practice social distancing if you have to go into the store or many places now are you able to place an order online and to pick it up or to have it delivered to your home so there's definitely options where you can help those that you would like to but you don't have to put yourself in harm's way great thank you christine uh as a follow-up to that uh lisa w from north chelmsford wonders is there a plan for community testing like drive-through testing and what is the accuracy of the current test being admitted so many of us had great plans to to hold up community testing centers and they ranged from tents to garages that were cleaned out and refurbished unfortunately it's very difficult for us to have that kind of testing because there is a limited number of test kits available at this time so there is uh a system whereby if you're having symptoms you talk to your physician that we can test you but at this moment there isn't community-wide testing available in in our community it really depends um on from a symptom perspective it depends on when your symptoms show uh whether you'll need a test or not we do find that the test is generally pretty accurate but it depends on when in the cycle of if you have covid19 you take your test so you may be exposed and take a test and it may be negative and then if you had taken the test two days later after the virus had a chance to to work its way through your body it may be positive so test timing um is tricky and it's really important and that's why we recommend following some of the the practices i outlined with the last question just to protect yourself there is some new technology that's under development which hopefully will be released soon where it will allow us to take a swab or a urine test and get results under 10 minutes and we hope that those will be able to be mass produced so that we can administer more of those tests so more to follow on that one great thank you christine i'll take this next one it's from chandra r in andover she wants to know how can small businesses apply for a loan from both the federal and state governments so it's a great question chadron i'll i'll dive right into the details because we've taken this question from many of our our constituents we'll tackle the state program first on march 16th the state announced a 10 million dollar fund under under the massachusetts growth capital fund mggs uh it was set up to lend up to 75 000 to small businesses with no payments for the first six months however that program is no longer accepting applications just a couple days after the mgcf programs launch the federal small business administration issued a disaster declaration for the commonwealth and that declaration opened the door to sba economic injury disaster loans also known as eidls these are loans direct from the sba for up to two million dollars for an eidl the interest rate for small businesses is 3.75 and just 2.75 for non-profit so now if you go to the mass growth capital fund website it will tell you to apply for an eidl that way there's no confusion the process to apply for an e-i-d-l is fairly simple it's all done online you go to the sba's coronavirus website which is covid19relief.sba.gov again it's covid19release.sba.gov that will bring up the loan application from there you'll be asked a series of questions like is the applicant a business with fewer than 500 employees is the applicant a non-profit is it a franchise etc what were the applicants gross revenue numbers during 2019 and you work your way through the form and then you submit it one important change that the cares act made to this program is that now applicants are eligible for a ten thousand dollar advance and that borrower would not be required to repay that advance that advance is intended to be available within three days of filing the application the sba stood the system up on monday so early filers should begin receiving this aid immediately alternatively a small business can apply for a paycheck protection program loan this is a brand new offering that was created in the cares act the ppp is a different product from the eidl in a number of ways first the ppp isn't a direct loan from the sba you must apply through an sba certified lender north north mark bank for example is a certified lender they have a branch in andover second the ppp offers loan forgiveness for the first eight weeks of payroll that isn't an option for eidl i suspect in many cases that forgiveness of eight weeks of payroll will greatly outweigh the benefits of the ten thousand dollar eidl grant but it's it's your preference of course third the ppp is specifically designed to address payroll including employee salaries paid sick and medical leave and insurance premiums as well as mortgage interest rent and utility payments that's all the eidl can be used for payroll needs as well as other bills that can't be paid because of the coven 19 outbreak and fourth the maximum e-idea alone is two million dollars but the maximum loan under the paycheck protection program is 10 million dollars and in case you're wondering yes you can apply for both an eidl and a ppp okay that was super detailed christine let's get back to you john c from concord asks what is the state of our local health care system for dealing with covet 19 and what is the near-term outlook um are they at or beyond capacity so john you're asking all the right questions i think i'd be wondering if i was sitting at home boy if i get sick my local hospital ready to care for me and if careful you know where would i go so for the last 26 days just about every hospital in the state including emerson and all the hospitals on in our region have held up what we call incident command centers and we've appointed an incident commander which in my case is eric our chief operating officer and we have a fabulous team backing up the incident commander and planning for best and worst case scenarios so um we look at things like when will the surge in hospitalizations come and so we're working very closely with our governor and hospitals throughout the state and it looks like the prediction as of today is that the surge in hospitalizations will come somewhere between april 10th and april 17th and so we've been planning for in our case how will we open up a second intensive care unit we typically have one now we have two so that we're able to care for sick patients we didn't have enough ventilators to staff that unit and thanks to congresswoman trahan i reached out one day and said we need more ventilators and the next day i had them delivered to my loading dock and so working together both at home and in washington we've been able to secure much of the supplies and the equipment that we need to care for the patients in the community to be honest i've worked very closely with all the ceos in our region from nashoba valley hospital right up through southern new hampshire and so we're working together as a unit so that if one hospital gets filled or doesn't have an icu bed or has an extra event that we can all work together to care for this region and that's vitally important we don't know how this is going to shake out but we have good solid plans to be able to be nimble and flexible as the surge comes because as many of you know middlesex county has the second highest number of covid19 uh patients and positives so we're expecting that we will see an influx of patients i have to say the other thing that i'm really moved to tears with is how great and wonderful our community has been and so for all of you on the call thank you so very much for whatever you've done some people have made donations many people have made masks donated gowns i keep wondering what everyone's doing with n95 masks in their basement but i'm glad that they're there and that you're sharing them with us many people have um joined gofundme groups that have supplied nourishment for our staff our staff are on the front lines and my and my team's biggest concern is keeping them safe so they can keep the patients safe and so uh we're investing all of those things that you've done in the front line staff to keep them ready when the surge hits so thank you everyone and again thank you congresswoman for being there when we needed you the most you bet and you know i we say um every time we convene these calls that uh everything that we do in terms of staying at home and practicing those social distancing techniques is all to prevent uh the surge right and we've already seen this week right shipments are finally arriving of much needed ppe at the scale that we need to supply you know our hospitals across the commonwealth and that would not have been done if people ignored the advisory and didn't you know stay home and be disciplined in our approach so it is so true we all have a role to play and you pointing out what's happening on the community level it is it's it's heartwarming to see how communities rally around uh their workers and their families their seniors uh certainly everybody who's on the front line so thank you susan oh from of north chelmsford um writes to us with a question i have three daughters who are rns working in icus plus a paramedic firefighter i'm so concerned they will be infected by the virus or bring it home to their families health care workers must be protected at their workplace but they do not have the protection by way of masks gowns etc is the government working diligently on getting supplies to these front line workers so susan let me first ask you to pass along my deep gratitude to your daughters our health care workers and our first responders report to battle every day and our country is counting on their heroism to pull us through my sister bria is a nurse as are so many of my closest friends and i have the same worries as you each day brave and dedicated doctors nurses physician assistants emts they show up to work on the front lines and they deserve to be at the front of the line for personal protective equipment as christine mentioned we exchange daily texts and phone calls on this very topic what i have found most infuriating is that in the midst of a global pandemic our health care system has not received the protection that they need to protect us we've seen an unconscionable shortage in ppe like n95 masks gloves and gowns that our health care workers need when testing and treating patients the commonwealth of massachusetts received only 10 percent of ppe requested from the strategic national stockpile and 17 of its second request that's just unacceptable when hospitals state and local officials are unable to reliably access ppe it undermines our response to the coronavirus pandemic the cares act provides funding to rapidly increase our personal protective equipment manufacturing capacity companies like new balance are stepping up to fill the void and meet the demand for critical items like masks but the truth is we should have never let our manufacturing base wither to the point that we were so unprepared to produce ppe and other critical medical supplies the care act the cares act excuse me provides one billion dollars for covid19 related production needs under the defense production act that's a law from 1950 designed to secure our defense supply chain we're going to use bpa to help inoculate our nation against this ppe supply shock the bill also provides 100 billion dollars for the public health and social services emergency fund and this will provide grants to our health care providers so that they can have all the supplies they need it also invests almost 400 million dollars in telehealth programs that christine described earlier so that health services can be delivered remotely without the risk of transmission and there is 16 billion dollars for the cdc's national stockpile to procure and deploy ppe and other other items that are brave that your brave daughters deserve our aim is to ensure that health care workers at every hospital every health care center and every neighborhood clinic as well as every first responder has the resources needed to combat covet 19. people like your daughters are exactly why i advocated for these funds and the care cares act and while why i'll push for even greater resources for them until we beat this pandemic i also really regret that it has taken this crisis to awaken more people to the need for universal health care you know we've been beating this drum for universal coverage for quite some time as important as obamacare was it's clear that it doesn't go far enough and now we have people who are out of work with not enough income to cover the cost of maintaining their health care coverage we weren't able to hold on to a provision in the cares act that would have covered cobra premiums for example it was dropped in our negotiations with the senate and i believe that should be restored in the next package as i mentioned earlier we absolutely must reinforce our manufacturing supply chain for ppe and other critical items but christine i've talked long enough did you want to add anything i just truly appreciate your fight for us to get what we need to keep the front line staff safe you know these are folks who are leaving their family every day and at emerson i've told our team it's our top priority to make sure our frontline caregivers are protected and i really appreciated your response to that because to this point we've been able to do that and we'll continue to do so uh with your support and and your advocacy for us in washington so um thank you and we'll keep you posted um as we do every day absolutely absolutely okay jocelyn b from drake sent us this question my husband and i are both independent contractors in westford owning our own businesses single member llcs what provisions are in the new covid19 legislation to protect independent contractors we don't have employees we don't need loans but we're already losing business with a no end in sight we don't get paid sick leave or vacation and any provision for employees at businesses will not help us we are getting very concerned for our financial future well jocelyn you and your husband sound a lot like my husband and me before i ran for office recognizing that you say you don't need a loan i would just like to share with the listeners that independent contractors are actually eligible for the paycheck protection program which is the sba's loan guarantee program that offers loan forgiveness for up to eight weeks of payroll for eligible small businesses as well as the economic injury disaster loan and economic injury grants as i mentioned in response to that question from chandra a few minutes back that's the ten thousand dollar grant which doesn't require repayment jocelyn you may be interested in the new pandemic unemployment assistance pro assistance program this is a new federally funded unemployment compensation program specifically designed to provide benefits to independent contractors and others who are ineligible for regular unemployment benefits additionally in the second stimulus we enacted a provision to ensure that those who are self-employed like independent contractors are eligible for a refundable for refundable tax credits for the cost of payroll so self-employed individuals who receive the credit can use that credit against estimated income tax payments alternatively it could be received as a refund after the end of the tax year so thank you for your question john jocelyn i hope it helps my very best to you and and your husband okay christine this next question is right in your domain scott d from lowell asks how can we get to identifying tracking and notifying the public of when and where they may they might have been exposed also when will we be able to test everyone who is sick with symptoms for covin 19 like we do for the flu so scott that's a great question and about three weeks ago when we were very early on in this pandemic it was easy to identify someone who was positive and then trace back their steps as to who they might have been in touch with where they might have gone unfortunately as the cases have ramped up we know probably at this point that more than 50 percent of the population in massachusetts is probably covid19 positive some people will never experience symptoms and and others might so how i would approach it is when you see someone just expect that they are covet 19 positive and really employ all those things we talked about earlier to protect yourself and to protect your family or anyone you may come in contact with it's can't be underscored how important it is that if we follow these guidelines washing our hands social distancing staying in if we follow those things then we're going to as they say flatten the curve and what they mean by that is that we're going to reduce the number of active cases that we have because we're not in contact with people this particular virus spreads very quickly it's airborne and now they're saying you can get it just from being close to someone and breathing in uh the droplets that the infected person may have so you know using those those techniques will be very important in those strategies for making sure that you protect yourself we are longing for the day and it's coming soon i'm sure of it when we'll be able to test everyone with a rapid test just like we do uh for the flu and for strep throat many innovators have things that are in testing now and we hope that there'll be a five or ten minute turnaround to some of the upcoming tests they do have to go through getting many approvals for that so we'll keep you posted in the short term we're using the valuable tests we have for first responders and front line staff because we need to make sure that they do not have covert 19 because they're going to be caring for patients so we definitely don't want our first responders or frontline staff to be passing the virus along so stay tuned we will keep you updated um on when a test is available great thank you i'll take this next one it's from robin f and she asks how can we best help each other while staying separated oh robin that's a it's a great question i mean we're all affected by uh the coronavirus pandemic and in these trying times it's more important than ever to protect vulnerable populations and support and uplift one another while sticking to the practice of social distancing we are all going to have to adjust our behavior and look out for one another everyone myself included we're constantly bombarded article after article about the shortage of test kits the bottleneck and manufacturing supplies the rising number of confirmed covid19 cases and so on and so forth but but those news stories paint only part of the picture right i mean from companies donating masks and ventilators to hospitals to everyday people helping deliver groceries and medications for their neighbors we've seen countless examples of people doing the right thing during an extraordinarily challenging time and christine gave many examples of that in her open of what she has seen how excuse me how she has seen the community rally around emerson hospital you know i think about older immune compromised people like my dad he has ms and he's especially high risk and he has to limit exposure to covet 19 by staying at home i mean we just do not let him out and i think he finally understands and has internalized that um but you know if you're healthy and you're able i would encourage um i would encourage you to ask after look after your neighbors and loved ones who might be struggling uh to run even the simplest of errands and leave packages outside the door that's what my sisters and i are doing for you know my parents i spoke to several councils on aging across the district this week who still have kitchens open to prepare meals for seniors across their respective communities and they're always looking for younger healthy volunteers to help deliver those meals you know my office this week started assembling care packages for a few senior homes that that can't accept visitors and and need to keep their patients morale lifted so i know that social distancing in order to stay home may make people feel disconnected and helpless during a very uncertain time but i do believe it's also when a community comes together and it shows its strength and spirit so from the smallest of actions like lending a helping hand to a neighbor to donating to your local food bank or hospital or ordering takeout to support a small restaurant in your town we truly all can make a difference okay we have a couple more uh and this this question in particular is so important it's from rob z and lancaster can you and your guest provide guidance or references to ways in which we can maintain our mental health during these challenging times so i want to pass this question over to christine first because emerson hospital really leans into its wellness programs do you have do you have any recommendations or guidance to share with rob absolutely first remember that no one is immune to the toll that this pandemic is can take um we're a very social society people are used to to going out and interacting and many of us have had to alter how we interact both with our families and in the workplace if you're still in the workplace and many of people are working at home and to be honest i do think that it isn't really important to acknowledge that this can wear on us every day i know uh for myself i'm not used to having my daughter who's in college home and while it's great to see her let's just say there's a lot more dishes to wash and a lot more activity in the kitchen and so you know we all um are experiencing changes in our in our lives but there are some things you can do and i think we have to look at this um as we will get through this there will be life on the other side and so take this time which whoever tells you to stay home and work so you know let's let's try to have some fun with it so try to get outside every day there's something about fresh air and sunshine that has a way of sort of awakening you and really being grateful that that we're in a place where we can do that that we can get some exercise take a walk remember your social distancing but if you have a pet i know my dog i don't know what's going to happen when we all get back to work because the dog loves everyone being home all the time facetime of friends call a friend who talks on the phone anymore my kids are like mom i'm like why don't you try making a phone call um we've experienced zoom now all i can say is you have to make sure you look good when you do zoom um so a conference call sometimes is better depending on if you're having a bad hair day or not um but try to spend more time with your your family and your friends connecting um on social media try a new app i happen to have discovered the calm app um in these stressful times and it's a really great app that you can download and spend some some peaceful time my girls taught me how to use spotify okay i'm sorry but everyone may know how to use that one but i have played songs i won't even tell you from what era and we decided to have a dance-off um okay my dancing skills aren't quite what they were 20 years ago but we had a lot of laughs and it was a way of of sort of bringing together our family um and really uh trying to make them the most of a situation everyone has a pile of recipes that they tear out of magazines that they print off that they want to try you know what try your hand at baking or cooking something that you've been meaning to do for for a long time so um and don't be afraid to reach out to your primary care doctor or therapist or someone if you really do feel like this is becoming overwhelming this is a really important thing to remember it's okay to ask for help i know at our hospital we're here for you um if you need us and it's really important to recognize that these are not normal times and that we will work together to get through this so um i hope i've given you some good ideas of some things to do i hope you'll also try to get plenty of sleep what better time than now to catch up on your sleep to get healthy to binge watch some of your favorite shows on netflix or prime time or hulu and share those i know where i work we're always talking about what shows we're watching i get some of my best ideas and hey how about reading a book does anyone read a book anymore and there's a lot of good apps if you can't put your tablet down that you can read a book on your tablet personally i like to pick the feel of a book in my hand but try something try something new and different and be sure to let us know how it goes and if you have any great suggestions send them to the emerson website we'd love to hear what you're doing oh that was fabulous christine that was the most comprehensive list of things to do to keep busy i i don't think i have anything to add to that uh thank you so much i'm definitely going to take a few of those suggestions with me uh the one thing that i will and i remember uh employing this during um uh well right after 9 11 is you have to take breaks from watching reading or listening to news stories uh hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can just be stressful and upsetting so i think you you know turn off uh cnn or fox news or msnbc whatever your you know whatever it's like on in the background uh and do definitely listen to music meditate and just pull out that new year's resolution list that we all sort of forget about and give up on at the end of january and uh and get some um uh get those healthy habits uh use this time to uh deploy those healthy habits um so this i think this question is uh this next question christine is probably also best answered by you and it's from rob g when do you think this stay at home order will end what is the best public health advice uh irrespective of the economic consequences so i know that's a two-part question but any uh got any sort of prediction on when the stay at home order will end so i don't have a crystal ball but i as a long time nurse and someone who cares deeply about the health of our community i don't think that you can put a price on everyone's public health and our individual health so in my mind however long it takes for us to make sure that people are safe to go back to school to go back to work to hugging each other when we see each other on the street is when when i believe the stay-at-home order should come to an end and i think that we need to put people's health before everything else the economy will eventually bounce back but if we don't take the strict measures that we need to now this will continue a lot longer than it otherwise would so um i think the we'll have to see what the experts say but i'm glad we trust everyone must use the data we'll have to watch how many people are covet positive how many people end up being hospitalized and and how many people may may die as a result of this this crisis before we can really determine when the order will come to an end so my best public health advice is stay home wash your hands social distance have try to have some fun with this try something new and we'll get through this sooner rather than later if we do that thank you christine it is true i mean the evidence is going to guide those decisions around stay-at-home orders uh and you know i think it's paramount that we uh we look and we have that uh that data uh guide that decision making um in terms you know one thing that i often you know sometimes when folks talk about the packages that are being passed down in washington they'll they'll refer to them as stimulus packages and uh i'm really diligent about correcting people around we're in a health care crisis we're in a public health crisis that that's paramount right ensuring that people are healthy ensuring that people are safe that is job number one right you don't have consumer confidence if people are sick or people are worried about their health and so everything that we're doing up until now is addressing the public health uh pandemic that we have that were that we're in the midst of and we're trying to keep people afloat as that happens right in order to confront the public health crisis people have to stay home from work um you know people their businesses are are closing because we've never seen demand collapse quite the way it has right now we are going to stimulate the economy once we're through the health crisis and once we have consumer confidence back and once people are able to go back out and dine in restaurants and shop in their local stores and and go grocery shopping at a clip that they're used to and so i think what's most important right now is that the priority is the health of our families of our seniors of our workers uh and ensuring that and giving confidence that we're not going to let our small businesses fail uh we're going to keep people afloat during this really difficult time and then once we're through the health aspect we're going to stimulate our our economy and so i kind of think about it sequentially like that so that folks can you know sort of manage their own expectations around um you know what happens when uh so look unfortunately that's all the time we have for tonight i want to thank christine shuster for sharing so much vital information with us i mean she is on the front line each and every day and for that we are so grateful and i want

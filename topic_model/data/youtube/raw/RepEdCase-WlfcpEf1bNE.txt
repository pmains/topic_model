mr kalahi you're next up i know that uh a couple of other members have joined us and we'll pick them up in the appropriate uh gavel call mr clady you're on well aloha chairman garamendi and ranking member waltz for organizing this important hearing about kapu kaki otherwise known as red hill the ongoing water crisis on the island of oahu i want to thank the witnesses for appearing before this committee the last time the readiness subcommittee met on december 2nd 2021 i alerted this committee that the navy was experiencing a crisis of astronomical proportions in hawaii mr chairman this is not an exaggeration and has proven to be 100 true thousands of families have been displaced those who unknowingly consume the contaminated water are worried about potential long-term health consequences that they may face the fuel leak threatens oahu's federally designated sole source aquifer which a ranking member correctly stated provides 77 of oahu's drinking water let me be clear clean drinking water is national security and cannot be compromised for anything the facts speak for themselves and we in congress must understand the gravity of this situation we must bring the full power of congressional oversight to bear on the department of defense to ensure that the navy is doing its job of taking care of our service members billions protecting the island's precious water resources and determining proper management of this strategic asset i have several important questions to ask our witnesses today but my first question is directed to admiral converse after it was repetitively confirmed that the red hill well was contaminated with petroleum the state of hawaii department of health issued an emergency order on december 6 for the united states navy to suspend operations and defuel the red hill bulk field storage facility that emergency order was resisted and contested by the united states navy in late december on january third it was reaffirmed by the state of hawaii department of health in its final decision and order this order has witnessed broad support from the communities of oahu the governor the department of health the state commission on water resource management city and colony board of water supply city council members state legislators in short mr chairman the whole of government in hawaii believes that the navy should comply with this order to add more converse i would like you to reaffirm what you stated in your opening statement on behalf of the entire state of hawaii and a united congressional delegation is the united states navy going to fully comply with the state of hawaii's legal order to plan and execute the fueling of the red hill bulk real storage facility sir uh thank you speaking for my boss admiral zapparo whom i know you know uh and and and emilia khan receiving the order that was finalized on the third of january admiral paparo directed and we issued a tasking order that directs our subordinate commands in our headquarters to take all measures to implement the department of health emergency order the well has been uh isolated and will remain isolated until we've taken corrective actions we're taking actions to establish a filtering system for the red hill shaft well we are aggressively pursuing the third party assessments directed in the emergency order that will enable us first to identify and fix the problems associated with the operations and maintenance facility that caused the spills and the contamination and that will allow us then to conduct further fueling and de-fueling operations and that will set the conditions for the ability to de-fuel the plant we're also conducting a broader third-party assessment in the overall operations maintenance of the red hill facility and the environmental compliance associated all of those actions are in progress in some manner including the contracts for the third party assessments well i appreciate your affirmative answer admiral converse that is great news and i'm sure the people of hawaii greatly appreciate the navy's commitment to fully comply with that order admiral stamatopolis for the january 7th task force from the commander of the pacific fleet has navsup identified an independent third party to assess the system integrity to develop a work plan and implementation schedule congressman the technical evaluation process has just completed today the department of health of hawaii will receive notification of the highest technically rated uh uh event vendor in that in that and uh and then we will seek awarding uh that contract here uh shortly after admiral just the last follow-up to that question per the task or then that work and implementation schedule is due in 23 days by february 3rd do you believe that tasking can be met sir i believe and sir you are very familiar you know with the red hill location there it is going to be uh done a high level implementation plan and uh work schedule is going to be delivered within that time frame but as you're aware the complexities of it may require more detailed uh engineering analysis if that comes to pass within that assessment but there will be a high level uh implementation plan and work plan if you will to move forward i hope it answers your question sir yes it does thank you and mahalo mr chairman i yield back before i move on to the gavel order i want to thank you mr kalahi you brought this to the attention of the committee early on uh it was at the reagan defense forum that uh we did sign up a meeting with the secretary of the navy and the chief of naval operations at your request and your leadership for the people of hawaii and your very serious and appropriate concerns for them i i hope that we'll be having time to come back to you after we finish the gavel order hello uh representative strickland and i really appreciate the extra time and i will stay on the subject that you uh started on in terms of readiness because this is a readiness hearing and it's important that we talk about those thousands of military families who have been displaced over the holidays my question is directly to admiral lindsay since november 29th our service members who have been living a frankly a nightmare they were told that they could return home by christmas that's what the navy initially said that never happened then the new year passed and so i'm asking for the thousands of military families and also civilian families some of them who are living in homes without running water others who have been displaced to alternate lodging and many who are either staying down in waikiki or in area hotels when can those civilian and military families expect to go back to their homes to have a home that is safe to be in that has clean running water and they can have the full confidence that it's safe to move back you have an idea of when that is admiral lindsay yes sir we want to make sure that the homes have drinkable water and so we're working diligently with our partners at the hawaii department of health and the epa and our fellow services to once we attain that uh drinkable water and it is safe to use then that those families that have chosen to displace will be will be able to return to their homes we expect that to uh begin occurring here in late january and proceed through the middle of february original estimates were not accurate because of the scope and scale with which we had to address the water system again in conjunction with our partners and so that is the current timeline late january to early february and we that schedule is posted on our website so folks can see it and be uh and be well aware of it and we communicate that through the various companies we've been using to communicate all right thank you for that question um and chairman i can't see the time so when i do hit my uh the remaining time left from the my colleague from washington state can you please let me know two minutes all right thank you sir i'll go to a follow-on question for admiral stamatopolis and this talks about the structural integrity of the red hill tanks in your earlier answer you discussed the 20 red hill tanks and it's important for my colleagues to know that there are two tanks that have not been in operation for for many many years tanks number one and tanks number 19. tank number one is the proposed prototype if there were to be a secondary containment type of prototype to be done but when looking at the other 18 tanks that are or could be potentially put into operation tanks number three number four and number 11 have not been inspected for approximately 40 years so my question uh to navs to navsup is or navy supply systems command is why are these tanks still in operation and how can you assure this committee and the people of hawaii the tanks 3 4 and 11 that have not even been looked at in the last 40 years are safe to use and meet current api 653 guidelines for bulk fuel storage underground facilities yes sir thank you for the question uh yes you are correct there are tanks as you mentioned that have been out of periodicity for quite a long time the ap is i'm not an expert within the api area however the api 563 of course is a is a recommended recommendation best commercial practice uh and after an inspection is completed um that could be in the next inspection 20 years as you're aware and these cases all of these tanks uh are on a schedule to be which is put throughout the ecosystem uh all the way up into dla energy uh nav fax cnic navs of the geographic combatant commanders around the globe through their joint petroleum offices and they are aware of this um there are as you know sir there are certain requirements for uh baseline activities current operations and then there are also war reserve requirements so through uh through that process uh there are if you will uh shared risks if you will to determine which tanks will be up next in the uh clean inspect and repair cycle uh and all that has to be balanced if you will with the uh the geographic combatant commander's risk comfort if you will great well i would i would recommend that tank seven and eight be the next on those lists because those tanks are four years overdue from their last clean and spec repair that was done in back in 1998 and there's a series of tanks several of them that were all done clean and spec repair in the late 1990s and i don't know if that inspection repair process done well over 20 years ago complies with current api 653 or department of defense unified facilities criteria for underground fuel storage facilities nor do i think that any of those tanks have the required or or the suggested polysulfide modified nova lac epoxy solution that has been applied to the interior of those tanks so that would be my humble suggestion thank you and i will yield back my time having completed the round of members of the committee we now turn to uh mr case uh it is your turn thank you very much for joining the hearing i know that you together with mr kalei have been on this issue from the very outset you've been outspoken you've provided all of us with information as well as motivation mr case thank you very much mr chair and ranking member for allowing me to participate in this the subcommittees and critical hearing here um this issue is one of the most single important issues for our delegation for the people of hawaii for our leaders of any that we face in hawaii today and the fact that this subcommittee takes it that seriously um is of great uh comfort to us in hawaii and i would say this is not only a matter of of the health and safety of hundreds of thousands of residents of hawaii and visitors to hawaii but it is critical to the support confidence and trust of the people of hawaii in the u.s military and in our mission in the indo-pacific and uh this is certainly an important ingredient in this subcommittee's focus on the readiness of our military there must be an alternative to red hill the subcommittee is very deeply involved in what uh the best alternative to that is um admiral converts uh thank you for your confirmation to representative kahele my partner uh in the delegation on this uh that the navy will comply with the emergency order and i he asked you that direct question and you went on at some length but i just want a yes or no answer am i correct in assuming from your answer which congressman kelly also assumed that the navy will comply with the emergency order sir yes we we are complying with the emergency order and and we have already begun taking steps along every one of the lines directed thank you very much admiral does the navy acknowledge agree and agree that the state of hawaii has the legal authority to regulate red hill under both federal and state law so um i am not um [Music] uh i i i don't think i'm in a position to make a decision on on whether uh who has the authority between the federal and state regulators what i can tell you is that we recognize that the department of health emergency order uh directing specific elements associated with the red hill is a legal order and we are complying admiral i know i know that you perhaps are not in the position to answer the question fully but certainly um this hearing is being closely monitored by the department of defense's uh personnel as well as well as lawyers and i would ask for a specific confirmation from them that the state of hawaii has the legal authority uh to implement and enforce its emergency order and i think that's important for this reason admiral i appreciate and commend the navy on agreeing to comply with the emergency order but this is coming off as a voluntary compliance and a voluntary compliance can at some point in the future be reversed and that is the fear of the state of hawaii and so um i would strongly urge uh the navy and the department of defense as you analyze your your clear legal options in terms of the emergency order uh to confirm that the state of hawaii does in fact have this authority that's my strong advice to you that's my request to you let me move on uh to the actual implementation of the emergency order the emergency order requires the navy as congressman kelly stated to within 23 days come up with an implementation schedule including a plan of defueling following which uh the department of health and and also uh the epa and others will evaluate that plan um and uh once that plan is approved um you are required under the emergency order which you say you're going to comply with 2d fuel b fuel within 30 days after that do you have an estimate of how long it will take for you to implement um a de-fueling order first of all and second um are you intimately involved right now you collectively in the actual funding requests that it's going to take to implement that order and i say this with great concern that to my knowledge with the exception of one request to congress and my appropriations committee for some emergency funding for some of your initial actions uh to my knowledge there's been no formal request to congress beyond that and i have no idea where exactly the department of defense stands right now in terms of the president's own budget request for fy 23 and i believe that there should be a very significant request in the president's budget uh to implement the emergency order so constant case first i want to thank you for your advocacy in and and understanding of the time yes are we concerned that this is a very aggressive timeline to conduct this third-party assessment and develop the schedule and the work plan yes uh are we are pursuing the the issuing of this contract soonest and as soon as that contract issued we will get the right folks in touch with the vendors and we will make immediate decisions on a what's the timeline how do we get a short-term work schedule and a scope of the work that needs to be done to correct any deficiencies associated with the operations maintenance facility safety to be able to de-fuel and as soon as we have that scoping work done we understand the importance of getting that to the right people so we can start budgeting for that or making decisions in the current year's budget and and i don't have any more information on that other than that we recognize that the timelines are short and we recognize the linkage to the budgeting cycle and that we need to get those inputs to you soon thank you for your advocacy thank you admiral thank you mr chair thank you mr case in the second round mr kalehi you're up hello mr chairman uh mr chair i'd like to ask a question that i think is on the minds of many many people in the community especially island of oahu and that that talks about the the current red hill well recovery and remediation plan last thursday i led a red hill tour with area legislators and saw the eight very large granulated activated carbon filtration tanks that are set up right outside the red hill well for the committee's awareness mr chairman these tanks can filter up to 5 million gallons of water per day and it is my understanding that if this plan is approved that the navy will begin drawing and filtering millions of gallons of water and subsequently discharging that water into the nearby halawa stream uh they will commence this as early as the 20th of january i have serious reservations about releasing such a high volume of treated water into the stream due to the possible unintended consequences and downstream effects i understand that this final plan must be approved by all parties signatories as part of the interagency drinking water system team that includes the hawaii department of health the epa's region 9 the navy and the army will all need to sign this plan in addition a national pollutant discharge elimination system permit will also need to be issued i would highly suggest that whenever those four very important signatories come to an agreement on how to remediate and recover this well that before any water is pulled out of the red hill well to be filtered that they fully brief the people of hawaii residents of the island of oahu before commencing so that they can um instill what my colleague representative case highlighted which is confidence and trust that this is the best plan available so i guess my question would be directed to admiral converse or admiral korka what are the alternatives to discharging millions of gallons of streeted water into the halawa stream uh yes sir i could take that question and first and foremost uh thanks for visiting the site uh it went a very long way and i hope you had a good appreciation that we are working this together and hopefully the feedback that you got is that we're not doing this alone and and as you mentioned um before we execute anything we want to make sure that everyone is aware and supportive of our way ahead and our remediation efforts right now is the immediate solution the immediate solution so we actually are taking the trade-offs of risk very seriously controlling the plume or you know discharging the water the water in the halawa stream and so that's why we've been in such close coordination with all the agencies you mentioned as well as the university of hawaii because we're actually contracting with them to study the ecology on the aquatic life of the stream before during and after so we can make sure we're very mindful of that and presently at this time we're actually in the process of awarding a contract uh to a local firm here to get an appreciation on what can we do what are the options available for that water because as you highlight it a water is a commodity is something very precious and we don't want to waste that that discharge and so today i don't have the best answer for you sir um but i will tell you that we will brief you as you requesting on our plan and we hope to have some other options available well thank you for that answer you know i will also add that the halawa stream discharges near hotel pier into pearl harbor and between where the navy proposes to discharge that water into the stream and where it actually flows into pearl harbor there are people that fish in that stream there are people that crab in that stream and i would that is why i think the navy should make sure the public is well aware before that discharge commences i'll just take the last 30 seconds mr chairman to thank all the witnesses for being here today i want to impress on you like we have been doing for the last two months as a united delegation that we are at an inflection point for the hawaii's uh and the state of hawaii's public trust and relationship with the united states military moving forward and and up until now um you know that that credibility and trust is been put to the test and so i really appreciate um your attendance today and thank you for answering our questions i look forward to working with you and the department of defense in the future mahalo and are you back mr thank you for your leadership your intense uh interest in this and your determination to protect your uh citizens and uh all in hawaii we now turn to mr case for the final five minutes then the meeting will adjourn thank you mr chair first of all i could not have said it better what congressman kelly said in the last 30 seconds i completely endorsed what he said i also thank you again for allowing me to participate in for your interest in this issue there's a little confusion i think based on the on the discussion in the hearing as to what the emergency order requires and does not require and i want to take the time to make sure everybody's on the same page on that and i'm just reading from the emergency order here within 30 days of receipt of this emergency order the navy shall submit a work plan and implementation schedule prepared by a qualified independent third party approved by the department to assess the facility operations and system integrity to safely de-fuel the bulk fuel storage tanks upon the department's approval that's the department of health of the assessment work plan and implementation schedule conduct the necessary repairs and make necessary changes operations to address any deficiencies identified in the assessment and work plan and then within 30 days of completion of required corrective actions defuel the bulk fuel storage tanks at the facility so the time frame here is um within 30 days after the emergency order which uh which got more converse has confirmed twice now the navy will comply with that date is february 2nd um they are to submit a work plan and implementation schedule that is ambitious but it must be met it's part of the order it's critical and i know that the navy is going to do its very best to achieve that if there are any questions that need to be addressed in terms of things that were not fully considered within that time frame they can easily be addressed afterwards in discussions with the department of health the time frame for the department of health to review and consider that work plan and implementation schedule is not set forth with specificity in the order but we all expect that it will be done as soon as possible and as diligently as possible but once that work plan is approved then the navy shall defuel within 30 days that's what the order says and that's what we all need to focus on um so that's what that was that's what's involved here i want to use my remaining time to make uh three points um the first point um besides thanking the witnesses and the navy it has been a very very good and transparent process with the navy over the last two weeks and one says as the navy we all faced this crisis we appreciate admiral converse your efforts um i want to say uh from that perspective you started off by saying um and i credit you for this the navy caused this problem the navy owns it and the navy will fix it um i have no doubt about the sincerity of the navy and saying that it will fix it and the belief of the navy that it can fix is it fix it however i do at this point have to ask the question whether the navy has the necessary objectivity to fix it and so therefore the request of the congressional delegation and others uh for qualified independent people to look over the navy's shoulder to determine that the navy's proposal to fix this is critical all around not only to getting the fixed right but to earning the trusted confidence that congressman kelly spoke eloquently to that's number one number two um i would strongly urge you not to focus exclusively on operator error i have said this to the secretary of the navy i've said i've said it to other folks during the course of this discussion there may well have been uh errors by the operators at red hill but to confine the explanation simply to operate your error is to ignore what is clearly issues with respect to the operation and maintenance and perhaps even the direct design of red hill operator error can be avoided by adequate design by adequate maintenance and by adding so so to to to focus only on operator arrow i strongly suggest to you as the wrong way to go on this number three i want to go back to my point on adequate funding because uh we've had a great discussion this morning and i have no doubt of the sincerity of the navy to address red hill however the ultimate test of the sincerity of the military is adequate funding requests in the department of defense's budget that the department of defense will fight for in the office of management and budget and in the president's overall allocation of resources and not at the expense of critical needs in the indo-pacific we just finished in the ndaa an increase in the pacific insurance initiative from five billion dollars to 7.1 billion and i do not believe that the fixes to red hill should be taken out of overall readiness in the pacific thank you very much mr chair my time has expired thank you mr case your final point i see mr waltz with a big smile on his face going amen

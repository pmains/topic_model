thank you mr chairman i yield one minute to the gentleman from california a member of the committee on education in the workforce mr takano gentleman from california is recognized for one minute i thank the gentleman from virginia for yielding time mr speaker i rise to date in strong opposition to hr5 also known as the student success act having spent 24 years as a classroom teacher i'm especially concerned about the title one funding mechanism in this legislation we have seen time and time again that block grants often redirect funding away from intended populations and are a prelude to further cuts i also oppose the republican bills portability provision which betrays the original intent of the elementary and secondary education act esea is meant to promote equitable opportunity and education for all and to help raise the academic achievement of low-income children this legislation will do the opposite and finally i object to the utter lack of federal accountability in hr5 while i oppose the current test-driven high-stakes accountability system i want the right accountability system not no accountability system mr speaker this legislation goes too far it cuts too deep and takes too many steps backwards so far the chair recognizes the gentleman from minnesota

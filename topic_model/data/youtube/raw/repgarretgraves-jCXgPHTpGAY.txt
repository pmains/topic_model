it has been amazing to me watching this administration blaming vladimir putin for the energy price crisis that is impacting every american family people having to make decisions between refueling their car or paying their grocery bills it has been amazing to me watching this administration again blame vladimir putin whenever the reality is before well before the war on ukraine we saw one of the largest price spikes in gasoline costs that we've ever seen in our lifetime only to continue we then saw the administration try and deflect blame and say it's because of price gouging of the administration of the oil and gas companies it's their fault it's price gouging but what the facts reveal is something very very different as you well know it takes years to go from a lease sale when when lands are made available for energy production onshore to go to production it takes a decade for the offshore and what is this administration doing absolutely nothing this administration's energy strategy is no to everything yeah it's no to oil and gas but you know what else it's no to solar it's no to wind it's no to geothermal it's no to everything because there's no plan there's no strategy in place there's nothing you've you've shut down speaking from my friend mr strauber you've shut down the twin metals mine you can't have renewable energy production without the resources you can't have it this administration is solely responsible for the prices and the energy crisis that we're experiencing today solely responsible this administration what do you do to lower prices you raise royalty rates 50 percent i mean who looks at this and say oh yeah i've got a great idea i have never seen more inexperience and and just doubling down on stupid strategies on energy in my entire life only last night to have the announcement that the area where 18 of the oil for the united states is generated 18 percent the gulf of mexico and and and to shut down the cook inlet lease sale offshore alaska as well to say that we're not going to do a lease sale let me say it again the only president in modern history to say that we're not going to have a lease yet we're not going to offer any new energy let's be crystal clear why there's an energy crisis it's because of this administration the secretary of energy just last week or week before said they haven't found price gouging she said it this administration's own officials look you're a nice guy i enjoyed working with you and i know this isn't your fault i know that you are sent here as a sacrificial lamb crystal clear to all of us but i'll tell you what you've got one in every five americans right now that can't afford to even cover their electricity bill like i said they're having to make false choices between between whether they're going to buy groceries for their family or they're going to fill their car so they can drive to work this is absolutely disgusting it is absolutely unforced errors self-imposed impacts on the u.s economy and it's not limited to just energy because the energy is one of the most pervasive things it is the primary driver of what we're seeing right now with inflation with the supply chain problems and probably contributing to worker shortage as well because people can't afford to get to work this administration can no longer have no to everything as an energy policy i remind you as i did last time you can sit here and say oh we're doing all this for climate change you know what during the trump administration emissions went down an average of two and a half percent a year during the biden administration they've gone up 6.3 percent you can you can talk about production levels and i'm well aware and as i stated at the beginning sorry for taking your talking points yes production's gone up but because of the lead time everything that's happening in regard to domestic energy production is because of what the the trump administration did under under your administration under the biden administration we've seen a significant drop in the approval of production we've seen a significant drop in the approval of apds and as a matter of fact just to put another finer point on it if you look at bonus bids which as you know is the auction bid that is that is provided at the beginning of a of a lease sale the the immediate payment that's made in the auction do you know that those have gone down more than more right now under under this administration they're less than one-tenth the revenue that was generated under the previous administration less than one tenth despite the fact that energy prices are at record levels that gives you some indication of how flawed these energy policies are and for my home state that's hurricane protection funding coastal restoration funding preventing additional disasters in fema funds no is not an energy policy this administration is solely responsible for the disasters we're experiencing now and i urge you to take that message back don't sync with this ship

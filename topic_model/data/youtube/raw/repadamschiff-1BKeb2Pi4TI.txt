now is california democratic congressman adam schiff chair of the house intelligence committee also a member of the gang of the gang of a congressman uh thank you so much for being with us uh mark warner told nbc news that the intelligence that he's been told by the cia is that vladimir putin intends to take keeve is that what you understand as well well that's certainly a possibility i think the intelligence community has gotten this right from the very beginning tragically all too accurate in its assessment that putin had plans to fully invade ukraine those plans may include a seizing key that may include installing a puppet regime that the kremlin controls i do think though that it's going to be very difficult for putin to sustain a occupation of the entire country the last invasion just moved ukraine further away from russia drove it into the arms of the west even more than it had been moving in that direction this invasion will just consolidate that uh and i think that putin has bitten off more than he can chew but it may be quite some time before he realizes that let me just be clear and and what mark warner told us he said i think they're interested in not so not in surrounding keeve but taking keeve he is briefed regularly by the cia he spoke last night to director william burns but that is his assessment that's what he says uh what can you tell us about what you have been learning obviously no classified information not that you would reveal that but what you've been learning about the situation on the ground there in ukraine well i've been briefed as well multiple times today including by the director last night and you know i think the reality is we have insights into putin's planning but uh uh you know as is often the case in war uh those plans may go out uh with the firing the first bullet so whether those plans will be adhered to whether putin will change course depending on the resistance that russian troops meet i think is still an unknown we are gathering intelligence every moment from the assets that we do have so that we can get a better sense of where uh this is all heading but i imagine it's gonna be pretty fluid and my sense is uh that uh there are a couple directions that putin could go he's talked about destroying the ukrainian military that could be a primary objective or that could be just a part of what he hopes to accomplish and that he intends to fully uh subjugate the ukrainian people install his own regime essentially reverse any remnant of the orange revolution where ukrainians threw out the pro-kremlin a figurehead they had running the country and moved the country in a westerly direction um i want to know what your reaction is to the sanctions that president biden announced earlier today he said that the economic sanctions that are being imposed right now the sanctioning of the banks as well as more sanctions against the elite um are equal to if not more effective more consequential than kicking vladimir putin kicking russia out of its ability to access swift which to be clear we as the united states would need europe to be on board with well i i think the package of sanctions that the president announced is the most severe we've ever levied against russia and many times more devastating than anything that was implemented after their last invasion in 2014 uh nevertheless i favor going further i favor expelling them from swift i favor imposing sanctions directly on vladimir putin this is an unprecedented situation and even though we don't generally sanction heads of state on occasion we do and i think it's merited here uh the challenge as i think the president alluded to is that we want to work in concert with our allies as much as possible and so i think we need to continue working on our european allies to move them in forward with even greater sanctions on russia i would also favor if if push came to shove are imposing even greater sanctions unilaterally but it would be best if it can be done in concert with our allies congressman adam schiff chairman adam schiff thank you so much for being with us today and i

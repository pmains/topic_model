REMO JOINING US IS BRAD SHERMAN OF  CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE SHERMAN, WELCOME, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.  >> YOU KNOW, I SEEM TO RECALL  THAT IN THE DODD FRANK ACT THERE WERE PROVISIONS THERE PROVIDING  FOR SO-CALLED LIVING WILLS THAT  WOULD KICK IN IF THESE INSTITUTIONS RAN INTO FINANCIAL  DISTRESS WOULD CAUSE THEM TO DISSOLVE BASICALLY. IF YOU'VE GOT THAT, WHY DO YOU NEED THIS? >> WELL, CAPITALSISMISM CALLS F  THE GROWTH AND DEATH OF  COMPANIES. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE PLAN FOR BANKRUPTCY, DOES NOT MEAN YOUR DEMISE COULD NOT BE CATASTROPHIC TO THE ECONOMY TOO BIG TO FAIL IS TOO BIG TO  EXIST. AND WHEN A BANK REACHES 3% OF  GDP, IT HAS AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE  OVER OTHER BANKS BECAUSE WALL STREET BELIEVES IT  WILL BE BAILED OUT, THAT THEIR CREDITORS WILL BE BAILED OUT. BANK PRESIDENTS HAVE CALLED FOR  THE BREAKUP OF TOO BIG TO FAIL INSTITUTIONS.  >> IS THIS ABOUT THE COMPETITIVENESS OF SMALL BANKS VERSUS LARGE BANKS THE LAST FINANCIAL CRISIS WASN'T CAUSED BY THE SHEER SIZE OF  BANKS, IT WAS THE LEVERAGE OF  BANKS. COLLECTIVELY THEY COULD HAVE HAD THE SAME IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY.  >> WHEN YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF  DIFFERENT COMPANIES IN AN  INDUSTRY, IT'S FAR LESS LIKELY THAT THEY'LL ALL GO BANKRUPT BUT IF YOU HAVE THAT ENTIRE  INDUSTRY IN THE HANDS OF ONE COMPANY OR SO MUCH IN ONE  COMPANY, ITS EXPOSURE ALLOWS THEM TO CALL THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAY YOU'VE GOT TO BAIL US OUT. BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING DOWN, WE'RE TAKING THE WHOLE ECONOMY WITH US. NO ONE COMPANY, NO ONE BANK  SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHY WE NEED FAIR  COMPETITION. ALSO, IF YOU GETMORE HEALTH  AMONG THE COMMUNITY BANKS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE  FINANCING OF SMALL BUSINESS. AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAD JAMIE  DIAMOND TESTIFY BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE THAT HE COULDN'T FIND  SMALL AMERICAN BUSINESSES TO LOAN MONEY TO SO HE SENT HIS MONEY TO LONDON WHERE IT WAS EATEN BY THE WHALE WE'LL HAVE A HEALTHIER ECONOMY IF WE DO NOT HAVE INSTITUTIONS SO LARGE THAT ONE INSTITUTION  GOING DOWN COULD TAKE DOWN THE ENTIRE ECONOMY.  >> SO TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW LARGE IS LARGE YOU SAY 3% OF GDP. MEASURED BY WHAT BY ASSETS? MARKET SIZE? WHAT >> WE HAVE IT BASED ON ASSETS  BUT OTHER EXPOSURE I THINK IT SHOULD BE LIABILITIES TO U.S. PERSONS. SO SENATOR SANDERS HAS HIS BILL  WHICH HE'S INTRODUCING WE HAD A SUBSTANTIALLY -- A BILL WE HAD WORKED ON WITH SENATOR  SANDERS FOR MANY YEARS AND INTRODUCED MANY TIMES. BUT WE'LL BE REFINING OUR BILL TO FOCUS ON LIABILITIES TO U.S.  PERSONS. IF DEUTSCHE BANK GOES UNDER IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE FOR THE WORLD, BUT NOT PARTICULARLY FOR THE UNITED STATES. >> ISN'T AN ASSET A LOAN THEY  HAVE MADE TO SOMEONE ELSE? IT'S NOT THEIR LIABILITY, IT'S A LIABILITY THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS  TO THEM. >> EXACTLY OBVIOUSLY, FOR MOST BANKS, LIABILITIES AND ASSETS ARE VERY  CLOSELY RELATED  YOU HAVE OWNERS' EQUITY ON THE SHEET AS WELL. THAT TENDS TO BE A SMALL PORTION. THE SYSTEM FOR REGULATION MAY  FOCUS MORE ON ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS A WAY TO MEASURE  THE SIZE OF A BANK IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE, IT WOULD BE  LOOKING AT LIABILITIES TO U.S. PERSONS. >> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THIS BILL IN THAT YOU'RE ADDING  ON THIS WHOLE NOTION OF MAKING BANKING MORE COMPETITIVE,  LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN THE BIG AND SMALL BANKS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE  SAYING THE BIG BANKS NEED TO BE  BROKEN UP BECAUSE OF THE RISK TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WHAT IS IT WHAT IS REALLY THE PURPOSE OF  THE BILL >> BECAUSE A BANK COULD CALL WASHINGTON AND SAY YOU HAVE TO BAIL US OUT. THAT IS A RISK TO OUR POLITICAL  SYSTEM IT IS A RISK TO TAXPAYERS. BUT IT'S ALSO AN UNFAIR  ADVANTAGE FOR THE BANK IN  SECURING LOAN CAPITAL. THEY'RE PAYING, ACCORDING TO THE IMF, 80 BASIS POINTS LESS FOR  THEIR CAPITAL THAN OTHERWISE BECAUSE OF A BELIEF ON WALL  STREET THAT IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER SECURITY THAT BANK HAS THEY HAVE A HOTLINE TO WASHINGTON THAT A MEDIUM SIZED BANK OR A SMALL BANK WOULDN'T  HAVE SO THE POSSIBILITY OF A BAILOUT  GIVES THEM AN UNFAIR EVENTUALLY. THE POSSIBILITY OF A BAILOUT IS  A RISK TO TAXPAYERS. IT'S ALSO A RISK TO OUR  POLITICAL SYSTEM AS WELL.  >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR  EXPLANATION. WE APPRECIATE IT >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.  >> WE SHOULD NOTE WE'VE REACHED  OUT TO THE FINANCIAL SERVICES  ROUND-TABLE FOR COMMENT ON THE BILL BUT WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED A RESPONSE. >>> ALL RIGHT, NOW THAT THERE'S  A NAFTA REPLACEMENT DEAL BETWEEN THE U.S., MEXICO ANDCANADA,  THERE ARE SOME SURPRISE WINNERS  AND LOSERS WE'RE LIVE IN D.C. WITH THAT STORY. >> Reporter: WE HAVE TALKED A  LOT ABOUT WHAT THIS AGREEMENT  MEANS FOR FARMERS AND FACTORY  WORKERS. BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR  FOOTBALL TUCKED INSIDE THE U.S. MCA IS A  LITTLE SOMETHING FOR THE NFL GONE IS THE BAN ON CANADIAN  BROADCASTERS SELLING LOCAL ADS THAT AIR DURING THE SUPER BOWL NOW, THE GAME IS ONE OF THE  BIGGEST TV EVENTS IN CANADA. MORE AD SALES THE NFL BELIEVES WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT THE  FOOTBALL INDUSTRY. NOW, COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL  SAID HE GREATLY APPRECIATES  PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP ON  THIS ISSUE ANOTHER SURPRISING WINNER IN THIS, WHISKEY. SPECIFICALLY AMERICAN RYE  WHISKEY. IT'S UNDER CONSIDERATION AS A  DISTINCTIVE PRODUCT IN THE NEW TRADE DEAL YOU COULDN'T CALL IT AMERICAN  RYE WHISKEY UNLESS IT'S MADE IN  THE U.S., 51% ALCOHOL IS DISTILLED IN NEW CHARRED BARRELS. DEEP INSIDE THE TEXT OF THIS DEAL IS A PROVISION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE U.S. TO WITHDRAW IF  CANADA OR MEXICO SIGNS A FREE  TRADE AGREEMENT WITH A NON-MARKET COUNTRY, THAT WOULD BE CHINA THIS IS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL PROVISION. IT'S CLEARLY AN ATTEMPT BY THE WHITE HOUSE TO BOX IN BEIJING. GUYS, THIS SHOWS HOW EXPANSIVE AND WIDE RANGING THE DEAL REALLY IS IT COULD TAKE YEARS BEFORE WE  FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT WILL SHAPE OUR ECONOMY IN WAYS LARGE  AND SMALL. >> TWO QUESTIONS I'M GOING TO KEEP THEM SEPARATE. THE FIRST QUESTION IS, THAT LAST PROVISION YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IS CLEARLY POINTED AT CHINA. WOULD IT AFFECT ANY DEAL THAT  CANADA STRUCK WITH ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY >> Reporter: IF FIT'S CONSIDERE  A NON-MARKET ECONOMY, THEN YES IT GIVES CANADA AND MEXICO AND THE U.S. ACTUALLY THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE DEAL IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE DEAL, BUT IT GIVES THEM THE OPTION. >> SOMEONE WOULD, OBVIOUSLY, HAVE A DEFINITION OF WHAT A  NON-MARKET COUNTRY IS. IT WOULD BE A COMMAND AND  CONTROLLING ECONOMY I SUPPOSE  THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DRIVING AT LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT  OFFLINE. THAT IS HOW FOREIGN BRANDED CARS THAT ARE MADE IN THE UNITED  STATES LIKE MANY HONDAS, SOME  TOYOTAS, MERCEDES, HOW ARE THEY  TAXED OR TARIFFED UNDER THIS NEW

now Long Island has seen devastation Long Island has seen suffering and Long Island has seen its effects from major storms and 1,500 miles away from this very spot there is a place that is looking for help and looking from relief from its friends in Puerto Rico you know a lot of people remember not too long ago two years ago they suffered from a massive storm which dwindled power supplies you know at communication water and America in general opened up and reached out and helped well in the last week Puerto Rico has seen devastation all over again and they have still not recovered well here in the town of hempstead we're saying we're here to help we are joining together as a unified town board and we are starting the ability now for people to bring supplies that are going to be transported down to Puerto Rico for those in need now you are going to be able to drop off goods water food clothing diapers hand wipe gloves whatever it is you have we're asking you to bring here to this building right here at town hall to other locations at 200 North Franklin to Leavitt town hall to Echo Park and help us help our friends I'm so happy to be here and I'm so happy that all of us are working together to make sure that we do the best we can for the people who live in Puerto Rico it is very devastating I know yesterday they had another portion of an earthquake and it's wonderful to be able to work together to get something for them so that they can have food remember they don't have electricity so if you have anything canned goods that they can eat that they can just open that would be great as well it's our job not just as as elected officials but really as Americans as humans to step up and do what's right and to open up our offices to open up our resources to make sure that we could provide help to those who really need it and like the supervisor mentioned this isn't about financial support or the things that we think of right off the top of our heads like water things like cleaning supplies I remember in the aftermath of all of our flooding cleaning supplies was one of them important things that we could collect because we need to make sure that our homes were safe and we were removing mold so people aren't getting sick so I went over to BJ's in Levittown I spoke to the sewer manager Amanda Sullivan and she said oh I gave out all my my donations earlier in the month we have nothing left to give out and I told us for Puerto Rico they need water and food and he didn't know like we needed it right away they need it now she goes you know what I'm gonna give you four pallets of water I said how many cases of water on a pallet 50 she gave us 200 cases of water weight there and then and fortunately for me I saw somebody from the town of hempstead that was shopping I said get the truck over here pick it up before they change their mind so we got the water right here you look at that right now they're suffering when it comes to earthquakes and when it comes to the hurricane that hit them it's time for us to embrace our fellow Americans and to make this happen the town of hempstead and its residents have a great great tradition of stepping up when we have difficulties for our own neighbors we consider Puerto Rico's of Puerto Rico and its residents our our distant neighbors but neighbors nonetheless so I want to thank all of the residents everybody who will be stepping up going forward and donating it'll go to a great cause and will help our friends in Puerto Rico thank you as a form of First Responder my colleague will attest to this it's named just the resident that needs supplies first responders all over the world in the country will be responding to help out down there basic supplies such as clean water it's

thank you mr speaker i rise today an unequivocal support of our ally israel as a sovereign state israel has every right and a duty to protect its people from the unprovoked attacks of the iranian-backed terrorist group hamas it's painful to watch parents and their terrified children fleeing bomb shelters as rockets rain down indiscriminately on civilian neighborhoods thankfully our israeli friends are protected by the iron dome a joint u.s israeli defense initiative that has saved countless lives it is shameful that some within our congress congress choose to condemn our longtime ally for simply defending themselves no doubt if a similar attack took place in the u.s these same members would expect our military to protect their homes and communities sadly we shouldn't be surprised when terrorist groups like hamas feel emboldened to attack our allies when the bind administration's policies signal weakness to our adversaries i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to speak up with one voice in support of israel one of our great allies i yield back

you might've noticed we're in DC and that's because this weekend Washington DC is hosted a 45th annual legislative conference of the Congressional Black Caucus foundation much more than just a conference the annual CBC weekend as it has come to be known as a substantive convening of elected officials activists policymakers journalists and academics from across the country the call to Washington to respond to the most pressing issues facing black communities and to offer analyses and solutions every high-ranking official interested in having his or her voice heard among black Americans is sure to make an appearance yesterday attorney general Loretta Lynch spoke to a crowded room about criminal justice reform and voting rights this morning vice president joe biden is attending the annual prayer breakfast and this evening President Obama will address the awards dinner Hillary Clinton is also scheduled to be in attendance right at the table of congressman Rangel and Conyers which is wise worth noting that the recurring theme of this weekend centers on a group of activists who had not yet even been born when the CBC foundation held its first gathering because this year the dominating idea of the conference is quite simply black lives matter so with me representative barbara Lee and the leadership conferences wait Henderson and joining us now is a foam lat ek who is attorney and co-creator of black and brown people vote and D Watkins salon.com colonists and English professor at Goucher College and author of the new book of F a b-side living and dying while black in America thank you guys for being here thank you so talk to me a little bit about how you think black lives matter is starting to transform the political landscape and particularly like the black political agenda well first of all I'm glad that I'm here with what i would consider intergenerational allies and that's one thing that i think is great about this movement is that it's it's a continuation of activism that has been going on within our community literally since slavery i mean we've always had individuals that have said we have to step outside of the status quo to create change as Frederick Douglass has stated you know power concedes nothing without a struggle so what we're seeing is this generation is defining for themselves how we deal with that struggle and what we're also seeing is a response from elected officials of all races and colors but especially black leaders that are also saying the time is now to not only listen but at times also let young people lead how we change and how do we define that struggle I have been fascinated by exactly that because congresswoman I've been impressed at the CBC over the course of this weekend really taking up black lives matter not in a row aren't they cute kind of way but like actively engaging and at a time when the discourse on the right has shifted to black lives matter are terrible shouldn't be taken seriously well first of all black lives matters is a movement that we all must listen to and connect with once again I'm proud of my district of california where we have so many young leaders in the black lives movement secondly the black lives movement has evolved into a really political movement this challenging candidates are public policy issues which have to do with institutional and systemic biases and racism and it's so important that young people continue this movement but that those of us in Congress listen to because our movement and the wind beneath our wings and the push of course has to be from a democratic movement from the outside I mean that's how democracy works so what we're working so that you know is why there are some members of CBC I'm just here for and I just like I so appreciate that I moderated a panel at the request representative Lewis who put together a panel that had stick activists along with black lives matter and Justice League activists and very similarly like I saw him lean in and engage those young people and say you were mind you remind me of what we were doing but no need to act like everybody feels that way I just want to show the Washington Post there was a piece titled I was a civil rights activists in the 1960s but it's hard for me to get behind black lives matter written by Barbara Reynolds where she kind of goes through and does the full respectability politics saying you can't tell whether or not their mob actors or the protesters it's just there yeah wait look I love Barbara Reynolds but i think that analysis is something i'd have to push back on i mean i think when you meet these young activists like those that we have here what you find is that they recognize the value of moving forward politically taking a social movement and now turning it into a political movement so by emphasizing the importance of making change yes in the broad sense of raising their voices but in a very specific sense of going to the ballot generating new voters and helping to engage in the political process I think they can't help but they change that's why tana he sees report that's why the Ella Baker Institute report I hope will become a rallying cry for the black lives matter movement because they point out that systemic inequality and unconscious bias collude to create a system that creates a virtual cast at those at the bottom of the economic and political ladder and most of those who are also caught incarceration the mass incarceration movement can't fend for themselves and so when you talked about bipartisanship yes I hope there's bipartisanship on criminal justice legislation but bipartisanship is in the eye of the beholder unless you're talking about casting votes and it is unclear that the leadership in both the Republican leadership in the House and Senate will permit it and one last point unless they permit a Voting Rights Act mill to come to the floor in the house and the Senate all of this becomes hot air with nothing focused on making change those interesting cuz you you went straight to voting and z I'm not sure that's my black lives matter is like it's not really clear to me I mean it's a Catholic with a little seam movement full of lots of things but where are you guys on voting I think the key is it's not one thing it's many things my hometown East Baltimore I've never ever had direct contact with activists people engaged in a political process but since movements like black lives matter and any and many others have emerged you have all these brand-new activists there's guys who are taking on coaching some guys who are hung up people with financial literacy some people like me who focus on writing in journalism so we are becoming activists and our own right and going thanks to strengthen our community so if you push back on black lives matter then you're kind of pushing back on the progression of black people in America in general we meet these types of movements um and all of these different types of activism to take place if we want to see real change know what that happened this interracial moment but I'm really interested in whether or not you see this is a good thing or co-opting thing so Valerie Jarrett met with a couple activists from campaign zero at the White House but not only did she meet with them she then like with actively tweeting with them so this is des ray and of course shortie doo-wop and they you know they're quoting I mean they're tweeting with Valerie Jarrett and saying you know campaigns here their topics that it was a candid and conversation that covered much ground and then it got fascinating where Jarrett writes back looking forward to continuing our dialogue shorty doowop writes back i'm looking forward to talking about using social media and new ways and then Valerie Jarrett writes back I think this is fascinating me too you are the experts and there's a part of me that's like what just happened this is amazing you know here's a senior White House adviser tweeting it up with DeRay and shorty doowop on the other hand I also wonder like did it cost so that's gonna be the question on the table we're gonna come back i was gonna talk about Batman and the police all that's happening when we come back

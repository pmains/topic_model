- do you wanna know what a beautiful day what a great day Saint Patrick is smiling on us today and it's a good match for lovely data the hold of this hearing we appreciate the effort of all the witnesses - to be with us today and I'm especially delighted to be co-chairing this hearing with my colleague Bernie Sanders and today's hearing is focused as you know on exploring the link between clean the Clean Air Act and the economy and Senators will have about five minutes for their opening statements and then we'll recognize our our panel of witnesses following midea panels statements were gonna have a couple of rounds of questions maybe two rounds of questions with how roughly five minutes five minutes each the government as some of you heard me say before I think government has many roles to play I think one of the most important roles that we have to play is to try to provide what I call a Danner churring environment for job creation job preservation if in my state and frankly in any state in this country if we have companies are successful they're playing by the rules they're being good corporate citizens they're making money paying taxes hiring people to work people coming off from out of colleges and universities out of high schools off of welfare rolls off of unemployment rolls in in my business if you got all that going for you you know the rest is pretty easy the role of government is not through the lap dog for for business but to try to provide a nurturing environment for for job creation for the last of 40 years that EPA has tried to do its part to enable the federal government to play that critical role APA has sought to foster economic growth while ensuring that Americans are protected from life threatening pollution including air pollution in 1970 President Nixon signed into law the Clean Air Act this Act established a framework as we know to curb among other things our air pollution this law was so successful that over 200,000 lives were saved between 1970 and 1990 in 1990 President George Herbert Walker Bush built upon President Nixon's legacy were the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and that's the act that gave us the clean air laws that we live with today lately some of us ought to to make the claim that the Clean Air Act has raised costs for consumers and hurt our economy but on closer analysis the tell a somewhat different story for example since 1990 electricity rates adjusted for inflation have stayed constant in the United States while a real gross domestic product has grown by some 60% at the same time we've saved thousands of lives tens of thousands of lives and we've ensured that our children along with their parents and grandparents can breathe cleaner healthier air for 2010 alone cleaning up soot and smog saved over 160,000 lives that's over twice the number of people who live where I live in Wilmington Delaware and at the same time our country saves some 1.3 trillion dollars in health care costs by saving lives reducing asthma attacks and reducing sick days put another way the Clean Air Act benefits outweigh the cost by a margin of 30 to 1 talk about a return on investment just doesn't get a whole lot better than that these clean air regulations help us save billions of dollars on public health costs while providing a multitude of opportunities for good-paying American jobs according to recent reports clean air regulations that will be promulgated later this year are expected to create as many as one and a half million new jobs over the next five years jobs that come at a crucial time as the economy continues to recover and begins to grow these are American jobs and engineering American jobs in design as well as in manufacturing installing and operating pollution control and clean energy technology that's made in America and sold all over the world in closing let me just leave leave us all with the quote from Harry Truman president Harry Truman once said and I'm going to paraphrase what he said he said the only thing that's new in the world is the history we've forgotten or never learned in closing I want to invite my colleagues to take a little time to actually drill down and what I believe were the facts with with regards to the Clean Air Act I believe that once they see the facts they'll come to realize that moving our country forward cannot mean going backwards certainly not on clean air that having been said when recognized senator Sanders and it will move to our Republican colleagues we thank you for being a part of it in senator Alexander I have been a wingman on the issue of cleaner air clearly trying to a Sox NOx and Mercury for as he says for a number of years and I come from a state as does senator Sanders where we're the sometimes I feel like we live at the end of America's tailpipe and we have a bunch of states to the west of us who generate electricity by burning in many cases called nothing against coal but we know we need coal when you really clean coal actually but putting bad stuff up in the air and it just blows our way and we end up breathing it and it's especially frustrating you know Lamar mentioned at a time he served as governor and I was a little bit after him but so very frustrating we're trying to meet our clean air requirements to stay in compliance with the guidance of you know the regs and so forth and for us we could I could literally shut down Delaware in order to try to meet to be in attainment on some of this stuff and we still would have been out of a team it because the folks out to the west of us we're putting dirty stuff into the air and simply came on our way it's just not fair it's not and then we had to compete with these folks in terms of electricity costing they were in a cheap electricity a lot of times but created by coal and we it was just just not fair a big believer in a golden rule treat other people the way we want to be treated and part of what we want to do is make sure that that happens and in this instance all right long introductions now for our panel members I hope you folks were Paul Allen you're sort of like introduced on the left handed way by Ben Cardin I'll use the same Paul Allen who founded that Microsoft is at you maybe they let the mail or Delia give the wrong dividend check below the wrong pile and in your case the right one so I just wanted to check all right Barbara Samson is it something yeah Barbara Thompson legislative director of the United Auto Workers welcome we used to have a lot of hard workers in Delaware you al be represented local 1183 at Chrysler and 435 a GM and a GM plant is coming back to live and we're going to be starting to build late next year a bunch of cars my Fisker beautiful beautiful luxury cars they get 80 miles per gallon and I suspect they're gonna be built by some your folks that's good we're looking forward to that all right got here guy here from Dover Dover of course is our capital and I used to spend a lot of time in a capital of Ohio Columbus I was a Buckeye Ohio State and and I've actually driven through your city a time or two so we're glad that yeah the other Dover and the man from the other Dover is is here and my understand it unit you pronounce your name home ring housing housing housing okay good all right as anybody ever mispronounced your name okay just check you mayor of Dover welcome and again Ben's already given mr. Allen a bit of an introduction we're happier here I'm mr. Allen next we have mr. David Montgomery vice president of Charles River associates there's a charles river that runs right through Boston made famous in song and and my song that Christopher just graduated for a school up for Easter run right along that river in fact he and I run it many times together and it's nice - nice to have you here and finally I'm James a yenh yenh right Yen vice president no managing director of Austin power and we're happy to see you and welcome one and all your tire statements for me made part of the record and if you'd like to summarize from here feel free to do that but I just try to stick to about five minutes if you run a little bit over that that's okay if you run a lot over that that's not okay I'll ring you back in but miss Thomson why don't you lead these guys off okay thanks we're glad you're all here Ian thanks so much for wrapping us up here good test fun and enlightening testimony in in some cases that's why I almost wish we like to let the witnesses has questions with one another we will find a way to do that let me just start off by saying that Delaware is does not include in our state we don't include the Chesapeake Bay but tributaries of the from Delaware including Nanticoke River actually lead to the the Delaware Bay excuse me to the Chesapeake Bay and as it turns out their tributaries from maybe half dozen or so States but actually whose waters end up in the Chesapeake Bay Chesapeake Bay's been struggling for a long time with sedimentation all kinds of nutrients and so forth that have led to what are killing parts of vast parts of the Chesapeake Bay there's just not much going on there in terms of life the folks in the PSP could make their living off of as Waterman don't much like this and they've a called on their elected officials to work on the rest of us to try to clean up our runoff so that they'll have actually a Chesapeake Bay that will be alive and vibrant and and provide a lot livelihood for them there's a river a couple of rivers that flow into my state from Pennsylvania they will use those rivers for the water when it gets to Delaware use it for drinking water and we treat it but we use it for drinking water and there's a great concern about what the folks who live upstate from us in Pennsylvania are putting into what ultimately becomes our drinking water in our Dover Delaware we end up breathing the air that brings with it pollution from Dover Ohio brings pollution from Tennessee and Indiana West Virginia Virginia and we end up having to breathe that stuff we end up having to reduce our emissions in order to try to be in compliance with with federal environmental guidelines we end up having to put extra pollution devices on our our own utilities in order to reduce emissions really and a lot of the stuff that we're breathing here comes from outside of our state Jim Inhofe and I spend about half an hour together every Thursday in the capital in a Bible study group is led by our chaplain Barry black who's retired Navy I'm a good guy and he's always reminding us to one try to as how did how did your faith guide you and what you do the other thing he's a big guys Jimmy I was a chapel of life's big to believe in the Golden Rule treat other people the way we want to be treated he likes to say the golden rule is the cliffnotes of the New Testament I just want to ask you in thinking of those examples our waters contributing to the pollution problems that they have in a Chesapeake upstream water pollution that comes down and we and not having in our drinking water and of the air that we breathe and over that is polluted by places as far away's Dover Ohio and further for the West than that how how does that how does that how is that consistent with a golden rule mayor well in in Dover's example we've always had a strong commitment to being good stewards of the environment we were the first municipal electric system in the United States to install gas fired CO burners to clean up our emissions on startup when when we fire up the coal we also have the ability to co fire with gas with the price of gas we don't do that we have switched to a different call that that allows us to a burn cleaner or we have installed a six point one five million dollar back house which I don't think we bought from Alstom but our opacity is next to nil we have a very clean operation we we do what we can do our part to clean up the environment and that's always been our commitment ever since I've been mayor since 1992 and we we do it consistently we're always looking at ways to clean up any problem areas that we might have so I understand that that you are getting some kind of transport from other areas of the country but I would doubt very much that's coming from Dover a lot well I hope not we we compete for jobs we've got a former mayor up here and couple of recovering governors and we we compete for jobs every day against other states and against the rest of the world among the to route driving factors in and for creating that nurturing environment for job creation job preservation one is the cost of power Carsley electricity another the cost of health care and and I would just suggest to you that when we're trying to compete with States they get much cheaper utility costs because they burn dirty dirty fuels and create pollution for us and it and we have to increase our utility cost in part to try to control those emissions and then we end up paying higher health care costs it's just not fair it's just not fair and and I would just ask you to keep that one the folks in Dover Ohio are thinking about your pollution and what to do in terms of reducing your emissions I hope you'll keep in mind that their folks and other Dover's that's independent be the stuff we end up having to pay higher health care costs we have thousands of kids that aren't in school today because the asthma because he can't be the air it's just not fair I would just ask you to keep that in mind the great thing about this this is a situation we're in is it actually can create jobs and mr. Montgomery you seem to suggest it it doesn't I and maybe these folks that are working on air pollution control devices and installing those in places across the country that they could find find other work the unemployment rate in the construction industry is 21% today and the folks that are doing the work that helps reduce these emissions you say well we're not gonna we're not going to reduce Sox NOx mercury emissions today we want you go out and go find other work be gainfully employed the unab climate rate is over 20% it might be easy to sit here today in Washington DC in his hearing room and say well they can find work similar cells well if they could find work someplace else I suspect they would be doing it I would come back to - if I can - to mr. Samson the I was very much involved in the cafe legislation trying to come up with something that the auto industry could live with and it was fair - what - those the rest of us as well talk to us if you will about an cafe we said basically came to a bipartisan agreement Ted Stevens when McKenna he was big a big player in all this for City at the end and getting us to a situation where in the cafe 2007 we said by 2020 overall fleet average energy efficiency fuel efficiency will be 36 miles per gallon we still had a problem though because there was a question we're gonna have a California standard we have separate standards for different states and the the current administration got involved and said let's just try to not have a bunch of different standards let's just have one standard 36 miles per gallon we're gonna have it by 2016 the auto industry body and UAW bought in just talk to us about why that makes sense why that's a good idea well thank you for giving me that opportunity and I will point out that under the EPA nits a 1 national program that runs from 2012 to 2016 will be at 35 point five miles per gallon by 2016 so we move that up considerably the auto industry is one where planning has to be done years and years in advance and the investments are enormous capital investments and they need the certainty of what is going to be demanded of them in order to develop to do the research and development to do the retooling of the facilities to train workers to get the equipment if they need that years out five years which is the authority that Nitsa has is actually not even an ideal time for how long ahead we have to be planning we definitely need one national standard and not a patchwork of different regulations for different parts of the country it would be way too difficult to be manufacturing and selling and keeping track of things in different states if I can take this opportunity to just play off a little what mr. Montgomery said I am I'm not an economist and I'm not going to speak to job growth green jobs in other parts of the economy but the job growth that we've seen here that I testified to today these are jobs that would not be in this country otherwise that that up until a year ago there was really only one facility in the United States that was making the components for advanced technology vehicles and that was the white March facility in Maryland and it was making them for trucks so that the the advanced vehicles the vehicles of the future and their components were all being imported Priuses are imported all the engines and the power trains for the high-tech vehicles that are assembled here in the United States all of them were being imported from Japan or Italy or Germany and we are now seeing because of some of the things I testified about the growth of these thirty new plants we will actually be able to make the components not just assemble from parts that are coming in from outside the United States but these are truly new jobs because of the requirements that the industry knows they have to meet because of the one national standard thanks very much we've been joined by Senator Barrasso thanks very much for your insightful questioning pretty much I I want to go back to it to mr. yan and fine I couldn't as you know it's cars we've been working on our effort working on cleaner air for some 40 years this year we've have several clean air rags that are targeting our utilities all of which are under court-ordered deadlines amasses based on your past experience do you feel that utilities can install the control technology that is needed to meet these new regulations in the time frame required as Senator we've talked to a number of them and worked with him and everything is doable with a plan and the plans are being developed I think we need to be careful of any delay that could put a burden on that timeline and make it a more aggressive schedule say that again about a delay and delay would put a needle able to put a burden okay one day sorry sorry I understand I remember I got you about five six years ago representatives from about ten different utilities came in to see me they're from all over the country and Senator Alexander and I had been working on before pollutant bill dealing with sulfur dioxide and nitric oxide mercury and co2 emissions and trying to see for some way to accept a market assessment trading system to harness market forces to reduce release Sox NOx and Mercury saxitoxin and co2 emissions but not mercury and at the end of the conversation it's one guy from the southern a southern based utility I'll think it was from southern utility but suddenly he said well keynes it why don't talking to you said senator why don't you do this you and your colleagues do this tell us what the rules are going to be terms of reducing emissions give us a reasonable amount in time give us some flexibility and get out of the way that's what he said I thought that's pretty good advice I thought I still think that's pretty good advice I'll go back to - mr. Allen if I could and your testimony yes sir you shared with us the example of the Brandon shores facility in Maryland and I believe said your company installed technology to meet a 2006 state direct that took approximately I don't know 24 25 26 months to to install all the technology and it was completed a year or two ago maybe in 2009 is that correct okay did you believe this facility will meet recent EPA regulations of air toxics and Sox and NOx yes okay as you know we've seen several different jobs studies I've almost like dueling job studies going on here we've seen several different jobs studies citing job creation with clean air regulations how does your experience at Brandon shores match up with some of these studies are they on target or the off-base well I can't speak to all of the all of the studies what I what I can say is that we have numbers that would be very similar to what I heard from Alstom in terms of what it takes to do the the actual construction and installation of the equipment it's harder for me to speak to the jobs in the supply chain but if you think about who the supply chain is I mean it includes Alstom it also includes new core steel that we heard senator Johanns mentioned it includes Lehi cement which is a customer of constellation energies it it it very importantly includes the heavy automotive industry that the United Auto Workers works in so the supply chain contains a great great great many jobs and then there are the constructors the Bechdel's the floors the the Peter Kiewit s' of of the country who we depend upon the Washington International groups and Shaw and others and then the engineering firms that Charles River consults to the stone and webster's and black & veatch's and Babcock's and Wilcox's and all of the rest of them so yes it's a it's a essentially an American industry and and I want to say something else about the jobs associated because we know who the people are who build these facilities they are in fact the same Boilermakers and pipe fitters and and engineers and steamfitters and laborers and Teamsters and others who manage the outages and the maintenance of all of these facilities these are people who have careers in doing the highly skilled jobs that are associated with the electric power industry so that tells us two things it tells us that they're there to be employed and and it also tells us that they need the employment in order to pursue their careers so I I guess I just think that that's an important thing to consider when you're wondering about whether or not there are jobs associated with with you know kind of doing the fundamental work of of operating the electric power system it seems I just I've always thought that the question sort of answered itself oh good I like those questions answer themselves I couldn't come back if I could mr. yen and I think your company is if I'm hurt I've been told that your company's on the cutting edge of of carbon capture and storage technology is that a fair statement yes senator we are we currently have 12 projects there either in engineering or testing of CCS projects around the world and making progress in that arena okay is your company seeing an uptick in interest in this kind of technology with greenhouse gas regulations in place no senator we're not okay are you seeing a decrease an interest in this kind of technology with the new greenhouse gas regulations in place is the interest going up or down I'd say it's gone down sooner okay so you're seeing fewer utilities especially an interest in in this is a carbon capture and storage technology yes sir why do you think that is utilities are in a complex situation you know they're trying to serve us the consumers of power and trying to serve us as the people who are citizens in United States they're trying to work a balancing act and I think you said it very eloquently earlier please tell us what to do give us a reasonable time to do it and we'll go do it there's the price of natural gas a dramatic drop in the price of natural gas is that playing a role here it's complicating the issue okay fair enough just really why do you believe that efficiency we talked about now and we're trying to get efficiencies in mobile out of our mobile fleets and we're gonna come close to doubling the requirements for energy efficiency with our mobile fleets by 2016 but you think from efficiencies that we can create jobs a senator I don't think there's any silver bolt there's a lot of silver buckshot I think we have to take advantage of every opportunity we can to reach that solution okay that's one part of it well like a wrap up by well I'm gonna come back in we're gonna recognize senator Brosseau we don't want to come back and ask just one follow-up question but the and I'll just I'll Telegraph the pitch right now one of the things that that I try to focus on here is how do we develop consensus is a pretty contentious place and we need to try to find consensus and a whole lot of areas of deficit reduction and how to break in terms of health care better outcomes less money what we're gonna do about in for stretch our transportation infrastructure we have all kinds and we need to develop consensus to be able to address these complex and difficult issues one of the things I'm gonna ask you all to do never be my last question is given where you're coming from in your testimony's where do you think there's agreement amongst this panel I'm just gonna ask everybody here where do you think you agree with respect to you know cleaner air creates increasing jobs you create that's what do you agree and in what do you think that you agree that it actually might be helpful to us as we try to find consensus on on these issues okay that would be my last question so think about that chew on that for a while and meantime Center brasses hired folks I've Telegraph my pitch you're at the plate it's a chance to hit one out of the park I was Sampson you want to go first certainly Thank You senator Thompson one thing I heard today that pleased me was that everybody is not just concerned about jobs but about good jobs and good jobs are defined as high paying jobs and jobs that provide benefits which we see as pensions and healthcare and I'm pleased that this is a bipartisan and everybody on our panel seems to agree that that's a high value that we have to keep an eye on because of course we have a great concern about the loss of those jobs and the loss of the middle class I think it's implicit that everybody cares about oil savings and that of course we're all better off if our our vehicles for example are more efficient and I would suggest an answer to mr. Montgomery that although it is true that the cost of the vehicle goes up there are considerable savings to the consumer from the advanced technology vehicles they pay less at the pump and that's money that they can take and spend elsewhere which stimulates jobs with respect to mr. Montgomery's saying that that that we'd have fewer cars sales if we were to have more regulations I think in fact that the drop in car sales is because of the economy and the economy has led to such a high unemployment rate so we're back again to jobs so if we all agree that we need jobs and good jobs that we all benefit from oil savings and that we have some benefit even if it might not be we might argue over how great a benefit to a healthier environment I think everybody is really on the same page and if this led to having Congress once again take up comprehensive climate change legislation we think that would be a wonderful thing all right thank you there is a lot of pent up demand for buying new cars trucks and vans and we've gone from a time a few years ago we're buying in his country 16 to 17 million units a year down to as little as nine ten units it's a lot of a lot of pent-up demand and when the economy comes back as the economy comes back and people look at their old clunkers and there are their driveways and garages out on the street but one of the good things that's coming out of Detroit and in other places too are far more energy efficient vehicles far more energy efficient vehicles so hopefully at a time when folks are looking for some new a new set of wheels a lot of the sets of wheels are available beginning thirty forty fifty miles per gallon even 8080 with that new Fisker and Chevrolet Volt already there Thank You senator I believe that we can all agree that we need to do what's in the best interest of the entire country in cleaning up our environment but we also have to be very careful on what steps we take you know if if if the the intent is to get away from burning coal which is very inexpensive resource and move it towards natural gas or some other higher price commodity we have to be cautious because increased need will increase the cost of natural gas people can't afford to heat their homes with increased cost they can't afford their electricity if the electricity price was raised because of natural gas they can't afford I'm sorry I don't understand you say if the electricity price is raised because it because that's prices are higher cost of natural gas if you have an increased demand natural gas is going to get an increase in cost then all the demand is going up but the price is going down I know it's a seems that counterintuitive but that's what's happening well history shows that the more demand for a product the more it's going to cost unless the supply experienced dramatically and then and then you have to be wary of what is the fracking going to do to water supply you know there's a whole myriad of problems associated with this but several years ago I believe that Chinese were bringing online one new coal-fired power plant a week no regulations when they had the Olympics they had to shut down to power plants so the air could be cleaned up so they could have the Olympics which affected Dover chemical which one of their products is they need phosphate well there were two places in the world that they could get phosphate which from China or use Becca Stan since they they couldn't have the electricity to mind the phosphite Chinese raised the prices by 300% which puts 60 employees at Dover chemical out of work so and I read a report last week about the beneficial effects of the Clean Air Act from 1990 to 2000 and what struck me as very interesting a map was where all showed a map where all the pollution points were in the United States yet it had Canada and Mexico with no points on the map so I was just wondering if if pollution follows boundaries alright thank you I commented when West Virginia my dad actually just worked at a coal mine for a while and so I have a soft spot in my heart still for West Virginia and for the coal coal industry I I'm not interested in putting coal out of business what I'm interested in doing is making sure as we burn it we have a lot of it as we burn it to create electricity that we just burn it in a far more far cleaner way far cleaner way that's what I want to go to the other witness is good we need to close it right and and I think you know in order to do that we need to spend some serious dollars on clean coal technology and we have and now what we need to do is to spend some serious dollars on implementing that technology that dhalsim and others have so that's that's that's part of our challenge all right thank you mr. Allen some closing thoughts well I think what you heard was that everything is connected to everything else all right thanks very much miss mr. Montgomery good go back to you mr. Allen and I also think that you heard a lot of different points of view struggling to understanding coalesce around the fundamental value proposition of mental protection and at some point either you think that value is worth the cost or you don't and to the extent that markets can be used to do two things to Express the most efficient way to achieve the value if you believe it's there and second to test how much consumers are willing to pay for it then I think you've got probably the right formula mr. Montgomery said almost exactly the same thing if you think about it he said that the cost sooner or later flow through to consumers he's absolutely right the question is the consumers want to pay for the value that they get from particularly clean air and all I think we should leave that going back to the example I used earlier between dover ohio and and dover delaware the the consumers in and the folks are going to benefit most from cleaner air and from dover ohio our folks in dover delaware because of the the the transport of the the emissions and the folks are going to have to bear or have been bearing for years higher health care costs are the people on the east coast mid-atlantic and the Northeast and the investments made in some cases in the Midwest will actually benefit those of us who live in the rest of our country at least in the eastern part of our country because our health care costs are gonna go down and it's it's a it's hard for me to make an argument I'm trying to compete for what's the company that's thinking about putting jobs in Dover Ohio or Dover Delaware and they say well we're gonna clean it to go to Dover ohai they have cheaper electricity costs and their health care costs are lower and that's that that's hard for me to compete with and I we've actually not using not to pick on Dover we've actually had those those those those battles and they're hard to win I guess I'm in the camp of thinking we're all in this together good all right thanks how much my company I think I think the first thing we can probably all agree on is that miss Sampson and I do not agree about the effects of regulation on the the auto industry I'd propose that the referee on that be a book by two economists at more or less democratic organization the Brookings Institution Pietra neva Lowe and Robert Crandall who I would defer to on that subject but I think that they support my point of view I may be again overly optimistic but I think that we all agree that in in in doing these in any of these environmental regulations it would be very helpful if they are done in a way that they're stringency and application and timing responds in a more or less automatically way to what we find out are the costs of doing things that in many ways we're hearing that it's arbitrary schedules and arbitrary you know units specific requirements that are not something that are adjustable because of the cost or difficulty of doing something that is something really to be avoided and I'd like to believe that that also makes us all agree that there are far better ways of dealing with greenhouse gas emissions than the Clean Air Act authorities of EPA and finally I'd love to talk to you about TMDL trading in the Chesapeake because I think that one way we could deal with one of the Golden Rule problems is if Congress took up the subject of a six state trading system to improve the way in which the runoff is managed that's an entirely different subject that's a good that's a good maybe we can get senator Cardin to join us in that conversation all right thanks thanks a lot I miss Yun Thank You senator I think we all believe in quality clean air and I think we all believe in quality jobs and I think we also believe that the market-based solutions provide the best option for addressing these issues and I think quietly off and did that one of one of the questions that I think President George Herbert Walker Bush faced as they had signed into law the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments was how are we going to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions we had a real problem with acid rain at the time we don't hear much about that anymore and I think they wrestle with the question of what we're gonna use a regulatory approach or we're gonna try to harness market forces and and use that use that approach in the end that the the approach drove market using market forces somewhat skeptical of whether that what actually would actually work but turned out it worked pretty well and I'm told we actually met herself a dioxide emission targets and about one half the time that was anticipated about one-fifth the cost pretty impressive and I said a little bit of economics through high state and later after got out of the Navy at my University of Delaware I've always been fascinated by how do we harness market forces to drive good public policy behavior so I don't know who came up with that idea mr. Montgomery about to deal with that with acid rain as far as very clever and maybe sometime somewhere along the way we can find out to apply to other things the the other thing I want to say something some Laura Haynes who said right here over my left shoulder hears me say about every other day in adverse I'd like to quote Albert Einstein one of the few people here who does but he used to say an adversity lies opportunity and I'm by nature an optimistic person but I really think we place face but plenty of adversity these days certain on the scale of what they face over and Japan right now but we face plenty of adversity and I think our challenges as we deal with that adversity adversity to try to derive from an opportunity to realize opportunity and God knows we need jobs here we need to bang jobs we need to cleaner air and we need to reduce our dependence on on fossil fuels especially on oil from other countries that are undemocratic and unstable so my hope is that we can figure out around here and the reason why how to work together and find consensus and reason why I ask all of you to the answer that last question was to maybe help plant some seeds for for that for the consensus so we were very much appreciate your a preparation for today your participation today I mean your willingness to maybe if we're lucky we'll send you a few questions in writing that too many would ask you if you get some of those that you respond to them promptly and we'd be most grateful with that this hearing is adjourned thanks so much

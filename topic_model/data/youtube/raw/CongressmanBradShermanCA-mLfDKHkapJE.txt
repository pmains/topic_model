simpson obviously you make your own investment is a voting decision never I'm restart the clock I was gonna make my comment but okay um not everyone can has your largest staff would you prefer your fellow voters and shareholders get professional advice or just rubber-stamp whatever management tells them independent advice is always a good idea the interests of share owners and management are usually pretty well aligned you know ultimately we're on the same side we want companies to do well we want prosperity we want good returns yeah I represent a lot of your members I could do more but unfortunately there are areas of conflict executive compensation is a great idea and for a small investor to look at that executive compensation disclosure so complicated and working out how it's changed over time how to compare it with other companies how to relate it to the financial performance gee whiz you need a PhD in something to work that out so I think that in the free flow of information in the markets would you feel better as a major owner of Wells Fargo if they had a good klaw-bak procedure that would make sure that any executive who perhaps left the company recently with over a hundred million dollars would have their compensation adjusted for what was really happening CalPERS has had a policy on clawbacks in favor of clawbacks which is simply on and rewards which come out of shareowner funds we've had that policy before dodd-frank will continue to have it and hope the SEC rulemaking as possible you know to all be finished and wrapped up soon but it's an essential it's an essential principle of fairness of common sense of alignment of interest I'd point out if dodd-frank had been promptly implemented Wells Fargo executives might have the right incentives and Wells Fargo might have 2 million fewer accounts but it's taken the SEC a long time we hope they get there I'll also point out that if the Chairman's legislation is passed then all future corporations will not have the clawbacks that would have been relevant to to wells fargo now I've heard an estimate of 90 million dollars as the cost of some level of shareholder democracy uh they one of the witnesses said that that was the cost of dealing with these proposals didn't include board member time how much shareholder value is lost because of crony capitalism where boards prevent mergers acquisitions that would have increased shareholder value but were not in the interest of the board members and especially not in the interests of the management that kind of selected them do you think that if every board decision on whether to agree to a merger was made in shareholder in the shareholder interests that shareholders might be enriched by an amount say over 90 million dollars I'm looking at the numbers just on wells fargo we have about a billion dollars in that company equity and debt and then we've lost so you are so about eleven percent yes so something over 90 million dollars just in the first on on that one action company just from one series of two million decisions that were not in the public interest and their consent you know State corporations choose to incorporate under the laws of whatever state does the best job of protecting management and furthering the goals of crony capitalism would CalPERS be in a better position if all these competition codes of all the states had the same level of shareholder protection of California does at least as applicable to the to earth you know the major publicly traded corporations well two of the shower owner rights that we think are most important majority voting it's the ability to vote no as well as yes on a directors election and proxy access which gives us the owners the right to put forward candidates onto the ballot and I'm going to have to ask my learned colleagues there are one or two states which have those provisions but the main states wearing corporation is popular Delaware California and more actually do not have that in the different Delaware is out there advertising in effect will protect management we will defeat efforts to enhance shareholder value incorporate here and needless to say that has caught the the attention of management we ought to have shareholder protections that are national in in nature I I see the governor would like to comment but my I think I'm looked Linux is where we going over here a little bit well I just I'm amused that these questions in the aspersions being cast here that there's these boards of directors running amok somehow doing something that's in a breach of their fiduciary duty and I'm also somewhat amused at citing CalPERS you mentioned Domini constituents i'm looking at the bloomberg report calpers last year earned arousing 0.6 return and Ted Eliopoulos the chief investment officer said you know that is below the assumed rate of seven and a half percent he said that's a significant policy issue if I were worried about somebody I'd be worried about somebody's hoping to get a pension from CalPERS with that puny rate of return and maybe it's crony capitalism that's doing it maybe its investment strategy I don't know but a good governor not everyone can make a seven and a half percent return in this particular economy 0.6 and many many investors lost a lot of money last year and she just lost or rather the organization she represents just lost hundreds of millions of dollars because of the bad corporate governance that we'd like to see ended by enforcing and passing the regulations / clawback rather than supporting legislation that would eliminate that I don't think that's factually accurate you don't think she's lost hundreds of million dollars on wells fargo stock no uh the stock prices as of what date now the numbers know it says as of when i'll be to follow up with the detail anyone who owned a billion-dollar that that level of corporate stock has learned lost an awful lot of money as the stock is declined by tempers as we've learned that management can't prevent two million frauds they did fire 5,300 employees that they found that they hired and on the digital time we're going down to make you in forever government oh so Joe masami's expired

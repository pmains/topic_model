Prince at one point over at the White House the president specifically in response to a question from our own Jessica Yellin the president specifically said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and in the president's words is not right on this issue referring to the criticism the senator Graham has leveled against the Obama administration for the build-up but to what happened in Boston also on the Benghazi killings in Libya as well senator Graham is joining us on the phone right now he's in Phoenix Arizona did you have a chance I senator Graham I assume you did to hear the exchange between Jessica Yellin and the president of the news conference yes I somebody played it back for me and I just say wolf with all due respect to the president we've had eight Americans killed in the last seven months by radical Islamist forum Benghazi for in boston and i think our systems are degrading and I stand by that statement it's not like I relish saying that I just think it is true in Benghazi multiple warnings were coming out of our consulate our ambassador Stevens they were at no work request for security was denied the consulate became a death trap for seven and a half hours nobody could come to the aid of the people who are under attack and after the attack Susan Rice and administration told the narratives that just didn't hold water wasn't a spontaneous event caused by video Boston has got its problems too I will let me play the the clip this is the president speaking at the news conference responding to Jessica yellen's question I know Graham was a member of the Armed Services Committee has said that Benghazi and Boston are both examples of the u.s. going backwards on is he right and did our intelligence miss something no mr. Graham is not right on this issue although i'm sure generated some headlines I think that what we saw in Boston was state local federal officials every agency rallying around the city that had been attacked identifying the perpetrators just hours after the scene had been examined we now have one individual deceased one in custody charges have been brought I think that all our law enforcement officials performed in an exemplary fashion after the bombing had taken place and we should be very proud of their work very proud of their work are a senator grandma you want to directly respond to this part of what the president said absolutely a great work by the Boston Police Department great courage by the Boston people although police organizations in the Boston area the FBI to catch the guy afterwards the FBI had a photo of the suspect and I still don't know why that didn't team the system to say we've already talked to him but my concerns about what happened before he was interviewed in 2011 the older brother was I've got a warning letter from the Russian intelligence service sent the FBI and March in the CIA November he goes back to Russia and Dagestan in 2012 wolf and DHS fix him leaving and coming but they don't share the information with the FBI or the CIA he's never interviewed they never share this guy's presents for the Boston fusion cell is who's supposed to be tracking terrorists in the Boston area and when he comes back in June of 2012 he goes on a YouTube channel of website on the internet for oral to see it embraces radical Islam a guy that's already in the system is suspected to be attractive Lummis now in the world inside the United States embracing the rattle radical Islamist ideology and the rest is history so this is stovepiping death behind the ca not being informed of his travels back to Russia when he gets on the website nobody comes back to him and say hey listen in 2011 he said you loved America he wanted to be an Olympic boxer what are you doing now interacting with these radical Islamic websites our systems are failing in my view I guess the argument that some administration officials have made is that the FBI after they got that initial tip from Russian intelligence back in 2011 and the president specifically said the Russian intelligence agency alerted the u.s. to the older brother and mother the president said today and mother as well as potentially being sympathizers the president then said they did the FBI they went out and interviewed the older brother Tamerlan tsarnaev and the mother and after their investigation they came up with nothing so they closed that file so what are you saying that was a blunder there is that what you're saying they didn't do a good job in the interview I'm saying they did a reasonable job in the interview they took the warning letter from the Russian intelligence service they interviewed the suspect the older brother they opened up a case file and in November the CIA gives the same warning letter and they enter this guy into the tide system a terrace data bank and once he goes back to Russia DHS picks up the fact that the system things in the FBI and the CIA never informed about his trip to Russia so that goes back to a 911 3 911 mentality of not sharing information wouldn't have been great to know we went back to Russia and we could have followed him up I'm disappointed in the Russians but that's no excuse for us not being able to track a guy in our system who goes back to one of the most radical parts of the world and when he comes back and he starts embracing radical Islam for the whole world of see how did we miss that obviously we've got a lot of things to do in terms of post-mortem that fix our systems so people like this when they come back then America from Russia started embracing radical Islamic ideology that we visit them once again and say in 2011 he said she loved this country he wanted to be an Olympic boxer for this country what are you doing now on these websites and oh by the way what did you do in Russia you've got a solemn from Dagestan why did you go back you know the President did say at the news conference that based on what I've seen so far and I'm paraphrasing what the president said he believes the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security did what they were supposed to do he did acknowledge that the Director of National Intelligence the DNI director clapper has begun a full review of what happened to make sure important lessons are learned so if there were mistakes they are not repeated down the road and I assume senator you support that kind of Investigation do you support the DNI director clapper conducting this investigation or do you think there should be an independent commission of inquiry along the lines of the 911 Commission to take a look and study what happened I think it's an on a joint select committee the tiger should relook at Benghazi because were there people now alleging they want to come forward but afraid to do so when it comes to Boston would you need a joint select committee to look at the FBI the CIA and homeland security the system did not work as designed when he left to go back to Russia the system deemed at DHS and they were supposed to share the information with the FBI and the CIA diffusion Center in Boston was supposed to been made aware hey you've got a guy that we've looked at in the Boston area again we I'm glad the clappers want to do an investigation but Congress quite frankly has been less than strong when it comes to investigating Benghazi in boston and i hope we will do our own independent investigation it's not so much about blaming people as to get it right we've lost eight Americans in seven months for overseas for at home and live instead radical Islam is on the march we need to up our game clearly to me the systems did not work the way they supposed to I'm shocked that this is this happened after nine eleven four people no longer talk each other I thought we'd gotten over that son of a gram thanks very much for joining us thank you

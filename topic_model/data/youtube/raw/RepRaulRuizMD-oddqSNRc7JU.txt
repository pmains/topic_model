august 26 2021 psy catholic a giant in our community who worked tirelessly to improve the lives of his fellow veterans and jennifer kepner a veteran whose service vision and relentless advocacy made today possible their three stories are shining examples of what it truly means to live your life with a greater purpose as we continue with today's program let us contemplate their heroism and service to our nation and now i ask you to join me for a moment of silence thank you i'd now like to welcome our very own all-star indio vfw post 3699 for the presentation of the colors if you are able please rise thank you and now i invite my friend bill young from the veterans easy access program to lead us in the pledge of allegiance good morning i'm bill young if you can remain standing please do and begin i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and thank you bill uh bill will be joining us later in the program for a brief presentation to on local veteran service all of you can sit down so now our first speaker is going to be secretary dennis mcdonough then we're going to have khandeep sharon from the medical center director va loma linda hospital romana cruz young who's a veteran representative from the riverside county veterans services tom porter executive director iraq and afghanistan veterans of america and rosie torres executive director of burkis 360 and then back to bill young major u.s air force retired veterans easy access program or what we know here be so without further ado let's dive into the program i'm so excited to be joined by a very special guest to help us get started my friend secretary of the department of veterans affairs dennis mcdonough since day one secretary mcdonough has been a staunch advocate of getting toxic exposed veterans the care they need he has also been an incredible champion of our local veterans here in riverside county and in fact throughout the whole country i know many of you were at our veterans roundtable with the secretary and the house veterans affairs committee chairman mark takano in march when we talked about the need to pass this very bill now six months later we're seeing this law implemented getting veterans in our communities the care they need so i'll now turn it over to secretary mcdonough to talk a little bit about how the va is doing just that dr ruiz thank you very much it's great to be with you let me just do a quick signals check you read me okay good great uh listen thanks to the stories uh the advocacy and the voices of the veterans there in the room with you at the veterans university and online and thanks the unrelenting determination uh and persistence of you dr ruiz and of people like chairman mark decano the pac deck did as you say uh make it to the president's desk and i can't thank all of you enough the bill now law will deliver care and benefits to millions of toxic exposed veterans listen as so many of you know firsthand that while vets were fighting for us many were breathing toxic fumes from burn pits and from other sources and then months or even years later developed conditions that followed them home from war that impacted your lives and in some cases took the lives of those you served with and loved long after the guns of war fell silent so now it's our job to provide you your families our veteran survivors with benefits and care for those conditions it's a monumental moment for va and most importantly for those we serve because with this new law va recognizes more than 20 new presumptives of service connection for toxic exposed toxic related conditions so vets living with those conditions will get the care and the benefits they've earned and that they deserve we'll bring a several new generations of new veterans into va healthcare and doing and increase benefits for many more and that will result in better outcomes better health outcomes better quality of life across the board we'll deliver benef benefits to more survivors of vets who survive who passed away from toxic exposure and we'll invest in our workforce and in our infrastructure to deliver those additional services modernizing 31 more va healthcare facilities across the country all told this is one of the biggest biggest expansions of va benefits and care in its history so i'd ask you to share the following messages with any veteran family member or survivor you know first we at va want veterans and survivors to apply for their packed act benefits right now right now august 11th the day after the pr the packed act was signed into law was our all-time high for online disability compensation claims being filed and we need to continue to build on that momentum keep breaking records for veterans second i want to be very clear on this second point because it's an important one the conditions in the pact act could take effect over the next few years but at the president's direction we're not going to do that the president believes dr ruiz believes chairman takano believes that veterans have waited too long for this care as it is and we're not going to make them wait any longer so instead of phasing in the conditions over the coming years we're making all conditions outlined in the pact act presumptive as of august 10th as of the day the president signed the law and va will begin processing pact act benefits on january 1 which is the earliest date we could possibly do so third any veteran family member or survivor can learn more about the pac deck by visiting va.gov or calling 1 800 my va 411 that's va.gov slash pact and 1-800 myva 411 that's 1-800-698-2411 and implementing this bill has to be about you the veteran we want to be loud in the coming months about what we're doing and when we're doing it because this is all about how it affects you your survivor and your families and our veteran survivors so that's what everybody needs to know about the pac deck you have a great opportunity now to hear from these experts including our excellent loma linda med center director but we really need your help also in communicating now once you learn all these facts today to your fellow veterans family members survivors because we want every veteran every single veteran to get the care they need and the benefits that they have earned that they deserve and we won't rest until they do dr ruiz thank you again for your persistence on this your perseverance on it thank you for your always being hospitable to me including hosting me there back in march for a roundtable with your great vets i look forward to the rest of conversation i won't be able to stay for all of it i think as you know but the good news is you have much smarter people including our first-rate loma linda med center director uh to help you work through this so thanks again uh mr ruiz back to you thank you thank you secretary [Applause] thanks for all that you do for our on behalf of our nation's veterans you know i have to tell this story i always said it i told you during the uh bill signing that we have had two game changers in the fight uh to get this legislation across the finish line and to give veterans who've been exposed to burn pits and other toxins the care they need one of those game changers was the national attention that was that uh brought to this by comedian jon stewart and advocate john phil the other was you secretary mcdonough and the biden administration when they designated presumptive benefits for burn pits exposed to veterans suffering from sinusitis rhinitis and other conditions for ear nose and throat last year because of the biden administration and that action changed the debate from having to prove or having to from debating whether or not we recognize that burn pits caused harm to debating which illnesses they can cause and that was a big game changer because before that it was it was like pulling t trying to show the previous administrations that uh that the toxins in burn pits can cause human illnesses and so once this administration recognized that then it was how many illnesses can we put into the presumptive benefits list and this bill which is now law does just that so thank you again for your leadership and for your time this morning so years ago veterans university was born of our community's devotion to serving our veterans it was part of a series of community forums where our veterans and their families talk about wanting to educate themselves more on how to best serve other veterans and it was through that veterans initiative back i believe in 2013 2014 as soon as i i became a congressman that helped fuel and gave birth to this idea of a veterans university it's a principle based on the notion that together we can empower ourselves our veterans veterans and our families veterans in our communities in our work site and it is my hope that today each one of us leaves with the power to demonstrate with actions not just words our gratitude to the men and women who serve our nation and i can think of no better way to honor the life uh and legacy of jennifer kepner who dreamed of a future where veterans who suffered from their exposure to burn pits and their families could receive the care and benefits they need then to empower our local veterans with the resources they need to access their earned care and benefits under the packed act since i met jennifer five years ago she has been my constant inspiration in this fight she was an air force medic veteran wife and mother of two young children who courageously served our nation at bilat air force base in iraq there like so many countless veterans she breathed in toxic fumes from burning jet fuel trash and waste in massive burn pits surrounding her base every single day and i know that there's veterans out there who are shaking their head yes because they experienced the soot in their face the burning in their nostrils and their throat breathing in this toxic fumes day after day and by the time i met jennifer she was battling pancreatic cancer caused by her exposure to these toxic fumes and she had no risk factors no family risk factors no other exposures and she went to the va and uh and said that her her physician said that the most probable cause of her pancreatic cancer was her exposure to breathing in the toxins from these burn pits and despite that she faced roadblocks to getting the benefits and the care she needed from the va and i know that a lot of veterans out there are shaking your head saying yes that was your story as well jennifer asked me at that kitchen table talk in her home to fight for veterans like her who have been exposed to burn pits to make sure that other veterans don't go through what she went through that was one of her two final wishes one is to help take care of other veterans and two to help her family get the benefits so that her husband ben kettner as a widow would get more assistance to take care of her children and she called the burn pits the agent orange of our generation and i promised her that i would help that i would lead this fight for uh our veterans who have been exposed to burn pits and now it is because of her and her vision for her best fellow veterans that we are here today educating you about the pac-that law it is because of her sacrifice and her relentless advocacy that the honoring our pact act is now law ensuring that veterans can get the care they need from the va and that families like the kepners are taken care of in jennifer's memory i founded the bipartisan bicameral congressional burn pits caucus and i worked hard to secure the benefits and care she fought for for her fellow veterans and with her vision in mind i developed a four-prong approach to the public health crisis she had another veterans battle and i'm going to lay these out because it's important to know that this fight is not over that we celebrate the most expensive access to health care in in our generation but there's still work to do so the plan involves four four pillars or four big steps one is care so we need to take care of our veterans and their families with medical care and disability benefits two is education educating doctors and veterans on the health effects of burn pit exposure to identify risks and early symptoms in order to take care of the problem and potentially save a life or prevent severe illness three research we need to continue to do the research that's needed to fully understand the scope of danger associated with burn pits and other toxic exposures and then finally four end the use of burn pits once and for all so let's go back care with my legislations the presumptive benefits for war fighters exposed to burn pits and other toxins act and the jennifer kepner hope act that were included the honoring our pact fulfills the first step of this plan this new law includes my bipartisan bicameral legislation to give veterans the care they need by establishing a presumptive of service connection for over 23 categories or illnesses or cancers now i say categories or illnesses because most people think that it's only 23 illnesses but one of the categories for example is cancers of the reproductive tract and we know that there's uterine cancers ovarian cancers testicular cancers and so that counts as more than one because it's the whole tract so there's more than 23 illnesses and that's a pretty big deal so that means that veterans will no longer have to face a cumbersome process to prove that the illnesses they're suffering from as a result of their exposure to burn pits and other toxins it takes the burden of proof off of their shoulders and puts it on the va later in the presentation we'll walk you through the new efficient process to enroll in these benefits at the va so stay tuned don't log out stay with us because you're gonna we're gonna get to the nitty-gritty and the how to uh to implement this bill and how you can get your health care and your benefits the second pillar is education the package ensures that va personnel have the appropriate training and education to regularly screen veterans for toxic exposures i heard too often that veterans would go to the va and even service members in the department of defense and the providers there were not familiar with the different illnesses that burned pits can cause often dismissing them as either making excuses because they wanted to leave their service or they were just making things up and because they wanted extra benefits they were wrong the veterans and their service members were right all along and now this fact that will help educate those providers and those workers about the ill effects of burn fix exposures and the subtle symptoms that veterans can experience in order to early screen and provide the protections needed for our veterans and as a physician i know how crucial this is to the long-term effects health effects of our veterans and that is why i've pushed legislation for years that would help va personnel recognize the signs and symptoms of toxic exposures in our veterans the honoring our pac act also requires the va to establish an outreach program to our veterans so that they can learn about toxic exposures so those subtle changes when you're young and healthy and used to running three miles four miles in the morning and now you get winded when you when you walk up a flight of stairs take those seriously because you're at higher risk of developing chronic bronchiolitis or other respiratory illnesses due to exposure to burn pits and early treatment early correct work up diagnostic tools will help you get the care that you need to prevent serious severe illness and so this will help veterans enroll this outreach program will help veterans enroll in key programs at the va to get the care they need and again later we'll talk about how you can enroll here locally in this district and finally the pack that will help us better understand the impact of toxic exposure while requiring the va to conduct new studies on veterans health trends so we can prevent a public health crisis like this in the future in in essence these studies are not necessarily to go back and rehash the proof of whether carcinogens and burn pig toxic smokes cause cancer because by definition we know there's carcinogens and carcinogens cause cancer but it is to fully understand the different types of cancers the different types of illnesses that have not been included in the presumptive benefits so that we can pursue better treatments early recognitions and better care for our veterans so that all those three pillars were included in the honoring our pac deck one pillar was not and that's what's next the end of burn pits this bipartisan law makes bold gains in getting our veterans the care they need however in order to prevent more service members from becoming delayed casualties of war we must put an end to our military's use of burn pits for good right now there are still six active burn pits being used at us military bases around the world that's unacceptable and i'm laser focused on making sure those six bird pits are not used again there are alternatives of waste disposals that we can utilize burning trash in open burn pits has been illegal in the united states since the 1970s due to its bad health consequences if it's illegal in the u.s it should be illegal and banned near americans in foreign soil as well and to write this wrong and pushing legislation in this year's defense package to push our military to identify alternatives to burn pits so that we don't subject another generation of veterans to the pain and suffering caused by toxic exposures our vietnam veterans know all too well about this very pain and suffering and like jennifer their stories have fueled my fight to get the honoring our pact act signed into law under this bipartisan law veterans who were exposed to contaminated water at camp the june will finally be able to file claims and have their cases heard in court the law also adds two new presumptive conditions and five new sites to the list of presumptive locations for agent orange including laos cambodia guam atal and thailand so in short this law will make a monumental change in the lives of millions of veterans it is the most expansive access to care for veterans in generations over 3.5 million veterans their families will be positively impacted their pain and suffering will be reduced because they will be able to receive health care and their spouses and their families will be taken care of because they'll be receiving their benefits and with that let's get into how you can access these benefits before i introduce our next speaker just a reminder that if you have questions on any of our experts presentations we will hold a q a once all of our speakers present you can submit your questions using the q a feature via zoom so if you're utilizing zoom go to the q a feature or the comment feature on facebook just to remember to include your first and last name and the city that you reside in then your question if you'd like to direct your question at one of your panelists specifically please include their names as well so it's it's now time to turn it over to gary woodward staff director of the house veterans affairs committee so again gary woodward is the staff director of the house veterans affairs committee who had a pivotal role in putting this piece of legislation together gay word word would present now uh the floor is yours gary gary woodward thank you [Applause] thank you congressman i appreciate you inviting me to to be here with you today uh chairman takano sends his regards and and asked me to thank you again for your leadership on helping to pull this this bill together and across the finish line uh as it has been alluded to the bill is is pretty wide ranging so i'm going to talk about some of the major provisions and then we can fill in the details as need be in in the q a uh but talk to to talk just generally about the reasoning for the pact act uh as has been mentioned before it's the committee's attempt to address in a comprehensive way the legacy of toxic exposure among our veterans and i say uh comprehensive and not that in in the sense that it addresses every potential uh condition but that it also tries to address not just the health care and disability needs of those who are currently ill and disabled but it also reforms the way in which va addresses these issues into the future and we also try to ensure that va has the resources and infrastructure in place to serve these veterans better moving forward so let me start by talking about the health care and disability expansions first uh it's best to think of the pact act as expanding healthcare access in in two different ways the first is a presumption of exposure to to certain toxins that is if you served in specific locations during specific periods of time you are presumed to have been exposed to environmental hazards and as such are given access to priority group 6 healthcare uh that's principally done for the purposes of of longitudinal monitoring as i said these these are for veterans who are not currently currently ill and uh hopefully in a slide in just future we'll see the list of of those locations and services that there we go uh it's important to note uh that the healthcare access provided under this expansion is phased in over time based on discharge date and again i can get into this a little bit more in in q a but basically over the next 10 years veterans are grouped into cohorts and based on your your your separation date and it would be granted access to to va's health care system in a phased in approach the second uh way that the pact act expands access to healthcare and disability benefits and and this was the previous slide was if uh veterans are currently ill with one of 23 new conditions or or categories of illnesses these are rare cancers and respiratory conditions [Music] as congressman ruiz mentioned he was he was pivotal in pulling this this list together and we thanked him him for his his leadership here um in the case that a veteran has one of these conditions or a a precursor to one of these conditions and served in one of the locations mentioned earlier they are given access not just to the va healthcare system but also to the va disability benefits as the secretary mentioned it was intended that these conditions would be phased in similar to the health care access above but the president and his leadership the secretary and his leadership have sought fit to implement these presumptive conditions date of enactment basically august 10th so as was mentioned we are encouraging veterans to apply now uh va will begin processing those those claims in in january but any uh disability compensation that that's awarded based on uh these presumptions would be vaccinated to that august 10 date and i will mention also that uh survivor's benefits are also eligible in the events that the veterans themselves have has since passed or succumbed to one of these visa illnesses there are also two additional categories of veterans that the bill addresses the the first is vietnam era veterans congressman ruiz mentioned this as well it expands the definitions of who qualifies as a vietnam era veteran by adding thailand laos cambodia guam american samoa and johnston atoll to the list of locations where agent orange exposure is known to have occurred and so those uh veterans folks who served in in those areas will now be access to the the full range of va healthcare disability benefits based on the already established agent orange presumptions at the va but the bill does also add two new categories or two new presumptive illnesses related to agent orange exposure the first is mgus and i will not try to pronounce the the medical term there uh i will stumble all over my tongue um but and the second was uh hypertension hypertension uh there are uh different effective dates for when these conditions are are kicking in at va for mgus the effective date is october 1st of this year for hypertension the presumptive illness doesn't become effective until october 1st of 2026. the second additional category of veterans who are addressed in the pac deck are those who would have been exposed to radiation in several locations the first is in the wattak atoll where they've done uh some atomic testing uh in the the second and third are palomares spain and thule greenland uh where there were some uh bomber crashes and that were carrying uh nuclear weapons and uh the cleanup crews from those were exposed to radiation as a result of that uh there are a couple other things that i would like to talk about as i mentioned the bill is is a comprehensive one uh it addresses the process of va establishing new presumptives moving forward and this is an important piece because in developing this legislation one of the chief concerns we heard is that it takes too long va's process took too long sometimes years or decades even to create new presumptions and so we've reformed this process to to expedite the the the task of determining whether or not there's a service connection for for new diseases by requiring the secretary to publish a list yearly of the conditions that they are considering and upon publication of that list to research and act and make a decision on those presumptions in an expedited time frame we're talking a year or two as opposed to a decade or two we've also changed the threshold that va will be using to decide when a new presumptive is granted in the past there had to be essential essentially absolute certainty that the disease was indeed service connected however um the threshold has been changed such that the new standard for decision making is that the disease is equal equally as likely as not to have been caused by an environmental exposure during during service so with that uh lowered threshold hopefully there will be new things added more quickly as the congressman alluded to we don't know what diseases may pop up in the future and so we need a mechanism to address those those new conditions uh more quickly and then uh i will say also that we were cognizant of the the need to provide va with the resources to implement this this wide-ranging bill uh we were adding millions of people to the to the health care roles and disability roles there and so the bill does invest in uh 31 new health care facilities around the country and it also provides the authority for joint facilities with dod so if there's not a va facility nearby but there is a military base a guard or reserve base or active duty va can lease that facility from them so veterans can get care closer to where where they are but it also increases resources for va's i.t infrastructure so that they can process claims more quickly conduct medical exams more quickly as well and then it invests heavily in the recruitment and retention of the health care workforce which i'm sure others will talk about later and this is important again so that veterans can get timely exams when they are visiting the the va medical centers as a result of this bill the last thing i will talk about is uh camp lejeune as congressman ruiz alluded to principally because we've noticed that there is some uh confusion about what the pact act did with relation to uh what has already been done at va i would just remind folks that in 2012 the congress created 15 or designated 15 new presumptive illnesses related to exposure to toxic water at camp lejeune those presumptive illnesses gave veterans and and their families i should note access to to health care and disability based on their exposure to toxic water there at uh camp lejeune so that's already existed uh it has been for for for some time now the pact act itself uh builds upon that and and essentially allows those veterans and their families to sue for negligence to sue the federal government for negligence related to that uh i will say that that va has uh no role in in processing those lawsuits those are our lawsuits filed with a circuit court in in north carolina but the health care and disability benefits side uh again granted in 2012 uh the va does have a role in and so i encourage you to uh to visit va's websites and and look into that uh so with that i will stop and i look forward to any questions uh later in the presentation thank you congressman thank you gary gary it's good to have you here and uh thank you for sticking around and entering some of the q a from our viewers later in the program i just really want to give a shout out to you gary and to all the staff who work day in and day out with minimal rest there's a lot of sleepless nights during this whole fighting process from the house veterans affairs committee uh you guys really really work very hard under the amazing leadership of chairman marticano and it's wonderful to have chairman mark takano as a fellow uh representative in riverside county who once i rejoined the va committee i said mark you're going to be the chairman that's going to get this done and he sure did he fulfilled and exceeded all expectations he brought the team together he uh was relentless in this fight together we made a good good cop bad cop kind of duo and committees i was always seemed to be always the bad cop uh uh raising boys in in debate in our fights but uh but we got it done uh and and having said that i also want to give thanks to all of the staff that's worked in my office throughout the years for this in particular i'm going to name a few all-stars patrick keplinger who's a wounded warrior fellow worked in my office also exposed to burn pits was there with me at jennifer kevner's death bed with her family blake weller who's a wounded warrior fellow worked in my office who was instrumental in getting this through uh we have current uh wounded warrior fellow uh tony griffin in my office we have uh veterans lucas pignon and michael bailey we have veterans who have worked in my office gino sexton and others and then my incredible staff starting with the release and now alexandra heller who got this across the finish line to everybody who's worked day in and day out uh on this i really want to thank you from the bottom of my heart so now now our next speaker is senior veterans representative ramonita cruz young from the riverside county department of veterans services she's actually here so she's going to come up to the uh the podium ramonita served in the us marine corps and can discuss the local services to help you navigate this new law so we've given you the general overview of the law now we're getting into the local services and how to apply for these health cares and benefits all right thank you congressman for being extending the invite to our department will participate in this event um if i may i would just like to go over some department information uh before i get into the claim claims process so like the congressman said my name is ramanita khrushchev i'm one of the senior veterans representatives for riverside county veterans services our office provides benefits counseling to all veterans and surviving spouses and dependents we assist with filing claims for disability pension assist survivors sign up for survivors benefits granted they meet the requirements that are set forth by the va we also assist veterans and dependents sign up for education benefits and health benefits additionally we also provide resource information to other local state and federal agencies concerning benefits all right so now to get into the claims process with regards to the pact act all claims will be processed the same way as any other claim with the exception that since these conditions are presumptive the requirement for the veteran to provide evidence of being exposed to these toxins is not required the only two requirement requirements that need to be met are the following one the veteran has to show that he or she is diagnosed with a condition from the presumptuous list and secondly the veteran needs to provide evidence that he or she served at one of the locations listed on the package once that established we will earmark the claim to be reviewed under the pact the rest of the claim process with regards to cmp examinations uh will remain the same if the va deems they are necessary if a veteran was previously denied for any newly added presumptive conditions our office can provide assistance with filing a supplemental claim to have the previously denied claim reopened and reviewed under the pact the same goes for any surviving spouses who were denied survivors benefits the va is supposed to be reaching out to these veterans and surviving spouses however i would encourage them to contact our office for assistance now rather than wait for the va to contact them we do anticipate a surge in claims and we are prepared as well as we can be however i do want to inform the residents of riverside county that we are understaffed just like any other agency in business today right now we have seven vsrs veterans service representatives that can assist riverside county veterans these vsrs are nationally accredited as well as accredited through the state with california department of veterans affairs we are operating on an appointment basis only so please call one of our offices to speak with a representative or and or make an appointment if veterans prefer to file their claim online or va.gov please make sure to file it using the appropriate va forms for new claims in other words if the veteran has never filed for any of these presumptive conditions before they will need to use form 21-526-easy to reopen a claim that was previously denied the veteran would need to fill out or submit a form uh called va form 20-095 and upload evidence supporting the plan if veterans prefer printing out the forms and filling them out at home at their leisure um you can send the forms to our office for us to review and then we can follow electronically through the va form our services are free of charge i do want to mention that there are agencies out there that charge veterans to file claims with the va this is heidi illegal they somehow find a loophole to charge a consulting fee please know that like i said all our services are free of charge so know that you can contact one of our offices to get assistance for any additional information regarding the pact act the information can be accessed on the va.gov website which is va.gov pat again thank you congressman for having us here today thank you thank you i see we have a few questions trickling in so just remember we'll go to those during the q and a portion at the end of the program in the meantime you can continue to submit your questions using the q a feature on zoom or the comment feature on facebook don't forget to add your first and last name city that you reside in and direct your questions if you want to direct your questions to a specific speaker so our next presenter is a very good friend of mine whose leadership helped get the pac act signed into law tom porter is executive vice president of government affairs at the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america he is from san bernardino so he's a fellow inland empire southern californian and is a captain in the u.s navy reserve with service since 1996 including deployments to afghanistan and the arabian gulf as a public affairs officer tom will cover resources that iava offers to assist toxic exposed veterans tom the floor is yours thank you congressman appreciate you having me on and i'm sorry i can't be there in person i hope to do that next time uh thank you everybody for being here as he mentioned i'm right i'm from right down the road in san bernardino uh i often help people from uh california especially because it's where i'm from if they want to come to washington dc either work on capitol hill or get into veterans advocacy so you can find me on linkedin if you want to connect uh happy to discuss any of those possibilities um you should know that i run the washington dc office or national advocacy efforts for iava we we are the the largest veteran service organization for post-9 11 veterans a little bit more of my background though before i go on is um not only from san bernardino but i've got family nearby in beaumont and yucaipa and riverside county i'm also a member of the lone pine shoshone tribe about three hours north view in in low pine california so i've spent a long time 20 years before doing this on capitol hill and at an energy lobbying firm working on california tribal energy natural resource issues so a long time long history of working on issues close to you and then came into this job about seven years ago after my last deployment because i wanted to be able to help veterans and military families so so this is really important to me i thought it was going to be a temporary deal ended up staying seven years and counting we're getting a lot done it's really rewarding we have members of ours come out all the time in normal times where they will fly out to washington dc and we will meet with members of congress and the committees that affect veterans and service members and so if you're a member of iava which you can be you can join for free at iava.org that's iava.org if you're a veteran of any era you don't have to have deployed to iraq or afghanistan but any era veteran or their family members or supporters again join at iava.org we focus on many issues of importance to the post 9 11 generation especially including veteran of military suicide veteran education benefits defending the post 9 11 gi bill from cuts and abuse we have been engaged on behalf of women veterans since we're seeing a all-time high in terms of women being represented in our armed forces and our veteran community medicinal cannabis is something of interest to post 9 11 veterans and many other veterans too so we're working towards towards legislation to that end military justice reform including military sexual assault so we're making reforms at the pentagon as well and then most recently as you've heard we worked closely with the other veterans organizations from around the country to pass the honoring our pact act which as you've heard already is a landmark legislation the most significant ever passed for veterans health care that would deliver health and disability benefits for those that suffered toxic exposures and i won't go into that anymore because i'll be duplicative since everybody's talked about it in depth um so the the honoring our pac deck i think what i could talk about is it's it was extremely unique in its campaign and that um that it utilized some really some main components one of them is the professional advocates within the veterans organizations based in dc uh that are engaged on this and other veterans issues all the time with the committees and members of congress it had activists from around the country um veterans activists uh including many local and regional veterans groups that that came to town uh that you may have seen online uh like rosie torres uh was uh leading the fight at the capitol when veterans uh occupied the steps and stayed overnight for for nights on end through uh through rain and near 100 degree temperatures and wind and everything so that was tough activists played a key role there um media relations we did an unprecedented push through through media from cnn to fox news to local affiliates all over the country and especially a huge amount was done via social media you can see our hashtag mostly on twitter but also facebook too of of packed act and passed the pact act you'll see so much of what we did throughout the campaign on twitter lots of pictures videos and all of our congressional meetings and then of course one component extremely important you may have seen throughout our campaign john stewart um who really is selfless uh donated so much of his personal time and energy to come down for several years to walk the halls of congress to go on tv to do media to do rallies all over the country with veterans organizations um really was key in our fight um along with the uh 911 first responders as well who um who iava partnered with them on two previous occasions on their own toxic exposure fight so this is not a new issue for them we helped them pass into law critical legislation over the last 10 years twice before the pact act and so they came to fight on our side this time because we were on their side before so that's that's the gist of the whole uh thing that i wanted to discuss but again if any of you veterans out there um congressman ruiz's district would like to know more about iava again go to iaba.org and join for free and i would be mistaken if i didn't recognize some very important people in this fight congressman ruiz has been with us through the thick and the thin meeting with us for several years now about on developing the legislation but then also working hard working the media working his congressional colleagues chairman mark takano represents riverside the chairman of the va committee he was a hero of ours getting this this this legislation passed working with speaker pelosi who was one of our strongest advocates in congress it really was the will of speaker pelosi and chairman takano um and our friends in congress like congressman ruiz that forced this to passage that was all significant and then i i can't leave out secretary mcdonough who is a staunch advocate of this this bill and getting it passed and the president himself in the critical days especially in the last few weeks of the campaign staff from the white house from secretary mcdonough's staff at the va chairman takano staff at the committee were in contact with us sometimes daily to make sure that we had what we needed and offering however they could help offering assistance however they could help so just want to pass that on thank you congressman for having me here thank you everybody for being out here on the panel i look forward to hearing from from everybody else thank you very much tom i really appreciate you being here with all of us thank you for your incredible efforts throughout the years absolutely correct this was a coalition this was a movement that really uh started from widows and spouses and veterans who were 100 percent disabled some could barely speak because on 100 percent oxygen some like jennifer kepner uh really thin on chemotherapy and uh very weak uh struggling with cancers of all forms these are the heroes that we lift them up uh in the passage of this law absolutely correct i also want to give a shout out to our senate uh companions on this fight we have senator gillibrand and senator marco rubio it was a bipartisan effort uh so it still exists bipartisanship uh they were our counterparts with the my bills the presumptive benefits for warfighters exposed to burn pits and other toxins and also uh republican representative brian fitzpatrick in the house who introduced that bill with me uh and is also part of the burn pits caucus uh with me so this was truly a a comprehensive approach for a comprehensive bill uh speaker pelosi was relentless when she made up her mind and said this and it didn't take long for her to do it in fact you know we had her at hello on this issue she said uh in a meeting with secretary mcdonough and chairman uh takano uh basically told the secretary to prepare himself because congress is going to pass a law to get this done and uh and i'll never forget that conversation so for all of our veterans participating remember that if you have questions on any of our experts presentation we will hold a q a at the end don't forget to put your first and last name the city that you reside in your question and you can direct it to any of the speakers that you want so our next speaker is also a very dear friend of mine who is no stranger to veterans university in fact she was the first advocate i met in this fight of a large organization she first got me involved in this work and helped introduce me to jennifer kepner all those years ago rosie torres and leroy torres her husband who is struggling to breathe due to his exposure to burn pits is the founder of burn pits 360. a veteran service organization whose mission is to reintegrate restore and build resilience through facilitating the unmet needs of warriors and their families through outreach advocacy and research she's been a fierce advocate for our nation's burn pit exposed veterans and we certainly wouldn't have gotten the pac-that signed into law without her i she has been there since the thick and thin of things she is relentless in her pursuit for justice for veterans she has enormous love for her husband uh and she is a a true game changer in all sense of the world word and i am so proud to call her a friend and she also flew years ago to our veterans university to have our very first workshop alongside jennifer kepner's widow ben kettner on burn pits so rosie i'll let you take it from here to talk about how burnt pit 360 can help our local veterans and don't forget for all of our viewership uh since this is online since this is on social media this is also speaking to all the veterans throughout our nation so rosie the floor is yours congressman luis thank you so much for having me and to all of your constituents thank you for um your your continuous support um you you congressman ruiz have been a leader in this space and so we're so grateful to to have worked alongside you and and have led this effort um so a little bit about um burn pits 360 we in 2011 you know this all started with us establishing a national burn registry in an effort to address this generation's agent orange and uh we let this effort for the past 13 years it was really um a unified front of you know those made up of really just those impacted by by this issue uh families veterans you know active duty reservists you name it uh we all just met on this social media platform facebook where we all had one thing in common and it was that we were all facing this injustice so we came together created a website and you know lo and behold here we are you know on august of course 10 20 22 we made history uh like tom porter just mentioned with the passage of one of the most monumental pieces of legislation in the veterans space um i can say that we created this like unchartered territory a very unique space alongside veteran known companies like grunt style the veteran service organizations you know the big six the organizations that hold up the space there in washington members of congress such as congressman ruiz uh the media the press john stewart john phil and this administration so i feel like we really mobilized america and we saw the fruits of our labor come to fruition on august 10th and that has been such an honorable and amazing experience um and you're right congressman ruiz i did attend and thank you for inviting us back in march of 2018 uh to educate the veteran community uh and and their families really and and that's the the one uh event that we did that we were able to connect with these veterans who had tons of questions and we're just so clueless in uh in in trying to access that specialized healthcare trying to file claims and so you know it goes back that far to where you know everyone is just kind of scratching their heads wondering like where do we go from here so for burn pit 360 it still continues to be you know part of our mission is to now that the pact act has passed and is been put into law uh it will continue to be our mission to educate the veteran community uh through our own efforts of outreach and education um so what i will say about um the pact act you know i don't want to talk about the uh the details of of the bill because i know that um the the staff at hvac and svac and the va that is their that is their forte that is what they do and i i'd rather leave that to them but uh my advice to the veterans watching right now is to visit any of the veteran service organizations in addition to ours burnpitz360.org select the the resources and information tab and you'll be able to download different resources such as like the va environmental training letter 10-03 you'll be able to download something called the toxic exposure table and with these resources and information you'll be able to really do your part in educating your civilian and va providers that is crucial it's key um this this law was just passed so it's going to take time for the va uh to to push out right the most you know impactful pieces of information faq sheets all the things that are going to help us along the way but for now do your part you know you need to do your part and educate them and in both the civilian uh private sector and in in the va and dod right if you're part of those healthcare facilities and you access care there educate them and like i mentioned i'm sure there's veterans organizations that have tons of of information that you can take to those individuals um so again for us our priority remains uh to to educate the community and it will be as well to make sure that oversight and implementation of the pact act is done correctly um and is done uh effectively so for us because we do operate a national burn pit registry a toxic exposure registry it'll allow us to continue to work closely with leaders like congressman ruiz uh with the va with dod in addressing your needs the veterans so we also know and we will continue to push for screening and prevention and adding cancers and illnesses and that will come with time um but please know that we'll continue to work hard on our end on behalf of burn pits 360 to make sure that all of those services are delivered to the survivors to the veterans uh to your families i think in in and just to touch a little bit about what tom mentioned in regards to that historical moment on the steps um it was just an honor to be part of such a movement uh congressman to to have seen all of our work over these past 13 years finally come to light um and and you know really just seeing democracy at its best sleeping on those steps in the rain in in the sun you know just really being with america and being alongside those veterans and their families uh was such an honor um so in closing i will just add that you know to tell people a little bit more about burn pits 360 and what we do uh in addition to the legislative efforts uh and and that you know monumental uh a piece of legislation that just passed uh we also have launched something called the warrior hope network uh where we provide different healthcare modalities and resources such as like in-home hyperbaric oxygen chambers oxygen concentrators for those veterans that uh you know can't get that through the va or dod we actually provide the concentrator you know with their script and all that so that they can you know be with their families or go on vacation and and they actually have a a a a mechanism and in which helps him you know um breathe and and and still be independent um and in addition to that you know we we provide resources to help uh veterans access toxic exposure lab panels to test their bodies for toxicity stem cell treatments and much much more so you know visit our website go on our social media pages and you can follow the work that we do again it's been an honor to be part of this historic movement and we're here to answer any questions that you may have thank you thank you rosie thank you so much [Applause] and uh one more reminder that we will take as many questions as we can during the q a portion of the program first last name question and direct to the person that you want in the meantime you can continue to submit them using the q a feature on zoom the q a feature on zoom or the comment feature if you're tuning in on facebook so don't forget your name first first and last city resided and which panelists you would like to answer your question so now i'd like to turn it over to current deep saran medical director a medical center director at va loma linda who will give an overview of local news and resources for the veterans community guarandi the floor is yours good morning congressman ruiz thank you for including us in veterans university i couldn't agree with you more that it comes down to care education outreach and research so with the passing of the pac deck via loma linda is preparing to expand the availability of primary care services our existing five community based outpatient clinics in the health care system have been contracted for over two decades and as many know there was a change in management on october 1st of 2021 and we've been experiencing some growing pains we know the angst and concerned veterans assigned to the palm desert cboc have regarding the new contractor i can assure you that we've been working diligently with stgi to resolve all concerns as the medical center director my non-negotiable goal is to ensure our veterans receive the care they need when they need it and ensure the highest level of safety providing safe quality care is just non-negotiable that being said we've had to make a few difficult decisions regarding suspending assignment into the cboc primary care panels and mobile packs just to ensure that we are consistent with what the contractor can safely supply while fulfilling the requirements outlined in the mission act it takes a bit of navigation however i am pleased to share that we met with the stgi executive team last week to review their updated staffing plans and they have several new providers in the credentialing and privileging process we're working very closely to get those clinical providers on board to expand appointment availability within the clinic we want stgi to be able to enroll veterans for care at palm desert but we're committed to ensuring that providers are operating within safe limits in terms of patient load so if a team or provider has too many patients it creates an unsafe situation and we do it's just a risk we don't want to accept when it comes to providing veterans the care they've earned and serve we are committed to quality and safety even if it means offering veterans the choice of having a primary care provider at the ambulatory care center in redlands or the option to receive their care in the community with a non-va doctor if you need help navigating any part of this process or you have an individual concern or an issue you need assistance with please reach out to one of our patient advocates i can tell you we track every single complaint that goes or concern or issue that goes to the patient advocates to make sure that it's resolved and they can be reached by phone at 909-583-6133 again that number is 909-583-6133 there's also an email address associated with our patient advocates that can help address concerns and that email address is vha lom vss va.gov again it's vha lom vssva.gov if you have a referral for care in the community and need assistance with care coordination you can reach a member of my team here in loma linda and the number there is 909 909-307-5248 the number for karen the community again is 909-307-5248 one recurring frustration that's been voiced by veterans many times has been the inability to call directly into your cboc so currently all calls are routed through the centralized scheduling center we're going to be changing that model to meet veterans expectations we hear you we're working on amending the contract to establish call centers specifically located at each cboc to give veterans easier access to their primary care team so veterans will be able to call directly into their clinic right now the easiest way to communicate directly with your primary care team is to use myhealthevet and send a secure message we track all secure messages to make sure that they are answered in a timely manner if you need a medication refill you can also do that via my healthy vet you can also do it online at va.gov or you can call the main hospital line at 909-825-7084 and pressing option number one the packed act has given us flexibility at our va medical center to recruit and retain clinical professionals and compete with private sector salaries to attract top talent we're using this to hire additional primary care and mental health providers to expand our capacity at the ambulatory care center additionally i'm really excited to share this we've been approved to open a va leased cboc in banning california this will not be a contracted clinic but one that is va operated with va staff providing the care this is our ultimate goal our goal is to open the banning clinic in 2023 so that we can provide more options to veterans to receive their care there are a lot of changes on the horizon and we thank you for your patience as we work to collaborate with our partners to provide you the care that you need we're here for veterans and veterans are the center of everything we do in our commitment to you va loma linda will host a veterans healthcare information session in november to ensure that you are aware of changes to policies processes and services we'll announce this through social media email distribution news releases the loma linda va website and other venues we hope that you connect with us to ensure you get the latest information additionally our team regularly updates our congressional offices to include congressman ruiz's office to guarantee the widest dissemination of information to veterans to underscore secretary mcdonough's comment i just want to encourage you to register today and you be you can begin today online at va.gov backslash pact where you can submit a claim for that with the veterans benefits administration or enroll for va healthcare i just want to thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve you and i'm i'm happy to stay on to answer any questions that you may have for me thank you guaranteed and [Applause] uh also uh we'll be helping you letting our community know about the november uh information session that you will host also thank you thank you thank you for our work together on the banning uh cboc in 2023 i know that was one of several we'll follow up on the others that we've been uh discussing for a couple years now i know uh that that is very welcome news for our veterans in the san gorgonio pass and and high uh high desert area as well so thank you very much for being here and uh thank you for staying to answer some questions so now to help us close things out i now invite bill young from the veterans easy access program back up to the podium to say a few words over the years bill has been an incredible advisor and friend he's he's a very strong member of my veterans advisory board uh and who has helped local veterans stay informed about important news and events in the community uh he's very instrumental in mobilizing local veterans participates in many events and is a uh a leader in the veteran community so bill is here he opened our program with the pledge of allegiance bill the floor is yours [Applause] burn pencil day is a huge victory for veterans no one can deny that but there are also many other areas that veterans need help in and need to be kept aware of things from education to jobs to even medical and legal issues in the past the veterans easy access program where we has held an annual veterans expo from 2010 to 2019 it had nine of those expos earthquakes was even represented at several of those exports we had up to 1500 attendees in 2019 so it was a huge success unfortunately the last two and a half years we've not been able to have a veterans expo on october 8th of this year we are planning to have the 10th annual veterans expo it will be held on a smaller scale and be held at the cathedral city core of the salvation army located at 30-400 glendale boulevard and it'll be right next to the brand new veterans village which is opening the latter part of this summer and on a limited basis will be open at the time of our expo we are planning to have the event from 9am to 2pm it starts with a huge flag raising ceremony then we honor two local veterans one actually is from loma linda va hospital the lady who is the head of the women's veterans program and the other is a world war ii veteran an aviator it was the youngest pilot at the end of world war ii and he actually flew into the beginning of vietnam there will be 34 plus exhibitors there may even be room for one or two more so i would recommend a couple of the individuals that are on our zoom today if they could get paperwork again shortly we'd love to have them also participate there's also going to be a pretty hot lunch and the interesting part about this is it's a graduate of the coachella valley rescue mission that went through their program uh and then went to culinary school and she will be preparing a hot meal for the group so it's a case of someone giving back to the community also there's a display that we call the gallery heroes there's 106 160 plus veterans it's a slideshow that shows veterans from this area and beyond and it shows that veterans come in all sizes shapes ages and supported wars way back from the beginning of time and finally there will be tours of the veterans village so it's an opportunity to see this great new facility once again it's on october 8th from 9am to 2pm one last comment we do a monthly email newsletter called the readback it's a great way to keep up on all of the programs and all of the events in the local area preventions if you do not get it please contact me and i'll get you on a distribution thank you congressman thank you bill uh so we're gonna lead into the question and answer session uh but before we do that i just gotta say what an honor to have you all i and all of our wonderful presenters with us today thank you so much uh and can i just say what an awesome job everyone did today thank you so much thank you and you on screen can't see this but everybody working the text and the cameras right now are just like we're almost we're almost there so each and every one of our panelists today truly showed us what veterans university is all about and i really do mean it when i say that veterans university holds a special place in my heart and it's a special place because of each one of you together at veterans university we've helped bring financial stability to veterans and their families about to lose their homes because they could barely afford a loved one's medical bills we've helped keep a family together by providing resources for a veteran struggling with ptsd for example and i'll remember this case uh the wife brought her husband in young veteran who was staying in his room days in and days out suffering from ptsd and she thought this would be a good place where he could connect with other veterans and sure enough at one of our in-person veteran sessions there was different organizations that got him into treatment and therapy and created a community for him to thrive and now we're helping veterans get connected with critical resources to get the health care they need from the va so by being here today you are part of something special something that's life-changing so whether you're here as a veteran to learn more about the pac-that or a family member to help a loved one enroll in benefits and healthcare or maybe a healthcare provider to learn how you can recognize the signs and symptoms of toxic exposure you are a part of a movement and a mission to empower our veterans and you are making a difference and together we'll leave today more knowledgeable about how we can serve our communities veterans now that you know more about the fact that law at work or in the community at your place of worship or in the community at your kids soccer baseball game you can talk to other members in the community and if you know a veteran you can ask them if they know about the pac deck law and if they were exposed to radiation to burn pits uh or if they served in one of the five countries that agent orange exposed vietnam veterans are now eligible for you can initiate that conversation and refer them to a veteran service organization to riverside county veterans service officers to the loma linda va or any va or cboc that serves those veterans in their community uh throughout the entire nation so to all of our veterans and your families thank you again for your incredible service so with that let's get into the q a so we would try to get to as many questions as we can but if you run out of time you can call my office at 760-424-8888 [Music] and the member of my team will assist you so we'll first start off with a few frequently asked questions that we collected before uh this uh this session we synthesize them together and we prepared them for the um the presenters and the panelists here uh so if so the first question is if a veteran passed away due to presumptive diseases in the pact but did not receive a disability rating for that disease before the law was passed will the spouse be entitled to survivors benefits again if a veteran passed away due to presumptive diseases in the pact but did not receive a disability rating for that disease before the law was passed will the spouse still be entitled to survivors benefit i would like to ask gary woodward from the house veterans affairs committee to please answer that question gary thank you congressman uh the short answer is yes uh spouses uh survivors are eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation uh based on the presumptions established in this bill they would still need to go through the normal application process at va and ms cruz young might be able to articulate on that but yes the bill does make those those benefits available to survivors excellent thank you so the second question is for karen deep saron the director of v8 loma linda will the va this was a specific question several veterans had about the loma linda's va will the va have to run the veteran through all the allergy medications then to the ert department before a diagnosis is presumed no uh the presumptive uh condition will uh doesn't require verification to my understanding the toxic the toxic screening will begin on november 8th uh we are actually training all of our providers beginning in october so that when the screening does begin there will be an initial five-minute screening for all veterans and then uh every five years um as more information comes out we'll be sure to share that with uh with folks and at our november information session we'll be sure to have additional information regarding that great and i'd like to um have a ramanita young answer this next question um and uh you want to come up i'll ask the question and you can answer from here will processing time be the same as any other disability claim uh so for example military sexual trauma has to go through a different routing process than normal claims would burn pits disabilities have to do this as well as there another type of processing criteria for burn pits like the military sexual trauma uh has to go through so to answer the question congressman everything i've read regarding the pact and the processing of the claims there is no there's no difference so the planche process will be routed as a normal claim um if gary has any other information give on that i have not read anything saying that it's not going to be a different process thank you thank you yeah congressman happy to jump in if if you'd like um we'll just say you know the issue is one of uh one of routing they do they do concentrate claims uh for certain issues in certain locations they haven't made that decision with respect to pact act and burn pit's claims yet i think this is one of the reasons why they're asking folks to apply now so they can get a sense of the scope of the universe of claims that are going to need to be processed and make decisions about how best to allocate those to the people who are reviewing them thank you thank you very much uh gary stay on because this question is directed to you as well what is the wait time before the law takes effect uh as we heard the secretary say the president made some executive changes to expedite these uh so the va has stated that uh will be as early as january 2023 but no later than that so again the question is what is the wait time before the law takes effect yeah sure and the answer uh depends on on the provision as i said the the location and service date based uh access to health care phases in over the next 10 years uh and again these are for veterans who are not ill uh currently uh and so they have access to the the testing um at loma linda and other places to catch these illnesses early but that faces in over the next 10 years based on uh when your separation date is the new presumptive illnesses and categories of conditions their effective date is august 10 20 22. va will not process the claims that are filed between august and and uh january until after that january date but once that claim is is granted assuming that it is granted the the disability compensation will be retroactive to to august 10. thank you uh now we have a question from scott kiran from palm desert will this law help vets exposed to radiation received help from the va so with this law how vets exposed to radiation receive help from the va uh karen deep from the director uh medical director for va loma linda can you answer that please yes happy to yeah we're very excited that the expanded eligibility for many of these conditions will allow veterans to receive va health care i would encourage you to visit va.gov backslash pact to go ahead and begin that process thank you so much the next question is for gary this is from richard valdez highland he resides in highland california for those who file the claim on august 11 2022 for agent orange for compensation purposes will this be effective date or is october first the effective date again for those who filed the claim uh on august 11 2022 for asian orange for compensation purposes will this be the effective date or is october 1st the effective date gary uh sure so this gets a little tricky and i'll try to do my best to explain this so underpinning all of this is the normal va disability and healthcare claims process right veterans have at any time been able to petition the va for service connection for an illness that they've uh uh succumbed to or experiencing the problem has been that the burden of proof has been extraordinarily high particularly for uh these illnesses related to burn pits and certainly with respect to agent orange and hypertension um you know especially as vietnam veterans are of the the population age where this would uh start to sort of manifest in increased rates anyway that burden of proof that any hypertension claim is connected to exposure is really really difficult and so a claim filed prior to the effective date listed for hypertension impact act would be sort of adjudicated based on the normal process that the va already has in place for that illness and as of now most of those claims generally are denied now va would have i guess one of two choices what to do with this this existing claim related to hypertension one is to just sit on it for four years until the presumption kicks in or the second would be to deny it and then ask the veteran to to file a supplemental claim once the presumption kicks in in uh 2026 with with the lowered burden of proof and in that case um in the case that they would sit on it the effective date would be the effective date of the the the presumption not that the filing date thank you gary this is uh the last question is also directed to you um this is a question from james moore james moore from san jacinto my father served during the korean and vietnam wars he passed away from cancer at the age of 42. his claim was denied and my mother raised us on our own what can i do to assist a widow again my father served during the korean and vietnam wars he passed away from cancer at a young age of 42. his claim was denied and my mother raised us on our own what can i do to assist a widow gary so again i'm already existing at ba and certainly expanded through the presumptions and and access created by the pact act there is available to survivors dependency and indemnity compensation and some other benefits for for uh spouses and surviving children of veterans so i would encourage uh this person to to reach out to mrs bruce young's organization reach out to one of the other vsos american legion vfw however and see how they can go about filing a claim for their their um their mother to receive the the dic as we call it because it is it is a benefit that is available and has been for for some time uh and has now expanded uh eligibility based on on pac tech thank you gary uh it's that's the last of our questions uh we if there are still other questions that we didn't get to we'll collect them we'll try to get back to you as well if you have further questions you have heard from uh leaders at loma linda va medical center riverside county veterans service officers and national veterans service organizations you can call them you can call my office 760-424-8888 we can we can direct you to the right person to answer them and we can help you connect you to the resources and benefits that uh that you have earned uh need and deserve so know that this invitation goes beyond just the honoring our pact and burn pits uh asian orange radiation

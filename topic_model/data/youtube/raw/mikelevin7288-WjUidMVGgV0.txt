members of our local Congressional Delegation say they are ready to take on the new term fighting to make life better for San diegans so today we heard from congresswoman Sarah Jacobs who represents Chula Vista in the forest South County and also Congressman Mike Levin from the highly contested 49th district which covers much of coastal San Diego County both telling NBC 7 they have hopes for bipartisanship heading into this new Congress well I think there's still a great opportunity to work across the aisle on Common Sense issues like trying to fight for our veterans for their education their health care their benefits also on the environment and on energy issues there are areas of Common Ground particularly around renewable energy on public lands on protecting our coasts our estuaries so I'm going to work across the aisle with anybody that's willing to work with me and I think that's what's expected from our constituents they want us to roll up our sleeves and get things done

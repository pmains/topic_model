More than $4 billion are
headed to the Mountain State as part of the new
American Rescue Plan COVID-19 stimulus
package that was signed into law yesterday in
Washington. $677 million, will be
directly funded to West Virginia's 55 counties
and their cities. Senator Manchin listened
to mayors and he listened to county
commissioners and he fought to make sure that
we had that money go directly to cities. He
trusts our government. He trusts our local
elected officials to make the right decisions
in their communities. The well-known West
Virginia park and river officially has new signs
to go with its new name. The National Park
Service unveiled the new signs at the New River
Gorge National Park and Preserve today. Senators
Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin worked to
bring a national park to West Virginia We have a chance to show
them who we really are. And this park is
basically a window to West Virginia. Passage of the
congressional infrastructure bill is
being hailed as a big boost for West Virginia.
In all the Mountain State will receive $3.8
billion to build and repair roads and
highways, $600 million are dedicated to
improving broadband. Another $506 million is
to repair bridges that are considered the worst
in the nation. We're touching every
element of infrastructure. If
you're on the rails, if you're in the car, if
you're basically wanting to get on the internet,
your bridges and your roads, everything, the
airports, we've touched everything here.

THAN ANY OTHER STATES IN THE  NATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH, GOOD TO SEE  YOU, CAL. JOINING US NOW, COLORADO  DEMOCRATICENATOR MICHAEL  BENNET. SENATOR BENNET, THE SPEAKER OF  THE HSE WAS RATHER OPTIMISTIC  TODAY AER HERREAKFAST WITH  THE PRESIDENT. IS IT A DEAL OR NO DEAL, WHAT IS YOUR PROGNOSIS? >> I'M VERY TIMISTIC, ANDREA. WE'VE G TO GET SOMETHING DONE. I FEEL LE THIS PROCESS HAS  GONE ON TWO WEEKS LONGER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE. WE SHOULD COME TO AGREENT AND  ASKHE AMERICANEOPLE TO  EXPLAIN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO  AFTER DECADES OF SPENDING $5.6  TRILLION FOR TWO WARS IN THE  MIDDLE EAS THAT LASTED FOR 20  YEARS. AFTER DECADES OF $5 TRILLION OF  TAX CUTS GOING TO THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA, WE'RE FINAL  ON THEUSP OF MAKING MAJOR  INVESTMENTS FOR THE AMECAN  PEOPLE AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO I THINKHAT'S LONG OVERDUE. LET'S BRING THIS TO AN END AND  LET'S GET ONITH IT.  AND WHEN ARE YOU ON THE  FILIBUSTERT TS POINT, GIVEN  WHAT ANGUS KING TOLD ME AND  SERAL OTHEREOPLE BEFOREND  AFTER THE VOTE ON VOTING RIGHTS  ON WEDNEAY? THAT HE'S NOW OPEN TO A CARVEOUT FOR VOTIN RIGHTS, HADN'T BEEN  FORETHAT, NECESSARILY. OR AT LEAST TALKING FOR  FILIBUSTER, THE PRESIDENT  CERTAINLY MED I THAT  DIRECTION LAST NIGHT. >> AH, I MEAN, I'D GO FARTHER  THAN THAT, AND I WOULD GO  FARTHER THAT. I THINK WE MAKE A MISTAKEHEN   CONFUSE MITCH McCONNELL'S  ABUSE OR BASTARDIZATION OF THE  FILIBUSTER THAT HAS NOTHING TO  DO WITH THE SENATE. AND WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THE RULES AND CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR  THE SATE TO HE A VERY  EXTEIVE DEBATE AND OFFER  AMENDMENTS AND TRY TO CNGE  LEGISLATION, AGENCY THE SENATE  IS MEANT TO DO. THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY, 51  SENATORS HAVE TO BE AE TO MAKE A DECISION. THAT IS THE WAY THE SENATORS  DESIGNED THE SENATE. IT'SOT THE WAY THE SATE  WORKS TODAY. IT'S NO LONGER THE WORLD'S MOS  DELIBERATIVE BODY. INSTEAD OF DELIVERING SOMETHING  WHICH IS PURE WREAGE WHICH IS  WHAT WE HE TODAY, WE OUGHT BE  FIGURING OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE  RULES TO MAKE IT WK AGAIN. AND I WOULD SAY, ANDREA, THE  RISEF TOTALIARIAN STATES  AROU THE WORLD, IN THE 21stth  CENTURY MAKES THE QUESTION OF  WHAT WE DO WITH THE SENATE RUL EVEN MORE URGENT THAN ER  BEFORE. >> NOW AS SENATOR KAINE WAS  POINTING OUT THE OTHER NIGHT, AS YOU LOOK AT THE 41 SENATORS WHO  VOTED TO BLOCK EVEN DEBATE ON  VONG RIGHTS, THEY REPRESENT  SOMETHING LIKE 24% OF THE  POPULATION OF THIS COUNTRY. BECAUSE, AIN, THE WAY THIS  COUNY HAS EVOLVED. >> RIGHT. >> AND YOU'VE GOT CALORNIA  HAVING TWOENATORS AND WYOMING  AND MONTANA HAVING TWO SENATORS. SO WHAT ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND  POLICE REFORM? HOW FAROULD YOU GO TO CHANGE  THE FILIBUSTER OR CARVE IT OUT? >>LL, I THINK WE SHOULD  CHANGE IT -- I THINK WE SHOULD CHANGE IT SO WE MAKE THE SENE  WORK. SO, WE GIVE THE MINORITY THE 65  OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE AS  SAID SO 51 SENATORS GET TO MAKES ECECISION NO MATTE WHAT THE  ISSUE IS. RIT NOW, THE PROBLEM WITH THE  SENATE IS NOTHING GETS DONE AND  THEN THE AMERIN PEOPLE CAN'T  HOLD ANYBODY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FA THAT NOTHING HAS GOTTEN  DONE BECSE THE RULES ARE SO  CONVOLUTED. THAT WORKS VERY WELL FOR MITCH  McCONNELL WHO REALLY ISN'T  TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH MUCH EXCEPT PUT RIGHT WING JUDGES ON THE  COT AND CUT THE TAXES FOR THE  WEALTHIEST PEOPLE EVERY NOW AND  NOW. HE'S NOT REALLY TRYING  PASS  CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATURE OR  TRYING TO DEAL WH VING  RIGHTS OR GUNS. ION'T THINK WE SHOULD DO IT -- I ACCEPT TT IF THE ONLY PLACE  WE CAN GET TO CAUCUS IS WE  SHOULD DO IT FOR VOTING RIGHTS. I CERTAINLY WOULD BE THERE TO  CHANGE IT FOR VOTING RIGHTS BUT  I THINK WEHOULD DO IT MORE  BROADLY. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A  FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY HERE. AND THE FILIBUSTER AS YOU'RE  POINTING OUT DOESN'T CREATE A  FUNCTIONING DECRCRACY, BECAUSE  IT COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEMS OF  HAVING A SENATE THAT'S SO  FOCUSED ON SOM OF THE SMALLEST  PULATIONS IN THE COUNTRY. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. WE CAN HONOR THEIR NEEDSND THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTO  PARTICIPATE INHE PROCESS,  WHILE STI BEING ABLE TO MAKE  DECISIONS AT THE END OF THE DAY. >> I WANT TO ALS ASK YOUBOUT  CLIMATE, BAUSE THERE'S A NEW  REPORT FROM THE RISK INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYSIS  ASSESSMENT THAT IS WARNING THE  WHITE HOUSE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE  IS A MAJOR NATIONAL SECURITY  THREAT. THE KEY PILLAR OF THE  PRESIDENT'S PROGRAM, THE CLEAN  ENERGY PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE  DROPPED BECAUSE OF OPPOSION  FROM SENATOR MANCHIN. YOU COME FROM ATATE THAT HAS  THE MOST GLORIOUS ENVIRONMENT, I AS A CHILD LOVED TO RIDE HORSES  AND WT TO SCHOOL. THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE  BEAUTIFUL THAN THE COLORADO  ROCKS AFAR AS I'M CONCERNED. W DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS? >> FIRST OF ALL, COME BACK TO  COLORADO, WE'LL TAKE YOU ANYTIME FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO BE  THERE. >> THANK YO >> BUT LET ME TELL YOU HOW I  FEEL ABOUTIT WE SPENT A GOOD  PART OF E IN OUR STATE AND  COME TOCOLORADO, MOVE TO  COLORADO SO THEY CANEE THE IN  THE. BECAUSE OF T SMOKE FROM CALIFORNIA, WE WEREN'T ABLE TO  SEE IT. THE COLORADO RIVER IS AT A  VANISHINGLY SMALL FLOW AT THIS  POINT. AS A RESULT OF THAT, AZONAS  GOING TO HAVE TO CUT BACK ON IT  WATER THI YEAR. WE HAD MUD SLIDES THAT CLOSED  I-70 DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY. YOU KNOW, SERIOUSLY DIMINISHING  THE ECONOMY ON THE WESTERN SLOPE OF COLORADO. SO THESE ISSUES ARE HERE TODAY  AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY ARE AFFECTING OURCONOMY  IN COLORADO TODAY. THEY'RE AFFECTING OUR CULTURE  TODAY. I'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATNS  WITH JOE MANCHI SEVERAL TIMES A NUMBER OF TIMES, ANDE JUST HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING HERE. I MEAN -- AND THE ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,OU AND I WERE  TALKING ABOUT THE NOTURPRISING ANALYSIS FROM DODD ANDUR  INTEIGENCE COMNITY THA  CLIMATE CHANGE IS A NATIONAL  SECURITY THREAT. IT'S A GLOBAL SECURITY THREAT. WHEN WE SEE PEOPLE GOING HUNGRY  BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WHEN  WE SEE SEAWAYS CHANGING BECAUSE  OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WHEN WE SEE  PEOPLE REFUGEE CRISES BEING  PROVOKED BECAU OFLIMATE  CHANGE,HE WORLD HAS TO ACT,  AND THE WORLD CANNOT ACT WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE UNITED  STAT OF AMERICA. AND THAT'S WHYE GOT TOET IT  SORTED OUT HERE. >> WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  YOUR WISDOM ON ALL OF

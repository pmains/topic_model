in this program we know that the impact on businesses often depends on the type of industry bringing in representatives jackie willarski and jim baird into our conversation you both represent different indiana industries starting with you congressman worlarsky the south bend area you represent obviously has a lot of manufacturing what's the reaction there to this type of assistance well i i'm grateful that when this happened that the governor deemed manufacturing as essential workers and so obviously in my district where you know we lead the nation in producing rvs boats trailers hardwood furniture and those kinds of things i think you've all seen we've all seen you know our economy in northern indiana hasn't just bounced back but manufacturing is in record sale mode and still as we cross into this you know new season and this new year they are still producing a record rate and so you know i would say that our district's doing great you know our kids are back in school our folks are back to work and the one thing that this bill is disastrous in is you know we're in a labor shortage in northern indiana we need people to come to work and so when people in my district job earners job creators heard about this bill they record called me and basically said don't pay our people to stay home we are in a labor shortage we need people to come to work and i will tell you this that you know elkhart county has done a phenomenal job as well and the reason we're having these record rates and sales is because the local elected official did a great job of making sure that this is a healthy workforce to go back into a healthy facility to work in congress

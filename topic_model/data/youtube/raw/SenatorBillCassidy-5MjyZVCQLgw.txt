since monday the national average for gas dropping by three cents yesterday's average at 3.81 cents a gallon in the meantime california has declared a grid emergency warning about blackouts potentially coming amid record high temperatures expected over the labor day weekend joining us right now to talk about the president's energy policy is senator bill cassidy and senator it's always good to have you why don't we just start talking about the the drop that we've seen in oil prices and in gasoline prices recently um it's been significant just as it was pretty significant on the way up but this is uh something that the markets are kind of watching and waiting to see what happens what what do you attribute the lower oil prices to i can think of three reasons right off the top of my head that rig count has increased by about 50 percent year over year those are private lands but there's more oil being produced here in the us number one number two we're through the summer driving season and a lot of people cancel their vacations reportedly because they couldn't afford gas so so that's a good thing um uh a demand destruction if you will and so so i think that there's a couple reasons one's kind of good one's not maybe not so good and then some are driving seasons over in general let me add one more to the list that's uh the looming potential slowdown i mean every time china shuts things down because of covet every time we have concerns about a recession coming up that seems to take some of the price out of any of these energy any of these energy commodities as well um what do you think we're in for let's say longer term where where are things kind of setting up especially as you watch what putin is doing right now in terms of cutting the supply of natural gas to europe yeah so i i the interesting thing is i think the american people are going to get whip salt okay so inflation was really going after them but now the fed is ratcheting up interest rates and so the economy is going to slow down so although we look at an indicator by itself and we say that's good news if you look at it in context it's just going to be the consumer the the people i represent being buffeted one way or the other we speak about gasoline prices coming down but natural gas prices continue up and natural gas prices means that people are paying more at the at the utility bill if you will but it also means that all those by-products fertilizer for example coming from natural gas fertilizer being an input of grocery stores you know you follow that is going to continue to be a little bit higher so i think if we're just speaking about the person at home balance in their checkbook they're going to feel it one way or the other for the next few months six years maybe six months or maybe even 12 months senator you serve on the energy committee what would you like to see done from national policy from that perspective there is so much that can be done to streamline permitting of energy projects renewable and traditional there was uh somebody who spoke of a permit that she had applied for for a super major in the gulf of mexico they were going to drill in four different directions off of an existing platform and she said 12 months after that was granted she would be sending oil and natural gas to the shore to be processed that she applied in january and they still have not received their permit now we could align that i call it the operation warp speed for energy not just for not just as we did for for the vaccine to bring something that would take three years to bring it to put in someone's arms in 10 months let's do that for for resources by the way it can also be for renewables when you see california going to all electric vehicles by 2035 they don't have the grid for that they are nowhere close to the grid for that and california is notoriously for delays and permitting they set them up for failure let's set ourselves up for success what's the funding that needs to go into that so the funding has been out there with both in the trump administration through the byte administration a bipartisan infrastructure bill for example which i was a part of there's a lot of money that is out there the issue is is that some of that so much of it gets chewed up in in the permitting process so and by the way some of which were permitting would bring revenue to the federal government think of permitting off the shore of louisiana to to allow those four different wells to be drilled that brings more royalty payments to the united states government i think the money would be there we would find extra money if required senator cassidy thank you we will

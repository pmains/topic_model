I coal ash a useful element or a harmful pollutant for the next few minutes we'll discuss efforts to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating coal ash hello everyone and welcome to Comcast newsmakers I'm Robert Traynham and i'm joined by congressman david mckinley republican from West Virginia congressman welcome to the program thank you for having me I think for the benefit of our viewers that are watching the program first and foremost what is coal ash and what do you do with it interesting question coal ash is an unavoidable byproduct of burning coal to make electricity primarily just like if you throw a log in the fireplace you get an ash when you put coal to make electricity you get an ash the issue comes down as to what to do with it over the years they found out that it is a replacement product for numbers of material that's used in concrete it's using concrete block in brick and tile it's used in drywall is using Kozma is used in toothpaste so in other words it's a recyclable material that's being used over and over night and it was encouraged by previous EPA administrators to do that because they based it on two studies there were a study done in 1993 in the year 2000 both under the Clinton administration to determine whether or not it was a harmful product both times they deemed it unnecessary alanda couraged pit to be recycled so as we speak now about forty percent of drywall of the of the product the co ash is created is recycled it's in bowling balls to ramming every tile in your kitchen let me ask you you mentioned different EPA administrators have I guess conflicting opinions about this the current administration the Obama administration has said that this is a hazardous material when you hear that word and when you potentially put something like that around your family around your kids in your home that's a major red flag so that's a but also be assuming that it is a hazardous material I assume that would be detrimental to the local economy absolutely but it's not a hazardous material but the thing is that their information perhaps that the obama administration may have that may have changed them if they did they haven't disclosed it to anyone this to be something if the EPA comes out with a study and it can reverses what they've their two previous studies I think I think any engineer would be able to see through it now you understand I'm just one of two engineers in Congress okay okay so it's hard to put something passed us on it we're going to deal with science and the facts and the facts are that it is a recyclable material it saves us as consumers millions if not billions of dollars a year for example right now we've had we've amended it into the highway bill why do we do that because if you can't recycle what if you can't put it into the concrete for roads and bridges that means they cost of concrete's going to go up and we're going to pave less roads we pave less roads we use less jobs I'm interested in using flash continuing to use it because it creates jobs and right now in the construction industry our men and women need jobs congressman absolutely congressman do you have bipartisan support for this from the West Virginia delegation but also from your other colleagues both on the Republican and Democratic side all across the country we've had support we passed the bill as a standalone piece of legislation back in October of last year and and we had I think 37 or 47 Democrats on the bill at that time now we've attached it to the highway bill as an amendment so that we can pave more roads during the highway construction we it was passed on a voice vote there of a muck and that and the chairman of the subcommittee the Democratic Chairman supported it it is bipartisan so why do you think the Obama administration literally is doing an about-face on this and saying something completely different from what you and also some Democrats are saying in the house I think they should have to speak for themselves on that but there's a perception actually of anything that's kool related to try to do away the so that we switch to renewable energies and I'm for that all the above let's use those we can use gas or maybe an ulterior motive here oh we know they're ulterior motive so they'll be very candid about they want to look back at the comments made by the administration or the president when he was running for office we have Joe Biden even saying that they're they're not in favor of clean coal then what are we doing the President himself has said that he doesn't favor the use of ease a bankrupt anyone that tries to build a coal fire power house we've got you go on and on we know there's an agenda but the issue here is what are we gonna do for job thank you sir it's of course thank you for joining us for this edition of Comcast newsmakers I'm Robert Traynham have a great day everybody we'll see you next time take care

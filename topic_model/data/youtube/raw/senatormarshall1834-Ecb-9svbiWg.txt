like to enter martial amendment number one which seeks to add a new section to title v of this legislation this amendment would improve and ensure appropriate access to drugs that are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy referred to as rims specifically my amendment simply ensure that for drugs on rims that are offered as an alternative to a surgical procedure that the drug must be purse prescribed to a patient only after the patient has been appropriately diagnosed using medical imaging rims is in place to ensure that drugs with serious safety concerns appropriately weigh the benefits over risk our amendment will not only ensure appropriate use of drugs on rims but it will save lives as an ob gyn for 30 years i delivered thousands of babies but i never imagined i'd have to be fighting harder in congress than i did in the emergency room and delivery room to protect moms and their babies medical imaging is one of the most powerful tools to ensure pregnancy is occurring in the uterus that there is not an ectopic pregnancy and is powerful in humanizing the unborn i would remind people that the so-called abortion pills are are fda approved for up to 70 days and even in the best of hands let alone telemedicine guessing a gestational age is just that that even in the best of hands again guessing a gestational age can be off three to four weeks and in some cases months medical imaging is the standard of care to diagnose the pregnancy in fact one study showed that up to 78 of abortion mind mothers chose life after seeing an ultrasound of their child the federal government does not have all the data on medication abortions that do go wrong as one of three physicians on this committee this is the least you can do to protect the safety and well-being of women and unborn children i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and i yield back further discussion on the marshall amendment madam chair senator smith um senator marshall could i ask you a question about your amendment sure um senator marshall under your amendment what kinds of medical imaging procedures would a woman be forced to receive in order to access medication abortion i think the ultrasound would be the the standard of care but what kind of ultrasound senator marshall i i don't think that that i would um i would leave that up to the physician i'm not sure if it's referring to a transvaginal ultrasound versus abdominal ultrasound both could be utilized at the discretion of the of the attending so um madam chair i strongly oppose this amendment um uh senator marshall i think that your amendment my reading of it would that it would require women to undergo a completely unnecessary medical imaging including an invasive and uncomfortable trans vaginal ultrasound to be clear these kinds of ultrasounds do not have a medical purpose within 10 weeks of pregnancy which is the time frame for when women are able to access a medication abortion medication abortion is a common procedure with over half of the abortions in this country taking place through medication abortion and most women confirm their pregnancies with a simple urine test and possibly blood work so this kind of ultrasound is unnecessary and intrusive madam chair i think that this amendment would force women who are seeking a medication abortion to be diagnosed in person and only after this unnecessary procedure it would undermine the ability of women to access reproductive health care and with this amendment um we would be saying uh senator marshall is saying that government and not women not their health care providers should be in control of the health care the doctors are forced to provide women this is not i think what americans want we should be opposing this amendment if we believe like most americans that women and not government and politicians should have the ability to control their own health care and their own bodies and make decision about their health care including abortion may i respond to that right i actually actually think it would be the standard of care to get a sonogram done before prescribing the medicine like i started uh saying earlier that this medicine's only been approved for up to 70 70 days after conception so they're really guessing on the woman's gestational age so they may be giving this drugs to a pregnancy that's much later than they thought making the drug less effective causing birth defects additionally for the standard of care for diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy again something that i would see in the emergency room is a woman who thought she had an abortion done somewhere else and she's showing up with life-threatening hemorrhaging because she has an ectopic pregnancy understand your i respect your concerns about the transvaginal probe ultrasound it's a very common procedure no more painful than up than a pap smear that's not saying much i acknowledge that but many times it could be done with an abdominal ultrasound i do think um with with the telemedicine that's going on in this country right now and the abuse of it that they'll be giving this prescription drug to people that are further along than they really are they're going to miss ectopic pregnancies and without the ultrasound women are going to die thank you so

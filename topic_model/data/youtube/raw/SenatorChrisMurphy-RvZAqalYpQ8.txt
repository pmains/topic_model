good morning and I want to thank you for joining us today thank you to Senator luma Thal and Murphy and Congress members murca Saul Powell crow and Evans for working together to introduce this legislation they have been all tremendous leaders on gun violence prevention I also want to thank the gun violence groups who have offered their support and who are fighting hard to save lives from gun violence for far too long Congress has failed to act on gun safety legislation every day a hundred Americans die from gun shots some and mass shootings in schools movie theaters houses of worship others and shootings and private tragedies that never make the newspaper these deaths are preventable and this year the House has advanced multiple important gun safety reforms including universal background checks the legislation that we are introducing today is another vital step it would repeal a little-known but deeply destructive bill passed in 2005 which gave the gun industry an unprecedented and unique immunity from liability in state and federal courts the protection of lawful Commerce in Arms Act or placa under state and federal law we require and expect every other industry whether car makers or drug companies to act with reasonable care for public safety but in 2005 after furious lobbying by the NRA Congress passed placket to create a special carve out for the gun industry since placa became law state and federal courts have dismissed numerous cases a gun against gun industry actors and doubtless many more cases were not brought at all responsible actors in the gun industry don't need this limitation on liability and the irresponsible ones don't deserve it correct the error that Congress made in 2005 my colleagues and I are introducing the equal justice for victims of gun violence Act this bill will repeal the liability immunity shield and shrined and placa it will ensure that victims of gun violence can have their day in court the same right we should guarantee any Amer and we're also repealing a separate ban barring plaintiffs and civil cases from discovering and introducing gun trace data held by the ATF that is often needed to show a pattern of negligence we know that the gun lobby will fight as hard to keep placa as they fought to get it in the first place this will be a long and difficult fight but in granting immunity to the worst actors in the gun industry Congress did tremendous harm to the goal that we all want to see which is fewer families torn apart by guns as we fight for common-sense gun reforms repealing placa must be part of that fight because I would argue that it is one of if not the most impactful steps that we could take and we will keep at it until we succeed and now I'd like to invite my colleagues to say a few words thank you Thank You congressman Schiff thank you to my colleagues from the house and my partner and so many of these efforts Senator Murphy for joining us today and most important thanks to the groups moms demand action Brady Campaign every town for gun safety and a lot of the Connecticut groups connect against gun violence Sandy Hook promise Newtown Action Alliance we are spawning a movement and we are winning at the polls gun violence prevention was on the ballot in the last election and it won and that's the reason why we have literally the wind at our backs the political wind at our backs as is shown so dramatically by the presence here of gun safety advocates from the house you are going to be the heroes of this fight because you are blazing the way for the Senate which continues to be complicit continues to be complicit by its inaction and in the hundred days since passage of the universal background checks bill the Senate has done nothing it is part of a comprehensive set of measures and we're here to announce another the repeal of placa is absolutely necessary to provide simple straightforward justice in 2005 there was a sweetheart deal and a corporate giveaway to the gun industry the principle author at the time promised that no one no victim of gun violence would be prevented from seeking redress that promise by Senator Larry Craig has been betrayed because numerous victims have been denied justice placa has closed the courthouse doors to countless victim and all we're doing through this proposal is giving victims of gun violence their day in court that's all we're asking for them to have the same rights as any other victim of products that do harm the gun industry manufacturers and sellers should be held to the same standard of reasonable care that applies to any other industry and there is no excuse for this corporate giveaway and sweetheart deal to them now I'm a trial lawyer by profession for me this sweeping immunity isn't a special abomination because it denies someone who suffers harm from a violation of the standard of care that is the bedrock of our justice system to people who need that redress and so I'm proud to stand here with my colleagues congressman Schiff and I introduced this measure in a previous Congress we have increasingly better chances of achieving it this time because of the change in the makeup of the house we're gonna put this measure on the ballot next time if it fails to pass now and history will judge harshly our colleagues in the Senate if they fail to pass this measure history will judge them harshly and the voters will judge them even more harshly I hope this coming November let me just say finally Connecticut as you know has provided a narrow victory for the Sandy Hook victims that victory came from a evenly divided Supreme Court ruling it was four to three in favor of the Sandy Hook victims carving a narrow exception to chlaka based on the deceptive and misleading marketing under our state consumer protection law so the Sandy Hook victims can go back to the trial court and seek to prove their case it was by no means a total victory for them it's a narrow exception it provides no justification for failing to move forward on repealing plaka Congress must move forward despite the Connecticut Supreme Court ruling because it applies to no other states except Connecticut and even there it is exceedingly narrow and the barriers to success are exceptionally high plaka is an abomination it must go and I'm proud now to yield to my partner in all this effort Senator Chris Murphy thank you very much dick thank you Adam and and others for being here today the real thanks to senator Blumenthal Noda it is to the advocates behind us who are representative of hundreds of thousands of activists of mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters teachers and co-workers who have risen up all across the country to make real demand the United States Congress that we reflect the will of the vast majority of the American public who cannot accept silence any longer from the United States Congress when placa passed in the mid-2000s it was during the heyday of the gun lobby here in Washington literally anything that the gun industry asked for during that period of time they got and in many ways placa was a test of their legislative limits I mean because on its face it sounds so absurd to carve out guns the most dangerous of consumer products from consumer safety standards it sounds absolutely nuts to someone that you're explaining this to on the street that a child's toy gun is subject to greater liability protections for a purchaser than the owner of an actual gun and yet the gun lobby was so omnipotent during that decade that they could even get this liability exemption passed through the United States Congress and I know as an advocate that you sometimes feel like you're beating your head up against a wall when you come to Washington on the issue of gun violence but I think it's important to underscore how radically different the gun lobby's reception is in Congress today than it was during that period of time in the 2000s when their allies controlled every lever of power here prior to the 2018 election the House the Senate and the White House the gun lobby had an agenda it frankly wasn't as ambitious as placa and they couldn't get any of it called for a vote in the United States Congress they couldn't get a single piece of legislation passed because of the power of the groups lined up behind us background checks now has passed one half of the United States Congress and though it's been over a hundred days and no action in the Senate it's yet another sign of how times are changing we will pass a repeal of placa we will get this done but it's going to require this movement continuing to believe in their growing power believing in the day when we the 90% of Americans who want change to happen are just as powerful in this place as the gun lobby was during the decade when they got legislation like the gun liability exemption Act passed there is life saving technology out there that is there for the taking but so long as the industry has no financial reason to invest in the development of that technology because they cannot be sued in court that technology doesn't see the light of day as it has in so many other industries where the risk of lawsuit from a defective product has made products safer and safer so there was a day when the gun lobby was so powerful as to get this legislation that we're seeking to repeal passed it was a high-water mark for the gun industry a high-water mark for the NRA and the good news as we reintroduce this legislation is that our day the American people's day when we get to set the agenda on public safety when we get to make sure that what 70 80 90 percent of Americans want becomes law is coming soon part of the reason why I know which direction this debate is coming and is going is because of all of the fantastic new members of Congress who have come here with their personal stories and with their conviction to make this change happen so let me introduce a representative Debbie Marcel Powell Thank You senator Murphy Blumenthal I think that Americans are tired they're tired of special interests avoiding accountability nowhere is that more painfully clear than the special immunities that gun manufacturers distributors and dealers get in the form of a federal liability shield for too long gun manufacturers have been able to silently send by with impunity as their products hurt and kill tens of thousands of people across the country every year no other industry in America is given that kind of blanket immunity to operate however they want with no regard to harm and grief their products caused on the American people and the rest of the world almost three years ago tomorrow exactly marks the date when 49 people were murdered at the pulse nightclub by the same military sell weapons found in gun stores across the country the companies that make these assault rifles like the ones used at polls have been allowed to operate business as usual after that shooting free from fear of prosecution punishment or any consequences gun violence is an epidemic in America killing a hundred people a day on average and the gun industry has seemingly no interests of changing that but mom steam and the Brady Campaign every town we are Americans are we are ready to change that and that is why today we are introducing legislation that would allow Americans to hold these gun manufacturers accountable and ensure the gun industry takes reasonable steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals in the wake of our nation's opioid crisis victims can take opiate manufacturers and distributors to court for negligent practices all we're asking here today is that victims of gun violence receive their day in court as well as part of a comprehensive approach to reducing gun violence it's time we end the gun industry special exemption from negligent actions and allow the victims of gun violence to pursue the justice that they deserve and it is a new day in Congress we will not stop regardless of the Senate Majority Leader ignoring the police of the American people and I am proud to introduce my colleague who is also fighting for gun violence prevention jason crow from colorado Thank You Debbie and thank you to chairman Schiff and senators Blumenthal and Murphy and Dwight for your leadership on this issue one that is deeply personal to my community six years 11 months in 326 days that's the amount of time that has passed since Sandy and Lonnie Phillips lost their daughter Jessie to gun violence the night was July 20th 2012 and Jesse went to the movies the Aurora theater shooting took 12 lives that night because a disturbed man was allowed to buy a hundred round magazine in 4,000 rounds of bullets online without a valid ID in any other industry their negligence would be criminal but the gun lobby has worked hard to make sure there are never any consequences for any of these shootings for far too long we've seen gun sellers and manufacturers being given the green light to put private profit ahead of public safety after losing their dog sandi and Lonnie decided to take a stand it was unfathomable to them that companies could sell a dangerous man tools of war without getting any information from that person and without facing any consequences so they brought the gun seller to court where the judge dismissed their case because Congress had already made the sweetheart deal with the gun and manufacturers the sellers to shield them from liability the results for them were devastating it bankrupted their family and left them with over $200,000 in debt in the Army I learned that citizenship comes with duties and responsibilities we have rights but we also have duties and responsibilities to one another and we are failing to fulfill those duties by giving the gun lobby immunity and not holding companies and individuals responsible for their negligence and for criminal misuse of firearm products that is why I am proud to stand here today with my colleagues to right this wrong I am proud to support the equal access to justice for victims of gun violence Act so we can start fulfilling our duties to each other and in the gun violence crisis in America thank you I'd like to thank the chairmanship and both senators Debbie and Jason also I've been advocating with legal action against gun manufacturing for over 20 years when I served in the Pennsylvania legislature because why mass shooting continues to make most of the coverage there are many communities throughout our nation where people love lose loved ones seemingly to unescapable gun violence on a daily basis for example unfortunately in the city of Philadelphia which I represent here in Congress they are essentially a murder every day every day surely some of these deaths could have been avoided if we help companies accountable for illegal sales and defective guns as they are floating on neighborhoods just as having the courthouse doors open again can be valuable because the discovery process was shine and light on these companies questionable practice in action State Attorney General's were able to hold big tobacco accountable in the 1990s now it's time to give them the power to hold big gun companies accountable in the 21st century because millions of Americans lives could depend on the equal access to justice for victims of gun violence Act will be another necessary tool in the toolbox to protect our citizens from gun violence and finally give victims from gun violence and their families opportunity to present their case in court let's reopen the courthouse doors for the victims of gun violence so I stand here with my colleagues collectively together the sent a message no more gun violence thank you very much I think my colleagues and we'd be happy to respond a few questions well it's not that the legislation calls for punishment what it does say is that the gun industry like every other industry ought to meet a reasonable standard of care and if it doesn't it ought to be exposed to liability like any other company in America if you own a bar and you are negligent in the sale of liquor and someone goes out and gets in a car accident kills someone you're not immunized from liability if you make a defective product you're not immunized from liability if you're the gun industry you are immunized from liability and the result of that is that they don't make products with the care that they should they don't sell products with the care that they should and what this legislation would do is repeal a one size only an immunity only enjoyed by that one industry so that it has to maintain the same standard of care towards the community that every other industry in America does you know congressman Schiff is absolutely right same standard as every other industry but every other industry has to pay punitive damages if it intentionally and purposefully violates that standard of care so for example if a manufacturer knows that a product is sold that will do severe injury to people when used as it is intended as in tobacco I brought the tobacco lawsuit then it should have to pay damages for that wrongful action but it's the same standard punitive damages yes if the same standard is met as applies in every other industry so sellers and manufacturers held to those standards may have to pay punitive damages but they would have to be proved in court and they would have to be justified under the same Lee legal standard that applies to everyone else and that will provide a powerful incentive as it has done in tobacco in automobiles in pharmaceutical drugs for safer products that's the trend that we've seen across America in the courts it's the way that the courts have raised the standards that apply generally to manufacturers well I mentioned at the very beginning that this step is part of a comprehensive set of measures the house has passed universal background checks it's also closed a loophole known as the Charleston loophole because in Charleston when the shooter they're killed so many people he was using a gun that he purchased despite his in eligibility because of a three day limit to how long the check would go so the house is moving ahead we've also introduced a ban on assault weapons I will be introducing shortly an emergency risk protection order bill I hope it will be bipartisan that allows judges to take away weapons from people who are shown to be dangerous and therefore a warrant may be issued the house has a similar measure under consideration there are a variety of other steps that we're going to be taking as part of a comprehensive approach to this topic and this this step is only one part of it I'll give a couple my thoughts and then invite my colleagues as well and you're right we've interview introduced this multiple names times now over the last more than half a decade look this is an issue that voters are increasingly going to the polls and demanding accountability and unlike in the past where a lot of candidates ran away from the gun issue there were candidates running to the gun issue to be champions of it in districts where they felt they could never do so before because public attitudes are changing and these wonderful groups that stand behind us are doing phenomenal work to motivate voters all over the country to make sure that whether you're in the Democratic Party the Republican Party you understand that if you vote against common-sense gun safety legislation that you are vulnerable to being removed from office and that applies to Republicans with equal force so I think we are reaching a tipping point on this I think it's going to be increasingly perilous for GOP members to hold up this legislation in the Senate or to vote against it in the house and I'll invite my colleagues to share their thoughts as well I think Senator Murphy said it a few minutes ago that this is not a short-term effort it is he learnt long-term effort and it is all of us collectively staying relentless in addressing this issue I wasn't here the terms before when I was introduced but I do sense that among the collectivism of the members that there's a realization we have to use all of the aspects of the toolbox to find ways to address it so I think that we have to continue to stick with it and keep pushing and I say to you today not that I have a crystal ball but that I say to you the determination of people will make a difference and let me add one more point just to be very blunt here the nra is crumbling the gun lobby is cratering it's dividing it's fraught with internal divisions and even corruption so it no longer has the sway that it did back in 2005 it's only a matter of time it may not be this session but remember that Republicans joined in passing the universal background check bill in the house not a lot but a handful they see the handwriting on the wall so will other Republican colleagues and they're gonna see that the NRA is an emperor without clothes it just no longer has the power that it did financially politically or in any other way and the NRA zone members are deserting it so I think that there there is a lot of promise here I think representative Evans is absolutely right that it's a long term marathon but we're willing to say the course I would reiterate the words of my colleagues here the bottom line for me is that the tide has already turned on this issue right the American people are behind this they are demanding it you know over 90 percent of America wants universal or enhanced background checks you know it's hard to get 90% of Americans to agree on almost anything but they are demanding this you know in my community I've had numerous mass shootings in my community from Columbine to the Aurora theater shooting - most recently just last month and another high school and and the people Republicans Democrats and unaffiliated alike have had enough because when they're afraid to take their kids to school when I go around my community and every week I have school students and teachers breaking down in tears to me because there afraid to go to school now afraid to be out in their community they have had enough we have had enough so if the Senate and the White House and others are not going to lead on this the people will demand leadership and they'll do so at the ballot box

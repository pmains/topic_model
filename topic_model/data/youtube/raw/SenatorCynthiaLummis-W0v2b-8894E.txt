thank you madam chairman uh my first question is for uh miss beaudine and mr pepper what what is the brooks act and and how could it impact small or disadvantaged communities from using these federal funds thank you senator for that question so the brooks act is federal legislation that says if federal dollars are being used for a project then um for the the design elements it has to be a a separate a separately uh competed project and that the community has to pick from the top three most um expert com uh companies so so it's yeah the the uh you could say it's well-intentioned so you don't go with low-cost bidders on design you could say if you wanted to criticize it you could say it's an example of a of a an association essentially getting into federal law to give them a competitive advantage for federal dollars but whatever your view is the reality on the ground is that it does create a tremendous barrier for small communities because you don't have you know these small projects you don't even have the big national architecture you know engineering design firms even bidding on them i mean it just it doesn't make sense for small projects i used to get lobbied on this when i worked in the house and we always well we always raised the small community concern um it did um it did get into the clean water act in in 2014 in the word of bill and in my recommendations i do recommend that congress amend that to add a cost threshold yeah okay because these big engineering firms they don't even wanna they're not gonna bid on these small projects it's not even an issue but nonetheless uh the the legislation applies to them mr pepper do you have anything to add to that yes ma'am thank you senator um yeah you know in wyoming the small communities typically have a consulting engineering firm that they've contracted with that acts in de facto as their engineering department the engineers then work with public works put it put a project together and then it goes out to bid to the contractors who will be performing the actual work uh and i think that that this particular provision has has created an under utilization of the srf in wyoming for that reason uh usda and of course state money slib and and so forth don't have that that provision and it allows the the communities to utilize that consulting engineer that they've had on staff relatively uh for a number of years and understands their systems so i see it as a a potential impediment well thank you i interestingly in wyoming there are only 12 towns whose population exceeds their elevation so think about that one chew on that for a minute ms beaudine what are some of the examples of creeping conditions in the march 8 guidance that that cause concerns that jump out at you certainly uh thank you for that question well the um it is true that when these srf programs were originally set up you know they it was a shift from grant programs to state-run programs and it was initially you know very um very much state-run and only the initial federal capitalization grants were considered federal dollars now over time congress and this is you know congress has changed the law to apply things like uh like davis bacon and of course american iron steel uh the uh infrastructure bill also adds that by america build america which we don't have guidance on yet so it's gonna it's unclear how that's going to apply but troublingly uh epa's implementation guidance adds to that so you know it's one thing that congress put it in but when epa is saying things like states should uh tell tell uh their communities that they should enter into project labor agreements for example there's nothing in the statute about project labor agreements at all yes davis bacon applies but not project labor regressions which says union and you have right-to-work states uh so it that makes it it's not epa's authority or role to do that they also i have you know i know that we've heard testimony on both sides on the disadvantaged community definitions and the intended use plans but again that it's a state uh a state decision i was really happy to see to hear senator carper say yes it's very different in delaware and wyoming about what's a disadvantaged community and so this really truly had to be state decisions and so my biggest concern was you know the the epa didn't say shall didn't say they must but says they expect it and that they should do it and i'm just worried that states will view that as a mandate yeah well if it's on a checklist and there's a blank on the checklist that may trigger epa to deny some sort of funding so yeah big concern thank you this is for all panelists what should congress be doing going forward to make sure these federal dollars make the most impact in the communities that you work or represent mayor would you would you take care to take a stab at that one sure i think that some of the things thank you senator i think some of the things that are happening uh are exactly what needs to happen the infrastructure bill is important uh to put resources in the hands of as many people as possible in it if they get directly to the cities you know i would advocate that that money come directly to the cities i think cities and mayors can use it very quickly uh we can expedite it and you can see the impact that we have uh immediately uh if that in fact takes place uh you know and to make sure that some of this this money is actually flexible that folks can use it in the way that they think is necessary uh as it relates to the infrastructure in their community particularly around less service lines and gives us the opportunity to use local laws and state laws as well to do this as quickly as we possibly can mr schimel any comments on this great uh i i thank you senator i agree uh with the mayor continued funding is the single most important uh issue for all of us um i would also add that making sure that there's eligibility for independent um utilities such as ours that are regional versus municipal um at points we have not been eligible for certain funding that has come out because we're a regional entity and don't have a municipal governance and then continuing to incentivize the state srf programs to innovate um in order to to gain new membership into the folks who are utilizing the srf programs not enough folks uh utilize it and if there's any way that they can incentivize to lower the bar or make it easier for communities um to to get their hands on the funding i think that would be uh exceptionally important thank you ms podin yes thank you um i so this is an historic influx of funding and so and and yes it's mostly being channeled through the state revolving loan funds which are set up as uh for capital investment now we've heard some of the folk people here today talk about um ability for planning uh you know yes it can be used used for lead service line inventory but i guess one one suggestion i would make is that uh that you may want to expand the eligibility to include some some innovative monitoring to it to identify problems whether it's the pfas whether it's the lead so that you are providing public health protection right now because it as senator booker said when he spoke it's going to take 10 years or more for example to get rid of all the lead service lines and you have people who are exposed in the interim or or we don't know if they're exposed or not and so taking some small amount of that money and i'm not you know obviously these are hugely expensive programs you need the capital investment but taking some money for some interim health public health protection might might be a good idea okay thank you and mr pepper thank you senator um continued funding maximum flexibility with the end result in mind getting from point a to point b which is upgrading our infrastructure uh getting rid of lead lines uh addressing pfas but allowing maximum flexibility on how we go from point a to point b i think is probably the the determinant that we're going to have to have going forward thank you i have the luxury of the fact that the chairman wants to come back from her vote and so i get to extend the the time a little bit and we'll take advantage of it so this also is for all the panelists in in the march 8 guidance justice 40 is referenced multiple times throughout the document but the epa does not define explicitly to state srf programs what exactly it is justice 40 is the president's plan to have 40 percent of the benefits from federal investments in climate go to disadvantaged communities we've heard concerns that justice 40 is going to lead to a standard one-size-fits-all definition of disadvantaged communities so to all the panelists is a disadvantaged community in one state necessarily the same in another mayor would you like to take that one on sure absolutely first i i think that it is the right thing to do to identify uh disadvantaged communities who have not had the ability to respond uh to environmental issues and and other issues that are no fault of their own accepted their their zip code um you know so generally there are things that are similar throughout the country no matter where you live uh you know people are discriminated against for very specific reasons uh and are that are victims of environmental disaster for very specific reasons because they don't have enough money you know disproportionately black and brown they may be immigrants and they move into these communities and these things exist there there are legacy kind of environmental issues that exist in these communities and should be addressed in those communities because they've been there forever whether they're next to the water in the port or the airport you know all of those things because they're in big cities and and rural areas all of those things need to be addressed then there are some specific things that may be particular to other people's communities uh that are different uh in other you know states and cities there are some disadvantages that people have particularly uh based on a region that they live in so while those things should be considered i think is uh equally important to understand that there's a general sense of what this being disadvantaged is uh and we cannot uh have uh one or the other we should be dealing with and thank you thank you uh mr shimmel any thoughts to add on that one one size does not fit all right um absolutely we have urban areas uh springfield in particular disadvantaged community but i would also look to some of uh the rural areas uh in western massachusetts where it's a two-person shop and they do everything and they don't have the time to fill out the the loan paperwork and have never done anything even close to that and so i i think uh as long as there's not a one size fits all i think there's a lot of different types of disadvantage and i think that um the the funding needs to be able to reach into those corners where it's obvious but also there's some areas where it's not so obvious where there's other types of disadvantage so uh i think it's important that there's flexibility in all of this and it's not uh scripted as a one-size-fits-all thank you miss bodine your state and mine have indian reservations which would particularly uh come to the fore when you're thinking about disadvantage in some cases certainly that's true in wyoming on the wind river indian reservation but would you respond to this question um and yes the tribal areas present their own very unique challenges with respect to wastewater and drinking water and i speak that as the former head of epa enforcement as like oh no yeah but uh leaving so to that to your specific question um yes there was an executive order with a goal of 40 percent of the funding going to disadvantaged communities uh congress though has said you you have said already 49 49 not 40 is to go to disadvantaged communities from these these various pots of money so the issue is it's addressed it's taken care of there's nothing further i don't believe for epa to do and so my concern is that there would be an attempt to overlay a federal definition of disadvantaged community uh on top of what this what's in this in the statutes because the definition both in the infrastructure bill and in the underlying clean water act and in the safe drinking water act is about eligibility for what's called in the statute additional subsidization so it's for what are the communities that need this money they they need the extra subsidy uh they aren't eligible they don't have an they're not eligible for the loans because they'll never be able to pay them back and therefore the srs won't give it to them yeah and so it's that it's those definitions about about uh where does the money gonna go where it's needed where where are the needs the most which is a which is um which is fair which is specific whereas the broader definition of the disadvantage community it could be much broader but it may not bring into account some of that uh some of the financial affordability issues um so again you took care of it in the in the infrastructure bill with the 49 set aside the underlying statute took care of it by uh setting up the definitions and and the responsibilities for states to set their disadvantage community criteria so i don't think there's anything further to be done here to meet and the goal will be met thank you and mr pepper agreed uh thank you senator um reservations do pose a great opportunity uh in wyoming as you know uh wind river has two tribes uh we work very closely with both tribes in fact the president of our association is the utility manager for the eastern shoshone utility um yeah i think it should be left to the states for the definition uh i guess taking a a wording from from a prior career mind you say potato i say potato uh i think the definitional aspect should be left to the states well thank you all very much i will return the gavel to our committee chairwoman senator duckworth

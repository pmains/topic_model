mr. speaker reducing the income inequality between the people I represent in a northern mariana islands and Americans in the rest of our nation is one of my key goals as a member of Congress household median income in the Marianas was just 20,000 in the last census compared to 53,000 dollars nationwide and for that reason I've always supported the decision made in the 110th Congress to raise the minimum wage in the Marianas to the u.s. level in a series of graduated steps with that decision was enacted in public law 11 tenders 28 the locally set minimum wage in the Mariana Islands was just three dollars and five cents per hour and a minimum wage had been stuck at that level since the 1990s today the minimum wage has effectively effectively doubled to six dollars and five cents and will increase to six dollars and fifty five cents a year from now that doubling of the minimum wage has occurred during a period of economic difficulty for the Mariana Islands gross domestic product was dropping by eight percent twelve percent nineteen percent in the first three years of minimum wage increase I should say however that these drops had nothing to do with the weights and everything to do with the loss of manufacturing because of the general agreement on tariffs and trade and because of a loss of tourism in the most recent year for which GDP data is available for our Islands we had economic growth for 4.4% even as the minimum wage continued to rise the US bureau of economic analysis says that this economic growth reflects a growth in tourism especially an increase in tourism from china but it also reflects a growth in consumption because workers were paid more can't spend more and that is good for the economy so I look forward to next year's increase of another fifty cents in the minimum wage in the Marianas I look forward forward to reaching the national minimum wage in 2019 and I support legislation raising the national minimum wage because I have now seen in my district that increasing wages can have a positive impact on economic activity and improve people's lives at the same time I recognize that there is such a thing as economic reality raising the minimum wage too quickly could have detrimental effect could cause employment to shrink for the reason over the last seven years that I have been in Congress I work with members on both sides of the aisle to tailor the minimum wage increases to the specific economic realities in my district instead of racing by fifty cents every year as the original law required we skip the increases in 2011-2013 and this year 2015 and we arrived at this decision to stretch out the timing of the increases by listening to employers on the island and two workers because workers also understand that increasing wages too quickly could jeopardize their jobs we also listened carefully to the Government Accountability Office experts who looked at the effect of this minimum wage increases periodically and report back to Congress I think that so far list we have successfully walked the fine line we have kept the minimum wage increasing faster than prices Gao tells us without disrupting the economy and I'm very grateful to both Democrats here in Congress who agreed to slow down increases and to Republicans who agreed to late let the minimum wage keep going up they did so I think because of a recognition of a recognition that a relatively isolated island economy might need special consideration and because when it comes to a decision that only affects the members own district there is a tradition of difference here in Congress to the views of that member this is a very long way around to saying that I support HR 2617 the bill now under consideration the delegate from American Samoa has made the determination that what is best for our constituents is to delay further increases in the minimum wage she to represent a relatively isolated island economy her constituents to have incomes much below the US average the specific economic factors in American Samoa are not the same as in the Northern Marianas so why delay for some may be appropriate I would not want to imply the further delay for the Northern Marianas is called for at this time but I do think that the same courtesy that the house provided to me when it comes to making a judgment about the well-being of the people I represent should be given to the gentlewoman the delegate from American soma with respect to her own district and for that reason I urge members to support passage of HR 2617

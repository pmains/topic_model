uh let's go out now to uh kentucky gop center rand paul he's a member of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee uh senator i kind of felt bad for you uh after senator peters and senator johnson screamed at each other you're like okay i guess i'm next and you have to jump in do you feel the same way just handle it differently i mean is the tension that high on that committee yeah and i think the problem is is it's become personal you know senator peters has accused senator johnson of spreading russian disinformation it's the same kind of crap that the left has been doing over and over again you work for putin or moscow mitch and all this craziness but it's very insulting because they're basically implying that we're thinking of another country first that we're somehow a traitor to our country and they don't realize that that those are fighting words where i come from and uh you can see i think chairman johnson's justifiably mad who wants to be accused by someone of not being loyal to your country i mean that's crazy i just tell you what president just tweeted out chris krebs was totally excoriated he thought the president fired him when he came out and said there was nothing there was no fraud at all the cleanest election ever and proven wrong at the senate hearing on the fraudulent 2020 election massive fraud took place with machines people voting from out of state illegals dead people no signatures and much more and we did hear his lawyers say that and krebs took the other side on that what did you what did you get from this who's right i think krebs still doesn't understand what he's trying to say if he's simply saying that it was a good election because it wasn't foreign interference and that his uh committee did a great job at trying to prevent foreign interference i could accept that but he didn't look at absentee ballots he didn't look to see if dead people voted or non-citizens voted or people voted twice he didn't look at that so from the very beginning i always thought he should have clarified a statement to say it was the safest election with regard to what i'm in charge of which is interference through the internet and actually don't think that any election votes in 2016 or 2020 were changed by some nefarious third party in another country i don't think that happened do i think there was fraud in this absolutely and there's a history of these kind of problems in our country and the only way to deter it is you got to put people in jail so there has to be an investigation of people who voted illegal people voted twice people who voted from the wrong address they need to be purged from the rolls we need to make sure it doesn't happen again but we can't just sweep it under the rug and say oh well 1700 people in georgia voted twice were we going to let them vote twice again in about two weeks i mean somebody has to do something yeah yeah it's not fair to the 75 million people that voted for president trump and still have questions about the election let's talk about hunter biden it's something that uh the rest of america if you're not watching fox learned about after the election and uh steve ducey's son peter who has been on the campaign trail and now he's with uh with what they're calling the president-elect biden and he's asking the tough questions no one else is fox is the only one there asking the tough questions thanks to peter and peter asked him yesterday he said do you think that your son did anything wrong listen to this are you confident your son hunter did nothing wrong i'm confident all right so that's the only time he's answered the question about it what's your reaction if he's confident he should leave in place the u.s attorney who's investigating hunter biden there is a u.s attorney in delaware doing this traditionally when a new president comes in they fire all the u.s attorneys if he wants to show that this is going to be a upright upstanding biden administration and that they're going to actually let the cards lie where the cards lie on hunter biden he needs to leave that u.s attorney in place so that's something very carefully to watch if the u.s attorney is fired in the first weeks of the administration and if the investigation goes to a biden appointee you can tell the fix is in and there's not going to be justice but hunter biden deserves the same justice that paul manafort got nothing less nothing more well speaking of the fixes in there is a brand new rasmussen reports poll that came out and they asked people all across the country uh people who were voters what they thought about the situation with hunter biden where we've heard about it afterwards as you can see right there 52 of all u.s voters think the media ignored the hunter biden story to help joe biden's win the presidency now 78 of republicans think the media deliberately hid the story until after election day and then and this is jaw-dropping right here 73 of republicans think that biden profited joe biden that is to say profited from hunter biden's business dealings and see that's you know people go well you know hunter biden is the the son of the former vice president but if you think that the president-elect is involved in these deals there could be a problem for the president-elect well when you look at the sources now the sources have gotten so one-sided completely ignoring it not only ignoring it then sometimes branding it or labeling it as being misinformation that's become the new thing even the associated press which once upon a time was thought to be objective would write stories and then say no evidence when my wife and i were attacked in new york they said rand paul says he was attacked despite no evidence except for 200 videos of my wife and i being attacked in d.c and a police officer being injured while trying to help us and getting stitches above his eye oh no nobody was attacked nothing to see here no evidence that's the problem is it's not just ignoring the news they're then saying that what we're saying is misinformation until it becomes so big they can't contain it but this only happened because there were some good people in the department of justice who decided to say look if we're going to investigate paul manafort and throw the book at him shouldn't we at least be fair and do the same thing to hunter biden yeah i know some are concerned too joe biden's a.g will be and that's why lindsey graham is calling for a special counsel he wants an outsider to investigate hunter biden he said if you believe a special counsel was needed to look into trump and russia how can you say there's no need for a special counsel regarding hunter biden to see if his dad was involved i think that's true if you were somebody who wanted a special counsel but i didn't want a special counsel for trump or for manafort i think actually manafort was over prosecuted in the sense that his punishment was much greater than his malfeasance and so what i would say i don't like special counsels if i had a special counsel i can investigate anybody in the world i can investigate the deacon at your church who's never committed a sin and put them in jail because special counsels are too powerful so i'm not for it even in this case but i do think hunter biden should get justice and it should be similar to what was meted out to paul manafort all right you think the election was stolen you tweeted out absolutely i think there's a great deal of fraud and it's not the first time i mean you know the famous story of lbj he's got scotch in one hand his illegal votes and a shoe box on the other and he turns them in at midnight and they say uh-oh your opponent turned his in two hours later and won the election he said ah never again he says so he comes back two years later and he says we're not turning our illegal votes in until my opponent has turned in all of his illegal votes it's been going on my dad had an election stolen in 1976 but the only way you fix it is the courts will not hear you after the election that's what we're finding now it's the way it's always been you got to go back and you got to police the election you got to elect a secretary of state who won't lie cheat steal and change the election law so these are things you have to do and you have to purge the polls you got to prevent illegal aliens from voting etc they didn't do that senator rand paul thank you so much

thank you madam chairman and ranking member Bozeman for having this hearing today and thank you guys for being here it's really critical and it certainly is in my state um Mr undersecretary I'd like to discuss the Disaster Assistance programs authorized under the farm bills specifically the emerging assistance for livestock honeybees and farm-raised fish programs are elap you know Mississippi grows more catfish than any other state in the nation and it's been such a good crop for our state for many years and we certainly want to protect it and do everything we can to enhance it because on Friday night Southerners they go eat catfish at a catfish house somewhere and I I'm guilty we do it on Friday night as well but the bird depredation and the disease it's really posing a great threat to the long-term viability it it amazes me what a nuisance and just a disaster they can be but the catfish producers suffer substantial economic losses to the bird depredation annually and the problem is really threefold the obviously the revenue that's lost by the fish that are consumed by these birds and it's amazing I don't know if you've ever watched them it's amazing to watch these this happen but then the death losses due to the diseases introduced by fish eating birds they just bring with them and then of course the increased costs that it takes to scare the birds away from the pots and since the vast majority of the catfish production occurs just in a few States Alabama Arkansas and Mississippi we really don't get a lot of attention on this because it is kind of just a Southern state thing but let me just describe to you what these farmers are dealing with I mean hundreds of thousands of these camarades they they migrate south each winter and we just look for them we know it's coming and they're fish eating birds and they can eat one to three pounds of fish per day per bird and uh because catfish ponds they're relatively small 10 to 20 acres and they're stocked with about seven thousand Pounds or more of fish per acre they uh they make a very attractive stopping pot spot for these birds they know exactly where they're coming and I mean it can be a flock of 500 easy at one Pond and that's not uncommon and they can be there for weeks they can be there for months and we all know when they there because that's when the phone starts ringing but during these events the farmer he may spend 800 or more per acre to scare the birds away and since they're the comrades and other predatory Birds such as pelicans and cranes are federally protected under migratory bird treaty act we can't use lethal methods without a permit from the U.S fish and wildlife service and those are pretty difficult to get for these Farmers so you know rarely does a plot leave for very long in the right back when you scare them off that's a lot of shells and after the comrades leave a catfish farm in the spring to fly north farmers are often counting thousands of fish that died just from the diseases they brought with them on top of the fish that they consume and you know if you do the math in a large flock of comorites eating one to three pounds of fish per day for a month that's a huge financial hit to these guys and ladies but when you factor in disease and the other additional cost it you know it's put people out of business but uh unfortunately catfish producers are not eligible for any of these losses under elab and or any other USDA disaster program for that matter they they just have to take the losses and this is a genuine crop loss here that's out of their control but I would certainly considering consider losing a million dollars worth of fish in a short amount of time or spending tens of thousands of dollars to scare birds I mean it's obviously it's a disaster to these farmers but the U.S farm-raised catfish industry is a major con contributor to rural economies in the Southeast and provides thousands of jobs in some of the most Rural and underserved parts of this entire country so saying all of that I would love to amend elab in the 2023 farm bill to address the issue and I guess my question Mr secretary is would you commit to working with me and my staff in the Senate AG committees to provide technical assistance and feedback on several proposals that we're looking at related to this issue that I'm working on and I want to be sure that any changes made to elab work and are easily implemented by USDA but we have a really major problem with this and it is you know it's a southern thing but I just want your commitment if you can give that to me to help me with these issues absolutely and I know I might turn to Zach as well I know he's been engaged on this issue as well we'll absolutely commit to work with with you and and uh but but let me turn it to Zach uh thank you senator for the question and growing up on a ranch driving an H tractor in a field with a jumbled up toolbox and a messy garage that we didn't have the money to put the electricity in I learned how to use tools very well and learned how to improvise elap is our best tool for that flexibility and we were able to use that tool to extend some flexibility to the aquaculture industry broader the the causes of loss that you mentioned we do have some challenges with those particular causes of loss under the program but absolutely we'd love to work with your staff to help get to some solutions that work better for your producers can you just briefly tell me some of the challenges of why we don't meet that elap has a lot of weather related cause of losses we were able to find flexibility to get aquaculture and under the weather related damage with regard to winter storm Yuri in 2021 and to hear the red fish producers tell it we really helped save their industry the the barrier or the bar against assisting where it's a depredation issue we use our lit program for depredation issues so there's maybe a little bit of a Confluence of of programming that needs to happen there in order for us to really meet that need okay well thank you so much and I'm glad you guys understand and that you're familiar with this and I appreciate your help thank you madam chairman

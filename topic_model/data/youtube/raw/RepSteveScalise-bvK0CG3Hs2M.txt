we started yesterday touring around with the border patrol agents especially last night when you see the large numbers of people crossing illegally over the rio grande it was alarming just how quickly we saw large numbers of people coming across over 100 people already being held in a processing center and then today we went to the donna detention facility and this really underscores how egregious president biden's policy is on these children we went into a facility in the middle of a pandemic that is designed to hold no more than 250 people today there's more than 4 000 people these kids are pawns in his dangerous game it's got to stop 40 of america's border patrol agents at these high traffic errors are not stopping the drugs from coming in which is their mission of what they want to do they have to be over at these holding facilities babysitting the children that have come over and the drug dealers know it and the drug dealers know while the border patrol agents are taking care of the kids that are coming across illegally they have free reign to bring in drugs illegally president biden you know this is going on you can stop it right now we are calling on you to come down here see this for yourself and then reverse the failed policies you put in place that created this crisis at america's southern border

new study looks beyond the tally of prison populations and taxpayer dollars to take stock of the human costs of mass incarceration over the course of a year researchers from the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights forward together and research action design worked with 20 community organizations to interview hundreds of formerly incarcerated persons their families and their employers their findings compiled in a report titled who pays the true cost of incarceration on families show that the consequences of criminal justice policies extend far beyond the incarcerated individual and past the end of a sentence to reverberate with long-term harms throughout their families and communities the researchers learned the loss of a family member to the prison system exacerbates economic emotional and physical vulnerabilities and that those burdens fall most heavily on low-income women of color back with me is represented bar believes in California MSNBC contributor EJ Dionne and joining us now is also weighed Henderson president and CEO of the leadership conference on civil and human rights and Marc Maurer executive director of the Sentencing Project and mark I want to start with you basically just to get to this question that is the report who bears the cost of incarceration well you know we often forget the day that a person is sentenced in the courtroom it's not only that person but his or her entire family is bearing some of that burden the person goes away for a few years in most states most prisoners come from but he's most prisons are built in rural communities often hundreds of miles away from home so now we say well it's very important for people in prison to keep up ties with their family and yet we make it very difficult for them to do that so if you want to go and visit your loved one in prison you need a car to get there you probably have to pay for hotel if you want to get a phone call home prisoners have to call collect at exorbitant rates so you're constantly battling balancing do i buy milk and groceries for kids or do I take a call from my husband in prison and that's a terrible choice afternoon that idea that the people who are incarcerated come from poor communities and family's most frequently and then those poor communities and families end up also bearing those costs and so way part of what's happened in this kind of shift around our incarceration language has been an economic discourse so I remember if you were a criminal justice for former 15 years ago it was the prison industrial complex and how there was big money to remain in the system and now we're hearing oh it's just a bad investment for localities it sorry I guess I have a little bit of a hard time balancing any of this as an economic rather than a an ethical question well there is an extraordinary economic underpinning to the prison industrial complex but I think tana he sees an article as well as the Ella Baker report early underscore three things one there is consequence at the intersection of policy on criminal justice reform and as well as unconscious bias and a structural inequality secondly there is a huge issue with respect to the voting participation of individuals in their communities and unless we restore the Voting Rights Act the idea of seeking reform as I think these articles emphasized will be difficult to achieve and then thirdly every member of Congress on the Judiciary Committee should be required to read these articles endless report because I really think they paint a picture both powerful and compelling and provides insight on how the unintended consequences of mass incarceration really undercut the ability to achieve meaningful reform in communities which are affected her you know this the way that you sort of put these together Coates's piece and this Ella Baker piece feel to me very much like the Ferguson report of kind of our national incarceration story because we can see that sixty-three percent of family members who are paying the cost of conviction eighty-three percent of those are women we see that that families go into debt one in three families go into debt because of the phone calls and visits that you were just talking about so like the Ferguson report that talks about policing kind of these interactions in a narrow sense but then a much broader kind of economic consequences how this whole system is built on poor folks that just feels to me like oh well now coats and the Ella Baker report have shown us how this is true nationally we are one of the most interesting things I thought about tallahassee Kurtz's peace is the way he used the Moynihan report because there are a lot of us who believe that family structure matters and that you need to help people put the family back together that if you care about equality you got to care about the family if you care about the family you got to care about equality but what this piece shows us is all right to everybody who says what I just said to everybody who talks about the family would you please look at what the impact of our incarceration policies have on families if you care about families you've got to worry about the over incarceration of people and then the other thing about the report and this piece is you've got to see this in the context of whole community said the problems facing whole communities and you know i'm a family guy but i know it's not just the family living these these together is really advances the discussion we're having of over incarceration in the country let me give him first the shout out to the Ella Baker Center dedicated about the show and they are but now they are yeah phenomenal secondly I think that what China has he has said makes the case for what he wrote about in his first piece the case for reparations okay secondly let me put a couple of things in context in terms of public policy in terms of our incarceration rates first formerly incarcerated individuals who are out now who were incarcerated for a drug conviction denied Pell grants we have legislation trying to unravel that yep that's wrong secondly ineligible for life drug offenses more food stamps these men benefits thirdly ineligible for public housing and so what Michelle Alexander titled her book the new Jim Crow we see policies now that are read segregating people who have been incarcerated especially for nonviolent drug offenses it's wrong it's morally wrong and it's destroying many many fans and that's exactly where we're going to go we're going to take a break but when we come back we're going to dig into those sets of policies and what this administration might might be prepared to do differently my guest back in the next hour but coming up President Obama ways in yesterday at the White House on prison reform and Batman black lives matter seriously plus the intergenerational struggle continues there is more MHP

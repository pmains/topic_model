so i had a great drive out of anchorage this morning uh we're about 160 miles up the park's highway we call denali the great one um obviously for for good reasons it's probably as spectacular of you as as you'll ever see this is the number one thing that people want to see when they come to alaska they want to see denali to see the extraordinary land that we're blessed to call home but it's just a reminder that we can't access this extraordinary place without good decent infrastructure whether it's the roads or the bridges we saw the train coming through people who want to get into the park this is a little bit challenged because we have significant repairs that we need to do to that that road and so people are not going to be able to access all the way through the parks fortunately we were able to insert significant funding to to help with the repair of that road so we can get that park road open to tourists so those people who come up from the outside or those of us that are born and raised here and just want to be in our national parks that we're able to to access again an extraordinary extraordinary opportunity with this mountain and and what she holds within the park so infrastructure probably as significant as anything i've done legislatively to help alaska not only with with our tourism but with our economy and just really the quality of life [Music]

this is a story of America it's a story of heroes it's a story of monumental achievement it's the story of rich struggle and great progress our nation was founded by fearlessness and unshakable results its union was restored at Gettysburg Antietam and Bull Run the story of our nation is one that stood up to fascism and then with uncanny bravery defeated it America's Betsy Ross and Martin Luther King jr. America is Rosa Parks and Neil Armstrong 14 of my West Point classmates gave their lives to defend this nation and to ensure that each of us would have their part in the story of America regardless of race religion or creative we are all Americans first and our best days are yet to come what unites us is color red white and blue I'm Leslie hunt and I approve this message

welcome back everybody look up here in washington this month um the uh the new hotness is basically uh trying to get texas to uh become a centralized energy grid just like everybody else uh democrats hate independence they're really not a big fan of it they don't like you to be independent they don't like your state to be independent they want you connected to to the borg um for you star trekies out there and uh um so look that's the big conversation there's like multiple hearings on what happened in texas and having aircut up here and answer questions to the federal government which is kind of strange in itself right there should definitely be a lot of hearings in texas there already have been and some very serious conversations about what needs to change and there are some things that need to change around the edges and i have a lot of ideas on that and i think you've heard those ideas on previous podcasts and we'll talk about some of them today but what the democrats really want is to regulate texas under ferc ferc is ferc the federal energy regulatory commission and so the big question is would it have improved the situation in texas if ferc had been in charge right because none of these power outages none of these rolling blackouts none of these problems ever happen anywhere else in the united states only in texas right um not sure that's right so i wanted to have an expert who knows ferc inside and out neil chatterjee is our guest today he's the former chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission so we might know a thing or two the chairman under uh trump prior to that uh served as an advisor to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell cocaine mitch where he played an integral role in the passage of major energy highway and agricultural legislation okay he could keep going on his bio he knows his stuff um neil thanks so much for being back on the show you're a repeat offender thanks for having me back so um and you're you're still on ferc right so how exactly does that change as administrations change so uh i still serve on a on as a commissioner uh still have a vote still have the ability to uh to influence the agenda big distinction between being chair and being a commissioner is i no longer get to set the agenda that said uh one vote out of five uh i can still be impactful and uh intend to stay and uh be constructive and make sure that um we build on the uh the good work that we did the the past four years heading into the future so yeah and i want to get to the politics of ferc um in the second half of this but but first let's just dive right into texas um and and answer that fundamental question in broad terms uh would texas have been better off if if ferc had been regulating it versus the the state regulation look you've already got people uh calling for texas to interconnect to uh come under ferc jurisdiction and i think it's way too premature to jump to a conclusion like that i think we need to really dig in and examine the root cause of what happened here uh why it happened what were the factors that contributed to what was a genuine humanitarian crisis and uh once we make that determination then figure out a path forward you noted uh at the start that while we had this cold weather event in texas this isn't the only time even this year that the grid was challenged we saw this past summer in california where extreme heat and wildfires led to similar challenges to their grid um they are connected uh to their neighbors in the west and uh due to the fact that their neighbors were going through similar extreme heat events uh the connectivity connectivity uh didn't necessarily help them in their instance and so we just need to do a a careful thoughtful analysis uh before we jump to a conclusion as to uh what happened with ercot being connected and also with ercot's market design uh there's a lot to examine here yeah and that seems when we talk about changes there are some there are some changes to eric market design that are being proposed that um there seems to be some consensus on um but but first i want to kind of just still dig into the arguments being made on why and why ercot should be connected and it seems to me the biggest one is well if it was connected then you could buy energy from louisiana and oklahoma and new mexico um and import it in but you know you can't do that because you're you're not connected and um but but last time i checked you know they were down too um they lost a bunch of power too so it didn't seem like there was any energy to buy so again um these are complex dynamics that we need to understand it texas the reason that ercot and texas uh have have been successful to date is because you know texas is sheer size you've got the population that uh drives demand and then you've got abundant resources to meet that demand and so the the texas only uh grid has has had its successes and has had benefits to texans what are some of those well sorry go ahead well sure no i mean look yeah what are the pros and cons i mean it's not obviously just perfect um so like what are the pros and cons and and how do you explain to somebody who just has no clue about electrical grids how texas is different what this even means to have your own grid so i think uh in terms of of texas and its structure ercot has been able to design a market that has been effective for texans for consumers uh and for reliability um and uh you know uh clearly something went wrong here uh this cold weather event should have been anticipated there was a uh event about a decade ago ferc and nerc did a report making some recommendations on things that texas could do to prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future um perhaps all those things weren't followed through on and people are pointing to that as a reason that there ought to be federal jurisdiction let's see you know some people are making the case where you know there should have been investments in winterization and those investments weren't made well was that the the sole cause of what happened here or were there other elements that contributed to this uh there's also some merit to uh interconnecting look interconnected grid stronger interconnections do create a stronger grid uh and if taxes were connected to the rest of the grid the connell continental u.s or it could even be better connected to mexico that you know may have played a role in this but until we understand the root cause i'm not ready to come out and say that it's time for texas to uh to connect to the grid and ultimately that will be a decision that texans make and i think they'll make that decision based on the facts and the evidence and the analysis uh of this crisis yeah and like i mean it's even if it was true that like hey ferc said you know you might winterize and and texas was like ah it's really never that cold here so we didn't win our eyes that alone is such a weak argument for for an entirely different structure um and you know people also leave out the fact that if you were just if you were to all of a sudden say okay ferc regulates you now interconnect between um other states it's not like you just flip a switch right you have to build billions of dollars worth of transmission lines because that connection is very physical in nature and and it would involve and implicate markets uh could be some benefits there you know at ferc we've always permitted regional solutions and approaches and texas would have some flexibility but it would be a very very complex undertaking and again i just think that and this happens in the aftermath of a calamity like this yeah people want action action well and they want to view it through their particular lens and so if you're for expanded for jurisdiction you want you know ferc to certain jurisdiction here if you are uh opposed to a particular fuel source pick your poison everybody failed across the board here yeah and uh you're seeing different people say well this is because gas wellheads froze or cold piles bros or a nuclear plant got tripped offline or windmills weren't able to deliver because they were freezing up uh i think everyone needs to calm down take a step back allow the experts to dig in and figure out what went wrong here and uh and then make a determination on what to do from there i just uh i i get nervous when people start proposing solutions before we even have gotten to the root cause of what went wrong that's fair i mean we've been investigating this for a while um i think we've got a there's i think there's a growing consensus on root causes and like many complex situations it's a whole number of things and look in policy there's trade-offs there are no real solutions they're only trade-offs that's why i ask like it obviously if it was obviously better for every state to have its own energy grid then every state would have its own energy grid but there's pros and cons um and it is certainly not clear to me that um not every not every state has taxes population exactly and natural resources exactly and you know and like i said like all energy sources failed to to an extent they didn't all fail equally um we're going to read uh michael schellenberger's tweet just from a little bit ago the capacity factors for nuclear natural gas coal and wind during the cold staff or 79 55 58 and 14 respectively so yes everything failed but you know the lesson you learn but you almost have no renewables and you don't even expect renewables in situations like this um which should kind of give people pause like in any and now it's getting to you know take a step back and you know what is what does a properly run grid look like and it's it's we're obviously not doing it right in texas but the question is what is going wrong and how do you fix it and um it would seem to me that if i'm looking at at what kind of energy has been added to the grid or what kind of um generation let's say has been added to the grid over time large large increase in renewables almost no increase in base load power baseload being defined as gas coal and nuclear things that you can make work all the time now obviously not everything worked all the time here but based on those percentage numbers that i just read um these thermal these uh thermal generations thermal generation power sources uh still perform a heck of a lot better than renewables right you and even on a normal day sometimes there's just no wind and sun so that's just a fact of renewables so you always have to have at least and disagree with this if you want but don't you always have to have at least 100 percent of maybe at least average demand and so maybe 130 percent of average demand that is capable of being switched on just like that if you want people to have power all the time would that be an accurate thing to say if you're if you're planning a grid i mean it's very complicated a lot goes on at ercot and in the respective other rtos to just make sure that demand and supply are exactly even on the us grid supply and demand are exactly equal when the grid's frequency is that 60 hertz so the market operators not only you're speaking in uh different languages now for the audience i'm getting into the weeds here bit but tell us what you because i've heard that before from other experts we talked about the frequency when the frequency starts to jump up and down it caused it it caused uh power generators to actually trip so power plants tripped and they turned off and that was a problem so i think the frequency thing that you're talking about is actually pretty important but very important mark it out i try to make it as easily digestible as possible market operators they're not only clearing energy supply every five minutes but they also rely on generators to provide something that we call ancillary services this is something like frequency response and uh regulation to ensure on a moment by moment basis that the frequency remains at or near that 60 hertz and the system is balanced so the easiest way to say to digest what i just said the grid is constantly monitored in the grid operators extremely technologically advanced control rooms to maintain this equilibrium and when it comes to ericot it's been hailed as one of the most efficient in maintaining that equilibrium making sure that the supply and demand are met perfectly you're not you're not putting too much energy into the grid at any one time or you know say too many electrons onto the grid at any one time um and you know we have a pricing mechanism that that does that um and it it it does it doesn't mean we have lower than average uh energy prices or electricity prices as well in texas uh so there are again there's some benefits but you know as i dive into this really deeply it's this pricing structure that we have the formula that is used to create the price it is largely affected by probabilities okay so probability that your generation will work at any given time now when you're talking about gas coal and nuclear that probability is 100 right unless there's a once in a century freeze okay then decreases but it's generally at about 100 percent that probability for wind and solar varies dramatically which causes dramatic price variations those price variations absolutely benefit renewables wind and solar to the detriment of other base load power sources gas colon nuclear the the reason being is average pricing and the that at the time and the price point at which any given generation can make a profit so this is this helps explain why we haven't seen a lot of investment in new power plants in texas power plants meaning gas nuclear and coal um and the question is how sustainable is that given our population growth that was a complicated point but you know well uh there's there's a couple of factors here so um secretary perry actually raised this issue back in the fall of 2017 and the department of energy proposed a rule at ferc uh to basically compensate power plants for their attribute of having on-site fuel and that proceeding didn't meet legal muster and was actually uh with three republican uh commissioners including myself we voted it down five to zero but we opened a new proceeding to look at these questions around grid resilience uh i was frustrated we had that docket open for a couple of years uh there was a lot of meaningful work and input that went into it uh we couldn't get consensus to move forward with it during my time as chair but i still thought there was value in the docket we actually a couple of weeks ago voted for one to close the docket i dissented uh and and in my separate statement what i wrote was essentially that you know this isn't about politics this isn't about trying to favor one fuel source over another that there are real serious questions that need to be examined here the new chairman opened a week later opened a new docket to uh examine the the challenges being posed by climate change on the grid that's actually the same concept that we were looking at um when i framed it up as as an examination and grid resilience and so i'm hopeful to take to import the record that we built in that original resilience proceeding into this new dialogue it's a worthwhile conversation that we are having that we need to have that secretary perry started it got unfortunately politicized if we take the politics out of it and and calmly and rationally examine these questions on how the grid needs to be designed to withstand these kind of events in the future um i think it's a very very important uh inquiry to to to focus on to the latter part of your question about pricing and the urcot model this is actually something that we are focusing on right now as we speak um on capacity markets in the eastern rtos in each of those rtos tell us what an rto is yeah so regional air cots basically right that's a different electric wave okay it's a good way to explain it um so in those regions we recognize that the energy and ancillary service markets revenues were not high enough to provide the revenues needed for competitive and and for the needed generation to remain operational and so in those regions we approve something called a capacity market that serves the basic function of ensuring resource adequacy that right you're you're you're paying enough resources to meet demand it's like an insurance policy uh if you will you're paying a power plant merely to exist to be able to be ready to give you power when you say turn on to meet demand on the peak day of the year with a reserve margin added and uh by providing that additional source of revenue to generators it addresses this this missing money concern that i just described from the energy and ancillary services markets these markets pay generators to be available in case they are needed in addition to paying them for uh for generating electricity in ercot they chose a different path rather than setting up a capacity market ercot developed something called shortage pricing which basically means when the market is stressed in real time they produce extremely high energy prices that will be able to attract investment in generation and negate the need for any capacity markets this was always viewed by economists as the most efficient and elegant solution but i gotta say the the the cold weather event might have changed a lot of mines here including my own i i'm not saying that texas requires a capacity market that has the same design as some of the markets we have on the east coast uh indeed if texas were to adopt a capacity market it may look a lot different but i i'm thinking some forward price signal may be needed here it's it's been talked about a lot um and we're the only we're the only state that doesn't have it we're the only ones um now in practice this means we're probably we probably have one of the greenest you know when it comes to carbon emissions and emphasis on a renewable we probably have one of the greenest i guess structures out there um you know we're if i look at a graph right now that we have planned capacity being added right now we have barely any reserve capacity it's a really big problem less than 10 percent we're getting up to almost 30 percent in the next five years but where's that reserve capacity come from entirely from wind entirely that's not reserved capacity because you can't just turn it on if you want it you can hope that it's on but it's but it's a hope um and um you know i think wind on average operates at about 18 in texas about 18 percent of its total capacity um or maybe it's 18 it's giving to the grid at any given time um i think it's actually on average maybe perhaps less than it's even less than that on total capacity these are complicated terms but they but they matter um yeah and so the question is do we add that capacity fee would raise prices on the average a little bit i mean yeah it's sometimes you have these price spikes in texas and other other data i've seen these price spikes are getting longer um which is which is a problem and maybe an indication that we're we just don't have that that base load to just to get the price back down quickly a lot of people are worried by the way about their their personal electricity prices that month skyrocketing um we you shouldn't worry about that too much first of all not that many residents are on i think i've i've heard and i stand to be corrected if so but about 99 of people are not on this variable pricing mechanism that's usually for big industrial people who use a ton of energy and are monitoring it all the time so they like the variable spikes because on average they end up cheaper and so they're talking about average prices but for a household you can't afford a thousand dollar bill all of a sudden that's just not how we're so so you but but households pay a fixed a fixed rate so it's important for people to know that and um the state of texas is making sure that people aren't going to be slapped with these bills um and we're working through that people should just understand that i think yeah i know there's been some conversation uh about repricing and re-running the market um having like a a cap uh uh in some areas i think uh i believe the governor weighed in with the legislature on this yesterday and uh i think there's no doubt about it that it that these issues are going to be lingering for a while just to put it in perspective you can't reprice right i mean i've i've that would have been you'd have to rerun the market and that's obviously a pretty contentious thing to do but some folks have called for it um yeah it's like it's like if you reprice milk is everybody gonna go back to their grocery store and get a get a return for it you know i mean because that's basically what you're talking about you can't do electricity yeah it's not milk it's a different commodity um but to put in perspective for for folks in texas and and and other uh of your viewers listeners in this podcast we recently voted out orders tied to the california energy crisis in the early 2000s uh i was joking around with my nine-year-old daughter the other day that if she follows in daddy's footsteps and is the first commissioner in the future she may be voting on cases tied to this uh this issue in texas it is going to take years and years to sort this out yeah um what about uh other states so so tell us um like so in california they have rolling blackouts um not not doing well ferc does uh regulate california ferc did regulate ohio new york in 2003 something happened in ohio caused blackouts in new york so i mean clearly this happens but like what are the underlying reasons behind these things happening let's focus on on california because again from from my re we've been diving into this constantly for the last few weeks and it almost seemed to me like texas took too many lessons from california um as far as changing where we rely on the unreliables for our energy sources which is fine on maybe normal times but something puts us out of the norm and we're screwed so but but but walk us through is are the what are the problems in california and how are they getting fixed yeah so the majority of recent outages in california have been caused by wildfires and heat related weather events uh specifically this past summer california had a significant heat wave that caused load shed for i believe a couple of nights when solar output decreased and before wind output kicked in so for california it appears that the system was designed to meet the peak demand but not the net peak demand which in layman's terms means that the system likely needed to better account for the output of intermittent resources like wind and solar which are really important part of the resource mix but also the the reserve margin meaning the amount of available excess power supply on the system to meet unexpected events uh was arguably too low uh and so in california you had a situation where i think they they retired some assets and the balancing resources weren't yet ready and available and and that led to uh to their market design challenge right retire assets do you mean gas assets correct so gas show a power plant that uses gas to generate electricity is retired and look you can't there's a floor to this right i mean i think texas is learning this hard lesson california has already been learning this hard lesson there is a ceiling to you know there's a there's an upper limit on how much wind and solar makes sense to build you can keep building it but the reality is is it all goes down at once because wind and sun just aren't consistent and there has to be a floor to how much assets you can retire assets meaning gas coal or nuclear and maybe other you know maybe hydro hydro seems reliable as well i'm really fascinated by the geothermal technology we're seeing and also repurposing of waste waste reformation i think is the right term there's a lot of other reliable sources that are carbon free that are coming online which are really fascinating again i i don't know why for the life of me we don't focus on those instead of saying you know would be better though here's here's a better idea let's manufacture up tons and tons of turbines and solar panels from rare earth minerals in china we'll import them all we will we will lay waste to thousands and thousands of acres just to have intermittent energy because it's clean i don't know man that seems crazy look i i'm all for market-based approaches and solutions to decarbonization uh i think when you have challenges is when uh and we're experiencing this in other regions of the country when state legislatures come in and pick winners and losers amongst fuel sources and offer subsidies to their preferred fuel sources that winds up distorting markets and to me markets function best when uh you have true competition and the uh low-cost resources get dispatched you have capacity markets to ensure resource adequacy with that focus on reliability and uh you know i think if you let the engineers and the economists uh and the market experts kind of oversee these markets they tend to work efficiently it's when we've struggled with this at the commission uh when states start to weigh in with policies that impact markets outside of their own borders uh we've had to make some tough calls here at ferc where we have weighed in in these situations look i'm a conservative i believe fundamentally in states rights and that states ought to be able to make decisions about their their local energy futures but when those state policy decisions are implicating resources in other states uh i thought uh those market distortions need to be addressed and we took some steps at the commission uh to to weigh in there yeah i mean an example being the production tax credits for wind and solar wind and solar get hundreds of times more subsidies than say nuclear another carbon-free power source that is also reliable um and so you know the question is one distinction there that's a that's a federal tax credit right uh i'm talking uh uh about when state level tax credits or subsidies uh start distorting markets because so does california do that too how much different some of these states have really robust credits for their preferred resources and the difference when you have state credits versus a federal credit federal credit is applied everywhere when state a subsidizes a resource that inhibits state d's generators from uh being dispatched uh you know to me that that is an outcome that merits uh you know uh yeah you got something to say about that um yeah i mean look in texas is what i'm told at 22 per unit of energy gas turns off they're just like we're not we can't make a profit under this so once it goes once this price goes below that we're we're done we turn our plant off now then now they have to build gas plants that can turn off and on which means you have a less efficient gas plant ideally a power plant just stays on and hums nuclear can't turn off so sometimes they just operate at a loss coal kind of can write but it takes a while to to spin it back up um wind can operate at negative twenty dollars because of these subsidies that's just the federal subsidies i don't think we have state subsidies in texas so but again our pricing mechanisms are a form of a subsidy to to renewables makes it a you know a more attractive investment which is why you see over the next few years everything new getting built is going to be wind and as our demand continues to creep up because of course it will because we have um more people moving to texas then where we i i can watch this on a graph that's been done by by some analytics that i've seen um we're getting to this point where our base load power again that the stuff that you can turn on right away won't meet that demand and uh so that's a huge risk i mean it's a huge i can't even believe that we would and now i have faith that the texas legislature is talking about this and i think um you know switching up some some incentives around and i think a scalpel is necessary for the changes i definitely don't think a hammer is i've also heard great ideas maybe respond to this is um we probably talked about this last time but you know there's a lot of flaring that goes on in the permian in the permian basin um use that natural gas use the natural gas um from processing plants and uh put that into a pipeline and um and use it i mean wouldn't that wouldn't that make sense as well it's about that's much easier than building an entirely new plant yeah look i mean one of the interesting challenges that you guys are having in texas i was down in austin i guess in december and it was amazing to see you guys are picking california's pocket every day uh and and you're you're having all these businesses move out of california coming and establishing uh headquarters and a foothold in texas has been obviously clearly very invigorating for the uh for the local economy in texas but these folks are bringing their policies with them from california to texas and i just was amused by that it's like you're fleeing california because of the tax and regulatory environment there coming to texas but then you get situated in texas and you start to incorporate the policies and push for the policies that caused you to leave california in the first place uh i was amused by that whole paradigm yeah and i i hope in reality it doesn't play out that way um i think a lot of you know let's there's more republicans in california than any other state so we'll give them that um unclear how they want to vote when they get here um well respond to what i just said because the other problem the fer ferc regulates the building of pipelines too right that is correct so the thing the democrats seem to hate the most this is pretty clear from biden's first executive orders is pipelines they hate pipelines they just i mean it's like it's like trump and pipelines like these are the things the democrats fear the most it seems like to me uh even though pipelines are a safer more uh a cleaner way to transport oil and gas so you know this is a confusing um policy debate for me i don't know why you know canceling keystone offers zero benefits to the environment that that that oil is getting transported one way or another just gonna be on uh thousands and thousands of trucks what is it like every every 20 miles of pipeline keeps like like thousands there's a crazy number like thousands of trucks off the road uh rail also uh so um but are we gonna you know over the next few years let's because i just offered a pretty good solution right it would actually reduce carbon emissions drastically because flaring um you know you're just wasting the gas uh well that's a carbon emission so when we capture it and use it so we would reduce carbon emissions and have more reliable power sources seems like a win-win but will this administration's ferc even let us build pipelines what's going what's going to happen so i'm in negotiations uh with the new chairman of the leadership of the commission uh and i'm cautiously optimistic that there's going to be a path forward here because we got to have it um taking a step back uh markets have delivered great results for the american consumer for the economy and for the environment we are continually reducing carbon emissions in the u.s power sector because of these market forces and for all of the excitement uh uh legitimately around the business case for clean energy going forward it has all been built on the back of gas and gas infrastructure and the reality is we are going to need this critical energy infrastructure uh going forward and it's untenable to think that this commission would not approve any new certificate applications for gas infrastructure the question will be what changes to the approach the commission has taken the last few years will be necessary to garner the support uh to approve a pipeline um there are some legitimate concerns uh brought up by landowners by conservative landowners who uh have you know have have deep concerns about the use of eminent domain to come through their properties to cite a pipeline obviously there are questions around the greenhouse gas emissions associated with a pipeline um uh there's uh new questions emerging about you know what communities pipelines pass through these are all things that we're going to have to debate and and wrestle with i'm supportive of the approach the commission took under my leadership in evaluating and approving pipelines but i'm also cognizant that elections have consequences i mentioned early on the one big difference between the chair of the commission and the commissioner is the ability to set the agenda if the chairman of the commission is not in favor of moving forward with the pipeline application even if a majority of the commission supports moving forward the chairman does not have to schedule that pipeline for a vote and so the reality is i'm going to have to work with the new leadership of the commission on potential compromises that can move some of this infrastructure forward but we're going to need it and so i i want to be in the breach having that conversation one other thing that i think is being lost in this whole conversation around pipelines and pipeline permitting uh you talk to anyone in the energy space and they are all in agreement that in order to accelerate the deployment of renewables and and really expand clean energy use in this country we need transmission lines we're gonna have to have transmission uh lines long-haul transmission lines that are there that can bring the resources from sparsely populated areas where the wind blows and the sun shines to where the demand centers are well if we take a bunch of steps to add red tape and bureaucratic obstacles to the siding of pipelines uh those are going to apply to the build out of transmission lines as well and so it'll be very interesting to see how these two uniform goals making pipeline construction uh you know more compliant with some of these policy shifts how how's that going to line up with the stated goal of building out a much more robust transmission network um these things can't occur in a vacuum and i think people need to take a step back and understand that if you put up a bunch of obstacles to pipelines those same obstacles are gonna are gonna pop up to transmission lines yeah um that's true you're gonna remind me of the other reason that i'm often a little down on wind and solar um as a forcing function right it's like build it where it makes economic sense um and don't over subsidize it but if you're like look we got to get it all from wind and solar well then you got to put all that wind and solar kind of out in the middle of nowhere which means you got to invest in a lot of materials and construction to build the transmission lines to get it to where you need to get it and you can't really do that that efficiently you lose power for every mile of transmission lines that's a physical fact so um anyway you know this is why i'm always more bullish on nuclear and trying to make the argument for it and and some of those other power zero carbon generation mechanisms that i talked about um the oh here's a simple question maybe it's a simple question uh so why doesn't ferc vote on the keystone pipeline why does biden just get to cancel it i don't think people understand that so we approve uh natural gas pipelines uh oil we set uh rates terms and conditions for oil pipelines uh but we don't actually uh have uh uh the the ability to prove oil pipelines and here again because you're crossing a border there's a state department role to play ironically looking back during my tenure in the senate one of the bills that we kicked around circa 2012-2013 was a bill to to give ferc authority to examine keystone uh and you know uh at the time trying to marshal the 60 votes in the senate to get it through even when we had the majority uh uh we thought we might have a shot at it and that might be something that president obama could have signed uh i it could have been an elegant way to give him cover to have ferc approve it and take it out of his hands but we uh we couldn't uh we couldn't get the votes for the legislation yeah it's strange to me that a president has that much power over a given is it just international pipelines is that what it is there's a lot of dynamics with keystone you had a court case that that uh out in montana that that put up obstacles but ultimately at the end of the day i think it is that state department role that um empowers the secretary of state and the administration that they have the ultimate saying it's just frustrating because it's not like they made a cost-benefit argument they didn't even try i mean it was just like we don't like it that was basically the reasoning i mean because if they did try to make a cost-benefit argument it'd be impossible like i said that that oil gets that oil gets transported either way um and uh it's or it's going to uh less clean kind of production in china as opposed to the united states it um it's just it's just frustrating to have these debates because they do not have the facts on their side or the science and um but they like to scream listen to the science it's very frustrating um all right what else would we have what are we missing um before we wrap up anything look there's a lot happening in the uh in the energy space right now and i think a lot of it is going to zero in on texas i was commenting to someone the other day that i saw a local news reporter in maryland here talking about ercot as if it was like common terminology uh it's become a battle cry for the left like we just i guess they left love's control it's a very strange psychological disposition but it's it's it's a truth reliability is boring until it's not and uh unfortunately uh uh we're gonna be spending a lot of time or fortunately we need to but uh there's gonna be a lot of time uh and focus spent on uh on examining uh what went wrong here and and legitimately trying to make sure it doesn't happen again in the future yeah yeah and you've done a good job evading a lot of my questions and i think you know more than you're willing to let on but you're not but you're on the commission so fine fine neil i'll let it go uh because a lot of these questions have been answered and many i think we have we're painting a very good picture of of what happened and what is needed but you know the final report isn't out yet and i will say i remember you like very forcefully saying in the beginning of all this basically everybody shut up like nobody knows anything just shut the hell up and that's you know what that maybe we need i use a different word than hell but yeah yeah yeah but it's like it's that's uh we need more of that in policy debates just like look a lot a lot of passion not a lot of knowledge okay and don't substitute the two don't conflate the two they're different um you know we need we need a little less a little a little less of that a little more of what you're saying um just a you know a sober look at the facts and then make an argument make an argument you might still disagree but at least you're making arguments as a as opposed to just emotional outbursts which seems to be uh very prevalent in our politics today so neil i second that appreciate you man thanks for coming on and uh thanks for the work you do thank you for everything you do uh for your service to our country and uh i i love this podcast and uh it's the best thanks for having me back on this side some people say it's the best um that's why they give it listen to my buddy josh holmes on the ruthless podcast i got to give him a plug he's he's killing it over there okay i'll go listen to that one have you given this one five stars yeah definitely that was a lie i can tell i just interrogate people for a living you know come

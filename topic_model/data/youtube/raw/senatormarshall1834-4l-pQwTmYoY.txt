Mr Speaker I rise today to call upon all members of Congress to stand beside Israel and semitism ethnic hatred and Prejudice driven boycotts whether at home abroad and certainly from members of this chamber we as a country cannot tolerate this behavior and certainly this chamber has no room for bigotry furthermore I must warn the general public that despite the warranted outcry we saw in response to the representative from Minnesota's irresponsible comments that this is the new normal for the liberal base in America to be clear anti-semitism has become an all too common occurrence in politics among the Democrat base and the far left who see Israel as nothing more than an extension of phantom corruption and colonialism politicians who appeal this type of ignorance are simply shoring up a new Democratic constituency that is the ethos that as Prime the Minnesota represented as ludicrous and insulting accusation a bought and paid for politicians who stand with Israel it is that type of loose cheap anti-semitic rhetoric that led to the rise of the Third Reich it scre to all of us there are a couple of new colleagues across the aisle that need to be reminded in fact they need to admit that the brutal regime of Iran continues to be the chief obstacle to peace and security in the Middle East and that's the root of most all terrorism that threats our homeland for decades Iran's funding of terrorism and extremist groups in the region has fueled violent civil war and bloodshed the Iranian parliament literally burned the US flag on their Parliament floor and chants death to Israel death to America in their streets at home all Americans must oppose the radical and xenophobic boycott divestment and sanctions movements which are promulgated by the left this BDS campaign is peddled by intellectually dishonoured anti-semites whose sole purpose is to attack Israel attempting to delegitimize and isolate it from the rest of the world prefer this congressional body with ties to the BDS movement should renounce them immediately we must hold our elected officials accountable whether on Twitter the halls of Congress or discussing insinuations and bigotry must be condemned in all forms those who continue the use of anti-semitic rhetoric should be held accountable for their actions the Democrats should hold the high standards and the high bar that the Republican leader has taken when it comes to a committee assignments to those who make bigoted remarks America must continue to stand together in support of Israel and support a peace in the Middle East and the world we must build upon our unbreakable reliance our unbreakable alliance with Israel and overcome the challenges that become with a building a better safer world mr. speaker

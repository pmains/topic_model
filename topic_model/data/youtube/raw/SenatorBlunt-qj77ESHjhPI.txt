mr president i want to talk about the portion of the bill that we have made available to our colleagues in the country this week after lots of input from our colleagues on the labor health and human services and education part of the bills about 25 of the bill almost 250 billion dollars and that money would be used to get us back uh on the track toward vaccines that work toward treatments that work to provide additional resources for testing for treatment for care to get us back to school to get us back to work to get us back to child care these are all things that are critical for our economy to return and for families to return in the way they want to and for those things to work the way we would want them to work is our colleagues senator alexander put it very succinctly all things run through testing if you're going to go back to school if you're going to go back to work if you're going to go back to child care if you're going to be in a nursing home between now and the time we have a vaccine tests that are easy to take and quickly respond a test that you can take and in 10 or 12 or 15 minutes have the answer will make all the difference and we continue to push for that in this bill in fact they're about nine billion dollars in a fund that maybe should have been designated a little more specifically but it hasn't been spent it was designed to be a testing fund and that with another 16 billion dollars makes testing available for those priorities for nursing homes are in that state federal partnership we say in this bill that a priority for the federal government in that partnership is tests that work in nursing homes tests at work and child care centers test at work elementary and secondary education test at work in colleges and universities that allow people to get back into those situations in a residential campus to know that you're there and you have a way not only to test people quickly but get an answer quickly frankly mr president president trump is right when he says the current testing the way it has been working uh really doesn't do much but measure how many people had the disease not even how many people necessarily have the disease but how many people had the disease if you have a test and you don't get an answer for five or six or seven days what good did it really do you to take the test certainly didn't do you much good in terms of not infecting others because you don't know that you've got it particularly if you're that high percentage of people that don't have symptoms but are still able to spread the disease that's why mr president a test that would give you an answer in 15 minutes makes all the difference in the world you're on a college campus you take that test in 15 minutes you've got the answer and if the answer is you have this then your next place to go is somewhere where you're by yourself and i think almost every campus that's returning to residential campus living is setting aside some of their dorm space some campuses all their dorm space is single student dorm rooms but in every campus that i've talked to some rooms are set aside just so that student has a place to go if you show up at the at the nursing home as a worker and in 15 minutes you find out you have kovid you the last place you need to be is that nursing home but if you don't know for five or seven days whether you had covert or not really doesn't help out very much and so i i think what the president has said on testing makes a lot of sense but doesn't mean the tests aren't good it just means we need better tests and we have put a lot of money and effort behind those tests i think the national institute of health will be announcing some tests we're moving forward with that do just what i suggested sometime in the next few days put another 26 billion dollars toward vaccine my our colleague senator danes has been very helpful in looking at this organization called barta that was designed a decade ago to be able to respond to a pandemic and never has really been effectively used in my view in that way but this time we are using it and intend to continue to use it to form those partnerships with the private sector early on to begin to produce a vaccine even when we don't know absolutely for sure it's going to be fda approved but do know if it is fda approved we want it as soon as it can possibly be available and if it's not fda approved it never gets used but if it is fda approved mr president the difference in a vaccine that's available january the 15th and a vaccine that's available may the 15th is worth of loss if it doesn't work out if that means let's say you went forward with five of these and three of them worked and you've got vaccines maybe 300 million doses on january the 15th and you had to destroy a couple hundred million doses that because that didn't get through the full safety requirement all the difference in the world lives saved the economy restored and we're moving forward with that and putting another 26 billion dollars behind that we also have language in in our bill uh that requires an effort that was announced yesterday which is for a group of scientific ethicists to start talking about what the priorities should be for that vaccine when we have it who should get it first what our priorities should be how do we distribute this in a way that seems fair and equitable how do we distribute this in a way that somebody who can't get in the car and drive 100 miles to a doctor and pay for a shot has the same chance to get the vaccine as somebody who could do all of those things our bill requires that all of our discussions on this bill plus our public discussions in a hearing a month ago have said we want the administration to have a plan as to how to distribute this vaccine before you have the vaccine everybody thinks we might have vaccine available by the end of this year early next year no reason to wait for that to happen to have a plan i'd like to see a plan on october 1 and i told the chief of staff of the president that again yesterday this bill provides money to be sure that people who go to places like community health centers are going to have a community health center that can respond to what they need 7.6 billion dollars to community health centers another 25 billion dollars to care to providers that lost income which is almost every provider during the last several months as our hospitals and our doctors in our surges centers and other places were told here's what we want you to do we want you to stop your income we want you to stop all the elective uh things you could possibly stop and at the same time we want you to be ready for the greatest health care crisis your facility would ever meet so fully engaged in spending money and being ready to meet a crisis but trying to stop income that you would normally have we're trying to do what we can not to exceed income they would have normally had but to replace some of that income also money for rural clinics that would step up and do that senator capito and senator collins particularly vigorous in being sure we had the money we needed for people who have mental health challenges many of which have gotten worse during this isolation period and this job loss period and this somebody or you and your family are sick period and the opioid deaths the substance abuse deaths have gone back up for the first time in about three years and that's totally logical when you think about it have this headed in in another direction you've got a support system working that keeps you from returning to that habit uh that dependency and then suddenly by yourself and maybe you're not only by yourself but maybe you're by yourself and you've lost your job maybe you're by yourself and your mother's on sick with covid and you can't see your mom or dad or somebody in your family and you're thinking i wonder surely i could do that thing that made me feel so good just one time and not be addicted but we know it doesn't work that way our nation continues to face challenges and in those challenges we've asked the national institute of health to look one more time more closely at people's underlying conditions that might make them more endangered by covid19 see what's happened with minorities with pregnant women with children to begin to drill down and figure out what we can do bipartisan priorities should include school as i've said before frankly need to include child care if you're going to get america back to work you're going to have to have a child care system that works and that's not going to happen on its own you know about half of our child care facilities have closed since the 1st of march the other half that have been open have struggled trying to stay open many have benefited from the ppp program but at the same time when they stay open or others reopen social distancing reluctance of people to send their kids back to a place where there are lots of other kids probably no more than 50 occupancy not going to make up for that by doubling the amount that families are paying for child care so you need to make up with that with the kind of grants and assistance that are in this bill getting students back to school getting people back to work getting child care facilities to work and senator ernst who was just on the floor and senator loffler have both been big advocates of what we need to do to make child care a priority school needs to reopen safely based on state and local criteria this bill includes money for schools to do that that elementary and secondary schools about 70 billion dollars we're exactly frankly we're a little bit ahead of where the house was in the heroes act now if you get into bidding war with the house you're never going to win a bidding war but if you get into a realistic discussion only 90 days ago or so 60 days ago the house thought they needed a hundred billion dollars to reopen schools we suggest 105 billion i read in some report they then decided well maybe it was 400 billion if the senate was willing to spend 105 billion we should be able to figure this out and figure this out quickly with some of that money being available only if you go back to school in person and some of it available if you go back to school as others will do virtually depending on again their situations locally we're ready to move forward uh answers to these important questions are in this bill i look forward to talking about it to not only our democrat colleagues in the senate but our colleagues in the house and mr president with that ideal the floor

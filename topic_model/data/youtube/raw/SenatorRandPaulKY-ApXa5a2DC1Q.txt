[Laughter] thank you thank you it's good to be in adair county where apparently we still stand for the pledge and we're allowed to have a prayer in a public space how about that i've had good news and bad news from washington the good news is we're no longer going to be sending stimulus checks to dead people now you laugh but we sent 1.1 million dead people checks last summer over a billion dollars so i introduced a bill and it's not easy to pass a bill but sometimes if it's non-controversial like stopping checks to dead people sometimes it can get through unanimously so i went to the floor and we were getting it through getting it through actually a democrat got on board and we had bipartisanship for our change and we were going forward the bill and this other senator was coming to the floor he was going to object we still don't know why but he never showed up and he never showed up and so the democrat people on the floor were saying to the democrat senator that was with me they're saying you have to object he says i'm not going to object to my own bill i'm not going to object to sending you know eliminating the sending of checks to dead people since i won't do it so there was no one there and it actually passed so it passed the senate but then this guy comes running through the door of this senator from another state and says stop stop i object but he was too late it was actually kind of comical but he then blocked it in the house and so it didn't pass so the good news is it finally did pass we're no longer going to do it but it's going to take your federal government three years to figure out how not to send checks to dead people they said it's complicated and they said i wouldn't understand and i said well i do understand i understand incompetence when i see it and that's what it is incompetence it's going to take them three years to figure out how not to send checks to dead people how are things going as far as the virus i think you can tell things are doing better i saw a statistic this morning 85 percent of people over 65 have been vaccinated that's pretty darn good and people say oh well 15 haven't well it's like 85 percent have that's good news one of the things i think we could do and i've been advocating for is i think your local doctor ought to be allowed to have the vaccine think about it if you're a little hesitant you say i'm not so sure about taking the vaccine but your family doctor had it you might maybe talk to them and have a conversation if you've been going to them for 20 or 30 years in bowling green one of the big medical clinics still has no vaccine from their doctors you can get at cvs or walgreens which is fine i'm for that so more people can get it quicker but i think also if you're hesitant getting it from your local doctor a few more people would get it i think that when we look at this though we need to look at this and use our ability to think and that we're all off not the same boat the young kids here are not the same as people over 80. if you say they're all the same people are going to quit listening to you particularly the young people because you're lying to them we should be honest this is a disease with primarily not entirely but almost all the deaths came from people after a certain age 65 and over you can probably say 90 of the disease the other interesting thing they haven't been telling you is it's not only age it's also weight really isn't a race predilection the media gets into that oh it affects different races it affects people who weigh different amounts and so people are overweight have a tougher time with this people struggle i know of a young man who was only 41 who got it and he got sicker and sicker and sicker didn't go to the hospital and he ended up on a ventilator for nine days and he survived but he was overweight and that was his number one risk factor 41 is not a risk factor but being overweight is but here's another thing that dr fauci won't tell you because he's too busy telling you a lot of nonsense but he won't tell you this which is very good advice if you get covered or if someone in your family gets coven and they're either overweight or over a certain age probably over 40 and overweight probably together when you begin to cough everybody knows what a bronchitis is like if you've had the flu and you have that sort of dry cough it's in your lungs at that point you need to get treated before rather than later why because they have a treatment president trump got it chris christie got it and so did giuliani they got it within 24 hours it's called monoclonal antibodies they've made these antibodies in an artificial way that react to the virus remember they talked about taking antibodies from people that had the infection and giving it to people that kind of worked but you kind of it's complicated it does is it isn't as easy now they can manufacture those antibodies so they have antibodies to the virus it's like taking an antibiotic and it kills off quite a bit of virus and you don't get it as bad um i have a family member i had metastatic cancer she got covid and she has almost no immune system and she survived by getting the monoclonal antibodies but this is something that's important because there's a window of time if you wait too long and you're too sick you can't get the monoclonal antibodies and they don't work so that's one bit of advice public service announcement that if you know somebody gets sick and they're beginning to cough and get a little worse don't wait till they're on death's door get them in and you there is a treatment that we can get them now as far as the regulations and what we do and how we treat this i'm a big believer that in a free country each individual makes their own mind up so there's some so there's some people have masks on and some people don't it's up to the individual and each individual has different risk factors and so they should make their decision accordingly and i think that's a good thing there's also a difference between young and old there's a difference between your you know body mass etc there's a lot of differences between individuals and so i think we make those decisions and so with a vaccine i'm for it but i would persuade you and not command that you take it it's a persuasion you can accept it or reject it but i would persuade you it's sort of like church goes if i were governor as opposed to the current governor i probably would have said if you're overweight and over a certain age i probably wouldn't be in a closed setting for a long period of time when the disease was rampant there was no vaccine i think disease is on the decline and i think it's reasonable to start gathering again but i would not command that you not go to church i would not command that you close your schools down this is wrong and at every turn the courts have rebuked our governor and i want to thank senator wise rachel and senator wise and the state legislature for saying to the governor that you can't close our churches you can't close our schools and really any of these emergency edicts should be reviewed by the state legislature think about the checks and balances congress doesn't have all the power president doesn't have all the power the judiciary doesn't you have these checks and balances but we have a problem and i think this is another problem i don't know where senator wise is on this but i think we need to allow the legislature the power to call themselves back into session he's given a thumbs up on that think about it this way when the when the kings of old would dissolve parliament they dissolved parliaments they could have all the power and then parliament they would prevent parliament from convening we've done it by law in kentucky the legislature cannot convene except for at designated times so the governor last march started making all these edicts you can't go to church you can't go to church school he said you couldn't travel outside the state you know he had mandatory quarantine he had all these rules that really i don't think he had the power to do it the legislature in the 90s gave him emergency powers and these emergency powers were like you know if a tornado hit your community this week i'm all for the national guard bringing in blankets and water and food that's an emergency but saying you can't go to a restaurant or you can't go to a church or you can't go to a hotel or a bowling alley or a gym or hair salon is something that no one individual should be able to make that decision why because one individual might be wrong and they might not represent you very well but if it has to go through the legislature as well at least there's some check and balance to that i would object to the legislature closing everything down too but there would be a check and a balance so they came back in session and they voted on restrictions and their restrictions said that basically after 30 days the the edicts of the governor telling you what to do expire unless approved by the legislature so what did the governor do he immediately sued the state legislature in court and he's arguing this he's arguing that he has inherent powers i guess from god god anointed him somehow and he has these powers that aren't in the constitution but they're inherent and they are his powers and he can tell you what to do no matter what the state legislature he's trying to strike down a law of the state legislature that simply modified the emergency powers that the state legislature gave him this should be laughed out of court but they've already had a liberal judge in frankfurt that's given an injunction so while i think the law the none of his edicts have any power of law because the state legislature hasn't approved them he says they still do even though the law says they don't so they're fighting this out in court and this is going to happen in june i think this will be the most important legal case of our lifetime but i'm fearful about which way they go but i'm also here to tell you that the supreme court is an elected position we've elected these people and four of them will be up in november of 2022 and you need to watch this carefully because if the court rules or they vote that the state legislature cannot check the power of the governor that is a recipe for unlimited power you know you hear on all the television channels they were calling donald trump an authoritarian hogwash this would be authoritarianism this would be allowing a governor and i don't care which party they're in i'm not for a republican or a democrat having the power to make the rules for your entire life with no check and balance between the state legislature but this is going to go before the supreme court in june this is a big deal and it is about your freedoms and people say well gosh isn't it unwise and wasn't it unwise last year to be 80 year olds in a church for two hours my suggestion to you would be not to do it wear mask don't do it be spread out maybe be outside but i would not command that so there's a difference between an edict from government and persuasion there's no reason we can't have common sense and agree to some common sense things but we cannot have the government dictating when and where you can go to church as far as where are we going as a country i'm very very concerned about how much debt we're piling on maybe eight trillion seven to eight trillion dollars in the month of month of march this

hi this is Congress will look tomorrow notice the blame Boz thanks for joining us this week we're just comment this week on the Supreme Court decision with regards to Obamacare it's kind of a mixed bag but generally we the people lost today the good things in the bill or that the mandate with regards to the Commerce Clause was struck down meaning that you can't be forced to buy our good or service under the Commerce Clause there were with some clarification with regards to states rights and what the government couldn't could not do with regards to opposing some of their restrictions on the States but by and large most of the decision came down to redefining the mandate in the bill as a text rather than a enforcement of a law or provision under the Commerce Clause and so by empowering the IRS to be out here and force you to do something even in activity which is kind of as a whole unique concept from standpoint that in the past you were taxed when you did something you purchase something whenever you made money now you're going to be taxed or ahead of the bill to be taxed anyway if you don't do something if you don't purchase insurance if you don't do something and you can take this to the nth degree if you don't buy a soda if you don't lose weight if you don't act a certain way and it can go so far as if you don't go to the right church you don't believe the right beliefs because suddenly now the government can tell you basically what to do what to think I think as I said earlier it's a bad day for our country for freedom it's bad policy it's bad law doesn't mean the Supreme Court's right thing to get it wrong I think that then the day you know we as a Congress we as a people we're going to stand up and push back on this decision and rectified the way we need to which is to repeal and replace the entire law so with that thanks for joining us this week we've got a lot of those things going on this week and next week as well with regards to so the things going with fast and furious we're going to contempt of Congress built this afternoon now we have a highway bill with been lumped together with student loans and flood insurance all the people are gone today so today is a busy day and stay tuned any questions you have any of these issues in this state to give us a call there's a lot of confusion around some of the issues and they're more than happy to have our staff or myself to softly clear the fog of whatever this misunderstanding or maybe about what's going on so again thanks for joining us look forward seeing you next week take care

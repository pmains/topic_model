good morning everybody my name is yousuf shamu i'm the vice provost for research for rice university uh welcome welcome this morning it is a great is my great privilege to welcome congressman dan crenshaw to rice university today for the third annual healthcare innovation summit congressman crenshaw has been a tireless supporter for the translation of biomedical research from the bench top to the bedside his passion for advanced and effective medical innovation stems from his own personal experiences as a young man dan's leadership in healthcare on the energy inc on the energy and commerce committee is critical to our vision for making houston a leading biomedical innovation hub today you will see examples of companies bringing the best ideas from places like the texas medical center directly to the improvement of patient care new technologies and therapies are drivers for improved health care look no further than the latest generation of mrna vaccines that have blunted the rise of covid19 in our nation these revolutionary technologies did not happen overnight or in a few months but were the result of years of tireless biomedical innovation in private companies big and small and in universities and national laboratories and there is so much potential yet within the texas medical center that we have not tapped yet with the construction of the houston innovation district in midtown and the tmc3 just south of our current location we are poised to become the nation's leading biomedical innovation and commercialization center i think that all the pieces are coming into place but we have a long way to go and that is why the support of congressman crenshaw city leaders the mayor and all the partners in the texas medical center including the academic partners like rice university and the university of houston are so important together we can build a biomedical innovation ecosystem that can take the best ideas from across the street and further equip our doctors and health care professionals in saving lives and improving the quality of life not only are new treatments and medicines critical for the well-being of our people they are critical to the well-being of our city and its economy the development of a robust biomedical ecosystem will produce new small businesses and train the next generation of health care workers in cutting-edge technologies we will build a sustainable future and a beautifully expert workforce to serve it we know houston is the energy capital of the world with the world's largest medical center and the dynamism of our city we are primed to be an accelerator for medical care and innovation as well i see no reason why houston could not be for medicine what we are for energy it's really up to us the pieces are coming into place and i'm very optimistic about our future we have such potential in this city that i think is yet to be really tapped into and built in a way that helps not just not just houston and texas but the united states and the world in general so thank you very much welcome to rice university congressman crenshaw it's a pleasure to have you here [Applause] great thank you yousef thank you all uh welcome again to rice we want to give you a double welcome this is actually the first uh large event we've had here since uh the world shut down uh in 2020 so thank you for coming it's so good to actually see three-dimensional faces so i am glad that you all are here my job is very easy i just want to introduce congressman crenshaw the last time we actually got together was for the healthcare summit in february 2020. so this is a great kickoff for us to come back physically so please join me in welcoming congressman dan [Applause] crenshaw well thank you both paul and dr shamu for that kind introduction uh your team at rice university is great and thank you for hosting us once again thank you all for for showing up today really appreciate it we'll have we'll have a good program for you promise you that so this is the third annual healthcare innovation summit and it's great to see um all of you here again and i can't wait to introduce you to some incredible people who are working on innovation in healthcare and here in america and for the third year in a row we're here to celebrate something inherent to our country spirit to discover innovate and create last year when we held this summit at the end of february the world was about to change completely global pandemic was already making its way around the world and while we were here celebrating the kind of healthcare innovation that is only possible here in america little did we know that we would be relying on that very innovation in the months to come to save american lives and livelihoods operation warp speed present spearheaded by the trump administration was a game changer we took the arduous drug approval process that normally takes a decade before a vaccine comes to market and we streamlined it with amazing unprecedented success without compromising safety or efficacy we were able to produce multiple vaccines in less than 12 months and i see we have here deputy secretary hargan and i know he was a big part of that as well so thank you deputy secretary at hhs by the way thank you dr hargan um the united states actually had 400 companies working on treatments and potential cures for the coronavirus and 354 of those companies are small biotech startups who rarely get credit for the effort they regularly pour into developing the next generation of cures here in the united states america was alone in this regard the only other country that came close to matching american innovation was china with 46 different companies working on a treatment or cure and because of american innovators in operation warp speed we are well on our way to the end of the pandemic and a return to normalcy all this underscores a broader point that has been a priority for me in congress we must protect the free enterprise system an ecosystem that serves as the incubator for healthcare innovation without it american companies would not have had the framework much less the incentive to develop a vaccine in record time now many rightfully bemoan the rising costs of drugs and health care in general unfortunately that frustration and that emotion leads to careless and emotional policy ideas which would upend the ecosystem in which innovation thrives price controls and a government takeover of our health care system would drive innovation out of america and probably into the welcoming arms of china we produce fewer treatments not just for once in a lifetime pandemics but for cancer and alzheimer's and the countless diseases people around the world are living with it'd be fewer doctors fewer clinics and therefore longer wait times and diminished quality of care this doesn't mean we can't agree on the end goals we need to lower the cost of drugs and people need access to quality care regardless of their socioeconomic status or we differ strongly as the how so how do we get there what is the vision for how health care should work in america what are the policies we need to enact to achieve that vision so i'm going to lay out a vision today i'm going to test it on you guys and we're going to call it the patient and power empowerment plan not settled on that name yet again you can you can like give me feedback on that if you want patient empowerment plan patient empowerment vision but the point is patient empowerment first and foremost we need to empower people empowerment means choice which means competition results of dignity in owning your own choices in health care this leads to the second goal lowering costs and the only forces that lower costs while still improving upon quality are market forces choice competition patent protection and of course price transparency because a patient can't be empowered to make a choice if they don't know what things cost so this fundamental truth about market forces is a hard reality and it's one that medicare for all advocates refuse to acknowledge third healthcare needs to be modern personalized and agile should be able to facetime your doctor use a simple app to choose a primary care physician in your area and find an insurance plan that actually fits your needs these are some guiding principles it's not the plan yet so how do we get there what is the plan first we need to put health care dollars in the pockets of patients not the federal government when people are hungry okay we like that so when people are hungry or in poverty they can't afford food we don't tell them go to the grocery store pick out whatever you want the cashier will build some third party and you don't know how much it costs that would be a really weird way to deliver food but we all agree that people need food we should agree that people need health care so we don't give the money money the government to decide how to feed people to produce it and distribute it give people the money in the form of a voucher a food stamp and they can spend the on the food that suits their needs the needs of their families the same should be true for health care a safety net that also utilizes market forces to empower the patient you must empower them financially instead of subsidizing insurance plans through obamacare committing to endless and unsustainable spending on medicaid we should transition to a different kind of premium support model wherein uninsured patients who can't afford increasingly expensive plans are directly subsidized through their health savings accounts getting there is not easy i said it very simply but getting there is not easy but it's about time we lay out a simple goal so that we at least know what the end goal is and where we're trying to get to so that's so that's it now one of the first concrete steps i believe is empowerment in the primary care space your primary care physician is your health care quarterback but not enough people feel like they have a real relationship with a doctor so that's why i'm pushing for legislation to vastly expand the direct primary care system and model the idea is pretty simple you should have a simple and affordable monthly fee for a primary care doctor without extra charges for visits and without third party insurance you're gonna get a lot more detail on this later in the program so this is exactly what americans want in their health care control over their health decisions with a trusted doctor of their choice this model is already successful here in texas and it's time to accelerate that growth by simply allowing people to use their health savings accounts for direct primary care for at need communities my bill gives states the flexibility to provide direct primary care to low-income medicaid recipients and to address the shortage of direct primary care in rural areas my bill allows for national loan repayment programs to be available for direct primary care clinics in areas with a shortage of primary care providers another concrete step regarding drug prices to lower costs especially at the pharmacy counter we need to increase competition and close the loopholes that some companies use to game the system so i helped introduce a lower cost more cures act that's hr 19. this bipartisan bill encourages innovation promotes affordability of cures and stops pharmaceutical companies from engaging in unfair uncompetitive practices among many provisions is prohibiting the pay for delay agreements for instance that pharmaceutical companies often strike with generic competitors to prevent lower cost alternatives from entering the market it creates the first ever cap on out-of-pocket expenses in medicare part d and a monthly cap for medicare beneficiaries with high drug costs to help evenly distribute expenses across the year among many other things it also engages in price transparency and price transparency is crucial to improving our health care system you pull up an app on your phone to choose the lowest cost flight option hotel room or dinner reservation and i want healthcare to be treated the same way these are just a few of the ideas a long list of solutions that are required to reach our ultimate vision to empower the patient but at the heart of our nation's health care solutions will be innovation so we're here about today innovation is what will ultimately save lives and drive down costs you're going to hear from people today who embody that spirit of healthcare innovation you're going to hear from people like daniel powell who's developing new ways to treat opioid withdrawal and addiction and people like dr rick doblin who is researching how to use psychedelic therapy to treat drug addiction and ptsd dr glenn davis who's at the forefront of innovation in the direct primary care space and lisa forbes satter who's achieved a breakthrough in treating diabetes using precision medicine all of our guests have devoted themselves to achieving a very simple but profound goal delivering hope to patients because that's ultimately what today is about delivering hope to patients through innovation one patient who is a recipient of that kind of hope kind of hope only american medical innovation and ingenuity can provide was my mom susan crenshaw my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer on october 13 1989 at age 35. doctors at md anderson cancer center told her cancer she had was particularly aggressive and that she would not live beyond five years the kind of diagnosis that would strike the deepest kind of fear in your heart the kind that would make you want to give up my mom was not ready to give up not the kind of woman she was she endured six months of chemo radiation treatments many surgeries and all the while stayed optimistic my mom met with other cancer patients sharing her faith and her strength her experiences battling cancer and caring for our family she felt fulfilled helping others even when facing a terrifying situation herself in three in year three of her battle with cancer her doctor said she needed to stop treatment it was just getting to be too much for her body there was nothing more they could do in 1993 however my mom returned to the hospital her doctors told her there was a new clinical trial a new drug derived from the bark of a pacific u tree that showed some promise the san antonio cancer research center the ut medical health sciences dr peter rabdon was interviewing candidates for phase one trials of the drug called taxateer after initial interview the doctors actually told my mom she didn't meet the protocols and denied her access to the program but dr ravdin amazed at her strength and and that she was showing through cancer treatment at such a late stage applied for an exemption for my mom from the national cancer institute and she would soon be patient number one in the taxol clinical trial the initial results were incredible her tumors shrank at an accelerated rate there were minimal side effects but it wasn't enough my mom susan carol crenshaw she died when i was 10 years old and is the reason i care so much about health care innovation my mom knew that this clinical trial would mean a small extension of her life at best they didn't know how to apply the drug yet she knew that while taxiter would not ultimately save her life her trial would provide doctors like peter ravdin the scientific research they needed to improve the drug and save others tax tier would go on to become one of the most successful cancer treatments saving the lives of countless women diagnosed with breast cancer just like my mother because of people like peter ravton and his dedication to healthcare innovation my family had hope just as so many other families have now and it is in the spirit of my mother that i'm proud to award the susan crenshaw congressional healthcare innovation award every year at this summit we've actually have a video i'd like to play give us a little bit more background about what this award means i lost my mom to cancer when i was 10 years old and you know before she died she was actually patient number one for a brand new treatment called taxateer she didn't make it all right because she you know she was she was part of that first contingent of patients but that that trial and that innovation and that investment that led to countless other cancer drugs that a lot of people now survive because of when i give an award to somebody like i'm gonna do um the award is called the susan carroll crenshaw award and um you know it's it's indicative of the fact that innovation saves lives now i want to recognize some people who've done some amazing things in healthcare and uh we want to reward them and we want to let others talk about what they're doing and and tell the public as we invite everybody tell the public what they're doing i can think of no one more deserving of this award than someone who helped lead our country through the covet 19 pandemic former commissioner of the food and drug administration dr stephen hahn dr han started at the fda in december of 2019 which was a heck of a time to take that new job just uh just a few short weeks he would be in the forefront leading america's response to an unprecedented global pandemic because of dr han merrick was able to unleash the unprecedented power of healthcare innovation to win the battle against covet 19. he's been an advocate for advancing medical innovation throughout his lifelong service in the healthcare space and it is an honor to present him with this award in my mother's name and it's my honor to welcome dr han to the stage right now to accept 2021 susan crenshaw congressional healthcare innovation award right there for you thank you well good morning everyone congressman crenshaw it's really an honor to be here today with you in houston formerly my hometown now consider austin my hometown but uh texas is a great place to be from and it's great to be here and actually it's great to be here with esteemed medical colleagues who are doing such tremendous work and really the topics congressmen that you picked in terms of innovation really uh speak to the issue of why we're here today and congratulations to everyone here it's also great to be at rice university my alma mater and one of the if not one of the best if not the best institutes of higher learning in the world so it's great to be here thank you i also want to shout out to eric my friend deputy secretary hargan who i worked with during operation warps be really tremendous operational and financial support for this really great to see you here um it is quite an honor to receive this award congressman what a tremendous legacy or way to honor your mother's legacy as an oncologist by training i know how courageous cancer patients are and the participation in a cancer drug trial that went on to save so many lives is just indicative of what we're trying to talk about here today and what we need to maintain in this country the importance of innovation and how innovation can improve human health now it's an extraordinary time in both science and medicine every day we are witnessing unprecedented progress against human disease i will argue that it is because of our investments in science and our robust private sector that we are where we are as a country investments in science and medicine are generating new treatments for life-threatening diseases cancer diabetes heart disease and injuries like traumatic head injuries science and hope they go hand in hand being a cancer doctor i know that very well science leads to innovation which leads to hope we can be optimistic about our future and our children's futures when we embrace and support innovation and sustain an environment that allows science and the private sector to flourish i had the privilege of serving this great country as the 24th commissioner of food and drugs now the fda is an agency of more than 17 000 individuals who are dedicated to serving our country fda regulates about 20 of america's gdp spending every year tobacco food medical products drugs devices that's a staggering responsibility ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs medical devices and the food supply in support of america's well-being every day they are true american heroes and i can assure you that they embrace every day this this responsibility and do an outstanding job on behalf of the american people and there is no critical substitute there is no substitute for this critical oversight that ensures that when you go to the grocery store the pharmacy or even when you go to the pet store to buy dog food that you and your family can rest assured knowing the products are safe and effective this high bar of product safety and efficacy set by the fda is the gold standard around the world and it provides the american public with assurance that their health is prioritized and protected now as congressman said when i first started at the fda it was december of 2019 i thought um tobacco and e-cigarettes were going to be the big topic to tackle at the fda and just like most predictions in life that was totally wrong but i established three priorities in my first month for the agency during my tenure and their tenants that i carried throughout my career and intend to continue to carry throughout my career and i'd like to share them with you today the first was to spur and enable innovation and really what that means simply is getting new medical products into the hands of the american people and american pro innovators excuse me american providers as safely and as quickly as possible in other words cutting unnecessary bureaucratic red tape but doing so without compromising the safety and efficacy of those products now when i was at md anderson we used to say cancer never sleeps we have to work really hard for our patients and i see people here in front of me who do that every day and that was true during covet 19. cover 19 and the pandemic wasn't sleeping we had to do our job to make sure that we cut all unnecessary bureaucratic red tape but make sure that we did our job of of safety and efficacy the second priority was to unleash the power of data to make better decisions regarding the safety and efficacy of medical products and congressman your proposal for how to move forward in the healthcare system i absolutely love we can use data to help with that for sure and then finally the third priority was to incorporate the voices of the american consumer and the patient in every decision we made just like medicine what fda does cannot be done in a vacuum this i think is part of the empowerment that the congressman was talking about what of course i didn't realize is that in six weeks after starting at fda covert 19 would come and that would be more important than ever that the fda and american people had innovative data-driven solutions to the problem that faces we hope that a year like 2020 is a once in a lifetime event we remember and honor those who died from coven 19 as well as the heroes in our health care system and heroes in research and development who really worked tirelessly as congressman crenshaw said on behalf of our country and its citizens i'd like to take a moment to talk about the past year not because that this should be about covet 19 but because i think what we did last year as a nation in response to coven 19 highlights the importance of innovation and how that contributes to human health and i have great faith great faith in this great country that this past year will serve as a resource for the future and that our country will emerge stronger and more prepared for that future for the fda the pandemic meant a doubling of our workload overnight with the need to continue all of our regular responsibilities of approving cancer drugs diabetes drugs heart drugs while also prioritizing and expediting medical products to combat the covet 19 pandemic what it did not mean was compromising the safety or efficacy of any product in any way this can be done we showed that it could be done last year and it can be done moving forward two examples stand out uh to me uh from from last year the first is covet 19 tests now there was a lot written in the press et cetera about testing and how long it took but i want to point out a few things it takes months years to normally develop diagnostic tests remember the virus was first identified at the end of january and published now it takes some time to develop those tests but in a very short period of time this country our great private sector in partnership with academia developed covid19 tests and i can tell you that the fda reviewed those applications and within a few days not business days a few days after receiving that those data we approved or authorized the tests that came before us which is a remarkable turnaround time certainly from the private sector in academia but also from our regulatory body and this meant that within a few short months coven 19 tests were available locally to the american public the second is covet 19 vaccines and we all know that story from identification of publication of the gene sequence of the tsar's cov2virus in january to the ultimate authorization in december of two vaccines we're talking about 11 months now the fastest time a vaccine had been developed previously was approximately four years we're talking 11 months now that my friends is astounding we have to thank the scientists in the private sector who found these safe and reliable means to help protect us but that's healthcare innovation at its finest and in my opinion quite honestly it's miraculous today as we carefully navigate our way out of the pandemic we have an ever ever increasing evidence that the covid19 vaccines are the best weapons we have against this enemy and we can see light at the end of the tunnel none of this could have been accomplished without science in the american and global private sectors along with a flexible regulatory approach that maintained the fda gold standard for safety and efficacy now i want to take a moment to thank congressman crenshawn his colleagues and company in congress often derided in congress politicians et cetera but i have to tell you congressman your support of the cares act and operation warp speed i believe will go down in history as one of the most consequential and wise investments of taxpayer money that we've ever seen thank you and very importantly we should also thank the tens of thousands of americans who participated in clinical trials just like congressman crenshaw's mother which generated the data that allowed the fda to safely authorize those medical tools so when you leave here and you talk about science and data and medicine and hope let's talk about the clinical trials we have to perform let's talk about participation in them let's talk about how we generate the data to actually make these advances so the question that i have now is as we stand here today what next so what do i believe are the most important lessons from the kova 19 pandemic and how can we apply those lessons in the future the first is the critical value of a robust and vibrant private sector in healthcare that deploys its resources to perform research and generate data in support of the development of innovative medicines and other products and of course the value of our investments in basic science at great institutions like rice university i believe we would not be standing here today right now face to face three dimensions as i think someone said uh many of us protected against covet 19 through vaccination in the absence of a strong private sector of course aided by basic research given what was accomplished in response to the covet 19 pandemic is there any reason why we can't continue to foster other critical medical innovations in a similar way and i say no hope and science i believe that creating and sustained by creating sustaining an environment that supports science in the private sector we can see more innovation and even faster development cycles think about that faster than 11 months for a vaccine pretty remarkable there's no reason we can't get there i also believe that the fda can continue to play the important role of providing vigorous oversight while fostering private sector innovation we can have both most importantly and this is very important as a former public health official and involved in public health policy there should be an extremely high bar for any government intervention that stifles innovation a second major observation is that in the covet 19 pandemic the most vulnerable among us were the most impacted socially economically and medically by the pandemic this is a stark reminder of the disparities that exist in terms of access to medical care access to innovative medical products and in levels of trust of the health care system it is tragic that those among us who are the most likely to benefit from the innovation in life sciences are also the most hesitant to trust these innovations and have the least access to them it is a moral imperative that we reduce and eliminate these disparities and finally we must rebuild trust in medicine and science that has been eroded in a number of ways over many years i believe that the private sector once again can help us with these problems as we think about ways to reduce and eliminate disparities we should create incentives for the private sector to develop products that are made available to all of us we could for example create a regulatory framework that provides incentives to companies who develop ways to reduce disparities to innovative medicine vaccines and devices and we need to re-examine our delivery systems with an emphasis on improving access after my service at the fda i joined flagship pioneering now many of you don't know flagship pioneering it really is an incredible company that call ourselves an innovation company whose core principle is the use of science and data to develop innovative medical products to transform health care and sustainability i'm really enthusiastic about working on an initiative called preemptive medicine and health security now this is developing ways to create a shield against future threats to our health as well as addressing the burden of chronic health conditions and once again combining science in the private sector to innovate and improve human health i believe that efforts such as the inc can have a profound effect on our country and on our health and for the ability of americans to enjoy every moment of every day in this amazing country unhindered by chronic health conditions or fear of another global pandemic so in closing it is an honor to stand before you today and accept the susan carroll crenshaw crenshaw congressional healthcare innovation award i accept this award on behalf of all of my former colleagues at fda my new colleagues flagship pioneering others in the private sector the frontline healthcare workers who did so much during this pandemic and always in our country and each individual who suffered or lost their life because of covet 19. i ask all of us to work together as one nation under our shared goal of further enabling health care innovation that can transform our lives science and hope science and hope congressman and guest my sincerest thank you [Applause] okay excellent so we're going to run this kind of like a ted talk uh that's the the format of today obviously the chairs are over here we're gonna be sitting with our guests so you guys won't be able to see as well there's plenty of seats we had like 350 signups for this thing but uh you guys are the ones who showed up so thank you all right but uh yeah so i don't know if you'll be able to it's up to you plenty of seats over here um i'm gonna read our first introduction this is a really these are all very impressive um guests so again thank you thank you our guest for being here this is this is gonna be really great so the first one is dr lisa forbes satter at texas children's hospital and she has created a a way to reverse type 1 diabetes through precision medicine advances in healthcare should be moving our system towards personalized modern agile medicine and delivery and these are the innovations that are driving down costs and changing lives for patients one such innovation is this and it's being introduced by lisa forbes satter and um we're going to hear from her right now and her patient travis thank you have you ever posted these on yep yep they sound like they are so dr forbes thank you so much for being with us today this is a huge accomplishment so i'm just going to ask you some very simple questions uh for those in the audience who are or maybe not as familiar with type 1 diabetes can you help us understand this form of diabetes and the challenges and actually treating it sure thank you so much for having me today i think that your your speech the video and dr han's speech set up this talk so nicely just as a personal note i am a breast cancer survivor that benefited from toxic care treatment and precision diagnostics and medicine so i can sit here today with that kind of history and then motivate towards finding those kinds of things for my own patients so thank you so much to your family because i'm here today to help other families because of you and i think we need to pay that forward science and hope perfectly set up so type 1 diabetes is actually driven by a hole in the immune systems the immune system gets a signal and the switch doesn't turn on properly in fact it turns on a bad light so to speak and so then the immune system thinks that the pancreas is a foreign object and starts attacking it so the why does one particular person's immune system start attacking the pancreas is is not quite clear and so for the patients that have type 1 diabetes alone what drove their particular story to develop type 1 diabetes is a big question so what i do is an immunologist because i'm not an endocrinologist i don't specialize in hormones and the pancreas but i specialize in underlying genetic mechanisms of the immune system and i take rare immunologic disease and i learn why the immune system is wrong so i can appreciate how it's supposed to be right so in patients like travis who has a rare immunologic disorder that drives autoimmunity i can pinpoint what the problem is and try and fix it so did you set out actually trying to fix type 1 diabetes because you're an immunologist so how did this treatment come about right so um you know like dr han um he thought he was gonna be doing one thing with his career and then all of a sudden life changed so um reversing travis's type 1 diabetes was actually an unexpected result of using precision medicine to treat his underlying immune disorder so um we kind of borrowed a cancer drug because we from very innovative scientists before us learned what the actual mechanism of his underlying immune problem was it's called stat one gain of function and and it's a rare disease i think there's about 600 people in the world that have been discovered with it thus far so but um staff congratulations thank you yeah right i know he's unique in many ways um and so but underlying when stat works so hard and overworks it drives this bad signal to happen this bad light that's turned on and so we borrowed a cancer drug that works in the same pathway as stat one does to calm it down and to balance it and all of his autoimmune manifestations reversed it was just remarkable because no one had ever published or reported that you could reverse type 1 diabetes the paradigm in the medical community is that once it occurs that's it for life you're insulin dependent for life so we were quite pleased and i have to tell you um travis is actually the one that realized his diabetes was diversed um he was about to start college and i'm going to call you out here travis okay you can supplement the story if you want he was um he said to me his his last visit before he started his freshman year of college dr forbes i don't think i need my insulin anymore and i said oh no no no you might not need as much we might be calming things down but do me this favor you're starting your freshman year i don't want to know what happens it's college earmuffs but don't change anything because i don't want you to end up in an er in a city that i don't know and so he said okay he looked me square in the eye he said no problem and what did you do why did you think that though what was going on that you you thought that you didn't need it curious um when i would take insulin i would just get like super low blood sugars and i am pretty active so um like i just honestly sometimes i just wouldn't take it and i would still get uh low blood sugars and i was like yeah this sucks i don't want to take it pretty simple explanation yeah so that's what he did he got to college and for four months he didn't take it so when i saw him again became a rebel well or the definition of a freshman in college right i promise i'm a good patient he takes his um immune suppression on time i promise so um i i just did his blood work and he was right um he didn't have evidence of type one diabetes so what's the science behind this and and as as best you can approach layman's terms okay well i have a cartoon if if we want to um put it up um things are good for lenses yeah so um what i have done is made um and actually my uh one of my staff dr vargas hernandez actually made this cartoon so i have to give him credit um but what i did is i took the round cell and i kind of opened it up and made it into dimension so briefly when the there if you go to the third okay third slide okay so if you'll see over here in the corner that purple little um bird-like thing we're going to call that the immune stimulus so when the immune system sends out a signal and stimulates something it gets it gets to a receptor and it activates an immune pathway okay so this one's called the jack stat immune pathway stat 1 is essential in the immune system and many other tissues to turn on and off all of our immune responses to covet 19 it is important in viral defense and so one of the sister drugs to what travis takes is actually one of the drugs that dr han's fda committees approved for the anti-inflammatory of of sars cove 2 infections so what happens is jack molecules activate turn on stats they go to the nucleus and they drive any whatever the immune response is rexolitinib which is the small molecule jack inhibitor that we borrowed from the cancer space blocks the jack activation so stat can't really be turned on so what happens in travis's disease is that the stat one gets turned on too much so it drives that overactive immune response causing the autoimmune disease and so what we did is we calmed down the inflammation we balanced out his stat 1 activation so it could do what it needed to do normally but not do turn on those bad lights and it calmed down the inflammation and the immune response to the pancreas and it allowed the pancreas to wake up again that's fascinating i guess the million dollar question then is can it be applied more broadly can it be scaled cost what's next for this so it's really it really is an expensive drug and um and so i think it can be with the right data and the right science be applied more broadly there's one clinical trial in the world with rexella nibs sister drug called baraceniv it's for patients in australia with new onset type 1 diabetes over the age of 18 and it's run by the jdrf in australia that's the only clinical trial available in the world right now for this class of drugs but because of our work here and my collaboration with some very smart endocrinologists across the country we are now crafting the pilot studies that we need to gather the data on patients with stat 1 and another stat gain of function disorder so we can understand again these rare diseases teach us so much we learn what is wrong with the immune system so we can understand how it's supposed to be right and modulate it with drugs that that have been created to target the particular immune pathway i mean a great example um years ago of how this happened was the bubble boy he had no immune system he lived in a bubble he was treated at texas children's nasa made his bubble for tch and for his home um and so we use the innovation here in texas um you know to drive that but what my mentor and the um and the honoree of our of our center for human immunobiology william t shearer did is he learned from david he he learned the underlying reason that david's immune system was wrong and his innovations and the science that he gathered is driving precision medicine and cancer in autoimmune disease and all of those kinds of things so so the precision medicine that are moving forward um awareness of immune disorders like travis is going to give us the opportunity to treat better our autoimmune diseases identify biomarkers so we can screen patients before they develop the diseases hence the importance of expanding a primary care network and innovating to give them the tools that they need to further treat our patients and then apply precision personalized patient-centered medicine to each and every one of these patients that come to us with these disorders so that leads to the question it sounds like it's difficult he said there's only one clinical trial in the world what regulatory barriers do we have that are preventing us from from moving forward this forward with this and scaling it out so i see two main barriers i see the um you know something dr han spoke to is the regulatory barriers to bring innovation to the marketplace and to the patients and to the cost so the first is the barriers when we identify these mechanisms in rare disease and want to start looking at how to treat them we don't have enough patients to power a clinical trial and so we fail at the beginning in our preliminary meetings because it's um it takes a lot of time to get uh the number of patients settle on a number that the fda will then allow us to go forth and gather the data so the nih actually just came out last year with an innovative idea of a basket clinical trial where you treat multiple rare diseases in the same space with one drug and then that way you can power the number of patients so thankfully i think that we're going to be able to do that with the disorders like travis in the coming years and and that will help us in terms of give rare disease another mechanism towards breaking down those regulatory barriers the last thing is the cost a drug like rexolitinib can cost 10 to 25 000 a month insurance co-pays are astronomical so when travis started the drug his insurance company charged him 25 a month and then after two years decided that it was too expensive for them and changes co-pay to 2500 a month well that's vastly lower than 10 000 a month but still like the majority of our patients your constituents cannot afford a drug that's 2500 a month and so what i did is i went to the company and i said and i applied for compassionate use and so they gave me the new version of rexella neb on an individual investigational drug trial for compassionate use and so for the last two years travis has been doing just as well on this new drug and it's free for him but that is an arduous task for every single person who needs an expensive drug to have their physician have to institute a compassionate use trial so we have to be better at understanding how we can do this together and and innovate from a policy uh regulatory and a science perspective and bring all of those things together to the same table because for us that's what makes it work and you know hopefully we'll be able to prove to the rest of the scientific world that these basket clinical trials do work so we can move forward the rare disease space but again it's rare disease that teaches us how things go wrong so then we can treat the underlying mechanisms for type 1 diabetes and i really do believe that then in the next few years given the pace at which recognition is coming especially through invitations like this that my colleagues and i are going to be able to identify some biomarkers that will make it helpful and give the incentive for a broader clinical trial for new onset type 1 diabetes i get calls and emails from parents all over the country and all over the world that have read our article and i have nothing to offer them and so hopefully by trying to break down some of these barriers partnering with our representatives and our private sector and our regulatory agencies we can break down these barriers and maybe have an answer for them in the next coming years well thank you last word travis how do you feel i feel great great man a few words okay all right all right next please welcome to the stage from spark biomedical daniel powell give him a round of applause all right [Applause] so spark biomedical is a texas-based medical device company and developer of an fda approved wearable neurostimulation solution for opioid withdrawal and uh spark is dedicated to further studying and developing solutions for long-term addiction recovery just last week cdc released the opioid overdose death numbers for 2020 and they're not good the death rate increased a staggering 30 percent to a total of 93 000 americans 93 000 lives lost to opiate overdoses and to put that in perspective that's 250 lives lost each day so thank you dr powell for for being here and um and for your innovation so thank you um let's let's start right from the beginning here four out of five people on illicit drugs started with prescription pain medications so in your experience how does a person go from a prescription pain med for a surgery to a drug addiction yeah so what we know is opioids are a very addictive diabolical drug and also miraculous in their ability to heal or ability to leave pain when misprescribed and used chronically they have two simultaneous effects they drive a deep physical dependence meaning you're going to go into withdrawal if you try to stop taking it and they're going to drive tolerance which means you need to take more and more to not go into withdrawal so you get two decades of this and you get four out of five people that are on heroin today started on pain medication so somewhere along the way your doctor cuts you off or you lose your job and you lose insurance and you start to go into painful withdrawal you have no choice but to start to try to find how to alleviate that withdrawal and withdrawal just overrides common thinking it overrides your logic it's fight or flight and so people are really at uh instinctual need to make it stop uh versus the logic of i got to get through this very painful process and your so your device changes that and intervening early on in an opioid withdrawal process so how how does it do that how does it disrupt this process and and why is it so different from other treatments yeah so the body runs on two basic substances it runs on chemicals and electricity and so most pharmaceutical all pharmaceuticals are going to be a chemical based solution where we are an electrical nervous based uh nervous system based solution and so what we've known and and we we build our science on researchers going back 50 60 years or more is that you can stimulate the nervous system to create physiological changes and what we've this has been being explored for years and years we we traced some original auricular ear stimulation back to russia in 1947 with this big device that we are glad we don't have to use today and um even 10 years ago we were i was working in deep brain stimulation for parkinson's so you put a wire in somebody's brain stimulate a very specific part of the brain and and their tremor will stop um we're thankful that we've been able to take this out of the brain not drill a hole in the head not have a very expensive surgery not introduce also more pharmaceuticals with side effects but access the nervous system this way again going to the science but in layman's terms how exactly does that work why does it work yeah i know because it sounds like too good to be true um we stimulate uh two branches of our two different cranial nerve branches so on your ear i'll turn this little divot here is where the trigeminal nerve comes up and inside the ear and that ridge is where the auricular branch of the vagus nerve comes up and when you stimulate both these nerves at specific frequencies you drive two important physiological changes one of those changes is you bring down fight or flight so you take the autonomic system and you do what's called decreased sympathetic tone that's that's that desire to run it's your cave membrane that tells you run from saber-toothed tigers uh just instinctually uh and bring back the calm and so that that takes away the anxiety but really more importantly anybody in withdrawal will tell you that that's been addicted drugs or just physical dependence they literally believe they're gonna die and that's that instinct and so we calm that down remove that portion of that amygdala that we're the lizard brain that's firing and telling you that uh and then the other thing we do is when you're stimulating these nerves you drive endogenous endorphin production so if anybody's ever seen a football player like randy grimes here they get hurt on the field and have a broken finger and they're like it doesn't even hurt that's that's your endogenous endorphins kicking in that's overriding the pain signal and filling the natural opioid receptors in your body so by filling the opioid receptors reducing the cravings reducing the anxiety we can bring somebody out of withdrawal is there like a picture of like what does it look like oh i forgot to click here's the device uh and little ear worn device a little belt worn clip and actually we have a video um so this sounds miraculous we have a video clip of a brave young lady that was in our clinical trial and said she wanted to do a testimonial so if we can run that real quick how long is it while we're waiting for that how long does it take to work i mean what's the how does the patient feel yeah so it um great question so we are able to take somebody in full opioid withdrawal uh that this looks like on the floor in the fetal position running to the bathroom every 15 minutes gastric distress sweating um one hour of stimulation brought 93 of the patients into mild or no withdrawal and then they wore it through uh five to six day detox process which is the typical time it would take to get all up to get through the the worst of withdrawal out of your system and have you been able to study um recidivism on this that's our next study okay so that's our next study and we'll talk about i'll talk about it here in a sec we'll uh [Music] i've been through detoxes before i've been on the taper and i've experienced the pain that it's still like causes and and i experienced this and it is it's completely different because you don't have to worry about waking up in the morning and waiting for your taper and getting sick and like all this stuff like it's already it's already making you feel better like it's already um helping you like physically and mentally was one of the things that i noticed because i didn't feel foggy from all the taper meds like i just felt clear and like talking to the other people around here i'm like they don't feel like as clear as quickly as i felt clear which was really interesting to me when i first came in here i um oh my gosh i was so angry and i wanted to leave i wanted to go home i wanted to get high i remember i told everyone i said i said if i'm not getting meds i'm leaving and i'm getting high and i don't care what you have to say about like i'm going i don't care i don't want to be here and then after like two or three days because i was feeling like so myself again it's i don't know it's so hard to explain because i literally when i'm getting high like i've become a completely different person so um the fact that it worked so quickly and i didn't have to like worry about taking like more drugs to like fix the drugs um sorry um it um i finally like feel like myself again and now i'm like going on to do more treatment which was not the plan originally the plan originally was just to come here um detox um and like after like a couple days of like doing this and just like talking to people and being myself again like i've made like a huge decision to like continue my treatment on to another place um which it's like like my parents are just so like grateful for and um i'm really grateful for so that's pretty strong uh testimonial uh two to three days i mean it just changes your life in two to three days how much does this thing cost uh so we're in the early phases of launching it's about fifteen to fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars for the therapy and how much does how much are we how much is it costing these days to try and treat someone with traditional means yeah oh well it's a thousand to two thousand dollars a day just for the inpatient you know facilities yeah uh the meds are kind of older so they're they're on generics or or they're so they're not outrageous there's care and you know it's a rehab but it's facilitated it's all these things and so you know typically the process is seven days an acute detox and then 21 days in uh outpatient or some kind of facility uh but to really beat addiction you know the the typical talking point is you know get through 90 days if you can make it past the 90 day mark the statistics go way up 50 of patients relapse the first month though post detox well i'm really excited to see what the study on recidivism is then and it sounds just from that testimonial but it's promising okay so why can't insurance companies pay for it so you would think the fact that we did all the testing the clinical trials the r d um that all the proof we've done and the fda accepted it and i think this might have been accepted under dr han's watch so thank you um you would you would think then we're there and but the part of the government the fda that handles approving the safe and effective device and the part of the government that handles reimbursement cms the center for medicare and medicaid services which we use one m for two m's which kind of already shows you earn it up he'll battle how they named it um they have an arduous process and so the first step is a company like us goes to them and says hey will you cover this and they look in their big book of things they cover and they go neuromodulation for opioid withdrawal nope doesn't fit the worst thing that could happen to us is they go no but that looks like a tens device because tens device stimulate the skin we'll reimburse this at a hundred bucks and and then sparks out of business and you can't undo i mean undoing a bad decision is worse than waiting and getting it right so that's step one so then you got to go to congress and go to your local congressman and say hey can can you help us say this should be something that's covered and so then then now it's covered well then you have to get a code so you go and get a unique code and go through the process and all the private insurance insurance carriers inherit cms's codes so if i go to blue cross to blue shield and say hey will you cover this they'll go do you have a code and i say not yet and then they go well we'll throw you in a miscellaneous bucket so every single patient requires a medical letter of necessity and it can be done but it's not fast why do private insurance companies do that you think is it is it a liability issue i think it's organization and consistency if the blues and united and everybody had all their own codes it just would be a mess that's true and so they rely on cms but cms is a government bureaucracy yep and and then they they put they put the owners the the burden on congress but it's not clear to me that that's even what is needed and that it couldn't be solved at cms with a little bit of uh forward thinking and innovation and desire yeah and if if you want to change cms being a startup isn't the one to do it you know the really big johnson and johnson like they could have some influence maybe on cms for us it's you know you you you're dealt the the cards and you just got to play the game so what else what else are you working on um besides this really what's an unbelievable treatment so we have two projects you you mentioned um what what i'll call relapse prevention so long-term uh recovery so wearing our instead of wearing our device for seven days wear it for 90 days not 24 7 but less and less and manage cravings manage we saw reduction in depression scores reduction in ptsd scores uh which is trauma which is at the core of all addiction most of the time and um studying so studying that and really taking this to an addiction recovery product versus a withdrawal relief product our other major initiative is with neonatals so there's 38 000 babies born dependent on opioids every year it's horrible to watch they scream and cry and they're in the nicu for 24 plus days these are babies that are on the state's dollar all day long because their parents don't typically have blue cross blue shield um and so we completed a pilot study of eight babies uh had incredible results were able to get them out of the nicu or at least off of oral morphine 14 days faster instead of 24 days more like 10 days so really good results and both those studies are funded through the nih and so really appreciate we'll talk about parts of the government not working parts that are really good is uh there's something called the heal initiative through the national institute of drug abuse and they have been really helped us move the science forward and fund us so that's been you know for a small company just invaluable and it brings me to being a small company being a small startup uh in a place like houston how does the the houston the texas medical center how does this ecosystem help startup yeah it's it's it is a very rich ecosystem so like i said we have rice uh texas medical center they have a texas medical center has multiple incubators and accelerators that we participated in or joined that community my alma mater texas a m is building a massive new facility here for innovation and medical but amazingly we have all of our r d is being done right here in engineering work through a company called valentium and they manufacture part of the product so you could you can manufacture in america this this is possible it's a good um it's a good news clip yeah so um another company galen data that's right here handles all of our cloud-based solutions cyber security hipaa compliant data transactions fda compliant and then positive recovery centers is actually a large evidence-based chain of recovery centers that will be rolling this out in the metroplex as one of our first places here so it's been really good for us and uh it's been a very positive experience so we've got a couple minutes so actually one last question i mean is is there any hope on the regulatory front seems like you know we laid out the problems with cms uh where are those conversations now so we're hiring lobbyists and we're hiring yeah when i started this i never uh with my two partners we we didn't have our eyesight on that we were focused on science and r d and it's kind of like well now it's a whole new world but this is urgent i mean it's an urgent seems like an urgent need that works and it's there's no reason to think i mean fda already proved it so it seems safe you would you would think this is um a no-brainer you would and i want to you know compliment to you mental health is always the last to be thought of uh carlos turado who is our the physician that ran our clinical trials says psychiatrists are the red-headed step-children of doctors and addiction specialists are the red-headed stepchildren of psychologists uh psychiatrists so um mental health's largely looked over a lot and you actually have 50 of the presenters here uh that are covering this so i that that's unusual and that's fantastic but yeah it's it's looked over because i need a lot of mental health okay thank you so much doctor appreciate it excellent all right so next if i can work my own binder here um from hamilton health box uh dr glenn davis thank you so much for being here i talked about direct primary care earlier give a round of applause please so dr davis is on the forefront of direct primary care as chief medical officer of hamilton health box they've been able to provide low-cost high-quality health care directly to the patient cutting out the middleman you know it's like paying a monthly gym membership so we're gonna hear what that's all about glenn thank you so much for being here thanks for having me dan and great lineup of speakers it's fun to be here thank you yeah well it says says the speaker you know i agree with me i agree i agree uh friends so thank you thank you so much for being here uh dr davis please cause give us an overview i i briefly touched on it in my remarks um give us a little bit more detail on the direct primary care model why is this a game changer why is this the future so direct primary care there's two distinguishing characteristics one is the patient pays a monthly subscription fee and that basically covers all primary care services uh secondly there is no third party billing so the physician never sends a bill to the insurance company for reimbursement the reason it's a game changer is because it creates the easily affordable convenient access to your primary care physician and that's something that any american would want and we can deliver it to you know any socio-economic status that's why it would be a game changer describe the model though so i mean like i said it's kind of like a gym membership but it really i guess it's not that much more complicated than that that's what it is so they pay a monthly subscription fee and that that uh creates this uh easy way to communicate with your doctor whether it's via text or a video or uh any type of email with your physician it creates that relationship with the primary care doctor that's longitudinal instead of just a visit every three to four months and what happened between the visits it's this direct constant communication with your primary care physician and that's what that monthly subscription fee you know allows you to do well and then what's the average you think on on these subscription fees it's usually about 50 to 75 dollars a month that's that's that's pretty cheap people pay more for their um for their cell phone bill um but you know for whatever reason people are just not willing to pay for for health care so trying to expand this is is what i talked about um what's included in that generally so usually it's uh a basic comp uh comprehensive physical so you think an annual physical uh usually basic laboratories for screening or including that and then uh care and management of acute illnesses you know uh upper respiratory infections walking pneumonia sprains strains and and that's where a lot of the value comes from is you know you don't have to go to the urgent care of the emergency room you can text your doctor you can get refills you don't have to make an extra visit for that to happen so that that comprehensive annual physical and then that constant communication for the day-to-day things that happen people get sick people have questions i mean questions yeah i mean where do i go for referrals is another big one like who should i see for this if that's something you can't handle so all that all that administrative burden that was never reimbursed before by an insurance company you know it's part of the subscription fee so the physician can request records communicate with specialists arrange follow-ups so that's the other added value there one reason i think congress should pass this is because members of congress get access to this exact model they might call it direct primary care but that's what the house physician is we pay like uh we pay i think about about that price actually i think per year and um and it's this it's exactly that right it's not insurance but you just get to see the doctor ask them questions you know they can assist you with primary care things and what that leads to is earlier diagnosis of illness so it'll you can treat a high cholesterol instead of a blocked artery so you treat pre-diabetes before it's diabetes and leads to blindness and kidney failure so that's what that relationship builds it prevents uh further costs online because you're you're able to diagnose things earlier and address lifestyle concerns and these are all things that it's not just another pill it's addressing the whole patient talking about their sleep and their activities during the day of their diet and all those things 70 of our health is you know what we eat what we do and so direct primary care physicians you know uniquely suited to fill that role and it's not just with individuals you also contract directly with companies to provide care to all their employees so um you did this with martin's preferred foods yes here in houston so so tell us about the success of that well i'll start with the success and then i'll tell you how we did it so uh the first year that we were there we saved the employer over half a million dollars in health care spend we saved the patients over 60 thousand dollars in co-pays and deductibles and so the way we were able to accomplish that is we put a fully functional micro clinic on site that had we used a lot of virtual technology to leverage that bring the cost down we put a full-time medical assistant on site so she's there eight to five during business hours and then a physician and a physician assistant were available 24 7 for after-hour calls and weekend calls and what we saw was a 30 rise in primary care visits a 40 decrease in emergency room and urgent care visits and so that's and then we were able to you know treat chronic diseases earlier we were able to diagnose uh conditions earlier and that's the kind of success that we've had there change the because again it's not insurance but did it change insurance premiums yeah the company insurance premiums go down as soon as you put a clinic on site insurance premiums for the company goes down because everybody understands if you remove the barrier of access and put a trusted healthcare provider that's that the the patient can go see it it will only improve care and is that is that encompassed in that half a million savings that premium is it is that from premiums or is that just separate that's just separate oh really so it's actually more than probably it's probably more than that okay wow yeah so it's it's it's a and and patients actually feel like they have a doctor yes because it is i mean i think a lot of people are not even sure especially if they'll go to the doctor very often you're like how do i even go about that process i have to call my insurance company or just find how does this work you know it's it's annoying and then they just end up in an emergency room sometimes oh that doesn't happen we have a you know we have a medical assistant and they they are the truly the shepherd for the entire work workforce and they know us you know they know my physician assistant you know i actually physically go down there and see patients at the at the chicken factory so this is this this latest iteration i think we have a video on this i'll do a quick slide and show you what it looks like on the other end but then i can i'm going to video in and show you okay we're going to look at some people's ears and you can see our our our when we do a television it's it's really a virtual visit so let me go get set up over here and this is just uh just a review of what we talked about full-time on-site microclinic you know it's a team we use a lot of telemedicine to help us we take care of a lot of primary and urgent care issues and this is what the console look on the other side the technology in some places we actually put a box and actually it's sound proof and then over here on the left you see what our console looks like and i'll show you what it's and this is we actually have a fully mobile clinic as well it's a fully functional mobile clinic and this is actually where we got the health box from is that's a we can actually pull a fully functional clinic in a in a box and put it in a rural area and we could talk about that more dan about how we can serve patients and then these are just all the iterations of what we're about to see on the other side and then it talks about where the savings come when in network referrals decreased er visits increased generic prescriptions rate we institute a new program where it's free prescription drugs for all our patients and that's really improved compliance decreased er visits obviously decreased sick days i'll see entire families on site parents will bring their children on their lunch hour with their child and i'll see their 12 month old and the patient so less time off work for the patient less time off to go to the pediatrician so we can take care of whole families there and you know obviously increased employee satisfaction so that's that i'm gonna try to log on here real quick and have my pa and we can show you our technology so bear with me for a moment and so we can log on we can log on from anywhere in the uh in the united states basically should come on here in a minute and you can see these are all our clinics and this is one of our worksite clinics and you'll be able to see it's truly a microclinic it's just a and uh tele teledoc recently bought our vendor for our electronic virtual equipment hey danielle i'm live so danielle if you want to show them how you look in the ears so danielle is our physician assistant and rosie's our uh medical assistant and they're going to show you how our equipment works so you can see the kind of it's not just face once we get the equipment we show it's just not face time all right and so this is how i will do a virtual visit you can see here here that's a a normal eardrum obviously it's a lot better on the smaller screen so we can do it like that and then you know we can look at the we can look at the ears and you know we can look at oh you can show the drama scope if you guys want to show the dramatiscope rosie the manoscope so we can also look at and we can listen to heart and lungs obviously the audio audio's not there but we can listen to heart and lungs as well and i'll show you one more just our damascope you can see the resolution on the let's see if that works so we can look at the ears nose and throat and get a really good look um and we can also use the skin and then obviously we have a stethoscope that we can use and it's just like being there in person so it's fascinating and so that allows you as the doctor to see you can utilize pas to do this it's just a much more efficient oh i guess the sound is coming through oh yeah so there's the heartbeat is it normal is she okay yes it's normal she will survive so so this is what we can hear obviously it's better with headphones up but yeah that's her then take a deep breath danielle yeah oh wow that's amazingly good okay thank you guys thank you thank you thank you all right so so that's how we that's incredible yeah [Applause] yeah i wasn't expecting that that that is uh that's unbelievably efficient yes that's great why is it called hamilton what's the story behind the name your name's not hamilton oh my the my my friend who's the ceo and i'm the chief milk officer when we founded the company i just liked the way hamilton sounded that's his last name it's his last name okay don't be hamilton a great guy yeah he was a founder yeah he was the founder about that um so okay what's my next question here how okay well actually i mean we kind of been over this but um i want to dive into this question being a quarterback this is as we mentioned before if a primary care physician is a quarterback for your health for referrals and things like that but you know in in my sort of vision for health care i do see this model as being the first step and the second step is well how do you fix because it's not insurance how do you fix insurance um i like this model because it's that first step it gives you a quarterback to figure out insurance because like even smart people who know a lot about healthcare can't figure out what insurance they should buy it is a very difficult process so maybe explain why it's so important to have a quarterback so the primary care physician is uniquely it's uniquely suited for preventing disease so they are uniquely trained and in a the position to diagnose and treat conditions not only early stage but also help their patient through preventive measures mammograms colonoscopies blood work so that's number one they're uniquely suited for that number two they're uniquely suited for treating acute illnesses like we talked about before bronchitis pneumonia sprains and strains and then the thing that i've discovered i think the most essential part of being a primary care physician is if you've developed that relationship over a long period of time you know your patient you're able to diagnose their conditions better it's just it's just that simple 70 of what we diagnose is by history alone 70 of what a physician diagnosis is by talking to the patient and the primary care physician is uniquely suited for that and that just that that increase in quality and performance just it pays dividends down the road with less complications down the road and he kind of briefly mentioned this you know getting access to vulnerable populations rural communities how does this help yes i mean you can see we can put a box anywhere basically our model has worked best in the blue collar population we have you know hourly wage earners who have very good insurance actually but have never had a chance to use it because they would have to miss three to four hours of work and now it's 30 minutes they'll bring their child to come see me because they don't have to miss work or if they do it's on their lunch hour and that's been one of the the biggest game changers for us and that's really the vulnerable population we serve best and so we've proven our model at the food processing plan worked and we've also had one of our other models of blue cross blue collar situation where we actually take the mobile van out to the work site they're working seven to five they don't have a chance to go to the doctor we will actually take our fully functional mobile unit go out do physicals draw lab work diagnose conditions early treat it before it becomes a problem and they get to know us sometimes we even bring them tacos for lunch so they know we become we develop a very good relationship with them and so that's where it can serve it is that for um when you're contracting with the company though because i mean i think that the it seems like to me that the next the next step would be and you would think that insurance companies would have an incentive on the individual market to reduce premiums for individuals who can prove they have a subscription to a dpc right yes you are correct and we've been actually there's a a couple of statewide institutions have contacted us to to serve their rural population really yeah so we we've already gotten that kind of interest that's good because yeah that seems like the the obvious next it is and um so what's next for hamilton health box working on more of the same one of the other things we've done we've actually put a clinic inside of office building so we have one anchor tenant who who pays for for their employees but then we can go to the smaller companies and offer them a deal if they have 20 or 30 employees say hey just pay us 50 a month and we'll take care of that we'll take care of your primary care needs and also down to the individual the really small companies in the office building we have individuals who treat it like their regular dpc clinic they pay us a 50 a month subscription we do all their primary care needs blood work and the other thing we've been able to do is negotiate imaging prices we can get you know cat scans and x-rays at a very reduced price all right so last question barriers to this model i mean what what are the barriers right now is it just a lack of knowledge about the model regulatory barriers what is it so one barrier on the physician side physicians usually make less money if they do the dpc model but their job satisfaction is much higher because they're doing what they were trained to do take care of patients prevent disease uh the other barrier is sometimes patients do they there there is some hesitation if they have to pay the extra to 50 to 75 dollars because they're i'm already there they think that i'm already paying a premium why do i have to pay extra if you will that's why i like the idea of the hsa it's a perfect perfect uh spend for hsa account would be be able to use that for dpc yeah i mean it seems like the obvious first step right dr glen davis thank you so much excellent doctor my one of my doctors i appreciate it all right um i think this is our last one yes it is so back to the mental health side of things from the multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies dr rick doblin thank you so much for being with us and uh so one of his uh uh somebody who's received such treatment john here um actually uh cornered me in the elevator in uh in my build where we're we live in we have an apartment in the navy yard when we're up in dc and um this is fascinating because he's like hey you need to look into psychedelic research i have this incredible story about it and um i was i was actually just coming from a friend's house i was coming back home that night from a friend's house who was telling me about his ex his marine blown up in afghanistan about a year before i was blown up terrible tbi issues for years and um said that this uh that the psychedelic treatments had changed his life so it was just very strange that i was getting both of these testimonies within the span of of 24 hours so we're going to hear about that today this is this is this is focused on mdma also known as ecstasy so there's a you know that's the connotation here and uh we're going to talk about the stigmas associated with that so seven percent of the us population will experience ptsd at some point in their life as many as 13 percent of combat veterans have the condition in 2018 the va spent 17 17 yeah it's not 1.7 it's 17. 17 billion on disability payments for over 1 million veterans with ptsd um that gets to a whole other problem with how the va codes things but okay but dr doblin and his team are in fda-regulated phase three trials studying how an unlikely source mdma might be able to successfully treat treat it so um dr doblin thanks for being here and so you're using this this therapy recently released a study in nature medicine that showed your treatment is a breathtaking 67 success in curing ptsd so how does that work well first let me say that i started this nonprofit organization 35 years ago and we've received 115 million in donations so it's all privately funded and we have bipartisan support from rebecca mercer from elizabeth koch from the rockefellers the pritzkers the buffetts uh all the way to george soros so we have bipartisan support we've been able to take this keep that to yourself but as far as how how does it work and we're committed to the non-profit public benefit model but how it works the most important thing to realize is that it's therapy first and the therapy is helped by the drug but it's not just here's a pill it'll make you better so to show you what the therapy is it's basically 42 hours of therapy over three and a half months and within that you have three days of eight-hour sessions and this is the design for our phase three studies so you either get um mdma with therapy or you get therapy with an inactive placebo and the first session is 80 milligrams and then the second is usually 120 and the third is 120 but there's a little bit of a negotiation between the therapists and patients if they want to stay at the 80 milligrams and then there's 12 90-minute non-drug psychotherapy sessions so there's three before the first mdma session to prepare people to build the therapeutic alliance to help the therapist understand what the issues are of the patient and then there's three integrative psychotherapy sessions after each experimental day-long experimental session so a total of 12 and then at two months is when we look at the outcome data and compare the two groups so this is the therapy component but then how it works um this is the statistics before the in the control group we have therapy without mdma but these are severe chronic treatment resistant people who unlike many studies in ptsd we enroll people who've previously attempted suicide so a lot of those people are excluded from studies but we feel we have to work with the hardest cases yeah and so [Applause] yeah because if you're doing it just for the easier cases what are you really doing so in phase two you'll see below this was preparing for phase three 23 in the control group no longer had ptsd at the two-month follow-up but in phase three it was 32 percent so what it shows is the therapy can be effective and so if you get randomized to the therapy group it's not that you're getting nothing you're getting some support but it works in 32 of the people but when you add the mdma that's where you get up to 67 at the two-month follow-up two-thirds no longer have ptsd and of the one-third that still has ptsd a lot of them around two-thirds of the the remainder have had what's called clinically significant reduction of ptsd symptoms they still have ptsd but their lives have been improved by a reduction in symptoms and we've done the 12-month follow-up in phase two and showed that people still keep getting better on their own after the treatment is over that's i think the most important thing for insurance coverage it's it's labor intensive at the beginning but if it lasts and durable and people keep getting better then i think we can persuade insurance companies to cover it so just as a brief neuroscience this is the last kind of how does it work we know that ptsd changes your brain if you have trauma that you've struggled with you can't get over it your brain has changed and we've heard before today about the amygdala where fear is processed and you have a hyperactive amygdala so memories of the trauma or sounds or any kind of triggers your hyperactive amygdala and you can't think as clearly because your prefrontal cortex where you think logically can sort things out you've got diminished activity and then in the hippocampus where we store memories into long-term storage there's reduced activity so that the trauma feels like it's always about to keep happening or it's right around the corner it's never really processed into the past and what mdma does is exactly the opposite we've had people in our study said ptsd changed my brain and mdma changed it back and the way that it works is that mdma reduces activity in the amygdala and i think that's the most important point is that these memories that are linked to to fear and emotions like the fight-or-flight that you don't respond in that same way you have a reduced activity in the amygdala and you have increased activity in the prefrontal cortex so you can think logically you have more time to think about what happened and to separate out triggers from this automatic response that it's the trauma but very importantly this connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus is increased with mdma so that these memories that seem like they're always still happening you can finally process them and put them into long-term storage and so that's where it can make durable effects from even a few experiences without daily medication this is only mdma a few times so that that's basically how we think it works why does it work better than other treatments well i think the the first reason is this um it's combined with therapy i think when we look at this idea of here's a medicine to solve your problems you've got a biological problem take this pill you're not really dealing with the full person and you're really not dealing with the issues the core issues so i think it works better because it's combined with therapy it also works better because of this amygdala reduction in activity i think that's a key factor is that these traumatic memories that are overwhelming to people they don't know how to really fully address them and they suppress the symptoms and so these um mdma really makes it so you can focus on the core issues and the other reason that it's better is that it's not a daily medication it's only meant to be given a few times so the side effects that you have from ssris which can be significant for some patients there's very minimal acute side effects during the day that people take the mdma but that fades and so then you're learning how to heal yourself without the drug and i think that's the key part is what we want to do is help people be more independent afterwards without being dependent on a daily drug which is good for farmer profits but that's not what we're after we're after patient outcomes so okay speaking of patients i want to hear what it's like to go through this um haven't experimented with it myself so i actually don't know i'm curious like what is it what does it feel like why is it why are you so different now then one what does it feel like it's honestly you're you're laying there and you have two therapists and you know coming from the military you know don't go to the dock that whole thing plus i was abused as a child and the therapist that the court ordered me to go see actually told my abuser rather than reporting it so i had a very healthy distrust of therapists in general but also you know as rick was saying when you start talking about you know traumatic events you know i got blown up in a porter john in iraq it's one of the crappiest places to get blown up but i didn't choose it so to speak exactly um and i was also a designated marksman with a bear at 50 cal and so when i came back you know i'm glad they accepted people who attempted suicide because within 60 days of returning it i put a gun in my head and pulled the trigger and a manual uh manufacturing issue with the ammunition is the reason i'm alive and i'll tell you my son was 10 years old when i entered the trial after my final suicide attempt and this therapy is entirely the reason that he has a father instead of a folded flag but how does it feel [Applause] it feels like doing therapy while being hugged by everyone in the world who loves you and a bathtub full of puppies licking your face that sounds amazing it it it really is a and and you know i i know there's the connotations of the party drug and all of that but you're going through all the worst trauma in your life but your body's not betraying you you're not having a panic attack you're not freaking out you you don't become over emotional or completely shut your emotions down you're able to stay in the moment and go back to those really bad places and process them but the change is actually it is very you know enduring because i actually went through i took my first mdma dose exactly to the day eight years after i came off active duty from iraq november 22nd 2014. i took my last dose in march of 2015. i haven't done mdma since i've taken it three times in my entire life i haven't felt the need to i also because the universe kind of likes to dump stuff on me uh i had a gentleman drown in the lake behind my house in charleston south carolina i dove in pulled him out did cpr for about 15 to 20 minutes till ems arrived i then about a year later had a gentleman shot yeah he he he died and then a year later i had a gentleman who was shot in the chest in charleston you know rendered it again i can't fix holes in hearts on the side of the road but after talking to the police and rinsing his blood off they're like hey you got to stick around and and wait for the detectives to show up i picked up the phone and i called rick and it's funny because he was actually on the phone with michael mithoffer one of the therapists who did my mdma therapy and rick's like hey john unless it's an emergency i'm on the phone with michael can i call you back in 30 minutes or an hour i'm like dude just got shot he died in my arms he goes hold on let me bring michael on the line and i did a one-hour therapy session waiting for the detectives right there without mdma without anything but i started processing that trauma right then and yeah i went and saw a therapist and and dealt with it and talked about it but you know i don't have i still don't have ptsd and actually both when president trump announced retiree recalls for kovid i actually wrote a letter to the administration asking to be recalled active duty to prove because i was medically retired for ptsd that i am fit to serve i've also sent the same letter to the biden administration um this this is life-changing and if if i'm not i'm not special i like you this doesn't just work for navy seals and stuff like this it works it works for everyone as a matter of fact most of the the participants in our trials actually aren't veterans they're they're victims of of sexual assault um and the reason you hear about veterans mostly is because you know getting blown up isn't as embarrassing as being sexually assaulted so i don't have an issue coming and talking but this is a game changer and it's bigger because it goes back to that core message that you said of hope we are telling people that ptsd is a chronic lifelong mental illness that once acquired as your new normal and it's not it can be healed in 67 of people in four months like a broken bone and i don't know anybody in the military or anywhere else that if they break their leg say no no i'm just gonna hobble along with it for the rest of my life once people understand i mean how many how many navy seals how many operators how many people in the military currently serve with ptsd don't seek treatment because they're terrified of losing their career and all of this when they realize it's like a broken bone they can go do a treatment for four months and continue to serve we're not going to have these problems and it leads to interesting operational problems what happens if you're on a say an obl raid and you have somebody have auditory flashbacks and hear gunfire or helicopters that aren't there the whole mission went south and this is something that can be very very easily integrated into dod va regular healthcare yeah and so well that could listen to the next question what are the barriers there because there's a stigma associated with with psychedelics um look it only came on my radar um about six months ago right you know just right before i met you um and uh so what are the what are the barriers how do you what needs to be solved here what how do you overcome that stigma well that that's a very difficult question i just want to add one thing from what john said is that we had someone from ptsd from vietnam in our studies and was able to get better so this idea that you could be stuck for almost half a century and you can still get out of that kind of pain and trauma so it's it's a real message of hope but as far as what the barriers are part of the issue is going to be how do we get insurance coverage we've heard that before because it doesn't meet all the normal codes it's it's therapy plus drug that's going to be a challenge because it's not the drug treatment one of the main barriers is that we have to train around 25 000 therapists just in the first five years so we have a whole therapist training program the other barrier i'll say is the war on drugs and prohibition because that has led to people thinking yes these are illegal drugs also and they've got no beneficial uses and then there's been a resistance to permitting the research that shows benefits from these illegal drugs for the concern that that will send the wrong message so i think that that's um fortunately it's diminishing the war on drugs is seen as counterproductive violates our liberties and so that's permitting more of this research to take place i think the the other fundamental thing people have to understand is that these drugs they're they're tools they're they're good or bad i mean you could take this drug in a recreational context you can have trauma come up and you could end up feeling worse off if you don't process the trauma and we've had people call us they've taken these drugs in recreational settings they've remembered sexual assault and they were with friends that were just out to party and they didn't want to talk about it and now months later they feel worse so the stuff that they'd sort of buried so that they could accommodate living in the world now it comes to the surface you have to let it out and so i think it's not inherently good mdma is not inherently good it's not inherently bad it's just a tool and how you use it is what determines and if people can understand that and we think that for sure like the surgeons it's about the surgeon's knife i mean the knife is in the hands of a surgeon that's life-saving in the hands of a criminal it's it can be deadly so i think we have to to get that understanding and then the the other barrier for us has been really trying to interest the veterans administration and the department of defense and trying to adopt this and so that's been really slow i started that in nineteen and they gave us a hard no when we try it it doesn't matter i make laws so we can make them do it but um yeah but it but yeah i mean there's resistance obviously and um their their letter of explanation was interesting this is from the dod i think the va might be more open i mean you tell me the va is starting to be more i had this conversation with david shulkin who used to be the head of the va and he was like saying rick you're being so naive you should give this whole thing up the he said the va is designed to squash innovation and i said well it's a government bureaucracy like that it is designed to squash but i told them that this will just be make it more enjoyable for me to eventually when i tell you that the va has adopted it so we're about to start research so as i said i started in 1990 with various va's every five years i try again so we're about to start research at the bronx va with rachel yehuda bob parsons who's a billionaire donor started godaddy he's a vietnam vet and he had ptsd from vietnam that psychedelics helped him to get over and he's talked about this he just gave a 5 million grant to the bronx va back in vietnam they could take psychedelics all the time right because his 60s is that bad joke i don't know well he didn't do it then no actually special operators used a lot of interesting psychedelic symbols when they were deployed to vietnam yeah but but he um he just did a recent in any case we're about also to start in the loma linda va and and we hope to start research here in the houston va would be really good and then one of the other big things that we're trying to do is group therapy and so we're working with researchers at the portland va to try to start a group in portland yes sorry i can't help with these jokes i mean it's and then you're talking about group therapy it sounds like a party well all right well well that's why we want to do it here in houston let's go let's keep it in houston all right let's keep it serious yeah but but i think the other big part is that we've completed um one phase three study and we need to complete the second so there should be an operation warp speed for mental illness but you know but but we don't have that and i think that's where the fda is still um looking at this as this is a illegal drug so far and you know it was actually a therapy drug in the middle 70s to the early 80s and actually it was in dallas where it became ecstasy so are you optimistic though about fda approval oh i'm extremely optimistic yeah extremely optimistic because but then the next barrier as we've learned from other speakers it's um you know it's it's not just uh fda but a cms as well and getting it insured yeah i think that's the big issue and and we're also trying to demonstrate we've done cost effectiveness studies on our phase two data we're updating them with phase three it looks very very cost effective and so i think yeah insurance coverage and then training therapists will be barriers and public education so i think this form that you're having here today is so helpful because it's part of us telling the story so people can it can it it can become destigmatized that's what we need thank you guys so much for coming that was the third time very cool great great round of applause guys thank you um ladies and gentlemen thank you for thank you for bearing with us i think that was some really great presentations um some really amazing speakers and um just an incredible lineup so you should sleep well tonight knowing that uh there are good people trying to solve humanity's problems i think i think that's the entire point of this is is the the hope and science message thank you so much for coming thank you so much for being a part of this great event

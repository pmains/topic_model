as the holidays are approaching and people across the country are looking toward the new year we want all Americans to do so with great optimism Democrats are committed to reigniting the American dream by building ladders of opportunity and tearing down barriers to success for anyone willing to work hard play by the rules and take responsibility we know that fairness prosperity and opportunity are values for all Americans as President Obama has said we are greater together when everyone engages in fair play everyone gets a fair shot everyone does their fair share at kitchen tables across the country families are making difficult choices can we buy toys for our children during the holidays and still afford to pay the bills in January can we put gas in the car and still afford to put food on the table Congress can take action to help those families today by making a firm promise we will not go home for the holidays without extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits these measures put money in the pockets of working families they create jobs and spur our economic growth they strengthen the middle class Republicans should join Democrats at the table to get the job done as one people we must also reaffirm our commitment to giving boys to all Americans not just the privileged few Americans can't wait we must act now today and every day we must work together to make the American dream for all thank you and Happy Holidays

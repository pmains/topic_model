the senator from Indiana mr. president having served in the Navy and as a Marine Corps officer I'm sensitive to the many challenges facing our veterans the VA was established almost 90 years ago so when the VA mission Act was passed it was time for a wide-scale reform to modernize and improve the system I was proud to support and vote for the VA mission Act which was signed into law one year ago this month this new program could dramatically change the way our veterans receive care for the first time veterans can walk into a local ER Junt care clinic like most Americans can as long as it's in network and receive care that day at no cost to them up to three visits per year they can even get a flu shot now at urgent care rather than having to visit the VA for such a simple procedure the VA mission Act is already at work back home in Indiana in fact a Hoosier veteran recently approached me while I was travelling throughout the state and he said there was an appointment he couldn't get scheduled with the VA until August or September now we had this conversation some weeks ago but when the VA mission Act went into effect at the beginning of this month he tried again and he was able to get an appointment right away so I'm sure this is just the first of many positive stories that I'm gonna be hearing as I travel around the states and coming days and even years to come but it's also important that we in Congress listen to those who experience with the VA has not improved if there's a part of this act that isn't working or isn't being implemented as intended then we have to revisit it and we have to work with the VA to get it right removing barriers within the system and in streamlining access to care this is going to help veterans of all eras live happy and healthier lives so that's what matters most I'll continue to fight for the proper care and treatment of our veterans because they deserve nothing less I yield back mr. president

dr roger lauria has spent the last few decades talking with students about his personal experience as a holocaust survivor memories that are still difficult to talk about but that he believes are important to share i didn't speak for 50 years but when here in the us in richmond i saw the burning of the churches and the killing of the vietnamese and the gay people that is the first time i start talking because i have been there and i want to make sure that we don't repeat this and that we don't let this happen again in 2020 congress passed the never again education act a bill co-sponsored by virginia u.s representative abigail spanberger the bill provides 10 million in funding to the united states holocaust memorial museum to ensure better access to holocaust education resources for schools around the country it's incredibly important that all of us remember where lies conspiracies and hate can lead a society and so being active in ensuring that we're remembering that part of our shared history is incredibly important i think it's a way that we honor the victims it's a way that we proactively ensure we never never witness something nearly as tragic or horrible ever again but it's incredibly important that we learn from the past and remember those who who lived it and those who died

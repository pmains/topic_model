I will yell two minutes and my friend from Florida Miss coming the gentlewoman is recognized thank you Mr Speaker I rise today in strong support of H.R 382 the pandemic is overact I want to thank my friend and colleague from Kentucky Mr Brett Guthrie for leading this important effort this action is long overdue this week we are voting on several bills designed to do what we all in America have known for some time that the emergency declaration should be gone away constituents have been asking heck demanding that we end this Perpetual state of covet emergencies in the federal government and get back to normal more than four months ago President Biden declared that the covid-19 pandemic was over yet interestingly the Federal Emergency declaration is still in place it makes you wonder why would the president declare that the pandemic is over but not officially rescind the emergency declaration in fact many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem more concerned with keeping the public health emergency in place rather than addressing the problems we are now being faced with things like investigating the estimated 163 billion with a B in covet unemployment fraud and recovering those funds that were stolen from The American taxpayers or the approximately 150 billion in unobligated funds that's just sitting there for covet that's a pretty easy way to start reducing spending or how about the approximately half a trillion dollars that's been obligated but hasn't been pushed out the door yet ask yourselves who benefits from the emergency declaration remaining in place it is a fact that the continuation of the public health emergency is costing taxpayers billions of dollars and worsening already crippling inflation inflation which is costing Florida families in my district an estimated ten thousand dollars extra a year in basic goods and services I don't know anyone who can afford an extra 10 grand a year the federal mandates like this have increased Private health insurance costs and grossly exacerbated the ever-increasing national debt that will be passed on to my generation our children and our grandchildren it's time to get our kids back to school folks back to work and life back to normal it's time for us to turn the page and end the covid-19 public health emergency Powers let's get back to com Common Sense fixes to our health care System let's get back to work on lowering energy costs let's get back to work and let's get back to work in person I yield

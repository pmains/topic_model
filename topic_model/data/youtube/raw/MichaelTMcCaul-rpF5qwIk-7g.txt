the chairman of the house homeland security committee uh is in san diego this morning he and some other members of his committee are inspecting the border situation for the past three days or so i've been traveling across the southwest border to make a security assessment i've introduced a bill that's commit that's passed out of my committee unanimously in a bipartisan way that calls for all the stakeholders the border shares that the border patrol coast guard the border governors to all come together and the communities and to devise what is the national strategy that we need to have to better secure this border and to get operational control 90 days after that is submitted to the congress we'll have a plan submitted where we can view the capability gaps and then in a responsible way allocate the resources what types of resources and where they need to go your bill requires a plan and the plan will have certain components to it there could be aviation assets could be you know boots on the ground also fencing the technology and such who will actually formulate that plan well this is the beauty of it the strategy will be we have all the stakeholders will have them put into that that that would be the border sheriff's so that's why they endorsed my bill because they have a voice and i'm meeting with them right after this call by the way i want to thank you very much mr chairman and all the congressmen that are here you know for listening to us you know and and this is the the way we need to get things done is by working together you know our ability to you know nine months to come up with a strategy in the plan and two years to get full operational control chief fischer believes he can do that if given the right uh resources you go back to immigration reform i you know i'm just not going to entertain or go down that road so i know that we've got operation control um and i think that's a common sense position i think that's where conservatives are we can't go back to 1986 we granted amnesty uh to illegals and then forgot about the security provisions and i think that's the important lesson that we can't repeat uh today you

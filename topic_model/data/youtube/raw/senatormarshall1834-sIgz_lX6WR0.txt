on our top stories let's begin with a growing crisis at the southern border republican lawmakers are criticizing the current administration's rollback of trump-era border policies they're also calling on president biden to re-restart border wall construction joining us now kansas senator roger marshall who visited the border last month senator thanks for being with us this evening what did you see when you were there well john it's a crisis it's a humanitarian crisis it's a health crisis it's a national security crisis uh we've done humanitarian mission trips across the entire world and this reminds me of a third world country where our where our doctors and nurses our border guard is just overwhelmed by just the mass numbers of people even compared to when this was at its worst three years ago i i would imagine it's four to five times more crowded the conditions are are horrible right now and you know this all goes back to president biden reversing president trump's policies and almost immediately upon president biden's inauguration mexico stopped cooperating and the flood gates are open now simply we're just overwhelmed the border guards are no longer able to do the job that they're supposed to be doing instead those border guard folks are being nurses and moms to the kids and the folks that need help why is it that president biden and vice president harris who after all has been put in charge of the border situation why have why has neither one of them gone down there well that that's a the the great question i i think that they want this situation they want this crisis they've done the political calculus they think it helps their party i guess it simply just it doesn't make sense uh certainly turning their back on the human the humanitarian issue along alone the kids that are being sexually abused human trafficking sold into slavery you know your listeners need to realize that for every person we catch there's two more that are getting through them through the border and those are probably the folks that frankly are the are the terrorists and folks the drug runners those types of people as well chad wolf had some suggestions on what the biden administration should do he of course served in dhs under president trump listen to chad wolfe now if they continue to treat this uh crisis as a capacity issue and continue to build more facilities and throw more and more money at it it's only going to encourage additional numbers of migrants coming across that border so we're in april now so april may june july you're going to continue to see these numbers increase until they start to get serious about enforcement of our laws on that southern border until they start treating the problem does he have a point i mean the biden administration is you know requisitioning hotel rooms and and housing migrants on military bases um it doesn't seem like there is a considered effort to simply try to stop them from crossing the border no this this will actually invite more and and again americans need to realize we're spending fifty to seventy thousand dollars per person coming across that border to shelter them to get them doctors nursing all the all the supplies all the foods that they need as well so this is actually just putting more holes in the dam we've got to fix the dam when i flew along the border it's just so frustrating to see hundreds of miles of wall built but the gates are not in place yet and i've been told by good sources that the federal government is now paying uh the contractors down there forty thousand dollars a day to not work to not finish the job as well so this whatever whatever the solutions are are about it starts with securing our border we need to finish the wall we got to get those gates put in as well we don't want to be inviting more we just simply can't handle any more people right now let's talk a little bit about the president's announcement this week that he's going to be appointing a commission to study the idea of increasing the number of justices packing the supreme court your take on that well look nine is just fine nine is just fine uh this is another example of a power grab and frankly it's hypocritical uh most of the the senators on the democrat side the president himself are pushing this have been against this before but now that they have a chance to pack the court there in favor of it so it's a it's a power grab uh it would be very very bad for this nation right now uh this is not what we need this is but this is part of their far radical agenda that's going on one more example of a power grab hr one having to do with election law that's a power grab that would put democrats in co in control then they stack the court and they control all all the different branches of the government so it would be a sad sad day for america yeah h.r one uh part of the plan would be to grant statehood to washington dc right you grant statehood to d.c you've got two more democratic senators and and certainly a democrat representative in the senate in perpetuity right and we lose the filibuster along with that and we end up with the pac supreme court so the president is setting the stage he ran as a moderate but he's acting like an extreme liberal so whoever's in charge of his policy and it does it doesn't feel like it's him it feels like there's somebody behind the scenes that's just doing this extreme radical policy and this would be part of it let's talk about major league baseball pulling uh the all-star game out of atlanta because of its perceived unfair new voting law um a number of businesses seem fine with that uh delta airlines and and and other coca-cola uh they're also criticizing the new law what's the effect of all that do you think well i i just want to put this in perspective what is the value of getting to vote for the president of the united states once every four years we get to vote for the president at the same time if i was going to go to the major league baseball game or to the all-star game i have to show my id to get those tickets so in comparison of the value don't you think that the value of president voting for the president of the united states has even more more value in that so look i think the super majority of americans want election integrity and want some type of voter id and i think that's what this about and in the in the case of georgia they gave us a safer freer election higher integrity more access to voting it actually probably just raised the bar from from from georgia being maybe 45th in the nation for election to integrity to raise it maybe to to somewhere in the middle to 25th um i'm not sure how this will impact their businesses but i can tell you i'm a huge baseball fan was planning on going to the nationals game here uh next week and i've already had some people cancel on it because of it some of my favorite friends who we we text each other when it's time for pitchers and catchers to report in spring training are telling me we're going to stop following baseball so i think americans will probably find other pastimes to go do it's a sad day um i think people are overreacting we're tired of being canceled i think that's what what we're really just sick of is this just seems hypocritical and we're tired of being canceled i don't mind being woke up on sundays and my pastor kind of saying here's a here's here think about what's going on but we don't like being shook out of bed every day play ball don't worry about the politics there you go senator roger marshall republican of kansas thank you senator thank you

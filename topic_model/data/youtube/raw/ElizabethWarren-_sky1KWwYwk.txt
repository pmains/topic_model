the postal service is a joke 91% of Americans disagree with you and that's Democrats and Republicans the Postal Service is the most popular government agency and it's written right there in the Constitution our founding fathers believed that moving goods and services and ideas shouldn't be limited by what state you live in rural or urban you can receive and send mail at the same price as everyone else inter Louis de Jouy who was just appointed as the next Postmaster General he's basically the Betsy DeVos of the postal service because he donated millions of dollars to Republicans to get the job Republicans have been trying to privatize the postal system for years in 2006 they passed legislation that crippled the Postal Service's finances enter the pandemic the Postal Service expects to lose billions of dollars in revenues because of it but Trump has threatened to veto any stimulus package that includes help for the Postal Service the Postal Service delivered 1.2 billion prescriptions in 2019 it delivers close to a hundred percent of packages from the Veterans Administration and it employs nearly half a million workers this is not a time to further the Postal Service it also delivers absentee ballots now we already know this president is against vote-by-mail I could vote by mail further because I loved you we can't let trump use this pandemic to privatize the postal service or it for his own political gain the postal service is one of our country's greatest accomplishments putting a wealthy donor in charge of it so that he can do Trump's bidding is corruption at its worst I'm fighting to root out corruption but I can't do it alone it's going to take a grassroots movement and that's what we're building together

well Thank You mr. speaker the Trump administration recently made the important decision to release hundreds of thousands of documents in the possession of the CIA which were found in the May 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan these documents reveal a much more intimate relationship between Iran and al-qaeda than what was previously suspected while it will take time to analyze the extent of the four hundred and seventy thousand documents some important conclusions can already be made the Obama administration selectively released 571 of these documents during his term none of which identified this significant relationship between Iran and al-qaeda while President Obama claimed al-qaeda was quote on the path to defeat these documents showcase al Qaeda strategically reorganizing its operational base one of these documents describes Iran as al-qaeda's quote main artery for funds personnel and communications and instructs members to quote refrain from attacking Iran and devote your total resources to the fight against the Crusaders and the apostates on the one hand al Qaeda would publicly declare all Shiites to be apostates on the other hand internal deliberations by the organization called for a transactional relationship with the mullahs of Tehran another finding in a 19 page document written by senior al-qaida operative Abu Hafsah al martini outlines a detailed arrangement between al-qaeda and Iran the relationship between al-qaeda and Iran was based on their mutual hatred of the United States Iran agreed to provide shelter financial support and coordinate efforts with al Qaeda across the region in this document a senior al Qaeda operative confirms that Iran and al-qaeda's quote interests intersect he goes so far as to describe Iranian regime as quote the best example of pragmatism and politics anyone who wants to strike Iran Iran America anyone who wants to strike America Iran is ready to support them with money and arms and all that is required as long as they are not directly and clearly implicated iran offered al-qaeda everything he needed including quote money arms and quote training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon in exchange for attacking US interests in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf al-qaeda operatives were safeguard in Iran with the consent of the Iranian military in fact the 9/11 Commission report confirms that eight of the fourteen hijackers passed through Iran during the period of October of 2000 to February of 2001 Iranian intelligence facilitated the travel of some operatives with visas while sheltering others in these documents there's even a wedding video of bin Laden's son with al-qaeda members in attendance in you guessed it Iran as Sun Tzu famously said in the art of war the enemy of my enemy is my friend we are their shared enemy it is shameful that the Obama administration deliberately withheld this information if these files exposing Iran's outreach an association with al-qaeda had been released support for the Iran nuclear deal would have eroded even further and rightfully so since the jcpoa was entered into Iranian aggression in Middle East including Iraq in Syria and elsewhere it's only increased these bad activities have only gotten worse and now it's even clearer why that is any terrorist group that wants to attack US interests will have Iran's financial and material support by providing Iran with 150 billion in sanctions relief we are giving Iran the resources it needs to carry out its bed activities threatening the United States and our allies while we already know of Iran's close ties with Hezbollah and political influence in Iraq these documents exhibit the extensive reach that Iran has in the region keeping these documents hidden from the general public while the jcpoa was being debated and approved was blatant politicization of intelligence and it was totally reprehensible thankfully the current administration has relieved these documents to let the American public know the truth I commend the CIA director our former colleague here in the house Mike Pompeo who has hit the ground running as the new CIA director and made the bold decision to take these 470 thousand documents and release them for the American public and for the world to see they should have been hidden in the first place they should not have been hidden for so long and now we can know the truth of the relationship that absolutely existed between Iran and al Qaeda I encourage my colleagues to view these documents I encourage the media to view these documents for the American public and the international community and I think again in the administration for their leadership in this very important decision I yield back you

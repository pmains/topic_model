six years ago farmers and ranchers across Kansas faced drought conditions that crippled crops dried ponds and forced livestock owners to abandon pastures and the year since rain has fallen and conditions ever turned to normal but drought conditions at once again struck Kansas leaving many counties across my district dry and worried ranchers in the Flint Hills of Kansas are fighting themselves short of water and grass for their cattle while farmers in central Kansas watch corn and soybean plant shrivel under the unrelenting heat some counties in my district are nearly 15 inches behind normal rainfall totals while many under extreme drought declaration all this on top of low commodity prices and market uncertainty strains operating budgets and pushes farmer suicide rates to more than double that the general population that's right mr. speaker our farmers suicide rates are more than double that of the general population and unfortunately impacts do not stop at the farm gate when production agriculture suffers so the community is our producers call home and the companies that support the agriculture industry the doubt really does impact us all earlier this month I visited the visit Connie and Joe mush Russia's Red Angus ranch in Chase County Kansas they showed me their vacant pastures and dry ponds and mended this drought was one of the worst their family has ever endured they are not alone as I hear stories of farmers and ranchers across the district struggling to find solutions and options for their crops and cattle while I cannot deliver the rain many of us pray for I can't help to bring a level of certainty and support to my farmers and ranchers through final passage of this 2018 farm bill I worked hard alongside my Agriculture Committee colleagues to write and pass legislation that continues crop insurance and conservation programs that help producers operate their farms and ranches more efficiently farmers never want a handout but in trying times like these it's essential that we support those that put food on our table with a safety net that we can all count on I will continue to do all I can to support my farmers and ranchers and I ask that my colleagues say a prayer for rain and the men women who feed us all

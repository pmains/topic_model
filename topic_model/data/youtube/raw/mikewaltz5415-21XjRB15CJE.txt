florida republican congressman michael waltz joins us now he served on he serves on the house armed services committee he's also a former green beret commander sir thanks for being with us yeah thanks joanne so six million refugees in three months that's an average of two million a month that's right you'd think that for these people fleeing the horrors of war escaping the clutches of vladimir putin would be the end of the story but it turns out that's just the beginning of the horror show this is the largest most concentrated refugee flow since world war ii and as we as we heard greg say 95 percent are women and children because of zielinski's national mobilization law all of the men are staying in ukraine to fight in addition to that you have uh the elderly the disabled you have really truly the most vulnerable uh and and on top of that 14 million are internally uh displaced so you have russian mafia in the country trapped in the country can't get out but out of their homes you have russian mafia ukrainian mafia international trafficking rings literally preying on these people offering to help oftentimes as they come across the border and if it isn't horrific enough what's happened to them then they find themselves trapped in either labor trafficking rings with slave labor going on around the world or in the worst of cases sex trafficking rings for the young girls and so we convened a group of these ngos and others yesterday uh bipartisan group to really understand and hear about what's going on and what we can do about it right you know you mentioned labor trafficking because sex trafficking is the one that grabs the headlines but the labor trafficking one could be an even bigger problem because you're a displaced person you've traveled to one country that you aren't familiar with you need to have work you need to have money you don't speak the language you don't speak the language that's right and then somebody says oh by the way we can get you work here and it's either for for pennies or as you pointed out slavery yeah they take their passport they take their work papers they have nowhere to go and then suddenly they're caught in a labor trafficking ring with nowhere to go the other thing you know that i think it's important to note uh from yesterday's meeting these groups are kind of ringing the alarm bells that sentiment is changing in europe even in poland people are just getting exhausted they've absorbed three million people in a matter of months the government hasn't been able to keep up with kind of compensation and and the attitudes there are starting to turn and i'm just not hearing any long-range plan from the administration or from european leaders on how to deal with this kind of flow they obviously want to return to ukraine but many cities they have nothing there's nothing left what are they going to go back to yeah all those people from marijuana that's right and now we're hearing from our military officials that it might be years before this war draws to a close so if in a best-case scenario for a lot of these people they're looking at that amount of time before they can go home before they can well so what did these ngos you met with yesterday tell you what do they see that the u.s that the biden administration can do to help stem this trafficking crisis well they need you know i mean america has to lead and they need to continue to lead both international organizations but also through european organizations uh and not just in terms of resources you just reported on the aid that was right the aid that was passed but you know these border countries these eastern european countries can't bear all of the burden uh some of the kind of old europe france germany united kingdom spain and others uh need to step up and help and just look on the aid piece i know it's been controversial in some corners i just wrote an op-ed on our border we have to take care of our border and we should go on offense against these cartels that are destabilizing we have two million a year coming across our border right just by we've got a report from bill malugen coming up on that um just time is short so i want to ask you quickly you and congresswoman young kim uh submitted legislation which would look at what's happening with inflation something that you think the white house would be doing part of what this legislation does is measures the impact and the cost of living evaluates how inflation impacts wages considers the impact that american competitiveness goes on does a few other things the point that i guess i'm making here is this is about to bite us really really hard well look we're seeing it in the military the defense budget their cost of fuel is in the billions of dollars over uh we're seeing it even in military construction bases and repairs and other things uh uh we can't afford the budget is going backwards you're seeing it when you you're seeing it when you put gas in your house and put gas so i mean we're seeing it across our national security apparatus how are you doing baby and baby formula as the as the dad of a four-month-old we've been scrounging for months and i think the consistent theme here is a bite administration continually from afghanistan to baby formula to inflation has no plan back you know on their back foot how do you go to the largest baby formula manufacturer in the country responsible for 50 shut them down and then kind of walk away for a month until it's a crisis uh so is the defense production act the right move you think now now but like so many other things too little too late um and and and i think we're just continually seeing actually congress pushing zilinski pushing uh you know across the board it's pushing this administration along good luck with finding the baby formula yes most importantly yeah yeah gotta keep same i mean gotta keep army well-fed i've served in places where babies are malnourished across africa and the middle east i never thought i'd see it here in the united states all right good to see you thanks for coming in thank you guys appreciate it give him a squeeze for us

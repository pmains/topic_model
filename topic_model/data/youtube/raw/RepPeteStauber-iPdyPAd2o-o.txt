thank you madam chair and ranking member ash Abbott for holding this hearing and to the witnesses I too am a small business owner my brothers and I own have owned a business for 28 years and there's ups and downs and struggles and and as my colleague from Oklahoma stated there are some political differences here I listened to them and and I thought the the partisanship on some of your comments I wouldn't I don't agree with them but we're gonna have a healthy discussion as we move forward the small business in my mind I want to tell you a story of what happened in Minnesota just recently in Ely Minnesota we have a small businesses there Outfitters for clueless and and men and women who want to fish and recreative States Forest Service implemented a system after holding hearings were these small businesses in Ely Minnesota said that's not the way we should do it the u.s. Forest Service went ahead with zero took zero input the system failed to get permits into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness those small businesses are backed up now at least a month and some change every day they don't have customers is a day without money and I look at the federal government to listen to our small businesses listen to our Chamber of Commerce's they are the engines of our economy if we lose our small businesses every time we lose a small business down in in Main Street USA or Main Street Minnesota we lose an employer or employee we lose money we lose the economic drivers of our Main Street and to my colleagues in Maine and and Iowa I fully agree with broadband bringing the ability to have broadband in a rural America we have talked about it for many years and to that mr. Sullivan from the Chamber's perspective what do you think broadband would do reliable high-speed broadband to rural America what do you think it would do to the the developing small businesses and the entrepreneurship congressman thank you for the question first of all this is part of what we were talking about earlier about infrastructure investment that simple answer is we believe that that that type of broadband deployment would have a enormous positive impact on small business and we are working on that finalizing a study that would help us put data and figures to that sense that we have and I'd be happy to share that with you we expect that to be out in the middle of March thank you and then can you reiterate to me what the tax cuts and Jobs Act did for small businesses in relation to your role as the member of the chamber sure so when tax reform passed we had a survey out in the field this is part of our quarterly survey of a thousand small business owners the survey firm is called it sews they do this every quarter but the tax tax reform passed right while that survey was out in the field and we saw the highest spike in optimism that we had ever seen that same spike was recorded by the National Federation of Independent Business that has been doing a monthly confident survey a lot longer than we've been doing our quarterly index so that was the immediate than what we saw really which was what the intention of the tax cuts were and that was to put stimulus immediately back into the economy and so we saw examples like a landscaper in Jacksonville Florida buying a new landscaping truck I grew up just outside of Boston we had a a bakery in Braintree Massachusetts who bought a new oven specifically from the savings from tax cuts and I had mentioned earlier we we've been trying to track this on a map and we have hundreds of examples of small business owners that not only were grateful but they took those tax cuts and they reinvested that into their businesses and that means hiring new employees that means providing greater benefits greater and also buying new equipment which is basically a double impact because they're generally buying it from other small businesses thank you for that comprehensive answer I want to end madam chair by saying I really think it's our role on this committee to facilitate a business environment that allows small businesses to succeed and flourish and I think far too long there's been rules regulations put forth that that stymie stop or don't allow an individual to want to pursue small businesses and I see my time's up thank you madam chair thank you

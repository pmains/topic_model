rabbi Daneel Hartman good afternoon God spoke to Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and sand to them you shall be holy for I the Lord your God am holy with that statement our tradition tried to create something that ought to be at the foundation of all of our denominations doesn't matter whether you're orthodox conservative reform reconstructionist renewal post denominational secular I think I got everyone doesn't matter to be a Jew at its core means to be to continuously aspire to that which you will never achieve it's not about feeling guilty it's not about being frozen and saying I'm never going to be good enough it's not about feeling engulfed in an ocean of original sin it's about saying God is not only one God as radically other but you have to spend your life trying to get close you shall be holy for I the Lord your God am holy aspirational Judaism is the core denomination of Jewish life it's a denomination in which mediocrity and Judaism is a contradiction in terms it's a denomination in which you wake up in the morning and ask yourself how could I build something better than yesterday and how could tomorrow be better than today what values what ideals what principles have to define me as a Jew I aspire to be an aspirational Jew I am an aspirational Zionist the essence of aspirational Zionism is no different than aspirational Judaism it asks how do I get up in the morning and make sure that today is better than yesterday and asked myself the question what do I have to do tomorrow I love living in Israel I love Israel I find it an honor to live there to raise my children there and now also to raise my grandchild it it's not always easy my family like most Israelis have paid a very very heavy price for living in Israel and for loving Israel the rabbinic tradition teaches us that one of the great tragedies of life is that everything of value any great value or blessing always comes with hardship and Israel is no different we've all paid a price but I could choose or think of no other place that I would rather live and raise my family but my love of Israel is not exhausted only by what it is and i love it for what it is we're soon going to have PESA we're a people who learn how to sing Diana we sing Diana but there's a little catch to the song de lleno it's a little contradiction if we were really serious about the song it would have only one line try it's like we're happy but I want a little more day on you and i you and i you and i you and it becomes quite a long song I love Israel for what it is and I'm aware of all the difficulties its greatness and its failures and I love it all but my deep love of Israel is not merely exhausted by what Israel is and what it has achieved but my deepest love is about what it can be and asking myself what values and ideals have to define a Jewish homeland and what do I have to do to help make that a reality as you all know we our generation where the first Jews of choice we're the first ones who don't have to be Jewish we don't there's nothing forcing us to be Jewish we have a real real crisis and that is that the outside world doesn't hate us enough and it's difficult because if they don't hate us enough they don't serve as a safety net ensuring that I stay inside they don't remind me of who I am if I don't want to be Who I am as Jews of choice we know that a Judaism of mediocrity is not merely a tragedy but a judy's of mediocrity is a catastrophe and a death sentence but Judaism which is not compelling is not going to actualize and activate the choice of Jews to stand up and say I want to be a Jew in Israel of mediocrity is no different I believe that Israel is an essential critical important part of building a meaningful Jewish life for Jews in Israel and produce around the world but I can't just declare it demand it and go home I have to earn it just as Judaism must earn the choosing of the Jews so must the future of loving Israel earned that love and that's much more difficult how do we do that we need to learn to develop a new conversation around Israel not necessarily we in this room we in this room and we outside of this room a conversation in which Jewish values and Jewish ideals defines us and challenges us to ask not merely what we criticize but what do we want to build not merely what's wrong with them but how do I take responsibility we need to develop a nuanced language of values which looks at the complexity of Israel and asks how do we build a homeland for the Jewish people in a real world in a difficult crappy neighborhood what do we do how do we maintain our aspirations what do we stand for I don't have the time even though I'd love to speak very you know at great length and model what these type of or what this type of value conversation may look like but I'd like to just very briefly let's take one of the more difficult ones one that is so essential to Judaism and so essential to Israel and which needs to be nuanced if we're going to be lovers of Israel because if your values are in nuanced you'll be you'll sort of drown in criticism all the time and you'll create us and them and you'll sit down together and speak about us who get it and they who don't get it an essential part of Israel and Zionism and sovereignty is power you can't be a sovereign people without power now how do we Jews think about power on the one hand power is an essential feature of what it means to be a human being when God creates human beings and says you rule the world and master it you'll be the demigods in essence replacing me in Genesis God creates God's replacement and says it's your world rule it and master it and with that God gives us the blessing and the responsibility of power a power which we must use to rule this world a power which we must use to be able to institute tikkun olam but also a power which we must use in order to live in our tradition protecting oneself is not a moral is not immoral protecting oneself is one of the highest moral responsibilities that one has we don't love human beings in general and despise ourselves and I know it doesn't play that well in a movie it's much nicer being the heroic one who dies for others it's a great ending it's the movie that you remember but let me just do a little exercise for one moment and see if you're like most other groups in our community let's take the greatest dire in Jewish history for a moment it was the person who led the revolt in Masada by a show of hands and don't worry it's not a test who remembers the person who was played by Peter Strauss in the movie what's his name the greatest Dyer in Jewish history look around for a moment ladies and gentlemen how do you think he feels right now Eleazar Ben Yair none of you even know his name or some of you most do not because on our tradition we have an obligation to live the Hiva him to live is a Jewish value love your neighbor as yourself love of others starts with love of self self defense is a moral obligation and so we embrace power and we take a trip up basada we might sweat a little bit but when we say never again we don't simply say that Masada will never fall again we say that's not our path we choose to live and as a sovereign people sometimes we have to fight but the thing about power is that it's essential to be to being and fulfilling our human destiny but power is also never an end unto itself we yearn for a day when we won't have to use it we struggle with the question of how you use it justly we ask what are its limits and yes we ask at what moment should I choose death rather than using it not as a theoretical exercise but as a question that I ask myself and a question that I asked my son to ask himself not in theory at what moment do you not shoot at what moment do you take a chance we need a very sophisticated nuance conversation for example about power about a Jewish state about democracy about state and religion building a sovereign Jewish country requires of us nuance requires of us a conversation where the purpose of that conversation is not to feel good about oneself the purpose of that conversation is to try to actualize these values in our lives it's to be part of the solution it's not the disenfranchised it's not to disengage but it's a conversation that will unite Jews worldwide and building a new Jewish country an aspirational Zionism now aspirational Judaism is relatively easy it's easy because it's up to us who do you want to be have you had enough with mediocrity what type of Judaism do you want to have how do we build a community with a wide enough bandwidth to even hear Jewish values a wide enough bandwidth to learn Jewish values a wide enough bandwidth in which we build institutions that are meaningful and powerful and compelling it's up to us we could do anything we want an aspirational Judaism our problem is not a poverty of resources it's a poverty of vision we could do it if we want to aspirational Zionism however is much more complicated for two key reasons the first is that unlike aspirational Judaism in aspirational Zionism it's not only up to us there's somebody else and one of the essential features of Israel and of loving Israel is to recognize that one of my values is to live in the real world part of what Zionism means part of what Israel has done is it as bought it has brought us back into the world it has brought us back into realpolitik it's brought us back into politics and I want to stay there but to build the Israel that I yearned for the Israel that I dream about it's not only up to me now there's a lot of things that I have to do and I will never be quiet I will never be silent as long as there's something that I have to do but I know that it's not only up to me there's another side who also has to be aspirational and it's also difficult because the environment of fear in an environment of war it's sometimes difficult to be aspirational I remember every third weekend welcoming my son home and he spent three years on checkpoints in the West Bank and he had five seconds ladies and gentlemen that's five seconds he had five seconds in which he had to figure out if the person coming to him was overdressed because they were overdressed or whether they were overdressed because they wanted to kill him he just had five seconds and he wasn't 30 and he didn't have a doctorate in ethics he's a little pisher it's my son he's 18 years old 19 years old and he's scared and he wants to come home and I want him to come home it's difficult to be aspirational in our neighborhood but because it's difficult doesn't mean it's not worthwhile that's our destiny to be an aspirational Zionist is to be an aspirational Zionist in the Middle East not in Washington DC alone that's where it counts but it's difficult and I need you to forgive us a little bit we have to forget each other a little bit it's difficult and it's not as I said always up to us but there's another reason why aspirational Zionism is difficult because we don't agree on what those aspirations are there's a lot of us who could love peace and love democracy and aspire for values but we could disagree as to how that ought to be implemented in real life do we do a unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank do we not what should the borders be how much risk should we take for the sake of peace our debate is it's nice and comfortable to think that our debate is between people who disagree with us fundamentally about our values very often what makes aspirational Zionism so difficult is that we're disagreeing with people who fundamentally agree but we disagree on the weight on the balance on how to implement them now when it comes to aspirational Judaism we also disagree but that's relatively easy because we know how to build while we're one people we now to build parallel Judaism's each one of us has our aspirations we build our own shul and if you don't agree with my value build a different sure I don't want you to come to my show I don't want to go to yours part of my identity is not going to yours and that's okay when it comes to the space the the institution of synagogue life and denominations allows for difference in which if we disagree you build your space but when it comes to aspirational Zionism what am I supposed to say if you disagree with me what build your own country Israel is the shared enterprise of the Jewish people we are stuck together it's all of ours whether we like it or not the people at the table aren't the people who agree with us there are also the people who disagree that's the essence of Zionism it's about our decision not to be a shul only but to be a people and to build something together and I can't walk away from you so how do I function how do I allow my aspirations not just to be criticism but to be a force for action knowing fully well that I don't get to decide alone and i can tell you to leave the table I'd like to end by teaching a cabalistic principle Todd and Lori yannick Kabbalah they asked a simple question if God is the infinite there's no room for anybody else infinite you take up all the space lareana Coppola had a brilliant idea they said in the act of creation God contracts God self the term is sim soon God contracts god self to make room for the world if we're going to learn to love is real together we're all of us going to have to learn the art of zoom zoom we're going to have to contract in order to live with the person who we disagree with contract our anger contract our frustration and yes even contract our certainty that's the hardest and then contract our language to create a language in which we don't vilify in which we don't insult in which we allow somebody to be a carrier of values and have a life of value even if they don't necessarily agree with me as a rabbi I'd like to wish all of us give all of us abraha for one moment my brother to all of us is that in the spirit of our tradition we'll have the courage to walk in the ways of God you shall be holy I yearned to be holy and may all of us try to be holier tomorrow than we are today try to have a life slightly more valuable tomorrow than we had today but i also want us to walk in the ways of God through team soon let's contract let's learn how to share let's learn to love Israel and to love each other and if we walk in the way of God maybe maybe we will be able to build a deeper Jewish life and a greater Israel and together we will open a new chapter in Jewish history amen and thank you

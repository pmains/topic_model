thank you Mr Speaker and to the chair for yielding this Republican rules package is more like rules wreckage and it has very little to do with governance adding insult to the American people speaker McCarthy and mega Republicans want to defund the IRS so that their millionaire and billionaire friends don't have to pay their fair share in taxes while hard-working people in Nevada's fourth district pick up the tab there's a persistent problem with the wealthiest Americans evading taxes or hiding their money in secret offshore bank accounts in order to avoid paying their tax obligations in fact according to a new Syracuse University analysis low-income wage earners were audited at 5.5 times more than the people in every other tax bracket in 2022 Democrats put people over politics and provided the resources and funded that the IRS needs to go after the Super Rich tax cheats it is not fair that taxpayers with lower incomes are more likely to be audited than high-income taxpayers and adding additional insult their first bill adds more than a hundred billion dollars to the deficit over the next 10 years what does that say about reducing our deficit stop this hypocratical human time has expired gentleman from Oklahoma I

hello and welcome to this edition of by you time I'm your host Keith wysite licensed clinical social worker with Terrebonne home care very glad you're joining us however you may be joining us we appreciate it and we're always glad to have those people who can come down and tell us a little bit about what's happening for us here in the state and what they're doing for us we welcome back to the program representative Gary Graves thanks for joining us thank you great we appreciate that I know it's one of those things we know you love coming down here and we're we're always glad to see you so uh thanks for what you're doing let's talk a little bit about some of the things that a lot of people are still dealing with and that is Hurricane recovery yeah uh well look first that we finished up in Washington on Friday it's it's great to be back among uh normal people again uh so so good to be here but look on Friday we we actually voted and passed the bill out that I think is going to be signed into law that will provide an additional 841 million dollars for Hurricane Ida victims so this isn't for governments this is directly for the people that have been impacted and this is on top of about 1.3 billion dollars we secured last year and uh there's actually some additional money that the state can apply for where it may even go up uh above what would be now about 2.1 billion dollars so so uh good good news there and I'm excited that that finally has has come in to help replenish the coffers uh but but look you know the most important thing that we can be doing is continuing to build hurricane protection continuing to restore the coast and address Pump Station issues and other things because because we we have got to make sure that the this community when a hurricane comes that it's not a you know everybody evacuating and losing everything but but we this place is is protectable you know we we can make the appropriate Investments and make this a safe place to live well you were also part of being able to get some of those funds nationally to support Morganza to the gulf and all of those so we we appreciate that listen you know we've been fighting for that for a really long time we've been using you know our Parish monies we've been using multiple parishes State money but you have fought the fight to get us those those National dollars as well and so that's just one of those things that people need to realize y'all have been fighting for that yeah it's amazing and I mean you you look at the federal government you get so frustrated you know that this project started Morganza project started in 1992 and about two years ago we finally were able to uh and and be clear I hadn't been there since 92 but uh right uh but but when we came in we started working on this and we were able about two years ago to secure the First Federal construction funds on this project and send since then it pulled together about 424 million dollars to complement all of the funds that the local community and the states put together on this project and so really awesome to see that finally starting to move in the right direction yeah it's just really nice to be able to know when you talk about feeling comfortable and confident for the next storm because we know there's going to be a neck storm but just being able to be better prepared for that and I love the fact that we're looking for extra money is that additional money that's going to get us to that 2.1 billion or so to help with those those people that still need the help because as you travel around I know that you're kind of seeing a lot of that help that's still needed right oh it it's incredible and lucky you go down to Southern areas of terrible Parish I was down there a few weeks ago and I mean some of the areas quite frankly some of the homes it looks like you're two weeks after a hurricane and as you know we're more than a year later but the conditions that people are living in in some cases are you know just they're inappropriate it's not okay to have people living in those conditions and to know that there's money in the bank and they're people with needs we have got to connect those dots and get the people the resources they need but that's why it's so exciting that finally able to come back in and get those additional funds to where now we're going to have the resources available to help people

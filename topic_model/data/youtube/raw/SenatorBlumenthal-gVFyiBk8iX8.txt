thank you madam president i rise today to voice my strong support for the nomination of Susan Carney to serve as an appeals court judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals one of our most distinguished appeals court panels among the Federal Circuit and I hope that the United States Senate will move swiftly to confirm her to fill one of the open seats on this critically important Court ms Carney has truly impressive credentials for appointment to the federal bench she graduated laud from Harvard College of 1973 and magna  laud from the Harvard Law School in 1977 and they then went to clerk for judge Levin Campbell on the court of appeals for the First Circuit she currently serves as deputy general counsel for Yale University one of the country's great institutions of higher learning and previously served as an associate general counsel for Yale in her capacity at Yale she advises the University on a wide range of legal issues some of them complex and challenging relating to intellectual property international transaction and commercial matters ms Carney's time at Yale has exposed her to a broad array a diverse swath of federal law giving her a breadth of experience that truly qualifies her to serve on the Second Circuit which handles federal appeals on legal issues arising within New York Vermont and Connecticut in various matters his Carney has advised Yale in reaching very successful results and that experience will serve her well on the bench her experience as an advocate has given her a perspective that will give her the kinds of qualities a respect for other advocates who come before the court a respect for the legal principles at stake for the factual findings of courts below and of all the considerations that are so critically important to ability and integrity on the Federal Court of Appeals she spent 17 years working as a private practice attorney in Washington DC in Boston and there too she represented a wide array of clients on major issues including for example to Major League Baseball Players Association and a Tennessee Union that stopped work due to its employees exposure to uranium in the Tennessee Court the NLRB determined that striking employees could not be replaced and the DC Circuit issued a similarly positive verdict as impressive as her commercial and private litigation is her commitment to pro bono public service work she engaged in such work throughout her time as a lawyer offering free legal counsel to pro bono clients and even volunteering as a tutor or commitment to the community as well as appropriate legal representation for all clients demonstrate a real respect for the legal system and the fairness the fundamental fairness of the legal system that I believe should be and is broadly shared by members of the federal bench her nomination comes at a particularly pressing and challenging time for the Second Circuit the vacancy that she's slated to fill has been designated as a judicial emergency the vacancy has existed since October 10 2009 there are two open seats on this Court from Connecticut which is currently more than fifteen percent under staff so the arrival of Susan Carney the second sphere will have immediate impacts it will help immediately to address the understaffing problem and the work burden that has accumulated as a result of it and it will ensure that this case load can be addressed quickly and efficiently we here in this body the famous saying that justice delayed is justice denied truly it is often justice denied if it is delayed and in practical circumstances people have a right to their day in court which includes a day in the Court of Appeals in the federal courts that appeal is generally one of right it is not discretionary and to deprive people of that right is truly a denial of justice I've been impressed since I have come to the Senate by the good faith that has been shown by both sides in working to address this growing judicial vacancy issue some have thought it an epidemic in many circuits it's been characterized as a judicial emergency and it has been spurred by respected figures from across the spectrum from Chief Justice Roberts to Attorney General Holder and the Senate has been moving very responsive Lee and responsibly to address this issue and I'm hopeful that this nomination of Susan Carney and others that will follow as some have preceded it will lead to a new era in addressing the judicial vacancy problem throughout our federal courts the American people expect us to work together they expect the courts to give them justice and so far I've been encouraged to see members of both parties working in the Senate to act expeditiously on these nominations some of them very long delay and I hope that the Senate will continue this trend with the swift confirmation of Susan Carney to the Second Circuit on the issue of emergencies I'd like to address a second topic Madam President over the last decade what we've seen is a pattern of rising profits on the part of oil companies the emergency for consumers is one of rising prices now and I believe that we have an obligation to assure fundamental fairness in our tax code by eliminating in effect the tax subsidies and loopholes and giveaways that are such an offense to the justice and fairness of our system in spite of the big five oil companies earning more than one trillion dollars in profits they have enjoyed tens of millions of dollars in these taxpayer subsidies they are unconscionable they are unacceptable they must end and that is the purpose of the legislation that we are going to consider later today I strongly support it in the interests of consumers but more important in the interests of taxpayers to repair a part of our deficit while families and businesses in Connecticut are paying more than four dollars and twenty-five cents a gallon putting a strain on all of our family budgets the big oil companies continue to rake in these record profits and continue to enjoy subsidies that put a dent in our fiscal situation the companies make over 30 million dollars in profits in the first quarter of this year alone representing a fifty percent increase in profits from last year the long and short of this debate is that big oil doesn't need these subsidies they don't need the help of American taxpayers to do exploration or any of the other activities that are involved in producing the profits that they enjoy so abundantly ending these subsidies despite claims to the contrary will not increase prices at the pump and instead will provide for basic fairness that Americans no longer have to pay for these giveaways and tax breaks to some of the most profitable companies in the world people in my home state of Connecticut and across the country remain concerned about reducing our debt and our deficit we can't do it if we have this plethora of subsidies and giveaways and breaks to special interests and corporations like Big Oil that simply don't need it ordinary Americans in Connecticut and elsewhere are struggling to stay in their homes find jobs keep their families together and they regard these subsidies as offensive to fundamental fairness and they are right and I urge this body to act later today in eliminating those loopholes and subsidies I thank you madam chairman

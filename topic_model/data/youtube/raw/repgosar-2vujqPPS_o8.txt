chair now recognizes dr. gosar for five minutes Commissioner Lopez are you familiar with congressman Scott Tipton's Bureau of Reclamation small conduit hydropower development and rural Jobs Act of 2012 that was signed into public law representative I don't believe that I'm specifically related to familiar with that but I've got a general sense of what well the reason I'm bringing up since I was a big supporter of that legislation because if it was fully implemented it will create jobs streamline the permitting process reduce red tape and make small hydropower projects up economically viable if you don't know how but I'm going to still ask this because we want this on the record how much hydropower generation was added to the Bureau of Reclamation's portfolio since the Tipton's hydropower bill was enacted in public law representative I don't know the answer to that but I'd be happy to to answer for the record I would like some follow-up from those stats from your office but I want to also help you as I'm told of you yesterday from several folks in the industry the Bureau of Reclamation's has only pursued four to five small hydropower projects in the entire country following the enactment of this law meanwhile these same industry experts tell me that the FERC the federal regulatory energy commission has aggressively pursued small low-impact hydropower project since enactment of this bill in fact on first website they indicate they have issued 25 licenses and 93 preliminary permits for small low-impact hydropower projects since the Tipton's bill was became law small hydropower projects are good for taxpayers and good for the environment unfortunately it sounds like your agency doesn't have much of a plan does the Bureau of Reclamation's have a five-year plan for encouraging development and installing new hydropower facilities representative what we what I am what I'm familiar with is I know that we are doing a lot to encourage things like the lease of power privilege option which would allow us to work with our customers to set up mechanisms by which they can finance the capital needs and then they get some of the benefits of the hydropower and I we we've been doing some that I don't think that's exactly in line with what you're asking it's not but but we we are encouraging that well in in 2012 Bureau of Reclamation's Commissioner Connor stated in an interview the reclamation was looking for ways to have a very aggressive and sustainable hydropower program he identified a 2011 Bureau of Reclamation's assessments which identified 190 existing facilities and other sites for new hydropower generation units of those 190 possible sites that were estimated to provide 225 megawatts of new capacity how many how many does your Reclamation's have online and plugged into the grid representative again I can't answer that number but I'd be happy to supplement this well currently the agency is responsible for the operations of 53 different high total hydroelectric power plants that's 9 290 the reason I'm bringing this up this is a very important segment of ale ability for hydropower particularly with what we're talking about here as far as clean electricity and clean energy this is an important aspect and I would have expected you to know a little bit more about this are you aware the Bureau of Reclamation's completed a second dismiss with a second assessment on small hydropower development after the 2011 assessment I previous mentioned the second assessment focused on small hydropower developments found that 300 different sites could be used to develop 365 thousand megawatt hours of energy production annually yet your agency does not have a five-year plan and has only encourage the development of a handful of the small hydro project since the Tipton's hydropower bill was signed into law I know that you were confirmed in October but what's holding up things over there representative I apologize I don't have a lot of information on this this this is not something that's come to my attention since since I've been there I would really like to know who's holding it up I'd like to have stats on that from your office immediately I mean when were concerned about energy production and clean energy production on hydropower I think this is a valuable asset that we ought to be looking into and I think everybody can agree on sides of this the aisle because it was something that went through very a very bipartisan in nature would you agree representative I would agree that this any additional hydropower that we can get out of existing facilities is very important to us and this would be very important for bo r2 to step up and immediately start looking at trying to comply in trying to help out facilitate that hydropower being built and in the allocations I mean 300 different sizes is a big deal we okay I yield back

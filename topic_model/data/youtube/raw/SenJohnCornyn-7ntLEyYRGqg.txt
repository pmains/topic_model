MR. CORNYN: MADAM PRESIDENT, IT WAS A BUSY WEEKEND FOR THE UNITED STATES MILITARY WHICH HAS NOW SHOT DOWN THREE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS OVER NORTH AMERICAN AIR SPACE IN MANY DAYS. ON FRIDAY AN F-22 TOOK DOWN AN OBJECT HOVERING OVER ALASKA WHICH OFFICIALS DESCRIBE AS BEING ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL CAR. ON SATURDAY AN F-22 BROUGHT DOWN AN OBJECT OVER CANADA THAT IT DESCRIBED ONLY AS SILL LYNN CAL -- SILL LYNN DRA CAL. AND ON SUNDAY THEY SHOT DOWN ANOTHER UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT TRAVELING AT ABOUT 20,000 FEET LOW ENOUGH TO INTERFERE WITH COMMERCIAL AIR TRAFFIC. GIVEN THE HIGH PROFILE OF THE CHINESE SPY BALLOON, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY OF GREAT INTEREST TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS, STARTING IN LATE FEBRUARY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WATCHED AS CHINA'S SURVEILLANCE BALLOON TRAVELED ACROSS THE COUNTRY BEFORE PRESIDENT BIDEN FINALLY INSTRUCTED THE MILITARY TO SHOOT IT DOWN OVER THE COAST -- OR OFF THE COAST OF SOUTH CAROLINA. THAT WAS JUST NINE DAYS AGO. THE MILITARY IS STILL RECOVERING PIECES OF THAT BALLOON FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE ATLANTIC IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN SOME ANSWERS. BUT GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE INTERIM, THE SWIRL OF QUESTIONS HAS ONLY GROWN. THE UNITED STATES HAS SHOT DOWN FOUR OBJECTS FLYING OVER OUR COUNTRY SINCE FEBRUARY THE 4th. THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED ONE OF THOSE FOUR OBJECTS. SO BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW NOW OR PERHAPS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW NOW, WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOT DOWN THREE OBJECTS OF UNKNOWN PROVIDENCE. SINCE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE, PRESUMABLY THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM. YET THEY -- THE PRESIDENT ORDERED THEM SHOT DOWN. WE'RE NOT TOLD WHETHER THEY WERE EMITTING ANY SORT OF SIGNATURE LIKE HEAT WHICH MIGHT BE PICKED UP BY AN INFRARED SENSOR OR SOME OTHER SIGNAL WITH DATA EITHER COMING FROM OR GOING TO THAT OBJECT. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS AS WELL AS THE BROADER THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL INTEREST. THEY'RE LOOKING TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ANSWERS AND THE ONLY PATH FORWARD IS FULL AND COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY. PRESIDENT BIDEN NEEDS TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED AND JUST HOW CONCERNED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE, AND HE NEEDS TO CONSULT WITH CONGRESS AND SHARE THE INFORMATION HE HAS WITH US. UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, SPECULATION WILL ONLY INTENSIFY. IT'S ONLY HUMAN NATURE TO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE OF A PARTICULAR CONCERN OF ANXIETY OR MAYBE EVEN A THREAT, IT'S ONLY HUMAN NATURE TO SPECULATE AND IMAGINE THE VERY WORST. SO THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS HAVE PROMPTED A LOT OF QUESTIONS, AND I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVIDE SOME NECESSARY ANSWERS SOON. I EXPECT THE CHINESE SPY BALLOON AND THESE UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS WILL BE THE TOPICS OF DISCUSSION IN THE SENATE THIS WEEK. I KNOW ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES, REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT ALIKE, ARE EAGER TO LEARN MORE, AND I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE WHAT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN AND THAT IS FORTHRIGHT AND TRANSPARENT. ON ANOTHER MATTER, MR. PRESIDENT, THE UNITED STATES -- THIS LAST WEEK PRESIDENT BIDEN SPOKE AT HIS STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS ABOUT THE LOOMING DEBT CRISIS, BUT HE TURNED IT INSTEAD OF A PLEA FOR UNITY AND BIPARTISANSHIP AND WORKING TOGETHER, HE TURNED IT INTO POLITICAL FEARMONGERING AND FINGER POINTING. HE EVEN SUGGESTED THAT REPUBLICANS WANT TO CUT FUNDING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE ON WHICH MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF SENIORS DEPEND, SOMETHING THAT COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. YOU MIGHT CALL IT THE BIG LIE. SPEAKER McKARNLG McCARTHY IS LEADING DEBT CEILING DISCUSSIONS FOR REPUBLICANS ANSAE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK. AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITNESSED LAST TUESDAY EVENING, THE REPUBLICANS ALL AGREE ON THIS POINT. SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE ARE A LIFELINE FOR SENIORS AND SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY, AND THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE, PERIOD. BUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT AND OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES HAVE FAILED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT SUSTAINABLE, PARTICULARLY WHEN TO COMES TO SOCIAL SECURITY. WE'RE TOLD BY THE ACTUARIES THAT UNLESS CONGRESS DOING IS, SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WILL BECOME INSOLVENT AND INCAPABLE OF PAYING THE BENEFITS UPON WHICH MILLIONS OF SENIORS DEPEND. I HAVE TO ASK WHETHER THE PRESIDENT, BY THIS FEARMONGERING, MADE IT EASIER OR HARDER FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER TO MEET OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF INSOLVENCY, WHICH WE ARE ON A PATH TO IF THE PRESIDENT DOES NOTHING. DID THE PRESIDENT MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WILL WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE FOR THE SOLVENCY AND SURVIVAL OF SOCIAL SECURITY OR MEDICARE BY FEARMONGERING AND FINGER-POINTING? WELL, I THINK WE ALL KNOW HE DID NOT. PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT SOCIAL SECURITY RECIPIENTS WILL SEE A REDUCTION OF ALMOST 25% IN THEIR BENEFITS IF NOTHING CHANGES. SO WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. TEXANS WHO LIVE ON FIXED INCOMES CANNOT HANDLED A 25% CUT. THEY'RE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION, AS THINGS ARE, WHICH IS NOW ABOUT 6.5%. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY A PAYCHECK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THANKS TO THE PROFLIGATE SPENDING OF OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES AND THIS ADMINISTRATION. BUT A 25% REDUCTION IS ABSOLUTELY UNFATHOMABLE. GIVEN THE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL SECURITY THAT WE SAW LAST WEEK, I HOPE WE WILL ALL AGREE THAT WE CAN'T ALLOW THESE PROGRAMS TO RUN OUT OF MONEY. THERE IS A CLEAR BIPARTISAN DESIRE TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY. LAST CONGRESS SENATORS ROMNEY OF UTAH, SENATOR MANCHIN OF WEST VIRGINIA INTRODUCED THE TRUST ACT TO RESCUE SOCIAL SECURITY. I WAS PROUD TO COSPONSOR THAT LEGISLATION, AND I HOPE IT WILL GAIN SOME MOMENTUM THIS YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ALREADY SLAMMED THE DOOR ON THAT POSSIBILITY ONCE AGAIN. SO WE SEE A TREND HERE WHERE INSTEAD OF ENGAGING IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO TRAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS -- TO TRY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, THE PRESIDENT JUST MAKES THINGS HARDER AND LESS LIKELY FOR THOSE CONSULTATION AND THAT COOPERATION TO OCCUR. A WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN EVEN DESCRIBED A COMMISSION LIKE THE ONE THE BILL WOULD CREATE LIKE A, QUOTE, DEATH PANEL FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. YET, FOUR DECADES AGO THEN- SENATOR BIDEN VOTED FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORMS PROPOSED BY WHAT HE NOW REFERS TO AS A DEATH PANEL AND THOSE REFORMS EXTENDED THE PROGRAM FOR ANOTHER 50 YEARS. TWO YEARS AGO THE SENATE VOTED SENATOR ROMNEY'S TRUST ACT AS AN AMENDMENT TO THE DEMOCRATS' RECKLESS BUDGET AND IT ACTUALLY PASSED BY A VOTE OF 71-29. THAT IS MORE THAN 20 OF OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES VOTED FOR IT, A STRONG BIPARTISAN VOTE, HE 71-29. SO IT'S COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO CLAIM THAT REPUBLICANS WANT TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND THEN DEMAGOGUE THE VERY BIPARTISAN EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE LONGEVITY OF THESE PROGRAMS. HOW SHAMEFUL AND IRRESPONSIBLE IS THAT? WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT WILL ADMIT IT, HE KNOWS THAT SOCIAL SECURITY IS OPERATING ON BORROWED TIME. WE NEED TO ENSURE ITS LONGTERM SUCCESS AND THE TRUST ACT IS A GREAT STARTING POINT FOR CONVERSATIONS TO DO JUST THAT. OF COURSE, THIS IS JUST ONE SMALL PART OF THE MAJOR CHANGES WE NEED TO SEE TO GET OUR SCALE HOUSE IN ORDER. THE NATIONAL DEBT IS NOW $31.5 TRILLION. CONGRESS CAN'T RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT AND CONTINUE TO BORROW AND SPEND LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. INTEREST ON THAT $31 TRILLION DEBT APPROACHES $1 TRILLION A YEAR. THAT MEANS MORE AND MORE OF THE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY OR TO SUPPORT OTHER PRIORITIES GOES UP IN SMOKE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY INTEREST ON THAT $31.5 TRILLION IN BORROWED MONEY. YES, WE DO NEED TO AVOID A DEBT CRISIS AND NO ONE IN CONGRESS WANTS US TO DEFAULT ON OUR DEBTS, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO ENACT BROADER REFORMS TO CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS OUT-OF-CONTROL SPENDING. LAST WEEK I WAS PROUD TO JOIN WITH SENATOR HYDE-SMITH OF MISSISSIPPI IN INTRODUCING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD REQUIRE A BALANCED BUDGET. I'VE AUTHORED AND VOTE FOR SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN THE PAST, AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO SMART SPENDING REFORMS. FAMILIES, BUSINESSES, AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGET. IF THERE'S NOT MONEY COMING IN THE FRONT DOOR, THEY CAN'T SPEND IT OUT OF BACK DOOR -- UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND YOU PRINT MONEY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE ONLY GLARING EXCEPTION TO THIS COMMONSENSE FINANCIAL PRACTICE, AND WE'RE SEEING THE CONSEQUENCES. THE NATIONAL DEBT HAS SKYROCKETED FROM $3.2 TRILLION IN 1980 TO $9.7 TRILLION IN 2000. AND THEN TO $31.5 TRILLION TODAY. IT HAS MORE THAN TRIPLED SINCE 2000. IT'S PAST TIME TO TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS GROWING DEBT CRISIS, AND THERE'S REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE THAT BALANCING -- BALANCED BUDGETS WORK. EVERY STATE INCLUDING TEXAS HAS ONE, AND WE ARE FAR FROM OPERATING IN THE RED LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN FACT, TEXAS HAS GONE INTO THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE SESSION WITH A $33 BILLION SURPLUS. YOU DON'T DO THAT BY BORROWING MONEY AND FORCING YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN TO PAY THE BILLS. YOU DO YOU IT BY RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PROPONENT OF TAKING THE TEXAS MODEL NATIONWIDE, AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF MY STATE'S SMART FISCAL POLICIES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO EMULATE. ONE OF THE EARLIEST LESSONS WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN IS ABOUT ONLY SPENDING THE MONEY THAT YOU HAVE AND NOT SPENDING MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. IT'S TIME TO APPLY THAT SAME COMMONSENSE LOGIC TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO I APPRECIATE SENATOR HYDE-SMITH'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL, AND I'M PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE 23 COSPONSORS AND WOULD INVITE ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES TO CONSIDER JOINING US IN COSPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION. YOU MIGHT WONDER, IS THIS JUST SOME REPUBLICAN TRICK OR NOT? WELL, IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, PRESIDENT BIDEN, VOTED FOR A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND HE DIDN'T JUST DO IT ONCE; HE DIDN'T JUST DO IT TWICE; HE DID IT THREE TIMES. THEN-SENATOR BIDEN VOTED FOR A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT IN MARCH OF 1995 WHEN THE DEBT WAS $4.9 TRILLION. IN JUNE OF 1966, HE VOTED FOR A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT WHEN THE DEBT WAS $5.1 TRILLION, AND IN MARCH OF 1997, WHEN THE DEBT STOOD AT $5.4 TRILLION, JOE BIDEN, THEN SENATOR BIDEN, VOTED FOR A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION. MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAVE OFFERED A RANGE OF PROPOSALS TO REIGN IN THE -- TO REIN IN THE NATIONAL DEBT. ALL OF THESE IDEAS SHOULD BE PART OF A SERIOUS DISCUSSION TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. IF YOU STRIP AWAY THE AGREEMENTS ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE AND THE BEST PATH FORWARD, THERE'S ONE UNAVOIDABLE TRUTH -- WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCES, THE UNITED STATES IS ON AN UNSUSTAINABLE COURSE. THE NATIONAL DEBT WILL HAUNT EVERY GENERATION UNTIL LEADERS SHOW ENOUGH COURAGE TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES AND FIX THIS MESS. AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANY BETTER TIME THAN NOW. SO I HOPE PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL STOP THE FEARMONGERING AND STOP THE DEMAGOGUING AND TAKE THIS CRISIS SERIOUSLY. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE WANT TO AVOID A DEBT CRISIS, BUT SO FAR WE HAVEN'T TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO REIN IN THE IRRESPONSIBLE SPENDING AND TO SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN AND SAVE IMPORTANT PRIME MINISTERS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY A -- IMPORTANT PROGRAMS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. NIECE ARE POPULAR COMMONSENSE GOALS AND I HOPE THAT OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES WILL STOP PLAYING POLITICS AND START TALKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS.

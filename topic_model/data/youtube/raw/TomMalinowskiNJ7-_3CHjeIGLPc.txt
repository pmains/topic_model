thank you everyone for enjoy for joining us for tonight's backyard chat I see some of you are in your backyard including our congressman I'm Lisa Mandelbrot I'm gonna be moderating today what we're gonna do is in a moment I'm going to introduce our Commissioner and our Congress and then we're gonna they're gonna chat for a wild I'm gonna open it up for questions if you have any questions just type them in the chat box and we will try to get to as many people as possible so without further ado Commissioner Robinson good afternoon everyone thanks for joining I'm glad to be here joining and having a conversation with congressman Malinowski and bringing it to your backyard and so he has been a staunch advocate for Somerset County with kovat one seat ride with anything that we need it we call on him he's there there's never been a time that I've called upon him he has not answered the call so I just want to thank him for his vigilance never giving up fighting for us and being a voice in Congress and DC where we know that we're taking care of because we have a seat at the table in the illustrious Congressman Tom Malinowski how are you if Chanelle great to see you well I haven't been called illustrious a lot now let's hope we can earn such words of praise it's it's really good to see you and and I'm I have to say I'm so proud of the work that we've been able to do together all of us in New Jersey in the last three months we were hit so hard by this horrible pandemic and we lost so much beginning with the lives of many people near and dear to us all of the businesses that have to close all of the people who lost their their jobs and at least it was for a purpose at least it was for a reason we pulled together we did what we had to do yeah we see the results in New Jersey we are beating this thing in New Jersey we have very few cases arising new cases a day our public health system passed the test with flying colors we have sufficient testing now finally we are doing the things that we have to do that's the good news yeah bad news New Jersey isn't America and we're not an island and a lot of other places are not doing as well as we are they didn't make as responsible decisions as we did I'm you know I've said in in in anger but with great conviction that we spent two trillion dollars of your money taxpayers money to buy America time to mount an effective Public Health response against coronavirus some of us did it New Jersey we did but some of us didn't and so we are still in danger because this could come back to us from you know last time it came from New York this time it could come from the West and so unfortunately we have to stay vigilant unfortunately we have difficult choices to make about schools we all want them to be open desperately we want kids to be able to go back and parents to be able to have someplace to send their kids especially working moms and dads but we are going to continue to put public health first and unfortunately if we will have some tough choices there as we do in terms of reopening restaurants and other small businesses and so would love to get your perspective on that Chanel meanwhile as you know my top priority in Congress is to get that relief for our state county and local governments so that you can continue to provide the basic services the Somerset County residents take for granted and I don't think there's anything more urgent or important and I think my expectation is by the first week of August we will have resolved something so well my take on opening schools or even reopening system extent to a broader perspective we have to do it safely you are absolutely right no one's going out expanding the footprint of their buildings in order to maintain the social distancing no one's going out buying a new building in order to place people at social distancing whether it's businesses or schools and so we all have a tough decision to make whether it's personally professionally or in government and with that being said there's no cookie cutting way of doing this there are guides there are guidance and there are guidelines and you take those under advisement and you tweak them to fit your situation in circumstance and so while everybody god said being able having to have wear masks and not being able to be practice their liberties as such that they they choose not to wear masks we have to do the right thing and you never regret doing the right thing so the proof is in the pudding the numbers speak for themselves new jersey is at a transmission rate of of 1 and so actually day before yesterday we were actually below 1 and what that means is for every person that's infected another person gets infected so our transmission rate is going down and that's where we want and need to be and so with that being said you just have to keep fighting for the good fight continue to do what we're doing we're definitely in this together I don't think there's not been one person that has not been impacted whether health-wise socioeconomic regardless of the demographics we all have been touched one way or another by this dreadful disease yeah talk to us about Somerset County finances what what your expectations are as far as tax revenues what are you guys thinking might have to be cut if if you don't get relief we're starting those conversations as we're looking forward we introduced an adopted a budget where we did not increase the tax rate even starting off the year with 1.2 million lost in revenues or from a contract with a pandemic getting us dead on we were able to pass the lowest budget in five years and so it comes at a decrease of nine dollars and 11 cents to the average home that costs cost about four hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars and so we're being financially and fiscally responsible but you're right what's next and so if we don't get the aid that we need in Somerset County was one of 12 counties that did not receive aid as one of the criteria was being populace of 500,000 or more and so we did not meet that criteria and therefore we were not part of the pool of the nine out of the 21 minute counties who receive funding and so we're still fighting the good fight to make sure that we get all that we need for our residents and for our County yeah so what you know what we did in the house was passed the heroes Act which incorporates a bill that I'd introduced with about a hundred and fifty co-sponsors Democrats Republicans to deliver relief correctly to local government entities so every municipality in Somerset County and the county itself would qualify for for direct assistance to make up for lost revenues due to the corona virus and you know if you think about it just about everything government does that touches our lives is managed at the local county and state level and you know whether it's cops firefighters our schools Public Works all the social services that the most vulnerable people in our society depend on if we're looking at major revenue loss something's going to have to give and and that's something guaranteed is going to touch the lives of people on this call so we had two months in which McConnell did absolutely nothing he said he felt no sense of urgency I think yesterday he said okay we're gonna start the process now like thank you very much it should have started a long time ago I think there's a there's recognition we have to pass something it probably won't be as generous as the heroes Act but our number one priority in the house as we go into that negotiation is help our state and local and county governments so parts of it thank you Lisa do we want to start taking some absolutely I will surely - yep as we're gonna unmute you done bunch of people have questions about schools opening in the fall but I thought dawn actually had an interesting angle to her so dawn I think you should be unmuted and go ahead and ask your question yeah so I think one of the the big concerns that a lot of people have had and I think it sort of impacts the most vulnerable people is you know access to Internet and access to technical support for using the Internet so I think you know like you know for kids for schools to reopen online which seems like it's going to be a thing for at least part of the school year you know we need to provide some support for for people to use the technology and so I'm just wondering whether any resources are going to be allocated for that yeah so we've already you know we have already allocated pretty significant resources to our school districts not enough but but I you know people should know that under the cares Act even though Somerset County as a county did not get a direct allocation there was a lot that went directly to school districts to help with code 19 related expenses and certainly one of those coded 19 related expenses is helping to set up kids and families with the technology they need for distance learning has not been enough that we did provide some help we also just passed in the house a major infrastructure bill which combines transportation infrastructure money that comes from a committee that I'm on the Transportation Committee so that's good for our roads and bridges and New Jersey Transit and Gateway but we also incorporated a bill to expand broadband access for underserved communities in the United States which are mostly rural communities and I have some in my district out in Warren County particularly where broadband access is still a big problem but also underserved urban communities and so between the kovat relief bills and hopefully we'll have more for this in whatever comes out of our negotiation with McConnell and that infrastructure bill we are trying to take care of this part of the problem look it's one of the lessons of this that should stick with us even after we beaten that Judge the broadband access access to high-speed Internet in America is not a luxury anymore it is a basic condition for survival and if you know immigrant communities low income folks people of color people in underserved rural areas don't have it that is a major inequity in our society but we can't tolerate and locally a lot of the cable companies and technical companies have actually beefed up and actually stood up to the table and providing services at little to no cost for some of the underserved communities so kudos to them yeah I spoken to Verizon about that earlier in the crisis so yeah and and wherever we are where the school is in the fall you know there's gonna be some element of it that happens online very little doubt of that so I don't want anyone disadvantaged right and I think the districts are looking at that and they assess what worked well doing the remote learning and what needs to change or what needs to be expanded so more to come from that the superintendents of schools have met with the DoD and they they have a deadline as to when they're they should have a plan in place so more to come on that from a local level thank you we have another question this time from Beth and she has a question about PPE shortages so my question is because of the outbreaks all over the country we're now hearing that there's shortages of appropriate medical equipment again and in order for schools to reopen they have to have that equipment on hand if even if they open in a hybrid fashion or even we're in the they're open to give out free you know they're still giving out food and having some contact how we gonna ensure that they're gonna get the equipment yeah so number one you're absolutely right because we never had that that national leadership to mobilize the private economy to produce PPE we're not where we need to be in terms of supply and now that it's spiking in Texas and Florida and Georgia and Arkansas and everywhere else the demand has gone up in those states and that affects us even though again we've done everything right we are affected by the bad decisions made in other states and you know it's our first responders it's our hospitals it's doctors and dentists offices and yes absolutely it's schools this is what makes me so angry when I hear politicians like Trump saying the schools have to open don't tell us to open the schools help us to open the schools and the help that we need is is partly thus making sure that there is enough PPE and enough testing because testing is something that may go into any responsible school opening plan we are we've made testing very widely available in New Jersey remember Chanel where we were at the beginning our struggle is just to get one drive-through facility in in Somerset County now you can get tested and you know a bunch of CVS locations and Walmart's and it's not hard to get tested but the time it takes to get your test results has gone back up in New Jersey from like it was two days at one point now they're saying five to seven days and that's really not good because if you have to wait a week to get your test result that's a week when if you have any suspicions you that you were exposed what do you do do you put your life on hold for a week for what will likely be a negative result that you're not sir anyway I am gonna look like where is about to power down so I'm gonna actually move out of my backyard I think this is where transept racing is very important to the process as part of the process if we can start tracing where some of the hotspots are headed off before it becomes a potential hot spot then it can be a little more contained I think of a science project a controlled environment versus an uncontrolled environment so if you know where people have been and crossed paths then you can isolate where it's stemming from I know some people think it's invasion of their privacy or big brother is watching but we need to be able to address quickly triage the issue and and hit it off at the past so that's gonna be very critical to us staying below the 1 transmission rate and not spiking up again so how is contact tracing working in Somerset counties you know if I test positive in Somerset County what's going to happen well we're not doing contact tracing as such as the big concept the big scheme where someone calls you but what happens currently is if you are exposed and you're tested depend there are several questions that are asked and depending on the answers to those questions you will be put into a category whether it's a low risk or high risk and then you will be instructed on what to do next whether your self isolating whether your in self monitoring for fever for the cough and then if you're asymptomatic it's still they're gonna give you a instructions that suit based on your your risk but one of my concerns is that as we're opening things back up you're where how you're exposed it could come from several different sources I'm still not going to church in the physical edifice but if you go to church you're going back to work kids are back to school so what do you do somebody comes home from school and you're exposed you go to work you could potentially be exposed again even if you test negative but you have those different entry points or points of contact that you could potentially be exposed and I think the ownership is not just on government but we all have a role to play for instance I have four people in my household and six people in my family that are asthmatic so what do you do I just do the best I can to stay put so that I don't become exposed and then potentially expose others we're definitely all in this together I think we're learning how interconnected we all really are thank you we're gonna move on to our next question which is from Joseph and he has a question about my favorite topic gateway gateway hi congressman Malinowski and freeholder Robinson thank you for doing this for us and thank you for all you do for us I'm just saying that a 500 billion dollar bill was passed by the house for infrastructure and as part of that 15 billion is the federal government's share of the infrastructure project of 30 billion total so I'm saying do we have assurance that the Senate is going to pass it and the president is going to sign that five hundred billion dollar bill so we can finally get Gateway started um you know the answer to that question no give you assurance does the Thursday will come much less that but here's what I know the first step in the Gateway project is not the tunnel it is the portal Bridge the rickety hundred and ten year old railway bridge the swing bridge between Newark and Secaucus that is has been the the big source the biggest source of delays on New Jersey Transit train trains and that was held up along with the tunnel and we beat them up for the last year and a half I've been relentless on that and we now have the portal bridge approved funded and approved so that's gonna you know that's in the engineering phase it will hopefully move to construction relatively soon so that's one the tunnel is still being blocked by Trump because he doesn't like us they've been sitting on an environmental impact statement for over two years that is ready they just lost it somewhere um so we're still at war with them on that the bill that we passed does provide money for what we refer to as projects of national significance which is code language for things like Gateway and it's got a lot of other provisions I put in there to limit the flexibility of the Secretary of Transportation to block projects like Gateway for example by refusing to release their environmental impact statements as you say this is going to the Senate and you know ultimately if we get a deal with the Senate from Scott Ivy for it and I don't know it it's not impossible because you know every so often Trump goes out there and says I want a big infrastructure bill well we just gave him big infrastructure bill he's gonna think that it's too friendly to the environment you know that's a bad thing if we're if we're trying to protect the planet from climate change even as we fix and build things in America so we'll have that fight and there's there's a way to have it and compromise and still pass something this year that helps us on gateway that's where I hope to be and then hopefully next year a new president president you know Vice President Biden just put out his climate and infrastructure plan which would be great for us in New Jersey hopefully we'll be able to do something more ambitious thank you thank you can you unmute Joseph Joe proceed go ahead Joseph sorry you were muted oh not only will it be good for New York and New Jersey and in general which is 20% of the world of the US economy but it will create jobs and a lot of people are unemployed exactly not just the direct construction and engineering jobs but all the jobs that are supported indirectly by having a functioning transportation system people being able to commute it's the key to our economy thank you thank you thank you so much so our next question is from Carl Frederick he has a question about election security and an infrastructure loading into the structure I thought I was on the Gateway answer you caught me by surprise I wholeheartedly support both of you and I love the work you've done over the years in your career congressman ask look I mean all this is great but I've got deep concerns about the integrity of our elections and do we have what concerns to the commissionaire in the congressman have and what can we do to protect and what can be done to protect the integrity of our elections in New Jersey in the district yeah I'm less concerned about New Jersey because we have good good leadership but I am concerned about the national election the the president seems to have as his plan B if he loses the election an effort to discredit its integrity the more chaos the more confusion that can be sowed the better for whoever loses so I think we have to get ready for that you've seen a major campaign from the president over the last couple of months to discredit by mail people voting from home even though his own family does does it even though there are states across America that have been 100% both by mail for many years all of this I think is just to set up the argument that if he loses that it was raped and we have foreign adversaries that will be amplifying that argument every single chance they have because they have the same interest they want to discredit the United States they they want us all to question the integrity of our system and not to trust anything so that's the problem hey it's really easy to describe the problem huh the question is what we can do about it Congress the Senate the house husband Mike we've been passing bill after bill to protect the integrity of of our elections every one of those bills goes to the Senate to die because Mitch McConnell is explicitly openly opposed to the federal government telling the states what they should be doing and should not be doing with regard to elections so I cannot I assure you that anything will pass and then of course the president would have to sign it and I don't think he would sign any bill that interferes with his plans for November and post November where does that leave us number one Congress has provided money and I hope in whatever comes out of the heroes Act negotiation he will provide more funding for election security for every state that wants to protect itself and I think most states will number two I'm hoping that we hold hearings on the various nefarious ways in which confidence in the election could be undermined through voter suppression through deliberate you know efforts to minimize the number of in-person voting stations and minority communities to you know everything else that you know many of us have seen these these strange-sounding scenarios how the person who actually wins the popular vote in a particular state may not be awarded its electoral votes you know crazy sounding things but that we have to be vigilant about and I think the more sunlight we shine on these possibilities the harder it will be for anybody to to pursue them and then the rest is up to us you know the silver lining what happened in Wisconsin of what happened in Georgia when you had blatant covert 19 related voter suppression was that people voted anyway turnout was up not down in both of those states and so this is not satisfying we are just going to have to have the determination to power through it and not allow anyone to take our most fundamental rights away and I think locally right now it's still early even though we're trending downward with the transmission rate which will put us in a better place to not go to a vbm for the general nothing goes without areas of improvement and even with this primary there were some things that we can we can learn from lessons learn and do things differently but I know the clerk's and the Board of Elections are not total DBM in the general with that being said some of the recommendations coming from the public as well as from Board of Elections and clerks is a hybrid model both early voting modeling or hybrid like we just had in the primary but given an opportunity for more people to go in person but it's all it's still too early to tell but I think and I'm confident that if we continue to trend downward with the transmission rate we should be okay but they're nowhere near making a decision as of this date so we'll just have to wait and see hunker down and and do what we have to do certainly there are some concerns with anything whether it's done electronically whether it's done by mail you know so many theories out there but for Somerset County I'm confident in our board of elections in a clerks office I think the one thing I would be concerned about from now is if we are nowhere near making that decision because I'm sure that sticker or a County Clerk would agree and you would agree that whatever we decide to do we need to decide soon so that we have time to get ready especially if there is a much heavier than usual reliance on both by mail even if it's hybrid system we gotta be we have to know that in August I think so the first time I would agree I would agree hi Meg thank you for those answers very thoughtful one quick follow-up you to a comment you just made congressman how realistic is the threat to defund or under the postal Postal Service as we go into the election it seems to be coming from the White House oh yeah it's very serious because we haven't been they haven't allowed us to fund it so it's more than a threat the president seems to have a beef with the post office which may be partly because of his personal feud with Jeff Bezos of Amazon I know this sounds weird but this is how we're governed right now Bezos owns the Washington Post which is a thorn in the president's side and as in a lot of third-world dictatorships we now have a leadership that will try to punish private business owners that are a thorn in the side of the leader and Amazon Bezos as other company relies on the post office and so Trump keeps saying here you know you're getting a sweet deal from the government and then there's the vote-by-mail which for most reasonable people in America is a reason to fund the post office but perhaps for some is a reason not to fund thickest office if you want to disrupt the election so that's where we have been we proposed fully funding it in the heroes Act keeping in mind it needs full funding not because the post office is mismanaged not because the post office is losing money but because of a a mandate that Congress imposed on the post office in the 2000s to pay prepay pre-fund it's pensions for its employees 50 years in advance that's the problem that's the reason they need help so we proposed fixing that and the heroes Act you know the subject to negotiation with McConnell my hope is that wherever Trump is on this there are enough Republican senators representing rural states that are heavily dependent on mail delivery that they're just not going to allow this to continue well thank you for that congressman all relinquished before lease may become you can't be you can't be kicked out of the country like they did to you in brain so we've got that going for us so you never know well you know when right now no one is accepting people from America you know the president got his wall unfortunately it's a while everyone else bills to keep us in so yeah even if they kicked me out I don't know where they would send me I think what's that's from woody she has a question about which I think is this pertain to a lot of folks in our district self-employed people and how they are sort of falling under the radar a little bit so what do you go ahead yeah hi there are congressman hello Commissioner to be I guess thanks for taking the time and you know staying in touch I got to tell you this is gonna be the silver lining of this whole situation is that I hope you'll continue to deliver democracy in this form going format going forward because it's really just been awesome I feel like this is retail politics at its best so I basically have thought about the question and essentially it's for people who took the PPP there are self-employed but their business is really cratered because of this little thing you know when you means-test us on our 2019 income you know it looks a lot better than it is today and you know we appreciated to support through PPP but that was meant in last two and a half months and the end of July now so just kind of curious to see what's happening with that and then I have a follow-on question that I think you're gonna want me to ask you that has to do about how we get you reelected well thank you woody so we did extend PPP I know like you know if you already applied for it and you exhausted the funds that's not necessarily helpful but for some of our businesses it has been helpful that we extended it through August that they could spend the money over a longer of time if there's anyone out there who hasn't applied yet there's still money left in the pipeline so they can and then the big question is what are we gonna do in this next Cove in nineteen bill to keep the help coming again we shouldn't have needed it right we should have been able through a serious disciplined lockdown over a couple of months to beat this thing that didn't happen so now we're gonna have to spend more money there's debate about unemployment assistance a lot of people arguing that the $600 a week that we provided including two people who are self-employed as you know is was appropriate in March but is too generous now because it disincentivizes workers from going back to work I'm not sure if that's true but I think realistically it's not likely that we are going to extend that very generous unemployment bonus through December so the question is what else can we do I think I don't have all the answers but I do think that we need to focus on sectors of the economy that are hardest hit so like back in March we wanted the entire economy to shut down right well no matter what your your your your job we wanted you to stay home and so it made sense to target everybody now we are gradually reopening with different sectors of the economy going faster than others so one sector that is particularly hard-hit is the restaurant sector restaurants and bars you know what I we don't want them to make it maybe we can't have them at a hundred percent capacity we still don't have indoor dining in New Jersey and I think that's the right call but it's incredibly tough for these wonderful small businesses that provide so much character to our communities so I think we need a dedicated program just to help independent restaurants for example and somehow or other we have to continue to include big mortars and self-aware people in whatever we do I was one of the innovations in the care Zac that was good and we've got to find a way to to keep that going yes well I'm really glad to hear you talk about restaurants my niece was just laid off and it's a real bummer you know we need restaurants and we're gonna want them when this is all over so yeah there certainly should be some prioritization to this and by all means I did not mean to imply that I was dissatisfied I was grateful to get the money and have made it stretch through but you know sort of running down at this point and as you pointed out I think we're in for a pretty long haul here and so the banks are thankfully in better shape but how much more can they take of people not making payments you know I mean at some point this whole thing is a house of cards so I'm praying that you get reelected and you know we get some reasonable people down there they can figure out how to dig our way out of this that's my next question which is you know what are you doing to beat Tom Kane jr. and what can we do to help and what do you wish you could do but you can't afford over the next 90 days I mean this is a you know the presidential election for me in new jersey is kind of you know I'm gonna vote but I don't really feel like I have much you know skin in that game because we're gonna beat them you know up and down here in New Jersey you on the other hand or a battle that I can make it impact on so please lay it out for us make your play thank you thank you for saying that I make that point Allah we're all going to be obsessed by the presidential but New Jersey is not going to decide the presidential we're not going to decide who controls the Senate either as important as that is but we may very well be the state that has possibly the biggest say again in who is in charge in the House of Representatives so like you know we all got we ought to do our job my job is to get reelected and I think all of us in this district we have the privilege of living in a closely divided congressional district which means whatever our point of view Democrat Republican we can really make a difference through our votes and our in our efforts what am i doing the most important thing I can do to beat Tom Kane is just to try to do a good job and to be there for people who need help to be present that's why we do so many of these I want to be first of all I enjoy it I think it's fun he doesn't seem to because he's never done a town hall in his entire political career but number two I think it's a responsibility it's a duty and it doesn able me to reach a lot of people so one thing you can do to help as we continue to do these online town halls so to speak is invite your friends to join hey you know congressman is going to be doing this Q&A session check them out you may not be decided you may not know what you think of him just check it out ask a question so you know if you're on our social media you'll know when we're doing this help us spread the word help us bring in people who don't normally think of spending an hour with their member of Congress is something that they're gonna do on a Wednesday early evening that's that's my other one you seem like such a nice person and I just wondering you know because the GOP is taking us to such a very bad place it's you know ripe for Lincoln project style attack ads that tied Tom Kane did that party even if he's a nice guy the bottom line is you know he's gonna have to fall in line so you know we got to hit back we got to get your numbers up man it is time to fight well we're putting out a lot of stuff okay so if you you know if you're interested in helping the campaign that's another way to do it look at our campaign social media you know we put out something on the Gateway Tunnel recently and pointed out that one reason you know why we don't have one seat ride for commuters in our district on the Raritan Valley it's because Kane supported Christie in canceling the arc tunnel in 2010 we'd have one seat bribe right now if not for that stupidity yeah and in terms of his cowardice on trunk don't get me don't get me started like I could talk about that all day because I really firmly believe that what is happening to this country right now hundred and thirty five plus thousand people dead because we have complete abdication of responsibility at the top you know argumentation sorry you know the tunnel project is genius cuz I go into New York all the time and the reality is by not having it it suppresses the value of our homes it makes our commutes longer right you know and the Republicans you know took the salt tax and stuck it in our I you know so today there is plenty of material to work here work with your I will definitely reach out to the campaign and try to help any way I can you know it's point is as we put out stuff like that right you guys can if you agree if you agree with it you guys can help spread it and it's a lot more effective if your friends get an email from you or a posting from you because they know you and they trust you then if they get a paid ad for me right right so everybody can be an ambassador for our campaign for the ideas that we're putting out there and for I think the legitimate criticism of this guy who buries his head in the sand who refuses to say a damn thing about what the leader of his party is doing to this country apart from I support the President and that cowardice has to be called out in my view okay well thank you I'll definitely check out your Facebook page and your website and look for anything too shareable that yeah absolutely oh I would say woody also check out the Somerset County we have formed the first in the state the economic recovery task force to actually work and help businesses and business owners and so look forward to more of the report just came out actually see that yesterday about the next steps in a short-term and a long-term plan and helping the business community certainly if we would have gotten some of the monies that the nine counties received we could be giving out grants to some of the businesses along with to supplement what the EDA is doing well we're certainly there the business partnership is beginning seminars I understand that the monies went quickly but we're tapping too into every resource possible to help well we really appreciate all you're doing both of you and good luck you know let's take it to them in the fall thank you thank you everybody and I think that is actually the perfect way to end this I want to thank you all so much for being here tonight for your great questions I'm seeing they keep popping up and more good ones keep coming up we will continue to do these we're going to try to come up with some more creative ways to do this please get involved there is in the chat there are ways to sign up for phone bank help we're gonna be hundred days is on the 25th so there's a lot of exciting things coming up so please get involved with the campaign and we hope to see you in real life one of these days soon but in the meantime we'll just keep doing this so be well everyone can I just yes if there are any questions that did not get if they're registered and their email addresses if there's for the county or for me let's connect offline and I'll try and get answers to those questions and then with Don had a second part of a question about technology certainly the school districts are doing all that they can to support those who need the technical support this is the new day and age great thank you so much thank you Thank You Chanel for joining us and only

thank you mr chair i appreciate you uh having this hearing uh important important discussion like i as you know uh i agree with you that it's essential that we pass comprehensive federal legislation to not just deschedule uh and not just legalize marijuana nationwide but also uh regulate right let's be informed by what some of the states have done i appreciate my home state of california being uh referenced just a minute ago where the evolution not just in public opinion but in the laws of california was i believe thoughtful and frankly voter driven years ago when voters of california took us the direction of legalizing marijuana for medical purposes only first and there was significant time that went past before we took the leap we weren't the first it was after washington after colorado in allowing for recreational use but again with regulation taxation everything that comes with uh so the goal of descheduling legalizing regulating is something that obviously could be achieved under the cannabis administration an opportunity act which would among other things also require the expungement of federal non-violent cannabis convictions and provide for re-sentencing for individuals that are currently incarcerated for marijuana offenses the bill would also limit negative consequences resulting from certain marijuana offenses on immigration proceedings it would prevent discrimination with respect to public benefits and aid state efforts to provide loans and establish licensing programs for small businesses in the industry my first question is for mr angelos i mean i'll echo senator durbin's comments on your impact your experience and its impact on the conversation here i'd love to hear from you just a little bit more how do you think expungement of marijuana offenses would help others who are or have been in your situation yeah thank you for the question senator i think expungements are absolutely critical even myself with a pardon still cannot fully participate in society when i first got out i wasn't even able to get an apartment because of my felony conviction and so it prevents me from actually having a meaningful second chance yeah that's a pretty common uh for folks like i said in or have been in your situation being able to apply for a job right there's a reason there was a whole ban the box uh campaign and we're slowly making progress there dr burnett question for you could you speak to the racial aspect built into our current sentencing system and how it has exacerbated the economic mental and educational inequities that we see throughout the country yeah i think that when you compare the harms associated with cannabis use to the harms associated with being incarcerated it's a night and day comparison i mean as mr angelos has demonstrated you have significant constraints on your ability to be able to participate in society after coming out of a criminal justice system which uh you know bans you and across the board whether you're participating in trying to get a job trying to get an apartment trying to vote trying to just be a meaningful member of society if you want to be healthy you have to be welcomed back into society and i think that you know um we can do a lot through this act to be able to facilitate second chances for people who have been harmed by cannabis prohibition thank you and mr chair and calling something i hope that we uh stay mindful of as we move towards not just legalization but regulation as i mentioned we know that this proportion impacted the criminal justice system on communities of color african-americans latinos but in the areas where marijuana has been legalized only one percent of businesses in the field are black-owned so uh we really do have to take a holistic view on all this uh in my time remaining mr chair i just want to touch a little bit upon law enforcement and an aspect of being smarter on crime the enforcement of marijuana offenses has been incredibly costly for governments particularly state and local governments i know before legalization in california was estimated to cost the state 300 million dollars per year to enforce marijuana laws that's just the state tab even more troublesome than the cost these efforts were often aimed at criminalizing individual offenders sometimes for little as a joint rather than large traffickers which has been the source of hundreds of thousands of marijuana related arrests across the country and those in the trafficking business are probably trafficking more than just marijuana so that's where the focus should have been but it wasn't the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use has freed law enforcement to focus more on more serious issues chief jackson could you speak to how federal cannabis laws divert resources for more serious crimes and discuss the types of crimes your department is now able to focus resources on yes uh one of the things that that's not in my biography from the time i retired from the baltimore police department until my current position i was a professor of sociology and criminal justice at a community college and in working on my dissertation i've learned some some pretty interesting things and that there are certain fundamental aspects of american life in our democracy that we have to address you know we have to address the institution of family we have to address the institution of our education and even i think in my personal opinion more importantly our faith-based institutions absence of those then you have heavy-handed police and and especially minority communities you're going to have heavy-handed the heavy-handed burden of courts and corrections we've run a re-entry program i take a social approach to law enforcement now meaning that in order to have stabilization in communities and peace in the communities you got to address the root causes of crime to begin with and so when inmates are paroled in the city of annapolis come back in the city of annapolis what we do senators we embrace them and we try to get them out of the environment that caused them to have to go into the illicit drug trade to begin with we try to find them jobs this is the annapolis pd i have sworn members who assist young men and women to get jobs to to to get them their ged a driver's license we have partnerships with the state of maryland i wish we had more federal support for those type of of programs uh and i do think that uh uh that that the target has been most of our clients so to speak for lack of a better term are minority uh men the vast majority of some minority women and as i sit here and listen to the testimony today i came into law enforcement i graduated from the baltimore police department 40 years ago and many of my commanders and supervisors were world war ii korean war veterans it was a different american a different mindset we were systematically socialized at the prototypical drug dealer and those individuals involved in the drug distribution ring whether it be marijuana or more serious dangerous drugs like heroin and cocaine were african-american males and we were taught to target them in our enforcement efforts and we were strategically put into places throughout baltimore city to address that and the running joke was that if you wanted to transport drugs in baltimore then you would get a white male to do it because they were far less likely to be targeted or stopped for the enforcement of drugs so when i came back into law enforcement it's been my mission for the time that i have as the chief of police in the city of annapolis is take a more social approach so we don't have to react to social disorganization we can be it on the front end and that's what's so important about the federal the power of the federal government if this act is if it becomes law then it sends a strong message to local jurisdictions far beyond the capital city of annapolis that we're serious about prison reform we're serious about mass incarceration and we're serious about uh you know i appreciate it but uh senator cornyn and i've got a good relationship with him that i'm eroding quickly by not deferring to him and letting him thank you

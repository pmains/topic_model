[Music] so it's a quiet session on the surface of the market amazing things though happening beneath uh although right now really all eyes are in dc as we await the congressional budget office to score president biden's buildback better bill that's now expected sometime later today now we already know that if it scored honestly the cost would be about 5 trillion dollars 4.9 uh over 10 years not the advertised 1.75 trillion but there's so many ways to gain this cbo so even with this official scoring lawmakers they're going to have to take really a deeper dive and look at some more sincere numbers joining me now republican congresswoman nancy mace of south carolina congresswoman mace um you know we already saw the director of the cbo state that uh for instance building this irs army would only bring in 125 billion not 400 billion that they say they would spend that's 275 billion dollar deficit right there and of course that's a drop in a bucket compared to the one trillion dollars if you make permanent these child tax credits which we know the goal is so i mean you talk to your colleagues across the aisle are the moderates going to take a stand here or will the or will it breeze through the house and just have one person maybe two standing in the way it's hard to say at this point i'm talking with uh my friends and allies on the other side of the aisle i can tell you that i i believe moderate democrats are fearful of what the cbo score will say is saying right now we know that it's the 1.75 price tag as you mentioned really isn't it's much higher than that when you look at the longevity and length of time these programs will consume the amount of money we were told it wouldn't add to the debt it's it's going to it's going to hurt the deficit and all this spending as you know very well charles is going to add to our inflation lows extensively there's no doubt about it now you've actually spoken in the past about fixing government spending habits right getting rid of uh quote uh sacred cows that are loved by by both parties to be quite frank i love your optimism when you talk about that but let's face it power corrupts absolutely and it feels like these folks when they get to dc uh they never want to leave unless they think they're going to lose a re-election so tell us about these sacred cows can we ever honestly get rid of some of them with the right people up here i do believe that we can as i've mentioned previously it's been both sides of the aisle republicans and democrats that have raised the debt ceiling because since consistently over 80 times and it's been republicans and democrats that have added uh spending it it is problematic but when you look at the numbers we're facing today this is beyond reach and if you look at the the pushback in virginia recently and even places like new jersey in the elections a couple of weeks ago this is not where the american people are at i think they want sound fiscal policy uh reasonable and healthy economy and this doesn't get us there so um it's just not the right move and i don't i just don't understand at this point why they're still pushing it through other than hey 12 democrats have retired for next year and they're going into what could be a very bloody midterm election next year

6 DAYS, THE GOVERNMENT OF  AZERBAIJAN HAS FORCIBLY CUT OFF  120,000 ETHNIC ARMEINIANS IN THE REPUBLIC OF ARTSAK. THEY'RE CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD. FOOD HAS BECOME SCARCE. THEY HAVE TO RATION AND FIND  EVEN BASIC ITEMS. DIAPERS AND MEDICINE SUPPLIES  HAVE BECOME SO LOW THAT FACEBOOK PAGES ARE OPENING WHERE  RESIDENTS ARE TRYING TO FIND  THESE ITEMS FROM THEIR  NEIGHBORS. RESIDENTS ARE SEPARATED FROM  THEIR FAMILIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER IN ARMENIA,  INCLUDING CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN ATTENDING SCHOOL OR VISITING  FAMILIES. AZERBAIJAN HAS EVEN GONE SO FAR  AS TO CUT OFF NATURAL GAS DURING THE DEPTH OF WINTER. A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IS  BREWING, AND WE SHOULD ACT TO  PREVENT IT. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS  ATTEMPT IS. IT'S AN ATTEMPT BY AZERBAIJAN TO FORCE THE ETHNIC ARMENIAN  POPULATION OUT OF THEIR HOMES BY MAKING LIFE THERE IMPOSSIBLE. THE TACTIC IS BLOCKADE. THE EFFECT IS CIVILIAN  DEPRIVATION. THE OBJECT IS ETHNIC CLEANSING. BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. LISTEN TO AZERBAIJANI DICTATOR  WHO MADE HIS INTENTIONS CLEAR  WHEN THIS BLOCKADE UNFOLDED BY  SAYING, WHOEVER DOES NOT WANT TO BECOME A CITIZEN CAN LEAVE. WHAT DOES HE MEAN? THE ETHNIC ARMENIANS ARE  CITIZENS. THEY ARE CITIZENS OF THE  REPUBLIC. BUT HE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THAT  CITIZENSHIP. AND INSTEAD USES IT AS AN EXCUSE TO ETHIC NATIONALLY --  ETHNICALLY CLEANSE. WE KNOW DICTATORS DON'T OFTEN  RESPOND TO CALLS FOR JUSTICE. I ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO PUT  MORE WEIGHT BEHIND THESE CALLS  TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE  CONSEQUENCES TO AZERBAIJAN BY  PLUNGING THE PEOPLE OF ARTSAKH  INTO THIS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS,  INCLUDING SANCTIONS, IF  NECESSARY. THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD  ENFORCE SECTION 907 TO STOP ALL  MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO  AZERBAIJAN AND PROVIDE CRITICAL  HUMANITARIAN AID TO THE PEOPLE  OF ARTSAKH, ACTIONS THAT ARE  LONG OVERDUE. WHEN I CAME TO CONGRESS ALMOST  27 YEARS AGO, I HAVE INTRODUCED  AND FOUGHT FOR A RESOLUTION TO  RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, THE FIRST GENOCIDE OF THE 20TH  CENTURY. BACK THEN IT WAS NUMBER UNCOMMON FOR MEMBERS OF THIS BODY TO  MINIMIZE OR EVEN DENY THE  SYSTEMIC ETHNIC CLEANSING AND  MURDER OF 1 1/2 ARMENIANS,  GREEKS BY THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE BUT THEY DID NOT GIVE UP. FOR DECADES THEY SPOKE TRUTH TO  POWER AND TURNED THE POLITICAL  TIDE UNTIL THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WAS RECOGNIZED BY THIS HOUSE AND THEN BY PRESIDENT BIDEN. IT MAY HAVE TAKEN LONGER BUT WE  GOT THERE. THIS IS A PAINFUL MOMENT FOR THE AR MEN YOON COMMUNITY --  ARMENIAN COMMUNITY. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE ARMENIAN  PEOPLE WILL RISE IN STRENGTH. ARMENIANS HAVE OUTLIVED THOSE  WHO SAID THERE WAS NO ARMENIAN  GENOCIDE AND THEY WILL OUTLIVE  THOSE WHO WILL SAY THERE IS NO  ARTSAKH. I URGE THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION  AND THIS BODY TO TAKE FORCEFUL  STANCE AGAINST ARIZONA ARIZONA'S SHAMEFUL -- AZERBAIJAN'S  SHAMEFUL ATTEMPTS OF TH

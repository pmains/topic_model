well good morning good morning everyone my name is Chris Murphy I have the honor of standing on stage today with my hero with my friend with my partner Gabby Giffords as well as two of our heroes from the March for our lives movement we are so excited to be a part of a history-making forum here today listen there are a lot of days where I wish that I didn't see the things that I saw and hear the things that I heard that day in December of 2012 in Sandy Hook Connecticut the state that I represent and there was no more heartbreaking moments than the spring of 2013 when we lost a vote on the Senate floor to do what 90% of Americans want which is to make sure that when you get a gun in this country if to go through a background check and I thought that if Sandy Hook hadn't changed everything if Gabby's shooting hadn't changed everything then then what could but I quickly came to the realization that this wasn't a matter of losing the argument this was simply a matter of not having enough political power back then the NRA and the gun lobby they were stronger than we were they were ready for those parents who came up trying to change the laws of this nation to make sure that kids and adults are safer and we went about the project of creating an anti-gun violence infrastructure in this country which would be just as strong as the forces of the status quo that we were fighting and there were several fulcrum moments in that build-up amongst them was that decision that Gabby and mark made in the days after Sandy Hook to stand up an organization which today is one of the strongest in the nation standing up for common sense gun laws in this country and then shortly thereafter in the tragic moments following the shooting in parkland a group of unafraid courageous and mouthy kids decided to step forward and lead this conversation themselves and so I can say today as I field regular calls from my Republican colleagues in the Senate trying to come up with creative ways that we can finally get beyond this moment of separation I can say today that we are now as a movement stronger than the gun lobby and we are stronger than the gun lobby in part because we have candidates running for president who decided to be bold who have decided to be courageous in not only their voice and the passion that they bring to this issue but the specific proposals and plans that they are laying before the country you are gonna hear from them today and as I remind audiences over and over again who are part of this movement we are part of a great social change movement in this country that's what the history books are going to say about us but the great social change movements that we read about are not those that meet success right off the bat the history books write about the movements that encounter obstacle after obstacle failure after failure but are so confident in the righteousness of their cause that they refuse to give up that they see that moment in time in which they will be victorious that is what they are going to write about us and we are at one of those moments today in which the ground is changing underneath us and you are going to hear that in the bold plans for change from the candidates who will come before you I'm so proud to be part of this movement

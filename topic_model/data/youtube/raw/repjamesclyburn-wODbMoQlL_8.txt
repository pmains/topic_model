joining us now is the House Majority Whip congressman james Clyburn he is the number three Democrat in the House Congress and we're gonna talk about the shutdown negotiations in these speeches last night in just a moment but I do want to get your reaction to the news about rod Rosenstein given that he has been the one overseeing the Ruscha investigation does his departure in your mind raise the stakes or increase the need to pass some legislation protecting robert muller i really think so thank you so much for having that but I do believe that we need to act in the Congress to protect this investigation we're hearing more and more every day how great this threat to this bureaucracy is all about and so we must protect that investigation we must protect the product that is already produced and hopefully continue to go forward to Mitchell be ruled out what it was that we were confronted with two years ago and to make sure that we do not fall victim to that going forward so yes we ought to be protect this investigation and what to do is legislatively you have heard some of your newer members call for impeachment and soon using rather colorful language as a member of leadership what is your message to them my message is that we should not get out in front of this investigation protect it let it go forward get the product that's produced from it and then we were to determine whether or not we would act and how he would act I want to ask about the government shutdown which is approaching the longest in our nation's history the president delivered a speech last night talking about the need in his mind for boarder barrier funding the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer then gave their response how close are we to a deal well I think we're very close to a deal I think that when we put up these bills today we will start been looking at financial services to do what we can to protect those people who like I used to do when I was a public school teacher I always clam zero every year and look forward to getting the return on my tax investments and of course we want to protect that so we're gonna put up a bill today so that people can get their tax returns then we are going to visit agriculture we're gonna visit transportation and HUD and then we looked at the resources to open up our paths I believe that we continue with this we and send these bills to the Senate I think that in the not-too-distant future the Senate will act and the president will respond in a positive way well Mitch McConnell has shown no sign that he's willing to take that road yet nor has the president of the United States and while the house will takes actions on those individual appropriations that doesn't directly address what the president was talking about last night which is border security there are actually a lot of areas of agreement between what the president said and what I know that Democrats in the house believes so what do you think is important in terms of border security what do you want to spend money on in border security what I would love to spend money on what I call a smart wall rather than a concrete edifice we cannot protect border concrete we can protect the body using the technology that's available to us to wall off intrusions by using that technology and so a smart wall is what we Democrats have been talking about and we will give the person of what is required to erect it's such a smart ball what material is the smart wall made out of because the president has given up concrete he's no longer talking concrete he's using the phrase steel barrier can a steel barrier be what you're calling a smart wall no what I'm calling a smart law is the technologies we have drones using the Internet to effectuate that now there may be places along where we can show up the fencing that's already been there by doing better fencing replacing it with these Steel's slats or whatever you may call them but there are places where we cannot erect fences without taking people's property it's kind of interesting to me that my Republican friends have been talking about eminent domain being such an intrusion on people's freedoms who cannot build a wall without eminent domain taking people's property and that's not the way we ought to go we talked to the people down there they do not want a wall and we ought to accommodate them as we should since let me clear no new fencing yes to replace fencing that need to be replaced okay but okay right north well new but not additional is there a crisis so new but not additional which is interesting it's asking me the democratic line um is there a crisis at the border the president said there's a humanitarian crisis at our border is there absolutely not we have a challenge Oh our humanitarian issues or challenges for us but no crisis six apprehensions did not make a crisis when you have thousands and thousands of encounters on the people who delivered the Democratic response last night were the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi they were standing side by side the performance of both the president and the House Speaker in the menorah leader made fun of by the late night comics did this go in your mind as you plan as you had hoped was it the optimal Democratic response well you know people deal with images they make fun of whatever they would like to make fun of I'd like to focus on substance and I think the substance of what the Democratic response is all about is very clear and not lost on the American people I think if you look at the president's performance as I said to a friend this morning we saw a reckless president morph into a feckless presidency and that to me is what we saw in the president last night Carson James farmer thanks so much for being with us this morning happiness

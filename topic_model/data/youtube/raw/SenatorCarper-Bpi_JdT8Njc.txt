i'm sorry i didn't get here sooner but that's great to see all of you i have a couple questions i wanted to want to start uh off by talking and asking you to talk with us about the need for a whole of government ppe procurement strategy and uh uh i would say this this question will be for you miss correa but um we talked about the need to protect americans by ensuring that ppe imported from other countries is legitimate uh but counterfeits are only a small fraction of the problem as you know since march i'm told that hospital states and local governments have reported dire shortages of ppe and i hear a rising again of those those concerns these shortages have become more acute in recent weeks as cases have shot up likely contributing to a cycle of even greater demand as the chief procurement officer at dhs i assume it would be helpful to you to have a whole of government strategy designed to ensure availability of sufficient ppe including from domestic sources it seems the president could provide such a strategy in part by issuing orders to domestic manufacturers to produce ppe on the defense production act do you agree that such a coordinated federal strategy would help you to keep in us to help us to keep costs down and to ensure quality and the second half of that question would be has dhs conveyed the need for such a strategy to the white house and what has been the response if you could handle those that i'd appreciate it thank you again welcome thank you sir thank you for your question um certainly a coordinated procurement strategy is always going to benefit anytime that we can bring our sources our resources together identify the supplies that are needed and engage our manufacturing entities out there to support that need it it is going to be beneficial to the government to the to the state local tribal organizations and all the institutions that serve the public with respect to a communication of any such strategy or request for such a strategy i i don't have that information i can certainly check with our officials at dhs who normally communicate with the white house all right thank you um my second question would be for you as as well deals with sharing covert 19 test results in public health i.t the pandemic this pandemic has exposed the cracks in our public health system and in particular our antiquated public health i.t infrastructure in too many parts of our country public health departments are relying on pen and paper there are fax machines or old incompatible software to collect and share covert 19 test results what are dhs and fema doing to help update and integrate public health data such as test results and demographic information in major transit points such as airports train stations and ports what rules govern acquisition of innovative technologies and how can we ensure that fema and dhs procurement officials have the necessary resources that they need to identify legitimate operators who can help bring our systems into the 21st century sir i can only answer the question from the perspective of procurement and as i mentioned earlier we have several authorities that we want to use and continue using to invite commercial innovative solutions that we can apply throughout our infrastructure be it for supplies services or products i believe the appropriate officials probably to discuss the it infrastructure are really our cybersecurity information security agency as well as probably the health and human services but i will certainly take that question back and get you additional information good i'll welcome that a follow-up question to that that one if i can one of the strengths of taiwan's public health systems uh for example has been the country's ability to integrate demographic data from travelers with their public health system what is dhs doing with hhs and with cdc to ensure that domestic and international travelers code 19 test results or symptomatic information such as temperature checks are quickly inaccurately collected and shared uh i'm not the appropriate individual because i don't work on the immigration data i don't know if my colleagues at the time anybody else want to try that anybody uh senator that's not my area of responsibility within cbp but we are working with cdc and other agencies as we work on the plan on how we will monitor travelers that we process once we begin to receive more international travelers right now that we're about at five percent of where we were last year at this time in terms of international travel but i but i will take that question back and make certain we get you the right answer on what cbp is doing with respect to monitoring travel yep thanks so much mr german there's a company actually a delaware company that grew out of dupont has been around for about 30 years and they operate in i think about 90 countries around the world and a bunch of health-related companies in in the us the name's labware labware and what they do imagine if you were a small suitcase that has entered a tablet that tablet would be used instead of pen and paper to take down the information from people that are about to be tested and they use their driver's license to actually has a bar code on the back of our driver's license to bring down and to unite with the the information from the tablet uh who this is and what their background is where they live and everything and you they marries with that the test results could be a swab it could be blood or whatever test results puts it up on the cloud brings it down to put it in public health agencies across the country it's really great stuff and it helps make more accurate information more quickly and it's actually very helpful i think in terms of tracing that sort of thing so i just lay that at our feet american technology thank you senator carver now we go back to senator cassidy and and uh if senator cardin

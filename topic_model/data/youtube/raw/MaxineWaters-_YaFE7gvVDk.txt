i'm pleased to be joined today by civil rights icon congressman john lewis from atlanta and representative maxine waters from los angeles she is the most senior of the 12 african-american women currently serving in the united states congress certainly want to thank both you for joining us here in washington watch congressman lewis 1963 marching washington for jobs and freedom you ended the speech by saying quote wake up america wake up for we cannot stop and we will not be patient earlier we talked to ben jealous here's the naacp he said in 2009 african-americans cannot be patient how do you craft a black agenda in the age of a black president i think it's possible and we must have a black agenda during an age of a black president there's so many black americans that have been left out and left behind they're still hurting and we still must say you tell us to wait you tell us to be patient we cannot be patient we cannot wait we want health care and we want it now and we must help this president who happened to be black who happened to be a strong leader help him get this piece of legislation through the congress congresswoman walters is that the real issue looking at him as simply and maybe difficult as another president by saying look these are the issues that we've always stood for the congressional black caucus the conscience of the congress and so therefore we would not waver even with you sitting in the white house one thing we know for sure we don't have to educate him about what our issues are in the past we have had to educate presidents about our agenda who we are our expectations uh what history has taught us we don't have to do that with him he knows what the issues are all we expect for him is to act on them and act on them in new and creative ways help to get things done without making a big deal of it just do it and what are those issues congressman you spoke of health care one of those issues ben jealous mentioned the whole issue they spared between crack cocaine and powder cocaine folks are talking about education what is on the horizon that frankly african-americans should be focusing on for the next year leading up to the 2010 elections when it comes to the issues that are part of the black agenda well we have many issues the many problems many unmet needs but we need to give the african-american community we need to give this president a major victory and health care is one of the victory that we can give to the black american community and to the president of the united states people need a victory and then we can move on to deal with uh the lack of fair treatment when it comes to the criminal justice system so for you after health care criminal justice is the next majority it is so important too many young black men are locked in jail in prison and we need to find a way to keep this growth of our penal system congresswoman waters what's the issue for you that people should be rallying rallying behind saying pushing congress to get this done that specifically targets african-americans well um we are all working on the issues that we've been working on for many years many of us were in state legislatures where we worked on the issues of redlining and predatory lending and financial services issues worked on education access to education we've worked on health care issues and of course this health care reform that is being debated now is important still many of our people are getting their medical care in emergency rooms that's very costly but i am focused on something a little bit different in addition to all those things i'm looking at some economic issues we have the treasury department fdic and the feds basically this is a white boys place and we don't have many african-americans that are working in these parts of our government and they're not getting the benefit of for example the bailout they're not getting an opportunity to manage failed assets that are not performing that are on the bank books i bet we just don't have access to the tremendous resources and amounts of monies that flow through these agencies and what's interesting about this particular area is this on wall street we have some of the most educated competent young black professionals who are doing um everything from money management to real estate you name it and they're all participating they are so happy about barack obama they raise money they really really uh see this as an opportunity uh to have access where they haven't had it before and i'm really pushing that and working very hard on it to open up these opportunities you spoke about many black caucus members serving in state legislators and also the local level u.s census 2010 the whole issue of of counting that also uh do you believe for that that should be a part of this black agenda because that sets up senate congressional districts future federal funding uh it do people truly understand african americans truly understand how the sentence affects so many aspects of their daily life i think more and more african-americans have an understanding of the census and that's why we're saying to people be counted it is important that we all be counted it control everything that we do as citizens as as a people not just the congressional district a legislative district as you stated but city council board of education but also resources but how you deal with the republicans who are saying uh when it comes to the under count how they want to count how are you how are you looking at uh with congress challenging folks who want to throw roadblocks up frankly in that whole counting process what we have to say we must have a a fair account and we must make the resources available make the staff the personnel available to see that every person is coming whether you're illegal or illegal you must be kind of because you're here in america coming from the waters well as you know we've done some things to make some changes already we have that long complicated form that is no more we have a shorter form we have to continue to educate we have to continue to talk about why it's important we've got to make sure that we come up with creative ways of doing it we've got to count the homeless we've got to make sure that we do everything possible to get account that's going to help us get the resources back to those communities based on the formulas that are developed because of the census count well one of the things that that is very clear from talking to both of you that we might sit here and and say that it's great having an african-american sitting in the white house having a first family but the reality is the issues that we care about are still there and frankly pushing him to action should be the same as whether it was president bush whether it was president clinton or the previous president well simply because we have an african-american president it doesn't mean that the issue erases behind us the scars and stains of racism are still deeply embedded in every corner of the american society so we must not give up pushing and pulling and putting on the agenda the american agenda the concerns and needs of african-americans and that's what we plan to do every single week in washington watch congressman lewis congresswoman waters we certainly appreciate it thank you very much

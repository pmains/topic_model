me now is congresswoman maxine waters from california here on the ed show tonight congresswoman i appreciate your time from what you're hearing uh what can you live with what do you struggle with at this hour well let me tell you that i am so disappointed uh that the senate has come up with something drastically different from what we put out in the house this business of getting rid of the public option and uh just expanding medicare a bit for those between 55 and 65 does not make up for public option uh i am really worried about it but of course we don't know what the senate is doing supposedly these five uh 10 democrats who have gotten together to try and come up with a compromise may be changing this as we're talking right now so i'm not happy with what i'm hearing you're absolutely right this means that the private insurance companies will be on this so-called health exchange uh supposedly with some negotiations by uh the office of personnel management but we don't i don't see how we're going to create competition the way we would have done with a public option so i'm worried about this bill now isn't it true a congresswoman that the medicare offer that could be on the table with this bill would only deal with the people 55 and older who do not have insurance now i mean if you're 55 and older and you have insurance you just can't jump into medicare that's why it's only going to affect some 3 million people is that correct you're absolutely correct those people who have insurance would either keep the insurance companies that accompany that's covering them or choose from one that will be on the exchange and so it seems to me that this opening up of medicare for this small group of people it's like a teaser or a trick to say that we're expanding it somehow and appealing to uh people in that age group so that they can get more support for it i don't like this at all would you vote against a bill that does not have a public option and where will the progressive caucus come down on this bill if it doesn't have a public option some form of true competition for the insurance industry at this moment based on what i know i'm poised to vote against this bill i don't know where the entire progressive caucus will come down on this bill there's a lot we don't know about it the devil is in the details and so we're trying to learn as quickly as we can what this is all about and uh right now i'm not happy with it and i'm not i would not vote for it as it is told to me today congresswoman can you give us a sense tonight here on the ed show what kind of response are progressives on the hill getting from people around the country i mean i think there's a sense that people think oh it's over we don't have to call i mean it would seem to me that this is the 11th hour that this fight is not over and are you still getting a lot of response from constituents are you still hearing from americans and do you want to hear from them well let me just say this we should be hearing from more americans unfortunately americans are not getting all of the updated information uh as a matter of fact the negotiations gone in the back room with 10 democrats over there and so we're getting bits and pieces out and that which they put out we understand that oh no not all of the democrats on board they have sent it over to be scored that is to be told how much it's going to cost and some of the senators are waiting until they get that information back before they even come on board so we just don't know what is happening and i'm sure the american public does not know or understand they should be calling in demanding answers demanding information uh to try and make their senators tell them everything they know about the back room deal that's going on congresswoman keep up the fight don't give up i won't give up we got to win this thing we got to have some form of a public option and i appreciate your time tonight thanks so much for joining us well thank you for being such a great advocate for the people thank you

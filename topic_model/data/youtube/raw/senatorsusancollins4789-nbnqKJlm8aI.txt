as american families continue to struggle to get the jobs they need at the wages they deserve it is more important than ever for members on both sides of the aisle to come together on legislation to promote economic growth and job creation and that is exactly what the senator from pennsylvania senator casey and i have done we come to the floor today to discuss our bill to do exactly that to create jobs to promote our small businesses our bipartisan legislation focuses on areas of consensus that both parties can embrace to rekindle opportunity by helping small employers start up or grow and create or add good good paying jobs senator casey and i recognize that employers can't grow they can't add jobs unless they have the money to invest in building and expanding their businesses and that's why our bill focuses on making it easier for them to plan their capital investments and aims to reduce the burden and uncertainty of taxation all in the name of creating jobs mr president let me give you a real life example of what the small business expensing and the bonus depreciation provisions can mean last year i spoke with rob todd the founder of allagash brewing company which is based in portland maine allagash makes some of the best craft beer in the country in fact maine is known for its craft beers i have a feeling pennsylvania has a few in that area as well well rob's operation started out as a one-man show in 1995. in the 18 years since it has grown into a firm that employs approximately 65 people and distributes craft beer throughout the united states rob noted to me that his company's ability to expand was fueled in part by bonus depreciation and the section 179 expensing new to the craft beer business rob had difficulty obtaining financing on favorable terms but these cost recovery provisions allowed him to pay less in taxes in the years he acquired the equipment needed to expand his business those tax savings were then reinvested in his business thus creating jobs so just think about that what a difference these provisions have made to this company which has gone from a one-man operation to employing 65 people mr president we're all too familiar with the litany of polls showing how little faith the american people have in their elected leaders and how much they want us to work together to solve our nation's problems i've been privileged to work with senator casey to do exactly that the legislation that we have introduced is neither a republican nor a democratic proposal it is instead a bipartisan plan to help spur america's economy to assist our small employers and most of all to create good paying jobs

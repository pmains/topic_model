uncertainty but one thing is certain you have the advantage of a Smith Education and education measured not only by GPA and test scores but by the resilience courage and perseverance you have honed these past four years and what is also certain that is in acquiring this exceptional education you have become links in an extraordinary legacy of Trailblazers groundbreakers and history makers you graduate in the year that women celebrate 100 years since winning the right to vote we all carry with us the courage of the suffragists and you especially carry the courage of your founder Sophia Smith Sophia Smith was a highly traditional woman with a highly untraditional vision who had the courage and generosity to expand opportunities for women generations before we could vote run for office or truly participate in our democracy but she understood the importance of founding this institution so that women's power for good could be encountered li enlarged as she said since then Smith days have been a force for good Janie new world from Oh Talia Cromwell who defied discrimination and blazed new trails for women of color and whose education at Smith was so fun that she went on to become the first woman of color to achieve a doctorate at Yale we recognized Italia with Cromwell day which also celebrates her niece Adelaide who made history as the first african-american educator at Smith Smith's early recognition of the importance of diversity brings lustre to Smith's legacy in the smithy tradition also our Gloria Steinem and Betty Ford Ann who rejected the ways of the past and revolutionized the fight for women's rights and I've had the privilege of serving in the house with least three Smithy's Jane Harman Niki Tsongas and now senator Tammy Baldwin who came to Washington to take their rightful seat at the decision-making table during this crisis in the days weeks and years that will follow the world needs your leadership to our goal as leaders is to shorten the distance between what is inconceivable to some but never will to us because Smith these are relentless and persistent I am confident in your ability to do so when the president launched his attack on dreamers you organized and mobilized to protect privacy expand job opportunities and secure access to legal counsel for dreamers on campus when you saw bias and policing on campus last year you demanded to achieve an overall of racially insensitive campus policing practices and when you decided that your campus wasn't doing enough to fight the climate crisis smithee's for eight long years to convince your trustees to fully divest from fossil fuels and succeeding and after succeeding got to work the very next day to reinvest in socially and environmentally responsible companies as you begin the next chapter in this time of uncertainty is even more necessary that you make your own environment and the tradition of these iconoclast and visionaries who came before I urge you to know your power leadership is about having confidence in your vision your knowledge your strategic thinking and how that connects to the aspirations of others recognize that you are the unique person you are with your own special power to shape the future for yourself and for our country you never know what opportunities the futures hold but we must be ready I had no intention of running for office or for leadership but when the opportunity presented itself I was ready my strength sprang from my love of my family and the comfort of good friends so my closing advice is to stay close and to treasure

moment for which we have waited more than 200 years never losing faith we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights but women weren't just waiting women were working never losing faith we work to redeem the promise of America that all men and women are created equal for our daughters and our granddaughters today we had broken the marble ceiling we had made history now let us

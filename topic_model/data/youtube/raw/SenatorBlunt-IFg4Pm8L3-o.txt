let me start admiral gerrard with you on test i think tests are essential to get back to school back to work and for tests to really work they have to be easily taken quickly resp there needs to be a quick response and they need to be affordable it seems to me that with the shark tank effort that members of this committee particularly senator alexander and i were involved in trying to encourage looking at ideas that are out there i think the shark tank has approved at least 16 different tests now in your testimony you mentioned that a significant number of these tests were point-of-care response test what should we expect in october or this month let's talk about i've been told in october we could reach 100 million tests between the shark tank and abbott alone is that a number that you think is close to right yes sir and thank you for the question and thank you for the support of the shark tank and all of the nih efforts we've seen just a tremendous blending of programs at darpa at nih at cdc at barda in my office with the defense production act all coming together and we do meet every week to put these together in a very cogent synergistic way um yes in october and again these are conservative estimates based on what we know has euas and what we know the manufacturing will be in october we're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of a 125 to 135 million tests available that does not mean that 125 to 135 million tests will be done but these will be easily and readily available and the majority of them we really hit that inflection point will be point of care good uh many of them will be the buy next that we talked about that will be made at approximately 48 to 50 million per month again five dollar test 15 minute result no instrument uh very very important but we're starting to see the point of tests coming from the uh the radax program the the shark tank uh really hitting the street so the next generation sequencing uh the microfluidics platforms like fluidim and some advanced point of care are all starting to hit from shark tank and i think you said in your testimony that sometime this month we will have passed the first hundred million tests that people have taken is that right yes sir today's total uh as of uh about five o'clock this morning was 99.3 million uh tests having been performed in the u.s those are viral tests not serological tests and starting the first of the year sometime when this this is from the outbreak of the of the covet 19 right right i mean when i took over in march 12th i think there were you know 15 or 20 000 tests done it was a very small number so this is this is ramped and in a historic way not just a number numbers are important but it's the ecosystem the point of care absolutely laboratory these all have to fit together in a in a am i i think i'm right and assuming but the three of you wouldn't know this better than anybody if you take a test and you don't get a result for three days or five days or seven days you find out a data point and you find out for that individual the problem they have but you've generally done nothing to tell them that they could be spreading this disease is that correct clearly we want tests to be turned around as rapidly as possible and that's why point of care is so important the issue with most point-of-care tests is they're not as quote good sensitive and specific as the very important laboratory test now everybody's making progress but but you are right we want rapid turnarounds and uh because we have more point-of-care tests and because we're doing more in the nursing homes that way for the major referral labs that had such an issue with turnaround times our average turnaround time for quest lab court cetera this month is 1.49 days so that has been improved dramatically because of expansion of their capability but also the insertion of point-of-care tests but again that's the average that averages out the point of care plus the test that averages all this down to one point no sir that's just the referral laboratory got it questions the other half of testing is either point of care at your local hospital which is generally either 15 minutes or within 24 hours so the turnaround time um at least right now with all the investments coming together is under control i think our sense many of the members on this committee certainly my sense of testing has been we want to test that millions of people can take maybe dozens of times and get the information at the time they take the test and it sounds like to me that we're finally getting to where that's a real realistic likelihood

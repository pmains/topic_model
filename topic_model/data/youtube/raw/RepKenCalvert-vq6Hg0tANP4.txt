minutes here we go again debating solutions to california's water woes with each side making similar arguments we've heard for years in fact more than a decade ago i was standing at this very spot in the middle of the debate of the last significant western water law that congress has passed we passed cal fed law in 2004 and hoped that it would help california establish reliable affordable water supplies that would help us get through dry spells like we're currently experiencing so why are we back here again debating many of the same issues the simplest answer to that question is we allowed the don't build anything faction in california block the critical investments we need to make in our state's water infrastructure the cal fed law authorized feasibility studies for large water storage projects like temperate flat sites reservoirs upper san joaquin expanding los vaqueros and raising the shasta dam a decade later our state's population has grown by three residents and those projects are still being studied think about that for a second california's population has grown the same amount as the population of the entire state of iowa and we haven't made the significant investments in our water infrastructure to accommodate those residents it's well past time to stop talking about these projects and start building them thankfully the bill before us will move us in that direction by requiring our resource agencies to finally complete those decade-long feasibility studies of course building water stories doesn't help us in the short term and also requires excess water that can be diverted that's why the western water and american food security act injects common sense and science in the operation of our water infrastructure when it does rain again we simply can't afford to make the same mistakes we've made in the past and allow millions of gallons to flow out to the pacific ocean those wasted flows don't benefit the environment farmers or california residents and they must be directed to a higher better use mr speaker mr chairman we have a clear choice before us today we have 30 additional seconds i yield 30 additional seconds the gentleman's recognized we can continue to listen to those who oppose investing in california's water infrastructure and we can believe we can restrict our way out of this problem or we can recognize that california's situation today is far worse than it should be precisely because our failure to build adequate water storage and restore more science and common sense into water policies that are operating today i encourage all my colleagues to support the western water and american food security act we can avoid being back here on the house floor during california's next drought having these very same arguments thank you mr chairman

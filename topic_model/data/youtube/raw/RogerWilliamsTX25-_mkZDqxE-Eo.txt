Thank You mr. chairman and thank you for being here today I'm a small business owner from Texas I'm a Main Street guy I'm a car dealer one of your favorites and I can tell you small businesses hurting Main Street America is hurting and is hurting because regulations which you have talked about today are little each okung the heart out of small business and I think too that we talked earlier about inequalities and i would say that competition is the key competition in business takes care of inequalities not the federal government and my colleague here just was asking for an expert opinion on whether dodd-frank and CFPB are good for the economy I can tell you as an expert opinion they're bad for the economy the worst now with that being said in 2014 and comments before the Joint Economic Committee and I'll be somewhat repetition here but I think it's important that we remind you where we need to add our economy that you stated in questioning from Senator coats I quote my own discussions with businesses i hear exactly the same things that you are citing concerns of the regulations about taxation about uncertainty about fiscal policy you went on to say there is more work to do to put fiscal policy on a sustainable course that progress has been made over the last several years in bringing down deficits in the short term but that a combination of demographics the structure of entitlement programs and historic trends and health care costs we can see that over the long-term deficits will rise to unsustainable levels relative the economy now my constituents back home in Texas are very concerned about the health of our economy because it is not good and in Texas where the we got great things going but it still can be better in Texas estate that is somewhat recovered since 2008 you have a hundred and fifteen fewer community banks you have a hundred and five fewer credit unions tons of consolidation and a lot of uncertainty about where the economy is headed so my question chair Yellen what do you say to those community based institutions that former FDIC chair Bernanke characterized as saying we're being penalized you touched on this today by your policies particularly when these policies have at the same time failed to produce meaningful economic growth in the communities those institutions serve which further erodes their profitability well what I've said is we're trying to do everything we possibly can to relieve burdens on community banks they've been through very difficult times first of all a period that's been very rough for the economy and a slow recovery and that's taken a toll on their profitability and that of the businesses as you noted and in a low interest rate environment on net margins tend to be low now I think that the low interest rate environment we have had an accommodative monetary policies have served to help our economy overall and get it moving and moving back to full employment if you compare the United States with any number of other economies that also suffered in the aftermath of the crisis we're among the leaders in terms of how we're doing economically and other countries are now pursuing the same kinds of monetary policies that that we put into place earlier on which in a way is an endorsement of their effectiveness well it still is very hard to borrow money for small businesses and i can tell you bank says you probably heard this too or hiring having to hire more compliance officers and there are loan officers that takes money out of the system that could be alone to people like me to hire people in and create jobs and you know we had we had Cordray here before us and I asked him if he would slow down this dodd-frank legislation because a lot of it is not completed and because we're losing so many banks and credit unions and he said no we're going to go a hundred percent we're going to take a look at it that is a that is a bad policy now you stated that the community banks shouldn't face the same scrutiny as bigger banks you said that today I agree and if the Fed will tailor its supervision to reduce regulatory burden I heard you say in 2014 I heard you say that you said I had community bankers in mop or just yesterday from what you said and I heard today from community bankers asking me what do I do we took we say the right thing but what do we do they're fearful of things that can happen of what they may not do so you don't know what to do what would you tell these people I mean we talk a good game but we don't come through well we're trying to make clear our supervisory expectations and work carefully with them to know what rules and regulations apply in how and what don't and to try to shield them from many of the things that larger banks have to well it's very vague well I hope you'll understand terminate you time of the gentleman has expired sure now recognize the gentleman from Maine mr. Pollock

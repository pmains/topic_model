i'm don bacon and it's such a pleasure to be representing the second district the average staff in washington dc they average two percent veterans our office has 35 percent veterans so we have a huge veteran contention and with me today is dan frazee who served in the air force and i want to ask dan to talk a little bit about his air force career and how did 911 impact his life so dan thank you for being here oh thank you very much congressman and thank you for your service um yeah i was uh i was in the air force from 2003 to 2010 i did a one-year tour to iraq working counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism there in support of operation iraqi freedom you know when i experienced 9 11 i was a junior in high school and i remember coming into my sociology teacher's class he would always have the news playing on in the morning it was my first class of the day and at the time i got in i remember um the picture on the television screen you know one of the one of the planes had had impacted um the world trade center at that time so you saw smoke billowing out of the building and and the news anchors were kind of trying to get a hold of the situation saying you know you know is this an accident you know what happened here um and other students started to kind of trickle in and you know we were talking amongst each other looking at you know watching the news kind of nonchalantly and then and i remember looking up at the screen and at that moment the second plane hit the building um and there was just this feeling of uh you know dread you know i felt you know the hair on my neck you know stand up and and i remember this feeling that we're under attack you know it was the first time probably in my life that i felt scared you know um but i came from a family my mom served in the military both my grandfather served in the military and i made up my mind pretty much at that point that i wanted to serve my country and prevent something like this from happening again that second building exploding was the big light that went off of my brain too there was no doubt we were under attack and did you ever remember the speech from president bush that night um i i didn't listen to it at the time i was 16 years old i think but i remember talking about the event with my parents when i got home and they wanted to make sure we were okay and actually the school had um uh the principal had come over the intercom and told um all of us that you know uh you know you're free to go home you know if your parents you know come and pick you up that kind of thing and and uh there was just a a you know feeling that this was a very significant event you know in our right our country and that um that we could talk about it with our folks which i did when i got home that's important for folks to remember that you know afghanistan the taliban provided safe haven for al qaeda uh which enabled them to attack our country uh with those four airplanes that they hijacked only three hit the targets but it's important to know that the taliban today are still allied uh with al qaeda and we're still in a fight with them in afghanistan i would say thankfully our strategy has changed to where we have a minimum presence in afghanistan now as small as we can have 8 000 troops and our whole goal is to train and to provide the backbone to the afghan forces and they're doing all the fighting and our whole goal is to prevent the taliban from taking back over and bringing back in al qaeda and giving them a safe safe harbor again which would likely mean more attacks down the road against our allies and our country and uh so this is still a remnant of what we're having to deal with even today and well i remember one of your top priorities coming into office was to boost our military to really recover from some of the funding cuts that happened earlier so can you talk a little bit about your work on the nba right so in 2017 in january we came in our military fought in afghanistan was still fighting there and iraq we had issues with syria with isis having a third of syria we had libya that the president obama before that took us in there all of that going on while we were cutting the military which would cut them about 18 roughly um and then we were still having to retool our military for russia and china which we were falling behind in our modernization and from that our military is at the lowest readiness since 1977 and heifer navy aircraft couldn't fly 58 combat brigades in the army only three could deploy it was really broken and so what we've done is we've restored about 60 percent of the cuts that occurred under president obama and and we've put more focus now on china and russia because they are what we call it near competitors their power is rising and we're having a pivot a little bit we're having to pivot away from strictly counter insurgency and counter terrorism which is what we were doing and so we've had to re-pivot our military uh to ensure that we can deter against china and russia and it's really been our work the last three and a half years and i think we've made huge strides and a great progress in that effort but the work's not done and you've been working um on a bipartisan basis uh um with a caucus that you were one of the co-founders can you tell us a little bit about the four country caucus well one of our i think you and i share this experience when you're in the military you don't know who's a republican you don't know who's a democrat you're solving a problem you don't care what party affiliation people are we wanted a little more of that culture in congress so we put a caucus together we have 21 members 11 democrats 10 republicans on the co-chair and our focus is to solve problems from a national patriotic perspective not a republican or democrat perspective so we're trying to find areas we can cooperate put republicans and democrats on the same bills so we can get things done and one of our focus areas right now is national service voluntary service we want to give more opportunities for 18 year olds to serve their country not just the military perhaps the peace corps perhaps the health corps but we know when people serve their country they get out of their parochial in their small town wherever they may be they start to have a little more of an american perspective and realize how great our country is and we can put petty politics to the side and remember that we live in the greatest country in the world and we need to defend it absolutely i remember working with other service members different components as well but from texas california new york you know all over and then even uh working with some of our allies overseas and in the uk and romanians and the australians so uh anyway so uh thank you very much sir well we appreciate that uh dan frazee and your years of service in the air force we're proud to have in the office thank you sir

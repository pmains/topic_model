Thank You chair to get for holding this hearing and before I get started I'm opening saimin I want to say I know a lot of our members are gonna have to be going back and forth for whatever reason the this committee scheduled two important subcommittee hearings at the same time and so we got we have drug pricing upstairs something everybody breezed important issue for the country and this support NC for the country as well and a lot of members share membership of that subcommittee so I apologize that we're going to be in and out but that's where we are and I want to say that I'm deeply concerned about the outgoing break of lung illness associated with vaping any cigarette use as well as the marketing of e-cigarettes to kids we need to understand the causes of this vaping illness and ensure each cigarettes are not marketed to kids it is also important that we understand the health implications of vaping in e-cigarette use more broadly where there has in a whether whether an adult is vaping THC divided arrived from marijuana nicotine or another substance so far the available evidence of the 553 reported cases of lung illness and eight deaths do not point to a conclusive cause but the test samples overwhelmingly suggests involvement of illicit each cigarette devices the psycho active ingredient in marijuana caught THC in other black-market products for example according to the Centers for Disease Control most patients have experienced these lung illnesses have reported a history of using e-cigarettes products containing marijuana or THC however some have reported using products that contain THC marijuana with nicotine while others have reported only using products with nicotine separate from the outbreak of lung illnesses according to the US Food and Drug Administration the United States has a youth a cigarette epidemic the most recent data from the National Youth tobacco survey show that 27 and a half percent of youth reported using e-cigarettes compared with 20.8 in 2018 the rate was only eleven point three percent just three years ago these trends are unacceptable the marketing of e-cigarette products to children must be stopped and youth access to e-cigarette products must be blocked more effectively this epidemic is already driving legislation and regulatory responses last September the FDA issued that more than 1300 warning letters to fine fines to brick-and-mortar retailers who illegally sold ISA vet products to minors and 5 warning letters to e-cigarette manufacturers about their plans to address youth access of their products 18 states have increased the legal age to purchase tobacco products of 21 Michigan New York and the District of Columbia have issued a proposed regulations to ban flavored cigarettes Oh September 11 2019 the Trump administration announced that the FDA would finalized a compliance policy to prioritize enforcement against the marketing of unauthorized non-tobacco flavored cigarettes including MIT and myth all cigarettes with these responses while these responses are aimed at reducing the attraction of e-cigarettes to youth wide bands will almost certainly create black markets in that vein we will also need a response to an increased black market demand for flavored pods and to address the growing trade in illicit cannabis marijuana vaping products a New York Times article reported that a recent bust of THC oil operation in Wisconsin revealed a very advanced in mature illicit market for marijuana vapes cartridges in distribution of contaminated marijuana based fate courts I am told these illicit operations are using a tactic in other illegal drug operations they're cutting their product with other substances including some that could be dangerous public health advocates for example set a particular cutting agent vitamin E acetate is an oil that could cause breathing problems and lung inflammation if not heated fully during the vaping process by using smaller amounts of the expensive THC or marijuana and diluting it with oils that cost much less one can increase their profit by selling the product for example medium grade THC can cost $4,000 a kilogram but additives may cost pennies on the dollar these operations rely on pin factories that buy empty vacant Raja's in counterfeit packaging from Chinese factories then fill them with THC liquid that they purchased from the United States market empty cartridges and Packaging are also available to purchase on the Internet while federal and state authorities are working on an effective response against teen Issa grant use we must ensure that our youth is educated on the dangers of using e-cigarettes for example in Massachusetts governor Baker's administration launched the campaign to combat teen vaping and e-cigarette use in April 20 19 and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health launched a campaign to highlight the dangers of bait pens in e-cigarettes in July 2018 these actions are commendable and I look forward to seeing the results of these campaigns with regard to adults trying to quit smoking some studies suggest each cigarettes are less harmful than traditional cigarettes according to the CDC each cigarettes have the potential benefit cessation from combustible cigarettes for adult smokers but the CDC cautions that e-cigarettes are not safe for youth young adults pregnant women or adults who are not currently using tobacco products additional research should be go to look at the effectiveness I want to thank our witnesses for being here on both panels today and I were to look forward to this important discussion sorry we'll be back and forth between hearings but that's where we are and I yield back

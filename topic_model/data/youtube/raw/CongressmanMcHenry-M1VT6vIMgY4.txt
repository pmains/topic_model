well hello friends this is your Congressman and fellow career night Patrick McHenry in honor of National Teacher Appreciation Week I wanted to take a moment to say thank you I remember my time a career medal very well and the many valuable lessons I learned there still stick with me to this day I'll be forever grateful and thankful to the many teachers and coaches that helped guide me along the way and so I want to say thank you I know many things have changed and we're dealing with unprecedented times but you as teachers I know we're putting your students first especially during the current challenge that we face with the coronavirus but I think all parents are actually gaining a fine new appreciation for the tough work that teachers do given the nature of our teaching right now so I want to say thank you and I want to express my gratitude to you and your continued dedication to the students a career medal thanks so much god bless

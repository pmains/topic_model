thanks so much joining us now to discuss Democratic senator Tim Kain of the great Commonwealth of Virginia senator let's start with the uh The Rail lines uh strike rail line companies are having record profits uh Union Pacific and BNSF are up 16 Norfolk Southern up 48 and the workers here you know they're fighting for pretty basic stuff paid sick leave um is this plan which would force these employees to work really the best way to go about this well Jake paid sick leave is a very reasonable request but it's also the case that the deal that was negotiated and then mediated is a significant Improvement in wages and other working conditions for rail workers they deserved Improvement and they got it is it good enough most of the Union leadership felt that it was um and uh and many of the unions and votes of their membership felt that it was as you know there are multiple railroad unions and some of the membership have not been supportive but as a general matter this deal that's been negotiated is a significant Improvement in wages and working conditions for rail workers but it's still the case that the Biden Administration is forcing workers to take a deal that would not allow them paid sick leave which is something that I have something you have something my crew in here has and it seems like something basic for any American worker why in the negotiation other concessions to workers were granted and this one was not I don't yet know the president last night suggested Congress needs to vote on this there's a statutory proceeding that enables us to have a vote on this it will be our job to vote and I'm looking forward to discussions both with railroads and also unions before I cast the vote I understand what President Biden wants us to do we do need to avert the strike before I cast a vote I'm going to be hearing from both unions and the rail companies and asking the kinds of questions that you suggested I haven't decided how I'm going to vote on this yet I'll have those conversations first but the nation does need to avert a rail strike sure nobody disagrees with that but but I guess the bigger question here is is something that Bill Clinton's labor secretary Robert Reich tweeted earlier which is quote is there a better definition of corporate greed than a Warren buffett-owned Railway refusing to provide workers with sick leave despite the company reporting a net income of nearly six billion dollars I mean is secretary rice wrong well again that's that's a hell of a good tweet um but the secretary didn't put in that all the the benefits for workers that were in the bill remember there was a deadline in September that we thought we had averted with the deal and that deal was a significant Improvement in working conditions for workers that many of the unions support again not all the unions do how the status quo has changed from September to now have they made additional progress in finding more uh concessions to workers have they gone backwards again this is what we'll all be digging into before we cast a vote on the president's request let's change subjects for a second here because as you know the Senate is voting soon on a bill that would provide some protections for same-sex marriages and interracial marriages it does not go as far as is the current law under the U.S Supreme Court obergraphel and loving decisions it doesn't actually guarantee same-sex couples the right to get married in every state it only forces states to recognize legal marriages from other states why do you say to critics who argue this does not go far does not go nearly far enough um I'd argue that they're right but we need to do this right now and then we can start uh looking for the next Victory this bill I'm a co-sponsor of it and proud to be a co-sponsor the respect for Marriage Act it would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act from the 1990s and it would force every state whatever their own marriage was it would force every state to recognize both interracial and same-sex marriages and that means the millions of couples who that applies to will be able to move anywhere in the United States any zip code in this country and their marriage has to be given the same respect that any other marriage would be that is a huge Advance after obergerfell we wouldn't have thought we would have needed this but the Dobbs decision this summer made plain that this Republican hand-picked Supreme Court report will not only go after Reproductive Rights it's likely to go after marriage equality and so by doing this we will force states to recognize lawful marriages from other states which they should do so anyway under the 14th Amendment Grant of privileges and immunities and equal protection it will be one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation that Congress has passed in decades but you're right it doesn't go far enough so let's get this one done and then we can try to go farther and what do you say to the good citizens of Virginia Which you represent who are religious conservatives and are worried that this legislation will force them to violate their religious beliefs um I will say that they're wrong and if people are telling them that they're affirmatively misleading them uh this bill has conscience protection so no religion is required to officiate uh same-sex marriages look my Catholic Church um as a doctrinal matter doesn't believe in divorce but it doesn't insist that Virginia not have a divorce law it just has its own rules about whether divorces will be recognized or not the same principle will hold for performing marriages churches will not have to perform marriages that are at odds with their Doctrine but they can't block others from getting married under the Civil laws of the state in fact allowing a church to dictate what the laws of the state would be would be a gross violation of the first amendments free exercise and establishment Clauses before we go I do want to take a moment to remember your longtime friend Congressman Donald mceachin who passed away uh yesterday how do you hope people remember him Jake my uh I I met Donald when he was 24 years old and I was a year or so older and I was at a celebration of his wedding to Colette who is also a dear friend and he died after a very courageous battle with cancer that lasted about 10 years I never once heard Donald complain or be without a smile on his face even as he was visibly weakening because of cancer so I hope folks will remember him as a as a gentle giant as a climate Champion as a champion for The Underdogs and a wonderful husband father and devoted friend may his memory be a blessing sir thank you so much Democratic senator Tim king of Virginia

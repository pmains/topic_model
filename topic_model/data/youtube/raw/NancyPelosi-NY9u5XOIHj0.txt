let's see one minute I thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for giving us this opportunity to discuss an important matter the integrity of Congress on the floor of the house I too want to join a distinguished majority leader mr. Cantor and praising the leadership of congresswoman Louise slaughter our ranking member on the Rules Committee and congressman Tim Walz for their extraordinary leadership over time their persistence their the approach that they have taken to this to remove all doubt in the public's mind if that is possible that we are here to do the people's business and not to benefit personally from it I listened intently to the attentively to the distinguished Majority Leader mr. kenter's remarks about the stock act and its importance and it just raises the question to me as to if it is so important and it and it certainly is that why we could not have worked in a more bipartisan fashion either to accept the Senate bill which was developed in a bipartisan fashion and passed the Senate what was at ninety four to six ninety four to six it's hard to get a result like that and Congress these days but they were able to get the result because they worked together to develop the legislation we had two good options one was to accept the Senate bill or to take up the slaughter walls legislation which has nearly 300 co-sponsors almost 100 Republican co-sponsors on the original stock act the discharge petition has been calling upon the leadership to bring that bill to the floor it was important about that is that when we passed we could go to conference and take the bet boast the best and strongest of both bills to to get the job done instead secretly the Republicans brought a much diminished bill to the floor it has some good features so I urge our colleagues to vote for to bring the process along what's wrong about it is though it makes serious omissions and I want to associate myself with remarks that have been made earlier but i think they bear repetition in any of event senator Grassley's remarks are stunning and really an a stunning indictment of the House Republicans in terms of their action on this bill he said and I know my colleague has read this into the record already but I will to Senator Grassley said it's astonishing and extremely disappointing that the house would fulfill Wall Street's wishes by killing this provision that would be the provision on political intelligence the Senate clearly voted to try to shed light on an industry that's behind the scenes if the Senate language is too broad is opponents say will not propose a solution instead of the scrapping the provision altogether I hope to see senator Grassley said a vehicle for meaningful transparency through a house-senate conference and other means if Congress delays action is mr. Conyers thermicon yourself said if Congress delays actions said senator Grassley the political intelligence industry will stay in the shadows just the way Wall Street likes it well this senator statement is a large very widely covered the hill today has a big full-page Grassley Republicans caved Iowa centerset senator says house doing Wall Street bidding I think it's important to note that on the Senate side there was interest in doing this study that is now in the House bill and it was rejected by the Senate by a 6239 vote to include the intelligence of political intelligence provision in the bill rejecting the study now that that's already been rejected in the Senate is resurrected on the house side a weakening of the bill so whether it's a political intelligence piece proposed by Senator Grassley or senator Leahy's piece about corruption I think it's really important that those two elements be included in the bill a good way to do that to find a path to bipartisanship and the strongest possible bill is to pass the bill today despite its serious shortcomings and it's hard to understand why we are going to that why the shortcomings are there but nonetheless they are pass the bill today and go to conference to pass earlier were to accept the Senate bill or to take the original stock act strong stock act to the floor both of those were rejected passed this bill go to conference it's very important that the house and the Senate meet to discuss these very important issues with all due respect to a study on political intelligence that's really just a Dodge that just is just a way to say we're not going to do the political intelligence piece so again I with serious reservations about the bill but thinking it's a the better course of action is to pass it and I don't want anybody to interpret the strong vote for it to be a seal of approval for what it is but adjusted a way of pushing the process down the line so that we can move expeditiously to go to conference for the strongest possible bill and want to close again by saluting congresswoman Louise slaughter and congressman Tim Walz for their relentless persistent that dedication to this issue had they not had this discharge petition and the 300 nearly 300 co-sponsors bipartisan nearly 100 of them Republicans I doubt that we would even be taking up this bill today so congratulations and thank you with that I yield back the balance of my time gentlelady yields back gentleman from Texas

THIRD, OTHERS SAY UP TO A HALF. SENATOR TIM KAINE JOINS US RIGHT NOW, SITS ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, VERY IMPORTANT PERSON THERE, A FORMER VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. SENATOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MEASURE IS APPARENTLY IT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION FROM NOW. NANCY PELOSI WAS JUST ASKED BY OUR HILLARY VAUGHN ABOUT TALK THAT MAYBE THERE WOULD BE A FEDERAL GAS TAX HOLIDAY. SHE SAID THAT IS OFF THE TABLE FOR THE TIME-BEING IF I GOT HER, THE GIST OF WHAT SHE SAID CORRECT. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? TAP THE RESERVE, URGE OIL COMPANIES, WORK ON EXISTING LEASES SOME CONTROVERSY WITH THAT BUT NO GAS TAX HOLIDAY, ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT. >> HERE IS WHAT I THINK, NEIL, I'M GLAD TO BE ON. I'M GLAD WE'RE TAPPING WITH THE RESERVE. THE CHALLENGE WITH THE GAS TAX HOLIDAY, IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY BRING DOWN PRICES AT THE PUMP BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE THE TEST. WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, OUR GAS WAS DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN THE NORTH CAROLINA GAS TAX, BUT IF YOU DROVE BACK AT THE PRICE AT PUMP IT WAS THE SAME. NOT THAT VIRGINIA WAS LOWER IN THE TAX. IF YOU DROP THE FEDERAL GAS TAX IT DOESN'T LEAD TO SAVES AT PUMP, WHY DO IT? I THINK THE BETTER STRATEGY THE BIG FIVE OIL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE INCREDIBLY PROFITABLE RIGHT NOW. YOU MIGHT DO EXCESS PROFITS TAX AND THEN REBATE MONEY BACK TO CONSUMERS. THAT COULD ACTUALLY HELP THEM WITH THE COST OF GASOLINE IN THE SHORT TERM. I WOULD BE MORE OPEN TO THAT THAN A GAS TAX HOLIDAY THAT MIGHT NOT LEAD GAS TO COME DOWN BY A PENNY. NEIL: ARE YOU AFRAID THOUGH THAT THE SIGNAL IT SENDS TO THE PUBLIC IS THAT ALL OF THIS IS BORN BECAUSE OF THE OIL COMPANIES? SO TAX THEIR PROFITS WHICH SEEM OBSCENE THE WAY THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE LOOKING AT IT, HARDLY AN APOLOGIST FOR THAT INDUSTRY, SENATOR, THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS GOING ON HERE, ARE THERE NOT? >> NO. CLEARLY THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS, ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS WHY THE STRATEGIC RESERVE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK WHAT, THE OIL COMPANIES ARE PROFITABLE, THAT IS GREAT, I WANT THEM TO BE PROFITABLE BUT WHEN THEIR PROFIT THE SPIKE UP AT THE VERY TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE HURTING THE MOST, THAT IS WHAT IS TROUBLING ABOUT IT. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT SOME KIND OF A TEMPORARY EXCESS PROFITS TAX SO THAT THEY THEIR PROFITS DON'T SPIKE AT THE SAME TIME THAT PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. NEIL: I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I'M SHOWING MY AGE, SENATOR, WHEN I HEAR A TEMPORARY TAX, HISTORY SUGGESTS IT IS NOT TEMPORARY. BUT WE CAN GET INTO THAT. >> RIGHT. NEIL: I WANT TO SOMETHING YOU LED IN A BIPARTISAN WAY, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE, SIR, A PRESIDENT OF EITHER PARTYOULD WALK AWAY FROM NATO, HIS OR HER DISCRETION YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE NOT BEFORE CONGRESS CAN WEIGH IN. TELL US WHERE THAT STANDS RIGHT NOW. >> IT'S A VERY EXCITING THING AND IT GOES AFTER SORT OF AN AMBIGUITY IN THE CONSTITUTION. THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THE U.S. CANNOT ENTER INTO A TREATY WITHOUT A 2/3 VOTE OF THE SENATE, CLEAR AS DAY. THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT EXITING A TREATY. THIS ACTUALLY HAS BEEN KIND OF A LIVE DEBATE THAT HAS GONE ON FOR YEARS THAT HAS NEVER BEEN RESOLVED TO ANYONE'S SATISFACTION. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TOOK A CASE IN 1979 DEALING WITH PRESIDENT CARTER UNILATERALLY BACKING OUT AFTER TREATY OVER TAIWAN'S DEFENSE. SO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SUED, HEY, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THE SUPREME COURT SAID THEY DISMISSED THE CASE. THEY SAID IT'S A POLITICAL QUESTION THAT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND CONGRESS. TO ME THAT SAYS CONGRESS HAS A ROLE. SO SENATOR McCAIN AND I FIRST INTRODUCED THIS BILL IN JULY OF 2018. IT WAS THE LAST BILL I BELIEVE HE INTRODUCED BEFORE HE DIED TO SAY NO PRESIDENT CAN BACK OUT OF NATO WITHOUT A VOTE OF CONGRESS. THE TIMING WASN'T RIGHT BUT THE TIMING IS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING THE VALUE OF NATO. WE HAD A VOTE IN THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE ON IT YESTERDAY. 21-1 IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL BUT NOW SENATOR RUBIO I ARE LEADING IT. HAS HUGE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. WE'RE HOPING TO GET A FLOOR VOTE ON IT SOON. IT WOULD SEND A GREAT MESSAGE TO OUR NATO ALLIES RIGHT NOW, NATO MEMBERSHIP OF THE U.S. DOESN'T DEPEND ON THE PRESIDENT. IT IS A BICAMERAL, A BIPARTISAN DESIRE TO STAND STRONG WITH OUR NATO ALLIES. NEIL: WAS THIS TRIGGERED BY THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP NATO PAYING RESPECTIVE FAIR SHARE AROUND QUESTIONING ARTICLE V, WHETHER HE WOULD RESPOND TO AN ATTACK ON ONE, WAS IT BORN OF THAT? >> YES, IT WAS. NOW PUSHING NATO, NATIONS TO UP THEIR DEFENSE, WE LIKED THAT ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT WAS A GOOD THING BUT SAYING THAT WE MIGHT GET OUT OR WHY WOULD WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING TO DEFEND A SMALL NATO NATION, THAT ACTUALLY MADE US GO, ASK THE QUESTION THAT YOU JUST ASKED, WOW, I DIDN'T THINK A PRESIDENT COULD GET OUT AFTER TREATY. WE WENT BACK AND LOOKED THIS IS AN ISSUE THE CONSTITUTION IS SILENT. AS A GENERAL MATTER THE SUPREME COURT SAYS WHEN THE CONSTITUTION IS SILENT IT IS SOMETHING THAT CONGRESS CAN LEGISLATE IN THAT SILENCE. CLEARLY THE SENATE HAS ALWAYS HAD A ROLE IN APPROVAL OF TREATIES. WE THINK WE'RE COMPLETELY ON FINE LEGAL GROUNDS BUT THIS TREATY IN PARTICULAR, THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT, SENDING A BIPARTISAN MESSAGE WE'RE BEHIND NATO SEEMS LIKE A GOOD THING TO DO. >> IT WOKE ME UP. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE PRESIDENT COULD HAVE THAT PREROGATIVE. I WANT TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING. YOU BATTLED COVID. I HAD SAME ISSUES. IT WAS VERY SCARY FOR ME. YOU'RE DEALING WITH -- OF IT AS AM I. HOPEFULLY NOT TO THE DEGREE EITHER OF US WERE BUT IT LINGERS. YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THIS IN VARYING DEGREES OF HEALTH BUT THERE IS A LOT WE DON'T KNOW. EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE PERSONALLY GOING THROUGH. >> YEAH, NEIL. LOOK YOUR COVID STORY REALLY GRABBED MY ATTENTION, I KNOW MANY BECAUSE IT WAS SO SERIOUS. MY COVID STORY IS NOT SERIOUS BUT IT IS WEIRD. I HAD A VERY MILD CASE OF COVID AT THE BEGINNING IN MARCH OF 2020. WE WERE WORKING ON THE CARES ACT HERE. I GOT COVID. I HAD NON-STANDARD SYMPTOMS. I GAVE COVID TO MY WIFE. SHE HAD ALL THE STANDARD SYMPTOMS. WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. WE GOT ANTI-BODY TESTS THAT SHOWED WE GOT COVID. ONE SYMPTOM I GOT AT BEGINNING, EVERY NERVE ENDING IN MY BODY TINGLED OR BUZZED 24/7. I DESCRIBE IT AS EVERY NERVE INDEPENDENTING HAS 4 CUPS OF COFFEE. I CAN EXERCISE, SLEEP, AND I FELT MY BODY HAD FOR 62 1/2 YEARS AND FELT DIFFERENT AND I NEVER GONE BACK. I AM DEALING WITH IT. I'M NOT SUFFERING UNDER IT BUT STARTING TO HEAR PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING MUCH MORE SERIOUS HONK TERM COVID SYMPTOMS INCLUDING NOT BEING BELIEVED. MAYBE IT IS ANXIETY. WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO REPORT THIS EXPERIENCE NOT BEING BELIEVED. I THOUGHT I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT THE PHENOMENON, WHAT ARE THE CURES AND TREATMENTS? I TALKED ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE SO PEOPLE GOING THROUGH A POST-COVID SYNDROME, HEY, THERE ARE POLICYMAKERS WHO BELIEVE YOU, WHO ARE LIVING THROUGH IT TOO. WE GOT A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH MONEY IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN A YEAR AGO TO DIG INTO CAUSES AND CURES AND NEIL, THIS IS AN INTERESTING ONE. WE MAY KNOW CURES BEFORE WE KNOW CAUSES BECAUSE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS ARE SIMILAR TO OTHER KINDS OF SYMPTOMS NOT RELATED TO COVID. SO WE CAN USE MEDICATIONS FOR MORE ROB -- NUR ROB PA THINK, NERVE TINGLING, DOES THAT WORK WITH SOMEBODY WITH COVID SYMPTOMS. WE NEED SUPPORT FOR THOSE DEALING WITH IT. THIS COULD AFFECT 5% TO 30% OF PEOPLE WHO HAD COVID. THAT IS SUCH A WIDE SWATH. WE HAVE TO DIG IN, UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS. NEIL: RIGHT, RIGHT. >> BUT THE SYMPTOMS ARE COMPLETELY VARIABLE. MINE IS NERVE TINGLING. SOME PEOPLE LOSE TASTE AND SMELL PERMANENT LENGTHILY. COULD BE RACING HARD. I WAS A MARATHON RUNNER. I CAN'T WALK AROUND THE BLOCK. THE SYMPTOMS ARE VERY, VERY BROAD. THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. WE'VE GOT TO GET ANSWERS. NEIL: INTERESTING. I WAS A MARATHON RUNNER AS WELL, SENATOR. NO, I REALLY WASN'T. BUT YOU DIDN'T MILK ALL THE ATTENTION LIKE I DID, SENATOR. I MEAN YOU EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE DEALING WITH IT. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NO MILKING IT. BUT NO, YOU RAISE A LOT OF VERY GOOD POINTS. GO AHEAD. >> NEIL, WHAT I WILL SAY ON THIS BEING WILLING TO JUST SHARE MY OWN EXPERIENCE. AGAIN I'M DEALING WITH A WE ARE THING. NEIL: ABSOLUTELY. >> MEANS AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE COME UP TO TALK TO ME ON THE STREET, AROUND THE CAPITAL, HERE AND THERE, THANKS FOR DOING THIS BILL. SOMEBODY YESTERDAY WAS TALKING TO ME ABOUT THEIR WIFE WHO WAS DEALING WITH LONG COVID SYMPTOMS. THANKS FOR DOING THIS BILL, BRINGING SOME ATTENTION TO IT. THE GOOD NEWS IS, PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THESE SYMPTOMS, IF WE SHARE THE SYMPTOMS AND KIND OF GET GOOD RESEARCH ON THEM WE WILL NOT ONLY LONG COVID SUFFERERS BUT IT IS VERY COMMON FOR OTHER VIRAL ILLNESSES TO HAVE AFTEREFFECTS, LYME DISEASE. RESEARCH ON COVID WILL GIVE ANSWERS TO HELP OTHERS TOO. NEIL: TO YOUR POINT, FIVE TO 10%, THAT IS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COULD BE AFFECTED. >> MILLIONS AND MILLIONS. YEAH. NEIL: SENATOR, VERY GOOD SEE

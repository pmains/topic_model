for two minutes Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in opposition to HR 9 87 to suppose strict Ihnen health care and lowering prescription drugs Act I wish I wasn't given this speech as many of my colleagues know I have a bipartisan track record here in the house I've been proud to work with many of my Democratic colleagues on a number of issues that impact Kentuckians and people across the country such as Alzheimer's the opioid crisis in workforce development last Congress I had ten bipartisan bills signed into law and it had two additional bipartisan bills passed the house hold my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that I take bipartisanship and our responsibility to get things done for our constituents very seriously that's why I make wanted that I will have to vote against 987 today wherever I go in my district I hear from Kentuckians about how drug prices are simply too high this is an issue that affects everyone and it's one of the few big issues that these days that Republicans and Democrats can all agree on and President Trump has made this a priority as ranking member of the Oversight and investigations subcommittee I have launched with chair Danna togedda of Colorado an investigation on rising insulin prices I was proud to support bipartisan legislation in the health subcommittee in the full energy and Commerce Committee sadly mr. speaker Democrats have loaded up what was previously a bipartisan drug price legislative bill with political landmines if they know we as Republicans will never support they made a bipartisan drug pricing bill into Obamacare bailout bill they know that this bill is dead on arrival in the Senate and the president Trump would never sign it my colleagues are playing games of score cheap political points in the short term at the expense of Americans across the country who are paying too much at the pharmacy counter urge my colleagues on the Democratic side not to make lowering drug prices another partisan fight I'm willing to work with any of my colleagues to fix this problem in Oregon all of my colleagues to do the same and I yield back

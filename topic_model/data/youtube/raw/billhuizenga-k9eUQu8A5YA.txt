thank you i recognize the gentleman from michigan mission mr heisenga thank you mr chairman i appreciate the opportunity and and for you coming in and i wanted to maybe touch on a couple of quick things and continue on that that uh currency swaps um how far are we going to bring this along i guess would be part of my part of my question how long are we going to stick into this this game to be a part of it if europe europe remains dependent on currency swaps these same swaps become increasingly risky um is are you prepared to allow these currency swaps to wind down or or what's going to happen there and then you know the the short-term dollar funding in europe seemed to be the discussion point right how would you define short-term versus medium term and and long-term uh i'll i'll start or you know why aren't you going okay uh you know i think that uh what we would hope is that the european countries do the right things in terms of getting their fiscal houses in order and improving their competitiveness so that investors start to have more confidence in uh the sustainability of the european union and and how all these countries are going to uh persist uh as if that happens and at the and at the same time the european banks are shown to have good earnings liquidity and capital then i think that the willingness of private lenders to provide dollar liquidity to the european banks will emerge very much intact and in that situation our swaps will be at rates that are actually higher than the market and the swap programs will just sort of wind down automatically this is what we saw during 2007 2008 2009 during the first big wave of swaps that as market conditions normalized the swap usage came down pretty automatically i'm kind of curious about that because i'm looking at some information uh in front of me here that says interest rates on dollar loans from the ecb are around 0.6 percent interest rate on ecb charges for its euro loans is one percent i i don't have my phd in economics however i can see the incentive there i mean that why why by making dollar financing cheaper than euro financing how are they ever going to get out of that cycle well the the i'm not sure that i would agree with that that's that's the right comparison the one percent is to borrow euros the point six percent is to borrow dollars and the alternative is to borrow dollars from a u.s bank when the federal reserve is paying 25 basis points on the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves so there's quite a bit of room between the 25 basis points we pay on reserves here in the us and the 0.6 percent on the dollar swap so we we would expect that if conditions in europe were to improve continue to improve that the rate that which european banks could borrow dollars would be somewhat north of 25 basis points perhaps but below that point six percent so we would think that there's plenty of room in that difference for the european banks to obtain credit from private private entities and in fact we've actually seen uh private uh suppliers of dollars to the european banks return uh subsequent to the largest long-term refinancing operations and the dollar swap program so it looks like but but doesn't have already starting to normalize the dollar doesn't that weaken the value of the euro what they're doing uh you know if you look at you know i think the euro has really basically been trading uh in line with how the situation in europe looks if as a european situation worsens the euro depreciates as the european situation improves the euro appreciates uh so it's really based on the outlook for europe of course relative to the outlook in the us help me understand though it's if a weaker euro doesn't that mean a uh typically a weaker eurozone since we've sort of flagged this off as a european issue and are trying not to get dragged into it here from from the u.s side well you're certainly right that if the european outlook were to deteriorate the euro would probably weaken as a consequence the good news is over the last you know four or five months the euros actually strengthened a bit because europe has actually made some progress in terms of addressing some of their issues okay and then my time is almost up and i'll i know dr kim and you want to say something as well but i'm just i'm curious what keeps you up at night what other countries i mean you specifically i think in dr cayman's testimony talked briefly about greece and then you just were touching on uh spain and portugal but you know where are we at italy ireland um and are we on solid footing or i'm sorry are they on solid footing in france and germany and and some of those other countries that have been leading this well well um certainly the euro crisis in general is what keeps me up at night and and what's uh occupies much of my thinking time during the day as well uh obviously uh the situation of greece has been very difficult and we've been following that very closely we also obviously are very focused on on basically you know ireland and um portugal which are the recipients of imf funds and we think it's critically important that these problems not uh move further into spain and italy which have also been the focus of market attention so and we think it's absolutely critical to make sure that you don't have further uh contagion beyond that so far things have been looking on the brighter side there have been improvement in markets but we have continued to monitor the situation as closely as ever and then while most of my thinking lately is focused on europe obviously i'm thinking about oil prices as well because that is another uh area that poses a potential threat at least down the road thank you thank you i

joining us now congresswoman house Homeland Security and Grover norquist the president of Americans for tax reform Merry Christmas it's good to see you both okay Ukraine is in the fight of its life it's fighting for its freedom it's getting 45 billion dollars more congresswoman but GOP lawmakers are asking where are the checks and balances there was a special Inspector General for Afghanistan spending how come how come we don't have it for Ukraine we don't know if it's certainly going to Ukraine's defense no and that's the crazy part of it Liz is that now when you factor in the 45 47 billion dollars additional that will be going to Ukraine in this Omnibus package that takes that up to about a hundred billion dollars you've got Americans here at home that are demanding accountability on our Southwest border you've got crime rampant you've got historic inflation you have a Litany of issues that we all are paying for at the behest of this Administration and no one can tell us where this money is going my heart breaks for the ukrainians absolutely but every American deserves to know where every single dollar has gone and we need that now before we pass another 47 billion dollars to Ukraine so what the congresswoman just said Gerber again Afghanistan had it was called sigtar they had the special Inspector General for Afghanistan spending but we've got a massive 4 100 page big Bank spending Bill Congress won't fully read that America is going to have to pay for and higher taxes higher inflation higher interest rates forever well yes of course the bills over 4 100 pages long and there's another 2600 pages of explanation of what that means that's where all the earmarks are stuck in then the the explanation part uh this is poorly done I mean it's all thrown together it's hard to focus on any one piece of it it's almost as if it was on purpose to make it difficult to find out what was going on and who was getting uh what I would strongly recommend that we bring back a committee we used to have in the United States an anti-appropriations committee it was put in during World War II to recommend budget reductions and they would put it on the floor of the House and Senate and billions of dollars was cut while we were fighting World War II and into the 50s in order to save money so that you could put it into defense they seriously reduced spending because they had a whole committee whose job was to where could we save money it's time to bring that anti Appropriations Committee back into yeah that's interesting we hear you know GOP lawmakers are Grover's point you know congresswoman it seems like the GOP is divided uh has divided messaging on this new blowout government spending watch this fight watch before the election I explained to everybody no more blank checks for Ukraine we want to make sure where the money spent their passing trying to pass this where nobody can read it they never move these bills to the light of day they never had a hearing in the process so let's step back and say what are the real needs of the country right now you're in the defense part of our expenditures making sure the defense department can deal with the major threats coming from Russia and China providing assistance for the ukrainians to defeat the Russians that's the number one priority for the United States right now according to most Republicans that's sort of how we see the challenges confronting the country at the moment I'm pretty I'm proud of the fact that with the Democratic president Democratic house and Democratic Senate we were able to achieve through this Omnibus spending bill essentially all of our priorities the American people don't want this they're sick and tired of it they are paying for it through the nose with inflation adding a trillion dollars to the deficit will simply fuel the fires that are consuming our wages and consuming our retirement plans congresswoman why is Senator McConnell saying the number one issue facing Americans is Ukraine when voter polls in the midterms show that voters number one issue was the economy inflation also crime in the Border your reaction you know I can't speak for Senator McConnell but what I can tell you is folks back home are concerned about making rent they're concerned about the fact that they're behind on their utility bills today more than 16 billion dollars is owed in utility bills alone I represent a district that is very rural and has a senior population on fixed income so the concerns of my district along with many others across the United States is the issues here domestically but it's the Ukraine do your voters care about Ukraine no no I mean everybody everybody again collectively we feel in our hearts that this is an unjustified unprovoked War our hearts break for the people of Ukraine but we cannot be funding both sides of this war we just saw the Biden regime release The Merchant of death on one hand who's going to be providing arms shells from North Korea drones from Iran and funding the terror on that side of the the Russian side of the war and then simultaneously we're bankrolling the ukrainians what is the message here it's ridiculous and I will say this if you have to pass something into the dead of the night at two o'clock in the morning it's not because you want people to know what's in it it's because you're trying to hide it and this has 98 of all of the Democrat earmarks it speaks volumes of what's in it it's not American priorities it's the Democrats priority so to what the congressman is saying you know grow Americans do feel for Ukraine right it's terrible what's happening in Ukraine but a new NPR PBS Marist National poll most Americans six out of ten have no common confidence that Democrats and Republicans will work together in Congress in a bipartisan way and you have Americans are about to face this new 1099 reporting Nightmare and that is the uh there's a push by Senator Bill Hagerty and Senator Joe manchin Senator Joe manchin is talking more and more like he will become an independent and go to that party that you know this 600 threshold for you know venmo and PayPal apps right to transactions Grover this is a reporting nightmare for Americans now there's a push to raise it to ten thousand you know what I mean so what it what is with all the paperwork what are Democrats doing here okay what the Democrats did was say if if you get six hundred dollars in the course of a year through PayPal or venmo or any of the various uh areas eBay and so on that the company is going to send to the IRS that you got 600 or 700 or whatever it is and then you have to prove it's not income maybe you were splitting rent uh maybe you were sending money back and forth between family members uh any number of things uh or you sold an old motorcycle that cost you twice as much as what you sold it for but unless you have the receipts for all of the things that you're selling at some point you're going to be hit with a note from the IRS you owe us money on this how would you like to be audited tens of millions of these are going out it's a disaster the the Mansion bill is is not getting the support now from Hagerty what they're going for instead is a one-year uh delay of this so we can kill it next year and that's both nightmare two women the Senators and the congressman from West Virginia got it putting that forward it's unbelievable paperwork nightmare nightmare Congressman mechanic and Grover norquist thanks again for spending time with us tonight and have a happy holiday

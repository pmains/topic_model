for now we want to check in with congresswoman karen bass a democratic member from los angeles the chair of the congressional black caucus one of the most prominent members of the united states house of representative congresswoman good to know you are okay and at a safe location but um sort of walk us through the images that you have seen yourself today and and your reaction to to what you are seeing now well i am just absolutely stopped i mean [Music] riot is just shocking you know that this building has been completely closed since march because of the pandemic and how did all of these people get inside the capitol they have vandalized the building all throughout people are sheltering in place members and staff this is just such a sad day in american history when it's actually one of the days that the world looks to us for because this was the beginning of the peaceful transfer of power and we have a president that still refuses to admit that he lost an election we can report now that the fbi in fact has been deployed to help u.s capitol police protect federal property i'm curious though congressman congresswoman bass what was your personal experience when this erupted well my personal experience was getting out of the way and coming away from where it looked as though it was going to go south meaning that people were you know the crowd was beginning to get agitated fortunately i was not in the chambers when the protesters broke through and had to experience you know the tear gas like my other colleagues did but all of us have been told to shelter in place you know alarms went off to tell us that we needed to make sure that we were not walking around i mean the u.s capitol prior to today is probably one of the safest buildings in the country and we really need to look back and examine how it wound up being so vulnerable it is clearly still out of control the fbi might be on their way but they're not here now and we can't even continue the work of a peaceful transfer of power because of what has taken place and i don't know if you heard the president's so-called message can quiet things down but he's continuing to agitate uh rioters by saying that the election was stolen he won by a landslide etcetera you're tragic your democratic colleague ted liu has said that the 25th amendment should be invoked um others have said that that he should be impeached and removed do you agree with them well i think we just need to get to january 20th but i was looking at it a little differently i think it's a crime to incite a riot that's exactly what the president has done but then we have seen him commit so many crimes this country just needs to get to january 20th so that we can evict him out of the white house this is just so pitiful the other thing that is so sad to me is that he has clearly developed a cult following i mean these people are completely disconnected from reality they will jump over whatever cliff he tells them to jump over as as protesters were walking down the street they were saying things like one they were mad at at vice president smith because he refuses to violate the law but two they believe that trump was going to actually do something and that they were on their way to the capitol because trump had a surprise in line for them that is frightening when people are so willing to blindly follow somebody who has consistently lied to them and consistently puts them at risk because remember we still have a pandemic i'm looking at all of these protesters no social distance and no math he is also facilitating and instigating a super spreader event now we are hearing that one of your colleagues said that in fact the certification process will continue today it's almost five o'clock in the afternoon for you we know that the d.c mayor has instated a curfew from 6 pm tonight until 6 a.m tomorrow do you actually see that happening that the certification process will pick up where it left off today absolutely this is our constitutional responsibility and i will tell you that we assumed we were going to be here all day and all night you know it's not all that unusual for us to be here until two three four o'clock in the morning we are going to stay here until we offend it we finish our constitutional duty this will take a while but uh but it will happen no protest is going to stop us from transferring power away from this irresponsible unstable individual who has been running our government for the last four years and just one political question since it just broke within the last 15 minutes that john ossoff won the seat in georgia raphael warnock won the seat in georgia how does that change things for your constituents having a democratic senate well first of all hallelujah it changes things for the entire country it means that president biden and vice president harris will actually be able to govern it means that the voting rights act in john lewis's name will be signed by president biden it means that the george floyd justice and policing act will be signed by president biden you know that mitch mcconnell has had over 200 bipartisan bills sitting on his desk because all he wanted to do was confirm judges and so now we'll actually be able to get the work of this country done wow yeah i was going to say we'll end on that but i'm curious congresswoman bass what's next for you literally in the next few minutes what will you what's life like well life i mean i'm i'm trying to not be as angry as i am because this is just so despicable but um but i am waiting to be called in to vote to continue this process we will certify this election today mark my word if we have to stay here until 12 noon tomorrow we will do it we will get the job done for the american people all right congresswoman uh thank you for checking in with us uh our best to you and to your entire staff stay safe and stay in touch thank you always

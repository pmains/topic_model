the gentleman from nebraska mr smith is recognized to speak on his amendment thank you mr chairman i have a number of concerns about the family leave proposal we are considering here today i also have serious concerns that we are being asked to approve such a major new proposal just 48 hours after the text was released this proposal will have major consequences for every family and every small business in america they deserve better than an unvetted proposal like we have in front of us today however i will acknowledge this is not the first time our committee has considered family leave issues both earlier this year and in 2019 we had full committee hearings on a different proposal the family act 202 house democrats are co-sponsors of the family act in fact the family act has been preferred has been the preferred solution of house democrats for three congresses that bill unlike the proposal in front of us today has been in the public sphere long enough to digest and understand the consequences of so now i ask our colleagues on the other side to pick one should the social security administration run a new paid family and medical leave program or should it be the irs should we pay for this program through a payroll tax or should every taxpayer bear the cost of the program when they face higher taxes already each year the congressional budget office estimates that the universal paid family and medical leave program in this subtitle will cost american taxpayers 570 billion dollars over 10 years similarly the cbo estimated the cost of the family act comparable paid family and medical leave entitlement program would cost 547 billion over 10 years the joint committee on taxation estimated that covering the cost of the family act would require a payroll tax increase of between 2.7 and 3.1 percent a separate analysis by the american action forum found the family act would require a 2.9 percent payroll tax to fully finance that's equivalent to the medicare payroll tax mr chairman i'd like to submit this analysis by the american action forum for the record so ordered thank you that cost that could cost an average worker making fifty thousand dollars well over fifteen hundred dollars a year in new taxes whether they use the program or not over a career that's more than sixty thousand dollars that could cost an average worker i'm sorry democrats are actually hiding the ball unlike the paid f paid leave proposal currently in front of us which creates a new entitlement program from general revenue the family act at least attempted to provide an earned benefit with leave benefits funded by payroll taxes clearly many many democrat members of this committee thought the family act was the best approach to paid leave because 22 out of 25 of these democrats co-sponsored that bill and every democrat on this committee co-sponsored at last congress i would like to ask unanimous consent to include in the record a letter from may of this year signed by the american academy of pediatrics and a number of other interest groups from across the political spectrum the letter actually says and i quote the family act is the only paid national family and medical leave proposal that reflects what most people in the united states need this amendment would allow supporters of the family act to include that proposal which they've co-sponsored in this package and now yield back thank you

i think my next question is for dr anderson dr anderson we're hearing about more technologies here today and and taking carbon and and just turning it into some incredible things from a manufacturing process and i had the opportunity recently to sit down with the company carbon solutions materia usa out of pennsylvania and it gave me a piece of carbon and then gave me the fiber that they're able to turn it into and the graphite as well i mean i think it could be transformative when we think about the opportunities for high-speed fiber making carbon into high-speed fiber making semi-conductors my goodness other countries are dominating all these areas and we have to bring these back back to the united states so dr anderson i guess my question are you know are you committed to helping the department of energy bring these technologies uh to to fruition and help americans out here bringing these supply chains back into the united states uh yes yes we are all right and in fact i think that there is one um one opportunity here that uh we may not have may not have stated there are many uh communities across the country coal and power plant communities that are uh have been impacted and will become even more impacted as we move forward in the energy transition and as we uh create opportunities for adding value from the coal resource that are in these coal uh communities it turns out that many of these supply chains are much more efficient if uh the processing facilities are moved closer to the mine mouth and so in fact when we look at the replacement of jobs that mr beggar was alluding to earlier there is an opportunity to add value like you were mentioning these high-value products by bringing the supply chain back closer to the mine mouth and and creating additional jobs in addition to uh replacement of tonnages as was spoken of earlier is there anything more specific that you can describe what you you see the role the department of energy is in bringing this uh to to the to the real world well and so it is uh as one an applied laboratory and the government-owned government operated laboratory within the doe that manages program across fossil energy energy efficiency and renewable energy seizure and le it is our job to make sure that these technologies find their way into market and reduce risk and have the appropriate technology transfer uh pathways for all the technologies we work on including coal products and other carbon products and co2 utilization so it is firmly within our mission to try to get these technologies into the hands of the folks who will put it into commercial practice thank you and i yield back thank you senator

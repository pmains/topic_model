This year as we gather
together to celebrate Thanksgiving, I'm reminded
of the great blessings that we share as West
Virginians and Americans. Growing up in Farmington,
I was always taught that if you can count your
blessings, you can share your blessings. This
lesson has stuck with me throughout my life, and it
is a message I've proudly passed along to my
children and grandchildren.
Thanksgiving celebrations remind us of the
importance of family, the source of life's greatest
joys and deepest bonds. We are so blessed with the
riches of loving families and friends, a beautiful
state to call home and the knowledge that we are
truly a statewide community with an
unbreakable bond. We're also grateful to those who
make incredible sacrifices to keep us all safe and
free. While we should thank our Soldiers,
Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Guard members and
reservists every day for their dedication to this
country, I ask all West Virginians to take a
moment today to thank those who risked their
lives to serve and protect. Their courage and
strength are an inspiration to us all. To
our service members and their families: We are so
thankful for your service. Today and every day I'm
thankful for the privilege to serve the great State
of West Virginia. On behalf of Gayle, myself
and our entire family, we wish you and your family a
safe and happy Thanksgiving. May God
continue to bless the Great State of West
Virginia and United States of America.

thanks very much let's talk more about this filled with the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee congressman Adam Smith the congressman thanks for joining us thanks all good we are let's talk a little bit about this extreme vetting process the president says it will be very vigorous are you okay with the US tightening up the the vetting process for refugees coming into the United States and at least for the time being banning refugees from certain countries I'm not he I mean we already have a very extensive vetting process that did usually take 18 months two years and is incredible and it would be one thing if President Trump put out okay here's my new vetting process but he had done that he's just banned refugees from you know the Muslim countries that he named and I think that simply creates greater problems for the US because look this is Isis and al Qaeda's message this is a war of Islam against the West so when the US comes out and says we're not taking Muslims that simply feeds into the narrative that helps Isis and al Qaeda recruit and like I said we already have a vetting process and there is no evidence that any refugees that we have led into this country have committed any act of terrorism in the US do you think that the president can take the these extreme vetting measures without additional congressional authority in other words can he do it through executive action alone yeah I don't have the legal background and know what what what you can and cannot do through executive action it seems early in his presidency a president Trump is going to test those boundaries obviously it would be better if it was done legislatively it was done with the cooperation of the executive in the legislative branch but will we will see what he comes up with but in the meantime an outright ban while waiting for that with no you know specific idea when that band is going to stop I think goes against American values and goes against American interest in an interview with the christian broadcasting network or with David Brody in fact the president said today the Christian refugees say from Syria or Iraq should get priority you believe it in line with American values to give a religious test or a fast track to certain religious groups naturally not I mean we were founded on religious freedom and if we are going to be successful in fighting against Isis and al-qaeda and other Islamist extremist groups we are going to have to make it clear that our fight is not against an entire religion it is against the extremists within that religion in fact we are going to need some allies more than anybody else is going to be successful in this fight so if you lump them all together and say they're all bad like I said that just makes al Qaeda and Isis very happy makes recruitment easier and drive that wedge and start creating the clash of civilizations that I for one want to avoid but you understand congressman why a lot of americans believe extreme setting of refugees coming into the United States will protect them I do I think in large part is because people aren't aware of the vetting process that already exists and again they're not aware where apparently of the fact that we have not had terrorist attacks from refugees oh gosh you think of all the shootings that have gone on in the US most of them have been committed by US citizens so you know we have a strong vetting process in place already so the outright ban again sends that anti-muslim message that I don't think it's going to be helpful to us interests but there have been a terrorist attacks committed by refugees in Europe for example people have snuck through the process and have sympathy for Isis what what the president the supporters are saying they want to prevent what's going on in France elsewhere in Europe from happening here in the United States I completely agree with that but Europe doesn't have the same vetting process we have and I think the track record shows that and again if the President had come out and said look here's what's wrong with our vetting process we don't do this we don't do that I mean he had plenty of time to look at what our vetting process is he can describe it and tell us what's wrong with it that's not what he did he just said nope we're not taking any more refugees until further notice and again I do not think that's in our best interest you're the top Democrat of your arms Services Committee I want you to listen to what the president said today about the use of torture listen to this we have a great general who has just been appointed Secretary of Defense general Janice and he has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding or however you want to define enhanced interrogation I guess would be a word that a lot of words that a lot of people would like to use I don't necessarily agree but I would tell you that he will override because I'm giving him that power what do you make of that well first of all I'm very glad the Jim mattis is the Secretary of Defense I've worked with him very closely in many of his previous posts while i was on the Armed Services Committee I think he is a very smart man and very capable and it is good that he is in the place that he is to have a secretary of defense with Jim Madison's credibility to sort of balance out some of the more extreme statements and positions that the president has taken as a positive but also extensive studies have been done on this and basically torture doesn't work interrogation works when you do it in an entirely different way and we've had this researched and studied all over the place it isn't even effective in terms of getting information because when you're torturing someone now pretty much tell you whatever you want to hear that doesn't make it true and then of course there's the fact and John McCain has been very outspoken on this and I really applaud him for taking a stance that this is not American values to torture people and part of the reason is because John McCain was tortured by the Vietnamese he knows what it's like and he knows it is not something the United States should engage in on a value basis alone but beyond the value basis Jim mattis is right it doesn't work it's not the effect the most the effective way to get information out of suspects so it makes no sense whatsoever and I guess I can be glad the president Trump is a yielding to Jim mattis is greater experience and greater expertise on this issue congressman Adam Smith thanks so much for joining us thanks I

Congressman Andrew Clyde joins us now he's from the state of Georgia uh and he's a part of this push to get this guy out of our government what is the current status of Sam Britton sir and uh where does it stand right now well thank you very much uh from what we understand he's on leave right now uh the department of energy has not said why he's on leave and we don't really know whether it's paid leave or unpaid leave and I think those are important points that we need to know we need to understand why was he put on leave uh in my opinion he should be on uh unpaid leave and uh the department of energy needs to be forthright and explain the American people why they put him on leave I mean here you've got somebody who is light fingered expensive luggage and um admitted to it it's such a so uh it's such a ridiculous story it's yeah I mean it's such a ridiculous story and I if I know my government the way I think I do I'm sure he's on paid leave I doubt I doubt they're worried about his his little paycheck when they got all that money they're wasting every day I want to move on for a second hours ago you introduced legislation that would eliminate government by proxy censorship in response to Friday's Twitter files Revelations what can you tell us about this all right I certainly did I I filed it today it's called The Free Speech Defense Act uh you know I think it's very important that we maintain separation of the federal government uh from being involved in uh social media uh in what social media does there should be no collusion between the federal government and between social media the silence conservative voices whether you know it's a pro-gun issue it's a it's a it's a pro-life issue whatever it is when the social media social media gets involved at the request of the federal government then that's a violation of the Constitution that's illegal yeah understood last night in your state Rafael Warnock got reelected beating Herschel Walker in the Senate runoff I wish I was surprised by the outcome what what exactly do you think needs to change in your state and in other states uh we were just talking a little bit about it a second ago but um it's obvious that that there's a big problem I mean Warnock should have been a fairly easy guy to beat in a state like Georgia I would have thought well I certainly agree with you there you know my district The Ninth District the most conservative one in all of Georgia it performed well um but you know we need a better ground game and we need to get people out to vote you know the Democrats poured a tremendous amount of money into our state and uh they they just in my opinion deceived people very interesting yeah we're still good we got to figure this out we really do especially for the next one Congressman Clyde thank you so much for taking the time well thank you very much appreciate it

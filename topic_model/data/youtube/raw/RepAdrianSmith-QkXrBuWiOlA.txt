LEAD -- LEADER, MR. SMITH OF NEBRASKA. MR. SMITH: I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION TO HOLD RUSSIA ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS INVASION OF UKRAINE. I AM GLAD WE HAVE FINALLY REACHED CONSENSUS. THIS REVOKES PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS FOR RUSSIA AND NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS FOR BELARUS PUTTING THEM IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS NORTH KOREA AND CUE BARK APPROPRIATELY. SO THE U.S. MUST TAKE LEAD IN SHOWING THE REAL ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLENT ACTS AGAINST NATO MEMBERS AND PARTNERS AND THIS BILL IS A KEY ELEMENT OF THAT. WE WERE ALL MOVED BY PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY'S ADDRESS EARLIER THIS WEEK AND I'M GLAD WE'RE FINALLY ANSWERING HIS CALL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. WE CAN AND SHOULD DO MORE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO BANNING ENERGY IMPORTS FROM RUSSIA. AS REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE TRADE SUBCOMMITTEE I'M GLAD THIS BILL IS FINALLY SEEING A VOAD ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME SO WE CAN USE THE TRADE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOS

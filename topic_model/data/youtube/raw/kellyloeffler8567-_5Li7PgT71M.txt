joining me by phone uh one of the two George Sanders oh if I can get to the call screening program there it is the screen keeps freezing it is Senator Kelly Leffler joining me today senator how are you I'm doing well how are you I'm great congratulations I let me get this out of the the gate you had all these people holding the stock nonsense over your head and and turns out you were right and they were wrong and the Justice Department agrees well that's right Eric the media got this completely wrong again I've been completely exonerated and I said from the start I'd answer any questions it was a political witch-hunt it's the same left-wing fake news that spreads false information about the president day-in day-out they've done this with impeachment with the Russian investigation and Michael Flynn now so look I never distracted me I have been working tirelessly for Georgians I think they see that and I'm glad to be able to you know clear this off the table and get back to talking about the things that matter to Georgians well it so I'm glad this is cleared and off the table uh and I'm glad that they did this and not just for you for some of these other people who were being looked at uh one apparently from North Carolina still has issues but I'm glad because it was very obvious that you've done the right things when you when you got into office and so I'm glad you're cleared and I'm glad because now I don't feel like like I'm guilty when I asked you a question about the stock market because it's doing and the Dow was down slightly today but it looks like we're starting to see the markets recognizing we're headed into an economic recovery well I certainly hope that's the case and I'm truly so busy with my Senate work here I don't follow it day-to-day but I can tell you that it's vitally important that this state reopens that our nation reopens and I am so proud of Governor Kemp for leading our country out of this and for leading our state to open safely and quickly because I got to tell you when you look at these unemployment numbers they're so staggering I don't think we quite know what the endgame could be here but we're looking at 41 million Americans unemployed filing initial jobless claims in the last ten weeks that's pretty staggering it is and you were criticized as was the governor when he came out and said he was going to reopen the state and there were some media blowback at the national press towards you for saying you thought he was doing the right thing and now it turns out according to ABC News today that none of the 18 states that follow George's lead including Georgia have seen a statistical significant uptick in the virus and yet people are starting to go back to work that's right and it's vitally important that we get people back to work I've been going around this state in the past couple of weeks and talking with small businesses that we help get PPP and talking to employees whose jobs were saved and so impressing so impressed to see how they've been doing this safely they're wearing masks they have hand sanitizers they have plexiglass dividers where needed and so I think look we know how to do this we can do it safely we absolutely need to make sure that we can get back to school and church and work because the economic destruction could be much worse than what the virus wrought on us and you know I do have to say we we mourn the lives lost and we have to hold China accountable for what they've done in creating the spread of this virus around the world but we can't have Americans pay even more at this time than we already have in terms of lives and economics well I want to ask you about China the president's press conference today withdrawn from the World Health Organization it we continue as a country to benefit from cheaply produced products in China and I'm wondering what your sense is on moving forward what we might need to do economically to begin making sure that particularly our national security infrastructure medicines are not dependent on a Chinese supply chain this is critically important you're absolutely right and I applaud the president for holding China accountable midway through the the delivery of the relief through the cares Act I started developing a plan called the USA rice plan and it was really about looking ahead of how do we make sure that this never happens again and how do we use this opportunity to stand up American business and one of the first tenants of it that it was called made in the USA so it has four pillars made in the USA grown in the USA hiring in the USA and families in the USA and it's critical that we get our supply chains is dependent on China and to the extent that it also reduces the reliance on China it also increases employment in our country and so it'd be a great economic engine so I think this is the right time to have those conversations and move in that direction I gotta ask you a more question on this but I've gotta put you on hold real quick cuz we got a traffic situation after the vice president's been in town and need to go check with Doug Turnbull Hey Thank You Erica 443 here vice president heads is but wheels up a while so no loud related closures because this motorcade that's good news the bad news though in the college park we have a red alert 85 North is still completely shut down crash investigation of multiple cars did it before I 285 exit 68 and the triple-t traffic alerts tab shows a big time back up before I leave 138 looks like getting even backed up now in 85 doors ramping to highway 74 next and 61 that's where you need to exit a used 29 Roosevelt Highway as it all started off thank you very much now see senator if you were in the state Senate I'd be now probing you on all the infrastructure with related traffic but it's actually been pretty nice around here lately so we have low traffic let me ask you on one more thing on the Chinese situation one of the push backs that you'll get on this I know Josh Holley David Perdue and others have as well is that a plan like what you're structuring would raise prices on Americans and and it's better that we get cheap stuff from China than then risk people seeing higher prices well there's a delicate balance there and I think what we have to do as a country is to have the right incentives and as a businesswoman coming out of nearly three decades of working in business you know we have to look at the impact on on businesses and consumers here but make sure we have the right incentives whether it's the right tax rate the right employment structures I've recommended that as part of the u.s. a rise plan that through year end that we remove the payroll tax and to incent incentivize hiring and make labor here more affordable so I think there's things that we can do in a in a kind of a fair market way that that creates benefits for Americans and drives employment and opportunity while creating the stability of our supply chains we shouldn't be too on China for medicine or other supplies in it just seems to me that given the situation in Hong Kong where the there were still a lot of businesses in Hong Kong that stayed after the British gave it to China that now just seems like might be the perfect opportunity for the United States to find ways to incentivize some of those companies that stayed in Hong Kong to maybe consider pull it up and coming to the United States well you know certainly those incentives may already exist just by the sheer actions of the Chinese I think there's probably a lot of discussions going on within international businesses to say what is that position now because if we're treating Hong Kong just like we're treating China that's going to change the playing field dramatically and I think it's going to you know companies will move quickly because if they have assets and resources and personnel there they're going to want to protect those and it's definitely going to impact Hong Kong in a very negative way which is which is extremely unfortunate but it's an opportunity for the United States to to strengthen what we have here you know it don't tell me you're probably the best person on the planet to ask this question to given your background I read one time that after sarbanes-oxley passed in the Bush administration a lot of companies started going with the London Stock Exchange's of the New York Stock Exchange and then after dodd-frank it escalated with people going to either the Japanese stock market or the Hong Kong exchange or London or Germany and what you're seeing are these international companies choosing not necessarily to have their largest presence in American markets and I'm wondering if there's a way what one if you would agree with that assessment and two if so is there a way now with this pandemic to try to get Congress maybe to rethink some of the disincentives we've had international companies headquarter in here well I think that's a common discussion certainly within in business and otherwise because you know what what's important is that businesses feel like they can operate knowing the rules of the road there's nothing that hurts business more than uncertainty and when regulatory and regulatory requirements are changing that creates a lot of the uncertainty you mentioned around sarbanes-oxley or dodd-frank and companies look to position themselves there was something a few years ago known as inversions where that companies looked at the various tax regimes and said you know where we did where do we need to operate and you know so so companies are always looking at that and saying what's prudent at this time and so you know I think it's it's not so much maybe a government decision but companies will be looking to get certainty around that and right now with regard to China and Hong Kong it's early to say but you know we there is a you know companies tend to operate in a global marketplace so they will be making those decisions in real time well hopefully we'll be in a position to capitalize senator thank you very much for taking your time today thank you so much and congratulations again on being cleared of that nonsense and and glad to be able to have you is solely focused on the people Georgia right now thank you very great to be with y'all you too senator

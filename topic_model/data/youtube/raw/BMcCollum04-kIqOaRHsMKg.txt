well good morning and thank you to our witnesses from matamidai moundsview saint anthony new brighton south washington county and white bear lake schools for appearing today to provide testimony about how the american rescue plan is being implemented in our school districts i want to thank you for the service to our community especially during the ongoing pandemic you've had the pandemic plus two waves to deal with and our educators leaders community leaders have gone above and beyond to support our principal staff teachers their families and students throughout the most challenging time based in in our generation with a public health emergency it's important that we look back on what we faced in 2020 in our communities across the country and let's face it around the world we faced an unprecedented pandemic it put every person's life at risk it stressed our health care system to the breaking point it closed schools it crippled our economy and exposed all the economic social religious and racial divides that undermine our society and the well-being of tens of millions of americans we were in a crisis at the same time back then our country was run by a president who propagated his own crisis rejected the science and failed to respond in the early phases of the early phases of the pandemic i want to be clear i understand that this crisis is not over yet despite the process families schools and our democracy while we're still struggling my democratic house colleagues and i stepped up to work with president biden and local communities in a hand to hand to provide federal funding and tools to build back better for a brighter future we save lives we save jobs we save businesses and we prevented millions of families from falling into poverty we know we've made major progress from a year ago but the omicron variant has forced us all to recalibrate especially in our schools and i want to commend governor wallace a former social studies teacher like myself for encouraging vaccines and testing at schools and i hope whatever your community health targeted response was that it's working well for you most of you are in ramsey county and so i'm very familiar with what we're doing there and i've been educated on what's going on in washington county but i know that your students have endured much during this crisis and i know you're doing everything you can to help students with their social and emotional as well as their educational needs keeping schools open keeping kids in school is a priority but we all know what must be done safely we are asking an awful lot of you as superintendents teachers instructors and school board members and chairs we're asking so much from you as a member of congress it's my job to work with you to make sure that you have the resources you need and that they're presented to you in a way in which you can use them to fit the needs of your school district we also have worked really hard with the american rescue plan we know that it sped up vaccine distribution it helped with testing it helped with small business relief it put food on the table and kept students stomachs full and a lot of that delivery fell on you thank you for doing that we also know that we needed to keep kids and educators safe in school and allow local units of government to maintain as essential services the law also made a down payment on cutting child poverty in half by expanding the tax credit and making it fully refundable however it's sad that i have to report that this has expired because the extension right now is being blocked from going from continuing on in the senate primarily by members of the other side of the aisle we also provided funding for more affordable child care and increasing resources for head start and more we also had another thing that we worked on and that was doing what we could to protect our crumbling infrastructure so there's seven billion dollars that went to minnesota and that passed in a bipartisan infrastructure bill that many are you aware of we're excited about the opportunity to create good paying union jobs and rebuilding america's infrastructure thirdly in the build back better act for the future we're working and that that is the bill that's stuck in the senate right now and we did the physical infrastructure but we were also working on the human infrastructure bill and that bill uh is going to if we can pass it and move forward create an average of 12 million jobs each year excuse me 2 million jobs each year over the next decade so i'm excited about the buildback better process it's going through a scrubbing called the bird rule and then in the u.s house we're calling it the bird bath to figure out what what what the senate will work with us on on the human infrastructure side but we are um we are facing um people who are not supportive a lot of things in that bill and the child tax credit is one example of that and it was a lifeline for many of the families of the students that you work with i look forward to hearing from you though this is about doing some oversight due diligence so i can make sure that if we are providing funding and there are still things in the way that are not allowing you to expedite that funding in a way that fits your unique school district or the needs of your students that we do so but right now i would just like to say that the law currently is delivering 240 million dollars to minnesota cities because the health of our cities are important to our school districts 107 million dollars to ramsey county 50 million dollars to the portions of washington county and more than 300 million dollars in aid for school districts in the fourth district so it's to keep our schools open to keep them safe it's for students it's for faculty it needs to have the flexibility you need in order to deliver what you need to deliver for your students and for your families mounds montemede high school it was over six hundred thousand dollars mounds view nearly 10 million dollars saint anthony to brighton eight hundred thousand dollars south washington county nearly three million dollars in white bear lake area over six million dollars so the adult the law is delivering 130 billion dollars to state departments of education to help keep schools open and safe and valuable learning for our children we know that have lost time in the classroom and as hard as everybody worked on virtual learning with the clicks on clicks off we know that we are not doing the job that we're all capable of doing in providing a great education for our students you know the american rescue plan it had the categories of case k-12 schools but one of the things in k-12 schools that had 30 billion dollars for individuals with the disability education act and those are some of our most vulnerable students and i i know we all want to make sure that they have the same opportunity to succeed the rescue plan was providing 1.4 billion dollars from minnesota schools in general k through 12. it was the essential resources that i talked about to so that you could do what you needed to do to keep your schools open safely so i'm going to turn it over to you and i nee i saw some of you have some great information if you would provide any information that you use individually you have sally gagne's information or rebecca taylor or sophia schilling sally works in our minnesota office that's her name up there so maybe you've worked with her on it rebecca taylor is my uh head over um non-defense uh staff and um is as a phd and works on education herself so she really understands what's going on and many of you work with sophia over things over the years so we're going to turn it over to montemedi first so um superintendent if you would take it away and if you have a school board member who's going to speak please introduce them over the course of the the pandemic mata media public schools has been awarded about a total of two million two hundred thousand dollars in one-time funding to address those coven 19 related expenses these are these we did receive funding from the federal grants but also a local grant from washington county when washington county was determining how to use their federal funds as well without these code 19 related grants our district would have needed to address the impact of covet 19 and the needs of our students regardless and we would have to have done it through our general fund and so this would have taken funding away from the classrooms and so accepting these grants meant that our district could both address the impact of covet 19 without addre impacting our critical funding we depend on for our classrooms so we're very thankful for all the funding that we've received to support our staff and students so during the 2021 school year we did have to go through four learning models hybrid we started with hybrid we went to distance learning we returned to hybrid and then in-person learning so during that our our our response to those learning model changes were supported by pandemic funding by allowing us to hire additional staff to lower our class sizes so that during our elementary hybrid model we were still able to keep our students four days in person we also provided special education program and intervention program during distance learning so year round are our students with our highest needs were able to be in person at least partially during each week we it also allowed us for the coordination and support staff for our tier one care in order to prepare for that 2021 school year we did have a a partial program for devices for technology but we were able to to expand so that we had a device for every learner during the pandemic and that continues now and that was a critical part for supporting our students and staff we also were able to expand our summer programming including transportation which has not been something we've always been able to do is transport to our expan our summer programming so we were able to expand that summer programming and offer academic recovery for more students during the summer and that continues to be our plan for this coming summer as well around health and safety we were able to do an evaluation of our indoor air quality and do some improvements to all our buildings we hired additional cleaning staff and then of course it it also provided additional sanitizing supplies and also masks and ppe for our staff we we started a pilot testing program before testing was wildly available also which was which was funded from our pandemic funding yet underscore enough the um the impact that is funding in these resources as you know superintendent dufferin um highlighted in superintendent linux will have had on our operation so with that i will pass it over to to the person who's actually doing the real work um i just get to do like the school board stuff uh mr lenox i will say that the american rescue plan funding has been incredibly valuable and very important to our school district and specifically mound view public schools has actually received about 11.9 million dollars in federal funding over this period that's uh really an increase of about seven percent to our to our overall budget to put that in perspective these funds really have assisted us in a number of ways but i would say increased staffing is one of the ways i'd want to highlight today addressing student needs specific student learning areas learning loss mental health social emotional support technology devices tools as well as software and covet 19 supplies including cleaning supplies sanitation all of the testing and ppe that we've we've needed to purchase throughout the pandemic and i'd hearken back when that when this pandemic first started schools in minnesota really were moved into distance learning so we immediately went into that model and in mount zoo public schools that's not something we had done before while we certainly have technology in our classrooms and had some curriculum and content online for our students distance learning required us to to move into that model comprehensively and so sending devices home with each of our students became a a priority for us we had to make sure that each one of our students had a device so that they would be able to access this instruction online through this new online learning model now beyond the devices that we needed to secure and get to our students it also required internet connectivity so we had to make some significant investments for hot spots we also partnered with families and uh providers to create internet connections for our families that really was happening across our district um at that point i just think we'd really be remiss if we didn't mention the growing mental health needs we're seeing with our students this pandemic has taken a toll on all of us and certainly on our students mental health and social emotional well-being we've seen some dramatic increases um in the need for support in this particular area so in our district we've begun shifting resources and adding resources across all of our schools we've been able to secure partnerships with some of our local health providers to allow us to best meet those needs so now i'm happy to say in all of our schools we have dedicated support staff who are available to support students and families really on a daily basis as needed we've also increased partnerships with local health providers so now again at all of our sites students have access to therapists for individual support should that be needed and again we're seeing that increase over the course of this pandemic we see this as a significant and ongoing area where we're going to need to continue to invest resources and we certainly intend to continue to provide prioritize our resources in this area supporting all of our students so in closing i might just say how much we truly appreciate what the american rescue plan funding has been able to do for us in the mounds view public schools i know we wouldn't have been able to meet the needs many and varying needs that we've seen throughout the pandemic without that support so thank you much appreciated well good morning and thank you representative mccollum for the opportunity to share the work that we have done at st anthony new brighton schools using the american rescue plan funds my name is laura oxnavad and i'm the chairperson of the saint anthony new brighton school board i will give a very brief overview of our district and then pass the microphone over to our superintendent of schools dr renee courney so saint anthony new brighton is the smallest geographic district in the state of minnesota our district consists of one preschool one elementary school one middle school one high school with approximately 1 780 students k through 12. we like to say we are small but mighty what we learned from kovid was that um kovid made everything in the world potentially all of the issues in our world more vivid in color those things that we all maybe knew existed those inequities covid brought out those inequities in brighter more vibrant colors and so as we looked at that we said to ourselves well as we think about the funding we are receiving this one-time funding that is so important how does that allow us to come back potentially from covid19 not just to where we were but better and more equitable our number one use of our funds really came in one two and three which was saying how do we address learning and potentially interrupted learning but not just do it by providing kids with more worksheets in red pens marking their mistakes but really envisioning it with um social emotional depth and how do we add community to that and creating a system where our school becomes the the the sanctuary for for learning and building citizens citizens for our future and so that is where we really focus the majority of our funding and we did that through the core of what schools do and that is teaching and learning within the steep steeping of relationships and social emotional wellness we also knew that we needed to have our children in the building to accomplish that and so we needed to prioritize in person learning especially coming off of distance learning and so we spent a lot of our funds to ensure and again it's not as much fun to talk about your hvac systems but really that circulation of air is really what allows us to allow kids into our system we also promoted and pushed for vaccinations minnesota department health actually called us and said why don't you have any covet cases there and really we weren't hiding we really didn't have many coveted cases and it was because of our high vaccination rate our awesome filtration system and a commitment to masking as well as our testing and so that was really available and was we were able to do that as a super small district because of the fundings that funding that we had first of all i'd like to take this time to thank you congressman mccollum for all the work you do for all of us for the state of minnesota for our communities we need more people like you um this has truly been an unprecedented time none like we've ever experienced before south washington county is so grateful for the funding we received we have over 19 000 students 28 schools with 40 percent minority enrollment 13.1 percent of students who are economically dis disadvantaged so these funds truly truly are needed in our district as part of the american rescue plan south washington county schools received 8.6 million dollars and i told dan that i would highlight the big three and he can take all of the small pieces and so our big three and i do have a one pager that i will forward um on so that you have those notes the big three really are this first the majority of dollars are going to be spent as we move into this coming budget year in the following budget year and that is to reduce class size across our k-12 system that 3.6 million dollars allows us to invest approximately 14 to 15 additional staff members for this coming school year and then into the next school year um and we know that they're one-time dollars but we are ever so grateful during this recovery phase to be able to do that secondly it was truly uh the dollars came at just the right time for our elementary virtual learning academy for those of you on the call you know that staffing occurs typically in january and at that point we were not sure about what we were going to do in terms of offering a k-6 virtual option we ended up offering a k-6 virtual option we had 330 students enrolled um and so that started this year we currently still have 270 students enrolled in our virtual option and what that allowed us to do is to have dedicated staff for our virtual option meaning that if students went back to their classroom we were already staffed at the correct ratios and so this allowed us flexibility as students maybe moved in between the virtual learning as well as in person we had great success i think it speaks for itself that we started with 330 students and throughout this whole year we still are hanging on to 270. we found so much success that we also now are considering a so-washco online for our k5 students and just to give you a little idea of impact we had two sections of k-5 and because of the vaccinations we did offer a sixth grade virtual option and we did have about 30 students who enrolled as sixth graders um to be in that virtual option so our elementaries are k5 but we did allow for that sixth grade option um and then our third third area of spending expanded summer programming and what we did in south washington county is we allowed our principals working with their school teams to come up with ideas and to submit those for additional dollars so whether that be remedial activities enrichment activities and so our schools had the opportunity to submit similar to a grant for dollars that we had available um and that combined with summer summer targeted services we're really looking forward to an opportunity uh to be able to utilize the bulk of those dollars this coming summer one big thing that really helped us financially is we were able to access through this bill uh the emergency connectivity and we're able to access almost a million dollars through there and our technology director jumped on that and we were able to purchase chromebooks ipads hot spots to ensure that all our students would have access to online learning the timing of this was fantastic from the bean counter point of view because it was crucial we just had to reduce our technology budget by about five hundred thousand dollars just to get through our budget reduction process and within eight months we're able to replenish that with with these ar p dollars we also access arp dollars to enhance our special education department with the purchases of ipads chromebooks and assistive technology and new curriculum that would work online and we spent about five hundred thousand dollars on that my name is jessica ellison and i serve as the chair of the white bear lake area school board and i'm an educator by trade and so i already knew going in that it takes a lot of people to educate a student but what this pandemic has really shown is that it is really an all hands on deck situation when there's an emergency and i am grateful congresswoman mccollum and for all of the superintendents and my fellow board members for the courageous leadership that you've shown in such a difficult time i also want to give a shout out to our teachers and staff and administration in particular our special education staff it's a it's a very different sort of education when you have students with high needs and they've done remarkable work i also want to say thank you as a parent congresswoman mccollum i'm a parent of four students in the district and as someone who became a one income household because of covid the meals that have come through the district have been a lifesaver for our family and i know we are not alone in that so i am incredibly grateful for the leadership that has made it made it a little easier for our families and with that i will say again thank you so very much to all of you and pass it on to our superintendent dr kazmerczek we applied for and received american rescue plan funds including elementary and secondary school emergency relief funds to help mitigate and reverse negative effects that the copa 19 pandemic has had on our students with the use of these funds we've been able to provide our students with specialized support and to use innovative approaches so specialized services were provided for various student groups almost a half a million dollars was set aside to specifically serve students in our special education program providing support and learning recovery for students with special needs another 120 000 is used to support students experiencing homelessness for those who lack a fixed adequate nighttime residence another almost half million was earmarked for covet 19 innovative testing initiatives so we provide our students and staff members with at home covet tests and in line with our mitigation strategies to keep our students healthy and in school and with this funding we're also able to partner with our our friends and neighbors maramira which has been referenced to open a staff to open end staff at kobit 19 voluntary testing center offering students and staff members the opportunity for rapid molecular tests the bulk of the funds we received came in the form of esser funds we use the funds to launch to distance learning academy option for our families and to minimize the budgetary impact due to lower enrollment caused by the pandemic and that really was a lifesaver as we much like south washington county we were in the midst of budget reductions and and that was exacerbated by the by the loss and enrollment caused by the pandemic professional development was another initiative funded through esser with priority geared towards student academic support and initiatives to ensure equitable access to educational services as we double down on our efforts to address gaps in student learning caused by the instability brought on by cobit 19. literacy improvement initiatives and mental health resources for students and staff were also prioritized in the district using the federal support operationally the district was able to purchase covet related materials with the funds covering supplies such as masks for students and staff air filters sanitizer cleaning supplies these unanticipated costs were more easily absorbed because of the federal dollars so learning recovery initiatives have been funded by esser including the hiring of academic achievement specialists and the implementation of additional multi-tiered systems of support through which we have added a reading specialist at one of our high school buildings reading and math board tutors at our elementary schools and promise fellows at our secondary schools additionally we have funded summer programming for students and professional development for staff members focused on elementary reading and literacy the district continues to plan additional uses for esser funding streams as we help our students navigate their educational recovery the effects of covet 19 the the effects that kova 19 has had on our district community state nation world were numerous but i'm proud to say that even in the midst of such challenges we were able to remain nimble and figure out ways to serve our students and families in ways we never had before and yes or funds have been a key to our ability to do so so some of the wins we have celebrated in this uncertain time have been the following we've been able to offer distance learning for our families who choose that learning model our distance learning academy is in its second year and serves students in grades k through 12. as i mentioned we have a very robust testing model and again mentioning our partnership with matamidai we've been able to retain employees we would otherwise lost due to budgetary constraints the ability to retain employees for schools and programs has been essential especially in these times of staffing challenges and employee absences due to illness so as the future of school funding is being discussed i think it's important to keep in mind some lessons we have learned in white bear through our work at the ground level the most helpful funding for school districts is that which is provided with flexibility so that districts may utilize the funding in ways that best fits fit their needs it is most beneficial for school districts to receive economic and financial relief through a process that isn't overly burdensome regimented so that they can build a plan that best fits their local situation and i feel like i'm repeating the congresswoman's comments as we opened up because that you you get that and you nailed it i want to once again thank all of the superintendents uh please pass on to your entire faculty and that includes you know the person who greets somebody at the door the the bus driver the school lunch lady my my sister uh was head of nutrition services at one of the other school districts i talked to all the school districts now i i did you in two tranches so everybody got an equal amount of time to really present so thank you for doing that and to the school board chairs um school boards you know sometimes people think this is the first time that school boards have faced controversy uh having grown up um i'm not afraid of expressing my age having grown up uh in in the 60s during the civil uh rights movement as a child watching um my my parents uh fight for equity to know that we are having to do that again is something that haunts me each and every day we should be building up not having to look back and reposition on on hard-fought gains in the civil rights movement the women's movement you know the the right for school districts and children to be able to you know go to a library and feel safe and secure in what they're checking out and what they're learning about you're in the front and center of that all the time and you have been as school board members and now you faced a public health emergency which became political i can't thank you enough as a elected official a former city council person i know what you're what you what you're doing you're not doing it for the glory and you're not doing it for the pay you're doing it because you want to pay it forward for the next generation so to the chairs please thank all of your board members for standing up and and doing what they do because the superintendents and and the and students need you to do that for those of the you who had slides and presentation you chose to do it that way everybody has their own different way in which they present uh thank you for sharing that with our office for those of you who have written comments please do that as well uh it's been an honor and privilege to work with you uh to hear what we got right and got wrong in the cares act from the early conversations that we had earlier as you know i'm an appropriator so and there's a difference in congress between appropriators and authorizers authorizers pass a lot of bills i don't pass a lot of bills i pass the big bills that have the money in it and so i was really pleased with the feedback that you gave me early on with the cares act that we were able to write into the appropriations act the american rescue plan the flexibility that you needed i'm pleased to hear that it it worked but i also want to know if we could have done things things better please don't feel uh you know like like you can't share that we can always learn from our actions that's part of education right you're never done learning so i'm not dr um i want to know as we move forward with our appropriation bills what we can do to help build on what you're doing to make sure that our students can achieve we each have our own land of government and so i appreciate you um you know putting on putting in the blinker the merge lane or whatever to get in to tell me what i can do better and for you're always willing to pick up the phone and talk to our office uh and and share things as we move forward so the aid that we provided to minnesota the one billion dollars in aid i have to say you all get high marks for how you used it used it in a common goal of making sure that our schools were you know helping our children learn but you did it in the own unique ways in which to serve your students and that's what we wanted with the flexibility i also want to say that i am deeply grateful than in minnesota that in the fourth district for all the care that you provided to our students to our families whether it was testing vaccine information free meals the hot spot whatever you did i had the opportunity to provide some families with a few meals in their car at some of the sites that i went to earlier this was something that you haven't ever planned on being able to do and you did it and you did it with grace and you did it with dignity to those families so thank you i don't talk about this very often when it comes to some of the essential services in our families um but i know what it's like as a child to be food insecure and worried about your shelter so thank you for making the difference in the life of a child i believe and i want to thank you for working with me today that is my job to make sure the ladder's down the window's open and the door is never shut and that's what you've done for uh children today using the american rescue plan so i look forward to working with you on other issues as we come out of this pandemic to make our schools more vibrant more places of hope and opportunity for every single student regardless of ability regardless of faith regardless of race regardless of just being the individual that they want to be to make the most of being in this country to learn how to be good citizens in the future so um stay in touch with josh and sally and of course with sophia here in washington dc uh you're all very busy thank you for taking the time out thank you to the chairs because when i was on the north st paul city council i had a full-time job trying to do all the council stuff so thank you thank you thank you to the school board

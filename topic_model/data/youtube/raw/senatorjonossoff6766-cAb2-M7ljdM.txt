thank you and hello everybody thank you for joining us i want to thank in particular our hosts at the ray thank you harriet langford for your leadership and your family's leadership i want to thank ali kelly as well for her leadership of the ray this is an extraordinary asset that we have in the state of georgia the nation's leading example of sustainable highway innovation i was really honored to tour the ray today to see how solar energy generation data and energy transmission growing vegetation that supports populations of pollinating insects all the while putting safety first and transforming a highway into an asset to our state to this community and to the whole country leading the way on technological innovation and environmental sustainability thank you to the ray for what you do for our state and it is inspired by the example that the ray has set that today i'm pleased to announce i'll be introducing the sustainable highways innovation act in the united states senate this legislation will permit the use of underutilized highway rights of way on interstate highways across the country for purposes like this for solar energy generation for energy and data transmission to connect communities with broadband internet access and for electric vehicle charging infrastructure we're working right now in congress to make a generational investment in infrastructure and clean energy that's why last week i introduced the solar manufacturing tax credit legislation to boost domestic solar manufacturing and it's why this week i'm proud to announce the sustainable highways innovation act we have some core goals that must be achieved in the coming decade we need to encourage the mass adoption of electric vehicles we need to accelerate our transition to clean energy and we need to ensure every community in georgia and across the country has access to broadband high-speed internet the sustainable highways innovation act inspired by the example of the ray highway here in georgia we'll scale these solutions nationwide and connect our country using existing highway rights of way to build solar arrays to build broadband internet connectivity and to build electric vehicle charging capacity so thank you all for joining for this announcement and we're going to continue to lead the way in georgia we have the largest solar panel manufacturing facility in the western hemisphere we have one of the most exciting electric vehicle battery production plants in the world we have the most innovative stretch of sustainable highway in the country georgia must and will become our national clean energy leader and the united states must become our global clean energy leader and look forward to any questions from the government do press far as rights of way that maybe local or state governments well this legislation will permit state departments of transportation like g-dot to use the under-utilized rights of way along federally assisted highways for these purposes for renewable energy projects for broadband internet projects for electric vehicle charging facilities and also encourage for example we heard about the plant life that's been cultivated along this highway to support pollinating insect species so we're also looking at regenerative vegetative practices sustainable growing practices that will let state dots access and use the full potential value of these highway rights of way yes sir sure so similar to the solar manufacturing legislation that i introduced last week just as our objective with that bill is to get that folded in to the overall infrastructure package that will also be our goal with this legislation this is really about envisioning where america needs to be in the very near future we have long deferred necessary investments in infrastructure maintenance and construction in the transition to clean energy in expansion of broadband internet access the transition to electric vehicles so this legislation that i'm introducing from the solar manufacturing tax credit to the sustainable highways innovation act is about helping to accelerate our achievement of these vital goals the transition to clean energy the adoption of electric vehicles and universal high-speed internet access yes like this with sustainability well one of the things that's most impressed me about the team at the ray is that georgians are developing innovating and deploying this technology for the first time and then sharing lessons learned and all the fruits of that labor with state departments of transportation across the country with leading innovators across the country so when it comes to solar module manufacturing when it comes to sustainable highway innovation when it comes to electric vehicle battery production georgia's leading the way and when i was running for the senate i said that our ambition must be that georgia leads the country on sustainability and clean energy it's about protecting our environment and also investing in our economic future all of these innovations also create jobs improve our quality of life support public health so this is a win-win for our state and the community for the country and for the planet broadband and that's been something that's been talked about in georgia for years and years what makes this push and this approach different than what we've seen in past years well finally we are serious about making the necessary investments in making high-speed internet access universal in transitioning from fossil fuel combustion to clean energy and creating thousands of jobs across the state and hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country while we do it we're poised right now to make a once in a century generational investment in infrastructure and clean energy we're going to assert american leadership and vision and strength to upgrade our quality of life to protect our planet and to lead the way internationally on this effort and i'll be visiting the kia facility later today because we passed legislation to boost american semiconductor manufacturing and shortages of those semiconductors have led to periodic announced closures of the kia plant but stepping back this is about having an integrated vision for georgia's economic future and america's economic future we are boosting solar panel manufacturing in the united states while we open up highway rights of way for the deployment of new solar farms we're unlocking all the unused value of these interstate highways to allow clean energy generation broadband internet access electric vehicle charging capacity it's clear where we're headed and my objective is to introduce legislation that is clearly going to advance our progress in all these areas clean energy broadband internet environmental sustainability job creation you

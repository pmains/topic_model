as everyone in this chamber knows the filibuster requires a super majority 60 votes to proceed on most issues in the senate the filibuster is truly the essence of this deliberative body it's what makes the senate the senate it's what forces collaboration long-term solution and prevents a partisan roller coaster ride of ever-changing laws and rules every two years the filibuster puts the brakes on hasty legislation and helps prevent unintended consequences which comes with most every new law i ask america this do you want more laws or less laws do we want more certainty from our government or less certainty arguably the best speeches to keep the filibuster in place have been made by presidents and senators from across the aisle nothing is more convincing than my democrat friend's own words president obama then senator obama said in a floor speech here in 2005 when i quote but the american people sent us here to be their voice they understand that those voices can at times become loud and argumentative but they also hope we can disagree without being disagreeable and at the end of the day they expect both parties to work together to get the people's business done what they do not expect is for one party be it republican or democrat to change the rules in the middle of the game so they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet and i'm still quoting president obama here the american people want less partisanship in this town but everyone in this chamber knows that if majority chooses to end the filibuster if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate then the fighting the bitterness and the gridlock will only get worse and i am quoting president obama and in that same year our current majority leader stated from this very floor and i quote the majority leader again we are on the precipice of a crisis a constitutional crisis the checks and balances which have been at the core this republic are about to be evaporated by the nuclear option the checks and balances which say if you get 51 percent of the vote you do not get your way a hundred percent of the time it's amazing it's almost a temper tantrum by those on the hard right and again still quoting the majority leader the current majority leader that is not becoming of the leadership of the republican side of the aisle nor is it becoming of this republic that is what we call abuse of power and i end quoting the majority leader if the current democrat majority party jams us through they will live through the day possibly as soon as next year but for now my colleagues across the aisle are cow towing to the radical left base the tail is wagging the proverbial dog sadly 25 of my colleagues across the aisle have flip-flopped from a position they staked out in writing just four years ago but thank goodness that one senator who signed the letter has remained true to his word what has happened to change the mind of these 25 senators why is the national media not asking them the same question because it would point out the hypocrisy let me remind them all as president joe biden once stated to this body that removing the 60-vote threshold would and i again quote again from president biden quite frankly it is the ultimate act of unfairness to alter the unique responsibility of the senate and to do so by breaking the very rules of the senate but simply the nuclear option would transform the senate from the so-called cooling saucer of our founding fathers talked about to cool the passions of the day to a pure majoritarian body like parliament but the senate is not meant to be a place of pure majority ism at its core the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee or a bill it's about compromise and moderation and again i end that quote that president biden these men and women of noble character in their heart of hearts do they truly believe in making this rule change that will forever alter the way our government functions the way our founders founding fathers intended it to be what will they say to the people their state when the shoes on the other foot when republicans hold the majority in the senate once again and republicans show them how the hog eats the cabbage i yield the floor

Mr. Speaker,
I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4909 the STOP School Violence Act. We have a responsibility to protect our young
people from violence, and this package of school security improvements is an important
step. In particular, this bill includes a bipartisan
provision that I introduced with my friend and colleague from Illinois, Congressman Mike
Bost to help schools acquire and install panic buttons in classrooms for use in emergency
situations. We first introduced the Securing Our Schools
Act in January and I’m proud of the support we’ve built from both sides of the aisle
which helped get this provision included in today’s school safety package. This technology will ensure students and teachers
have a more immediate method of notifying law enforcement and first responders in case
of a medical emergency, active school shooter incident, or natural disaster. All congressional offices have similar emergency
buttons. If it’s technology good enough for Members
of Congress, we should be doing the same to keep our young people safe where they learn. While this bill represents progress, it is
far from an adequate solution to the threat of gun violence. We now need to build on this bipartisan momentum
for other urgent solutions to improve gun safety and reduce gun violence. This includes universal background checks;
restrictions on the sales of bump stocks, assault weapons, and high-capacity magazines;
and research into the causes of gun violence. Here in this Congress, we have the ability
to save lives with commonsense legislation. We must act, and I urge my colleagues to support
this legislation as a start.

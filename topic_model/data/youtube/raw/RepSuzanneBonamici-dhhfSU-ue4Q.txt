say I want to start by thanking chairman Kline and ranking member Scott for working to bring this important legislation to the floor today reauthorizing the older Americans Act has been one of my top priorities over the years I've sponsored legislation to strengthen essential programs that help keep seniors healthy and independent seniors in Oregon and across the country know how important the older Americans Act programs are so I've met with them to discuss ideas for improving the law and I've advocated for funding for older Americans Act programs and services and all along my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been committed to reauthorizing this important law so on behalf of seniors across the country thank you to my colleagues for their support for this legislation before the house a three-year reauthorization of the older Americans Act I also want to thank the advocacy community and service delivery groups for their ongoing support for a strong bipartisan reauthorization backing from a wide range of groups that are dedicated to the well-being of America's seniors helped make possible the legislation we're considering today every day in our country about 10,000 people turned 65 and as the population of older adults continues to grow we have a responsibility as policymakers to re-evaluate and bolster the programs that keep seniors healthy active and engaged in their communities the legislation we're considering will help older Americans from all backgrounds lead meaningful lives with dignity by continuing to support the delivery of health transportation and nutrition services to seniors in every state this legislation includes modest increases in authorization levels of building on the amounts appropriated in the fiscal year 2016 omnibus appropriations act investments for currently funded older Americans Act programs are overdue and will help meet the growing demand placed on these programs and services increasing investments in programs like meals on wheels which serves thousands of seniors many of whom are homebound or low-income will allow more adults to stay in their homes where they can remain connected to their communities and avoid costlier long-term care and for many adults the hot meal they get from Meals on Wheels is the only one they will get that day the volunteers who deliver the meal may provide their only social interaction which is important for all seniors but especially for those in isolated or rural areas significantly this legislation provides tools to curb both physical and physical financial and physical elder abuse by promoting proven strategies for responding to elder abuse neglect and exploitation according to the elder justice coalition there are more than 6 million victims of elder abuse every year roughly one out of every 10 people over age 60 according to the National Center on elder abuse victims of elder financial abuse lose an estimated two point nine billion dollars a year and too often they lose their entire life savings so I'm pleased that this legislation continues to address the problem of elder abuse and takes steps to make sure older adults are not robbed of their resources or denied the dignity they deserve in addition my colleague from Florida has expressed support for the senior Medicare Patrol a program that helps train senior volunteers to prevent and identify health care fraud and abuse I want to reiterate support for this program and note that the education and Workforce Committee supports full funding for this important initiative which should not come at the expense of funding other programs the senior Medicare patrol saves taxpayer dollars by protecting the integrity of health care programs the return on investment for older Americans Act programs is undeniable and this is certainly the case for senior Medicare Patrol as well Americans are living longer more productive lives and our policies need to keep pace older adults should not have to struggle to afford reliable transportation nutritious food and high-quality supportive services Congress will need to continue to invest in and modernize services for seniors so all older adults including LGBT elders and older individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds have access to programs that keep them healthy and aged in their communities this legislation is an important step forward I'm glad Congress is coming together today with bipartisan support to recognize the valuable role that older Americans Act programs play across the country these programs work and reauthorizing them means America's seniors and their caregivers will continue to receive the services resources and support they need mr. speaker the reauthorization were considering today is an important way to recognize that in the United States of America our seniors our parents and grandparents across the country deserve to live healthy fulfilling lives and live them with dignity I again thank ranking member scott and chairman Kline for their leadership and I also want to thank the hard-working staff on both sides of the aisle for their dedication to improving the lives of older Americans thank you and I reserve the balance of my time generators

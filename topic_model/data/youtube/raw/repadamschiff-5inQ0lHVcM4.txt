36 select committee congressman adam schiff he's also the chairman of the house intelligence committee and he's the author of the new bestseller midnight in washington how we almost lost our democracy and still could congressman what's your message to the vast majority of your republican colleagues who voted against holding steve bannon in contempt well if they think they can do a carve out here and essentially exempt one of the former president's friends without eviscerating congress's power of oversight they're wrong either we're all in this together either the rule of law applies to everyone equally or we lose out on a fundamental aspect of our democracy that the rule of law applies to everyone and no one is above that law so they're undermining their own institution they're undermining a system of checks and balances and they're continuing the damage that they did in pushing the big lie about the election republican congressman jim banks scoffed at the idea that steve bannon had advanced knowledge of the january 6 attack saying i'm quoting him now every american knew that violence was a possibility that day what's your reaction to that well first of all if steven has uh nothing to say uh and nothing to fear then why is he uh obstructing congress and refusing to testify uh so let's find out what he knows i mean clearly he had a reason to say that he thought all hail was going to break loose when it did and he was in communication with the president he may know something about uh who organized these rallies and what the expectation was in terms of violence what the participation was going to be among these white nationalist groups there's one way to find out and that's to put him under oath at this point if he doesn't i hope that the justice department will put him in jail well speaking of the justice department the attorney general merrick garland testified today that the justice department will apply the facts and the law his words to to consider your referral to hold bannon in contempt if the department of justice uh declines to prosecute him what would that uh where would that leave your overall investigation well i think it would be a real body blow if they do apply the facts to the law i think it's actually quite simple because steve bannon has no absolute right of immunity to somehow just simply fail to show up he also has i think no valid executive privilege claim to assert and even if he did he would need to come before the congress uh and specify which question which document the former president was formally asserting privilege none of that happened so the facts couldn't be clear uh the law also couldn't be clear and to me this is an early test of whether our democracy is recovering uh if the justice department uh shrugs and says we're not going forward they're inviting other contempt of law uh by other individuals not just contempt of congress but contempt of the law more generally and i just don't think that's where the garland justice bond wants to go how soon will your select committee decide whether to pursue contempt for other witnesses uh for example mark meadows dan scavino or cash patel as soon as we decide that we're getting nowhere in terms of our discussions with council if we feel that we're merely getting stalled for time they're playing rope and dope with us we won't hesitate to move forward with contempt um but if we can work it out and and secure their testimony without having to bring up a criminal contempt charge that is certainly our preference congressman adam schiff thanks so much for joining us thank you wolf

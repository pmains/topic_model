thank you mr ward the chair now recognizes the gentleman from hawaii mr case thank you madam chair mr murray um i am reading from your the department of energy's june 2020 report on rooney dome and i'm just going to quote here the main risk posed by the dome will be derived from the flow of contaminated groundwater from beneath the containment structure into the local marine environment today there is no data that suggests that the dome or more specifically the radioactive material encapsulated there is currently having a measurable adverse effect on the surrounding environment i'm i'm unclear from from this is there in fact leakage uh from the dome um into the groundwater underneath it um that you have determined that thus far does not that leakage does not produce any uh harmful measurable impact um or is there no leakage from the dome um and that is residual a ground water underneath the dome from prior radio radioactive exposure or do you not know which of those three is it uh well i think what we have to assume is based on the uh the the linkage between you know the tide rising the tide going down uh and what we're seeing with levels inside the dome that there is some leakage occurring with the dome um how much we don't know okay so your your working assumption is it is leaking um because you do detect some radioactive exposure you're just saying that as a matter of scale it's not at the level that you consider to be um a concern at the moment um i i would say part of the problem is that uh the level in the lagoons um is not changing so okay so you if there is linkage if there is leakage coming out of ruin at dom contaminated elite leakage coming out of room and dome and going into the lagoon uh it's being masked okay and you're and you are saying that you you have concluded that basically your monitoring uh regime is not adequate to really fully answer the questions that i'm asking and you want to uh step that up and when you want to accelerate and implement your groundwater radioactive analysis program right and the two bore holes that you tried were not sufficient for that and so you have to ramp it up is that right that's correct and that's why we have been working with the department of interior and why they have been uh agreeable and provided us additional funding to put that program in place okay and here's here's an observation from me it it doesn't feel like this is a priority like i would be if if i was uncertain as to as to whether and to what extent uh there was in fact leakage into the underlying uh groundwater and and that dispersing out into the broader environment that would be top of mind i i see in your report that you you have various reasons for why you haven't been able to pull it off including mobilization but uh in in all honesty i i i struggle to understand why you can't overcome the logistical uh concerns uh given given the possibility that there is in fact um um a substantial level of leakage that we just haven't detected yet i mean you've got kwajalein right there you've got um you know i assume we can cut through the covet 19 you know restrictions at this point you appear to have funding what what is how how do you accelerate this so that we can actually just get some some you know uh scientific answers to determine what to do next uh well i don't want to give the impression that this is not one of our our highest priorities because we have people working on this um all the time um cobit restrictions are are real i mean they are have been established by to protect the to protect the citizens of the republic of marshall islands and uh we respect their so we have not been able to get out to the island how many how many people do you need to actually go out there and test a lot's going to depend on what we get back well to test or to do our drilling program i mean there's no real way to just just test and drop a borehole into the ground it's going to take a drilling process i do understand that so i'm not i'm not downplaying the the logistical challenges of mobilizing in in in the pacific i was just on wake island a few weeks ago and and got got that in spades but as my time is expiring i would invite the folks that do actually represent the marshall islands to comment on on how we accelerate and remove any restrictions on on getting these tests in place in the event that the united states feels um that there is um you know any complications in terms of getting the two governments to agree on on how to deal with coven 19 and other logistical uh uh challenges thank you very much we would welcome that

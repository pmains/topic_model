thank you to the chairman and ranking member good afternoon and I want to thank my colleague Dr winstrup for his commentary on this and of course Miss walorski who we again extend our condolences to her family and I'm not surprised of her advocacy on such an important issue I was proud to vote in favor of the pandemic unemployment assistance program to help people who traditionally would not have qualified for unemployment insurance because of the type of work that they did but sitting here listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle Express concerns about unemployment insurance fraud I couldn't agree with you more now I don't accept the fact that fraud and identity theft is something that we should just allow to happen and that is why I agree we should be taking action that's why I introduced HR 8661 the guaranteed unemployment assistance and reducing deception act the guard act I think that we can all agree that the pandemic revealed many structural inadequacies of our nation's unemployment system that are administered by the states criminal organizations seized on the opportunity to steal finding ways to illegally access people's benefits sometimes simply by applying as someone they simply knew existed and had a job that's why my bill enables aggressive action to recover pandemic unemployment benefits that were paid to these criminal cartels it supports prosecution of ringleaders and helps fraud victims my bill also protects against the future use of weaknesses discovered during the pandemic and it gives the Department of Labor new tools to assist penalize and reward States performance in key areas such as program integrity and fraud prevention the guard act which I've authored will help States improve their systems and empowers the appropriate agencies to do their job and protect our constituents to go after and recover from funds from Criminal cartels that took advantage of the pandemic crisis and I'm very thankful to the support of organizations like the national employment law project in support of my legislation so I am glad to see that we can all agree on the importance of a strong unemployment insurance program and we shouldn't wait we should take action on my legislation so I urge my Republican colleagues to join me in this effort I invite you to become a co-sponsor of my legislation and I appreciate the chairman and the committee staff for their work with me on this legislation to protect our constituents hold criminal cartel accountable and protect taxpayer resources particularly during an economic downturn like we experienced during the pandemic with that Mr chairman I yield back

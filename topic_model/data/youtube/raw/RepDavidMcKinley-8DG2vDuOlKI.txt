Thank You mr. chairman there are series of questions I'd like to address primarily brought about by some comments made by the opposition but also by your comments about that you don't think there's been any change it's been market-driven of why people why companies are using gas rather than coal and i want to remind you back we had a hearing last year when gas was gas prices were seven or eight dollars in mcf but Purdue University say they were switching from coal to gas because of the EPA regulation threatening to make the byproduct a hazardous material so it had nothing to do with the price of coal or gas it was the threat of the EPA causing a stigma attached to that product but but I want to go so I know that it's not all founded night I do appreciate your patience because you've been here how many times and we've had some interesting but I want to fall back up on what dr. Burgess asked you I've asked you to for some letters I don't know whether it's it I don't wanna say it's a conspiracy but I don't understand why you're not answering our letters or answering questions that you say you're going to get back to us about I asked your last year explain to me in all this discussion of greenhouse gases and global warming I'd like I again I want you to tell me why the Milankovitch says the physicists Milankovitch and his beloved cycleways been dissed in your mind discredited furthered like to understand why how Lewis and his resignation from the american physical society where he says in his comment if i can just call that up all right he said it is the greatest that the global warming scam is the greatest and most successful pseudo scientific fraud I've seen in my long life as a physicist this is not politician saying this is a scientist this is someone that is the emeritus professor at University of California Santa Barbara and he and 200 other people have signed off on on this issue and I've asked for you all to tell me as an engineer myself explained to me why that's not valid to be part of this discussion and we still only here because can you can you get back to us again third fourth time we've asked for that is can we do that please congressman if you if you've written a letter to me I will certainly answer it but I I don't know we've written letters that we've asked you in Testament here to get back in and you're very kind you say you'll do it then like so many other folks here they just get lost somehow perhaps but I the further I want to go back to where you say you don't think this has affected the coalfields in this country when in 1993 the EPA itself said the byproduct of burning coal was not a hazardous material it should be recycled in two thousand they came out and said the same thing but yet again the EPA under this under new administration pics at that fight back up again after it's been disproved twice and is making his threat that the byproduct of burning coal could be a hazardous material how much more studies are we going to have it's it's that kind of uncertainty that's coming out of your office this causing plants coal company a utility company to maybe just pull back like they did at Purdue University how do you respond do you really think we need another do we need to have another study I think people have asked us when EPA proposed its coal ash rule to take a very close look at the science to take a very close look at the st. John's since 93 and 2000 well it's the same compound I can speak for the for the science that that related to air pollution and clearly the science gets more sophisticated every day it gets better every day the clarity in the the substance and the robustness of the data particularly on issues of climate look it's very justly every game my time I've only got 18 seconds ago and I know we get let me invite again anyone from the EPA to please come with us to the coal fields across America and talk to the miners and their families when they talk about that when it is suggested that it's the price of gas that's costing them their jobs when 700 people at arch coal get let let go we've got to be more sensitive to the middle class people across this country and particularly those that have mined coal that have made America what it is so let me extend that invitation again to you I did the Lisa Jackson last year she ignored that let me ask you again please come and talk to these people and explain to them how there's a future for their industry you do that gentlemen so much start at this time let me

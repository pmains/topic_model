hi my name is congressman joe morelli i wanted to take a moment to recognize national deaf history month which honors the history of deaf and hard of hearing communities in this country rochester is home to a robust and vibrant deaf and hard of hearing community and i am proud to advocate on their behalf as a member of the congressional deaf caucus we are also home to the national technical institute for the deaf which began operating at the rochester institute of technology in 1968 they are world leader in deaf education and an extraordinary resource for our community and i am so grateful for all they do sadly despite the momentous occasions and advances celebrated during national deaf history month there is still work to be done to improve accessibility and ensure equal opportunity for all people regardless of their different abilities it is truly disheartening that members of our deaf community still face discrimination as we recognize deaf history month i want to reiterate my commitment to being an ally for hard of hearing individuals i will continue to work with my colleagues in congress to find creative solutions to the challenges our deaf community faces and fight for the equity accessibility and opportunity they deserve thank you

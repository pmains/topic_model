as referenced in the title of this hearing my friend congressman john lewis and if you're a georgian an american still feel his presence profoundly though he's gone and we have an obligation to live up to and honor his example he said that the right to vote is quote precious almost sacred i can think of no better way to honor the life and legacy of congressman john lewis as our country still mourns his passing last year than to restore the voting rights act of 1965 for which he bled and nearly died to protect that precious almost sacred right to vote the hearing is adjourned

you have made me feel very old I've always known them as Jefferson Airplane are the legitimacy of our federal government and all of our governments is based on the theory of democracy but the enemies of democracy take refuge in the belief that while we elect some people we don't actually let them make the important decisions and that the elitists will control the entities that make the important decisions the most important decisions discussed in this room are those made by the Fed where the elected representatives of the people get to kibbutz but the people actually making decisions are well removed from the concept of democracy but many of them are in fact appointees of the President but others are selected by the theory of one bank one vote now we now have a B and C levels but that B level is selected by the banks meaning that important governmental critically important governmental decisions are made where the banks have votes and the people don't this is exacerbated by the fact that not only do we have this one bank one vote but California gets as much clout as areas that have less than half of its population so you have both democ the democracy is thwarted in two ways the we ought to move forward to the idea that government decisions in America should be made by those selected by elected leaders in addition the the Fed made as much as a hundred billion dollars in a year profit by mistake if this was a if if if we had the people of America told that they're allowed to look at what the Fed does and not just on the bloomberg channel we would be insisting that any policy that produces a hundred billion dollars for the federal government be looked at as a policy that might generate a hundred billion dollars profit for the federal government and that that cannot be ignored just because the elitists say they did it by State therefore it doesn't count I look forward to a true democracy in this country I am old but I hope I'm young enough to see it I yield back a gentleman's time as a Christie is under attack the battleground is this room and it is under attack from both the left and the right the left wants to make sure that we empower entrenched bureaucracies and protect them from public input the right says let's democratize by giving more power to banks and we need regional control we need control outside of Washington we need to make Bank president's control their regulation process and monetary policy democracy may prevail but it doesn't look like it we're told that we don't want to politicize things that's because the enemies of democracy don't dare claim that they're against democracy they just say they're against politics but politics is the only mech mechanism by which the voters of the country can influence or control public policy so you're not against democracy as long as the people who are elected do not control governmental policy I suggest that the enemies of democracy ought to have the guts to come out and say they're against democracy instead of using the word politicalization and as for the idea that we need local input I couldn't agree more let's have a class-d vote the control that that has a hundred voters and have that be the hundred largest local labor union leaders why should banks control monetary policy when we're all talking about jobs if we care about jobs and we want some entity other than governmental officials to have input but why banks they're not dedicated to jobs why not local labor union leaders and don't have to be nationally briefed not Washington not the NESH local labor union leaders ought to be in control or the public elected officials and the president who's elected by the public should be in control but for God's sakes why banks now dr. Michael you've suggested that we have or I believe it was also mr. Selden you suggested that we ought to have the board of governors may correction the Fmoc rather the Board of Governors empowered since that just empowers banks rather than the people the country to a greater degree couldn't we marry that with the idea that these local presidents of the Federal Reserve is selected by the president or selected by local Assemblies of voters or selected by any mechanism that doesn't empower banks yes congressman oh well my what I'm arguing for and what I think the proposal is for is not giving more power to the FOMC than it has traditionally had well you're going back to an anti-democratic tradition which fortunately we've moved away from we took some power away from an entity that had Bank control and moved it to a body selected by an elected president of the United States go out of a out of a nostalgia for an anti-democratic institution you're moving back to that well perhaps but the only nostalgia I'm referring to lasted up until October 2008 so it's not all that nostalgic the FOMC had complete responsibility for monetary policy until that date so why should if we're going to do that why not have an Fmoc that is entirely reflective of a democracy why have bankers vote as a foods of people voting well let's understorey union leaders I'm willing to go with that to remind you I'm looking for Republicans what I did with its existing structure the FOMC gives overwhelming an overwhelming advantage to the members of the appointed Federal Reserve Board who had five so so we'll have some democracy and some bank control why don't we do that for members of Congress why don't we say that three quarters of the outcome is determined by how the voters vote and then we have a separate caucus of bankers and they control one quarter of the vote wouldn't that be a good way to depoliticize mr. Pollak the congressman my suggestion is the people who really are elected to by the people namely the members of Congress are the responsible party for the definition and the management of money and that's the way but we can we can vote to move will get away from democracy by empowered by setting up a commission of labor union leaders or banks to be making governmental decisions since labor unions of private labor only represent about seven percent if I'm right of labor I'm not sure I'm willing to create employee councils of other institutions too just as soon as I get a Republican vote sure but if I could just say I love politics and money is political I think you and I agree on that one congressman you'll back at the time of the gentleman

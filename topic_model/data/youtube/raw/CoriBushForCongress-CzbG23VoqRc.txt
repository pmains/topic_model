my life is different these days first black woman to represent missouri and congress bush just toppled a 52-year political dynasty if you were unhomed you you're a mother of two kids and you've shared being a survivor of sexual assault my story is unusual in the halls of congress but it's what so many of us face every day here in saint louis i was working as a nurse when michael brown jr was murdered in ferguson it lit something inside me i showed up to protest and started taking care of people who were tear gassed who were beaten who were shot with rubber bullets when i see someone suffering it doesn't feel like a choice to me it's what i have to do too many people in st louis bear the trauma of eviction i've been there i know that pain the way i see it is when corey bush said wait a minute i know what this is like she spoke from the heart when we elect leaders who come from our communities who've lived the same struggles that so many across our country live every day anything is possible look at what we did in less than a year the house has just passed president biden's 1.9 trillion dollar covert relief package forcing the epa to finally clean up the radioactive waste in coldwater creek we introduced the people's response act and the green new deal for cities all of that is just the beginning corporate special interests they're going to keep coming after us they'll say we don't deserve a seat at the table they'll say we're too radical it's because they're scared but they're not just scared of me they're scared of our movement because we've already shown our power i'm running for re-election to the u.s congress because congress should have people who come from our communities who have actually lived our struggles who have marched in our streets so join me when we come together not even the sky is our land

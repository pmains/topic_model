also be in order the gentleman from minnesota is recognized for five minutes this is the final amendment to the bill it will not kill the bill or send it back to committee if adopted the bill will immediately proceed to final passages amended mr speaker asbestos is a known carcinogen asbestos wreaks havoc on the health and livelihoods of people exposed to it killing approximately ten thousand americans each year gentlewoman will suspend the gentleman's correct the house is not in order the house will be in order members will please remove their conversations from the house floor the house will be in order the gentleman from minnesota is recognized thank you mr speaker this deadly poison can cause lung cancer and mesothelioma an aggressive cancer that an estimated three thousand americans are diagnosed with each year once detected mesothelioma victims may only survive eight to fourteen months this was true for my predecessor the late congressman bruce fento bruce proudly served minnesota's fourth district for more than 20 years in this house and many of you served with him in this chamber bruce died from mesolithic leoma in 2000 only months only months after he was diagnosed i lost a friend and a mentor his family lost a husband a father a son and a brother since then i have worked with mesoconioma patients and their families to fight this awful disease and to hold those responsible for asbestos exposure accountable and i can tell you this legislation does not support the victims of asbestos the asbestos trust would be forced forced to release the private information of patients and their families on a public website listing a patient's name their address health and financial information and the last four digits of their social security number exposes these patients to identity theft h.r 1927 would also delay any compensation victims could receive with new cumbersome and unnecessary procedural hurdles meaning many victims will not live long enough to get the justice they deserve to know that their families will not be burdened with medical costs this legislation is unacceptable for those seeking justice from asbestos exposure and it is especially outrageous when we know this legislation does not provide basic protection for children this amendment would protect children this amendment will ensure that children exposed to asbestos will not have their personal information disclosed children exposed to asbestos from the walls the ceilings and the floors of their classroom or even the possible exposure from crayons that they used that were manufactured in china our children deserve protection their parents should have the peace of mind that their child's privacy is secure as a mother i cannot imagine the anguish of worrying about my child's health as they suffer from asbestos exposure and then add the burden of worrying that my child's private information was exposed on a website without this amendment the current bill you will be voting to deliver sensitive information about children to criminals who could exploit them and let me be clear this information will be available to identity thieves and to sexual predators congressman bento was a dedicated public servant and an asbestos victim and i know bruce would be horrified that this house would allow a child's personal information to be exposed in this incredibly irresponsible manner and we should stop it from happening we can stop it from happening congress has a responsibility to find real solutions to help and support victims especially children of asbestos exposure in their families and this bill falls far short of it the least we can do here today is to protect the privacy of innocent children who have already suffered enough so i urge my colleagues to pass this amendment and to protect the privacy of vulnerable children and with that mr speaker i yield back the gentlewoman from minnesota

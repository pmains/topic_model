thank you mr chairman good to be here today thanks all the the witnesses i want to focus on the the financial aspect of this just for a second i feel like i'm here with the weight of three million kansans who are waking up to utility bills which are just through the roof i feel like i have the weight of 90 100 different municipalities who are buying natural gas on the spot market municipalities who would in three days time spent more than they were planning on spending in the next five years and the questions i'm going to ask you are questions i've been asked dozens of times that i don't have an answer yet so please don't take them personally but somehow i got to get answers to figuring out what happened financially certainly we saw on the spot market the rates went up at least 10 you know multiple of 10 sometimes more than that i understand what happened to the supply i understand that the wind turbines froze the the gas ads froze uh that natural gas plants were affected that some of the coal was frozen together by snow and all those things happening but one thing that's been pointed out to me is as we saw this spike in the in the price of it go up and stay up for three days that went down so quickly if it was just supply demand mr wood how would you answer that why would the price go down so so quickly um if there was truly a supply shortage how did it get to go down quickly in three days and if there was anything nefarious where would you look uh center on on gas or on power let's talk about natural gas yes the gas issue clearly once once the constraints are overcome whether that's wellheads come back online you're right that would generally be something that would be phased in i mean we went from 20 bcf coming out of texas for example down to about 10 over that full week so through the 15th through the 19th monday through friday it went down and uh i don't so you're talking about the price going back down to 10 from 900. it went down really quickly it's it it's um it was an issue when we looked in the california energy crisis that senator cantwell referred to earlier it it is always it's a very open and transparent market scarcity pricing and mark manipulation sometime are two sides of the same coin it depends what a jury thinks about it but when you've got a when you've got a scarce supply of something you want to charge for it in texas for example i think probably in most of the states our attorney general is pursuing actions now uh looking at gas and power trades because it is illegal to a price gap in a in an emergency so you brought up the term price gouging who who would have profited from this would would have been on the on the markets people that are playing the markets or was it the the producer that that owned the gas well who profited in this scenario whoever has the whoever has is i think in general economics whoever has a precious commodity at a time it's most precious and so that could be the person who has it in storage the person who's flowing it from a well head whoever has title to that gas at that time it could be anybody it could be uh you know a landowner in the middle of kansas or oklahoma or texas that has title or royalties to the gas so it's um it's it's it honestly depends on where you are at the moment and where the gas is uh where the title to the gas is at that moment how could we figure out who who had it then who's how could we follow the money that took us years in uh in the california are you are you convinced that we used all the storage up that we had i do not have any data that tells me does anybody know if we used all the storage storage up any other witnesses i do not who can explain to me am i when i pass my time nope my second minute you're right you've got one minute one minute left um you know i'm i'm going to guess it's it's mr wood how could ferc investigate if there was anything nefarious what does that process look like and i'm not saying there is i'm just it's just hard for me to imagine uh just prices going up exponentially and again i think of that you know my parents on a fixed income what's happening to their electric bill and their heating bill coming up right right now as well how would ferc investigate this uh ferc does have authority over market manipulation uh or just markets in general in the interstate markets of course interstate natural gas pipelines serve kansas oklahoma and parts of texas as well we have a in trust state that's separate but um the commodities futures trading commission they were certainly involved with us 20 years ago when we unpacked the issues in the california crisis the the state attorney's general uh as i mentioned the one in texas is already investigating this issue um those those those three three camps ferc cftc for the futures in your experiences that takes decades to go through well no it doesn't i mean you can unpack in this digitized age we have a lot more capability that in 2021 than we did in 2001 to review um trades in this matter or in any matter much more expeditiously thank you i'm past my time i yield back

everything i've done in my career has prepared me for this particular job at this particular time over 25 years ago tom swazi became one of the first public officials to offer help to undocumented workers men who were looking for work could gather at one location and if you didn't get paid someone would advocate for you and if you didn't get hired you could stay and learn english with a job skill as nassau county executive he oversaw the lowest crime rate in the history of long island we did gun buyback programs to get the guns off the street tom felt that the police should not just control the community but be part of the community now crime in new york is rising and tom will help put more cops on the beat and give judges the power to take violent offenders off the streets in congress tom led the fight to repeal the cap on state and local tax deductions devastating new york's middle class my family has paid thousands more in federal taxes we've seen tom be out in front of us and not back down no matter what the meeting was i always brought up the issue of salt salt salt salt and it worked now tom will fight to roll back new york's sky-high property and income taxes tom swazi's always believed public office is all about getting things done for people from pulling nassau county from the brink of bankruptcy to cleaning up some of new york's worst polluted sites in a lot of ways tom swazi is kind of a throwback i like to call myself a common sense democrat politicians are too focused on being politically correct i'm focused on doing the correct thing for the people of new york the far right and the far left has gone too far and they're stopping us from getting things done he's driven by what the issue is he's really interested in other people listening to their problems and then fixing them tom would tell you it all comes from his family a father born in italy who faced discrimination like many immigrants and his mother marguerite my mom was a very remarkable woman really devoted to helping other people complete strangers even you'd be driving home from school and she'd see a woman walking with her grocery bags and she'd pull over and pick them up give the woman a lift maybe that's what tom has been doing the past 30 years maybe that's the whole point of public service lifting up people you don't know [Music]

Thank You mr. speaker November is prematurity Awareness Month and as the number of preterm births continues to rise in the United States it's important to acknowledge this serious issue in my own experience as an obstetrician having delivered over 5,000 babies I've seen firsthand the seriousness of early birth premature birth is still number one cause of infant mortality in the United States and around the world advancements in detection and care for infants born early have not made the same strides that other areas of the medical field have the premature birth race in Kansas is right now below the national average of nine point nine meaning that approxi one in every 10 babies is born premature in the coming weeks Congress has the opportunity to act and pass the preemie reauthorization Act of 2018 and help those that cannot yet help themselves

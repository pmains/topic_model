patrick mchenry is with us now chief deputy whip i should say sir do you see any problem getting this accepted by the entire republican party and the house and the senate if this is the basis of the tax plan that goes forward well you're going through the checklist there and you've got very good information uh yes this is the basis for us to to pass this bill and get it done before thanksgiving i think we'll see not unanimous support but you'll see more than 218 republicans support this on the house floor in two weeks it's a good plan it focuses on keeping american jobs and at the same time giving middle class families a real tax cut a substantive tax cut it's a good plan i'm sure you were at that meeting this morning were the whole house republicans all of them were briefed on the details of this plan uh i'm told that the atmosphere was pretty good it was pretty solid that it was not exactly gong rah-rah-rah but there was widespread approval is that accurate absolutely and what members want is more and more detail but the ways and means committee has been hard at work of this for weeks getting the details right and we took another day to make sure that everything was uh as it should be so members want to see the the text and get into the specific provisions of how this is implemented we're all really well bought in at the top line though okay if i were to characterize the whole package as follows i want to see if you'd agree with me first of all it does help middle america number two it gives great help to american business number three no help at all to the one percent what do you say that's about right um and this is what this is what the president said why don't you come and sit with me for heaven's sake and simplify these things i appreciate it no you've simplified it better than i could but look the the the issue is i i personally think that everyone should receive tax relief uh that uh we have americans that are rendering to the federal government more than they should uh historically that is true we're paying a higher percentage into the uh the government the federal revenue uh than uh ever before outside of wartime uh but president trump has is uh put his influence behind this and he says look you're not gonna touch uh uh people's retirement savings uh you're not gonna have a gradual step down on corporate tax rate we need a jump for the american economy and we need middle class families to win in this and it's really the president's influence has really gotten us to this point okay so thanks very much for being on the show this morning we appreciate it we really do uh this is a very big deal it's the most important tax reform legislation or plan since 1986. congressman we appreciate you being with us thank you thanks sir yes sir david macan

is that right what i understand it goes into any no uh where does it go what's the repo what's the reprogramming what was talking about for 2010 yeah yes and in 2010 there was my understanding is a letter was sent to congress of informing congress that of what's planned for the 2010 activity that had been allocated or appropriated for the upper mountain it's our understanding that the senior leadership of doe is working with the rw leadership and the general counsel and cfo on this whole issue of how to close out if you will the yucca mountain activity but the 2010 activity is not an me part we start in 2011 as the responsibility shifts to what will shift to you yes em takes over uh the plan is in the upper amount of that time right would have the physical facility at yucca mountain and that in e would have responsibility for the nuclear waste policy act and implementing that act but you're not aware of what the reprogramming request is to use those funds uh that were originally going to be used for the licensing process uh they're going to have to reap they're going to have to reprogram those they want to use them for something else but they're not sure what their what the proposal is for that well there's a letter that was sent that there's a intent to reprogram and it was attempt to close out the program uh to work with employees to work with the site records for example retention of all records so that has been sent that's my understanding uh one other thing uh this committee has been very supportive of uh and one of the things i don't think we've spent enough money on in years gone by is infrastructure we're going to retain and bring the best research scientists to work at our national labs and stuff we're going to have the scientific facilities to for them to work in and as you know out in idaho there were some places were in old grocery stores garage doors everything else but the committee has been very supportive of increasing that budget for infrastructure improvements it looks like in your any research and development budget it's kind of a makeover of the old budget with some new new programs new initiatives such as the small modular reactor program and stuff that may these new initiatives may add to the overall research and development effort and increase the demands on the infrastructure last year the committee put in 163.4 million dollars or i guess 173 million dollars last year into the any budget uh the infrastructure budget in idaho which as you know they've done some great work out there and building the labs and equipment and so forth this year's request is 10 million dollars less does this request fully support the upgrades and scientific and testing capabilities of the inl that may be needed to implement the expansion uh of the new indy programs thank you congressman um this is again an extremely interesting question we i had an opportunity to be in paris for the conference of president sarkozy and on sunday we need you to talk to my japanese russian and french colleagues about investment in nuclear energy r d and there's no question that ours isn't up to what some other countries invested in grnd but having said that only about 10 years ago we were at zero you know and we've come up to now a request of 500 million dollars i think that's pretty pretty darn impressive of what we've done now and so as we look at this balance of 500 million dollars and we and we struggle with the balance between infrastructure intellectual capability and people who are doing research and theory and computation and experiment the experimental facilities they have what they need it's it is not easy to make that balance and we've done the best we can we think in the future the balance is likely to move toward investment more in infrastructure of course it would be nice that we had a much greater budget but we're here to defend the president's budget we think it's a solid budget and we spent um considerable time trying to think through this this thing of infrastructure and people and students you know the next generation so it's the balance we came up with and i think it's a strong budget and i'm supporting it a couple quick questions on the advanced test reactor it's 40 years old last year we fest off 12 million dollars for the atr life extension how much is being requested in the fy 2011 for the uh life extension project at the atr well the the atr is a is a component as you point out to the of the facilities infrastructure budget idaho national laboratory i don't have the exact number with me for what fraction of that is for atr we can get that okay uh in oak ridge congress provided 10 million dollars for the radio radio chemical engineering development center at the oak ridge national laboratory did this investment complete the movements for that facility because none has been requested in this year i understand yes thank you for that question also congressman simpson um so the in the best of all worlds we would also be investing in facilities at oak ridge national laboratory and we would be invested in facilities at other national languages i think that the the overall facilities is is appropriate for the size of the program of 500 million but of course yes it would be nice if we could also invest in those but we we think we've done the right balance for the size of the budget but as far as the radio chemical engineering and development center this uh it doesn't need any additional money for its uh for its maintenance uh or is it just that there was not any request this year there was just they can they could use money but there just just didn't make it in the cut of our request

mr. speaker recently I called for a vote on legislation to address the threat of the Zika virus but nothing was done now there are more than 1,000 and rising confirmed cases of Zika in the united states and its territories pregnant women and their children across the country are now more at risk as the summer months and mosquito seasons approach it's just a matter of time in fact on Monday the Coachella Valley mosquito and Vector Control District confirmed that the I 80s Egypt I mosquito which can carry Zika was detected in my hometown of Coachella mr. speaker no vote no funding means that you are willing to accept that children will be born with microcephaly allowing gridlock hyper partisanship and congressional dysfunction to put women and their children at high risk is unacceptable to me and American families as an emergency physician I know that emergency funding now will allow physicians and scientists to better protect the health security of women and their children mr. speaker let's vote on emergency funding to combat Zika now before it's too late are you

um Congressman Roger Marshall representing Kansas first congressional district first congressional district also first in America for agriculture and agricultural exports this it's the reciprocal tariffs that are coming as a result of president Trump's tariffs and trade policies hit your district particularly hard how worried are your constituents certainly trade and tariffs are topping everybody's minds back home like you said as usual Agriculture's the tip of the spear when it comes to retaliation so overnight we saw the price of sorghum drop a dollar a bushel now Mexico is talking about tariffs on pork so this is all hitting us home really quickly what does that mean for a farmer in your district well already already our income is 50% of what it was two years for the average agriculture produces now all these trade issues these tariff issues are creating more uncertainty and driving the price of commodities down we're walking into the harvest season for wheat we still have wheat left from two years ago setting on empty runways in the middle of nowhere in Kansas and we can't ship anywhere so what are we going to do with this year's crops the president addressed that a little bit earlier at his press conference essentially saying look I'm worried not only about farmers but about manufacturing jobs as well take a listen they're either going to make the trades fair because our farmers have been hurt you look at our farmers for 15 years the graph is going just like this down our farmers have been hurt our workers have been hurt our companies have moved out and moved to Mexico and other countries including Canada now we are going to fix that situation he says we're going to fix it what it sounds like though is is that the Cure might be worse than the disease right now Liat has been a tough couple months in agriculture but there's lots of opportunities here I appreciate the president's commitment Mexico was right Mexico was ready to finish up a NAFTA agreement we met with the Mexico Ambassador this past week a great conversation Canada doesn't want to get serious about negotiating right now so I understand where the president is coming from until Canada respects us and quits having high tariffs on milk and stop stealing our intellectual property we have deal with them but Mexico's ready an electro property or China stealing our intellectual property yes yeah Canada stealing our intellectual property is a new one on me I think mostly they disrespected so I think if you're in the movie industry or the music industry they don't respect it lots of counterfeit goods come from China through Canada into our markets as well this brings up an important point because he at the same time that you're dealing with our allies in putting tariffs on whether it be European Goods or Canadian Goods or Mexican goods the president is also trying to deal with China would it be more important to focus on China first before dealing with our friends I think we need to take care of Mexico I think once Mexico agreement is made Canada will fall in line the European Union will fall line then we can work together on China bringing it back though to the farmers in your district can they afford the retaliatory tariffs they're gonna come over the next months or years as the agreements you talked about are being worked out I think if we get NAFTA and the European Union we can survive what's got to happen with China there's gonna be some blood it's a big if it's a big if the president has to do is he promised us better trade agreements I believe in him it's been a year and a half though it's time to get Mexico done Canada will fall you're talking about you're talking about a year and a half - just getting Mexico may be done then we've got Canada then you've got Europe then you've got China that's a lot of painting for people in your district would they be better served by the status quo I think agriculture in the short term probably would but in the long term know we have to go after China China is dealing maybe five hundred billion dollars of our intellectual property every year we send over sorghum to them and they stop the shipments in mid in mid-flow in mid right over there so we have to address some of these problems with China I understand that and mice and my AG producers are willing to stand beside the President on China but we need NAFTA yesterday so he's willing to stand behind him despite the pain if you get NAFTA done it's an incredible group of people agriculture are they're very patriotic they understand what's going on with China when I had the opportunity to explain to them what's going on with the electro property theft then they the next in the right there beside the president well noteworthy he can afford to lose a few points in your district - what is it Republican plus forty it's not there this is growing everyday all right so it's support is safe in Kansas is first good to see a congressman thank you thanks for having me listen president Trump now heading from the g7 summit in Canada to his anticipated

so it is not the first time that joe biden has said these things let's speak now to madeleine dean she's the democratic congresswoman representing pennsylvania's 4th congressional district congresswoman thank you very much for joining the program again it's great to have you on so people in your district voters in your district women in particular are exactly the type of people that president trump wants to win over with this message of law and order do you think it's effective on them not at all they're not fooled just because someone says he is the president of law and order over and over again all evidence to the contrary will not make it so and i have to tell you my constituents here in suburban philadelphia and beyond are not fooled uh joe biden could not have been clearer and has been consistently clear throughout his 40 years of public service that there is no place for violence for rioting for injuring anyone or their property uh that what is appropriate in our country and it's enshrined in our first amendment is peaceful protest is bringing your grievances to our country to our government this president is presiding over what is going on in america let's just layer it in he has fought to suppress the vote he has cut short or wants to cut short the census he's using the justice department which should be the top law enforcement agency as his own political law department he has stopped congressional briefings on intelligence and election interference he has physically put down peaceful protesters by the use of his own administration this is not the law and order president he does not regard the law nor does he want to encourage order he wants the exact opposite congresswoman you are in a fairly safe democratic district you won by 63 63 to 36 percent in the 2018 uh midterm election but i wonder whether even in your district uh the fact that the press the politicians are focused on law and order rather than on covid makes a difference in the race well i think it's a planned distraction by this president and thank you for thinking i'm in a safe district i'm in a district that cares deeply about the rule of law and our precious democracy and so what i see is a president who is not the law and order president he's orwellian uh in his expression take a look at his use of the white house for a campaign stunt or series of stunts a spectacular spectacle my constituents are incredibly offended by that imagine if i had used my campaign offices for fireworks about reelecting me i'd be hauled the heck out of office as this president should be just because he mouths law and order does not make it so in fact he is the one who and our impeachment show he is the one who does not care one wit about our constitution or the rule of law take a look at what he has done in terms of uh fda what he's done in terms of cdc and you're absolutely right it's all about the distraction because 183 000 americans are dead from coronavirus and there seems to be no end in sight i wonder if i can just jump in uh congress remember even if the unrest is occasional these pictures from cities are going to be played again and again giving the impression to some voters that democratic cities loyal to joe biden are not peaceful i i absolutely understand that but it's just simply not the case what is true is that every member of my caucus every democratic person person who is a democrat uh agrees there is no place for lawlessness you know we just recently laid to rest john lewis what did we praise him for petitioning his government peacefully for non-violence that's what we stand for that's what my democratic caucus stands for that's what joe biden and kamala harris stand for so yes you're right it's an abuse of video to try to foment these things but recognize too that it is the president himself who is trying to incite violence notice how he didn't call out this the extraordinary murder by a 17 year old with an ar-15 kyle rittenhouse of two people publicly on the street the slaughter of americans in an american city where was our president to call that out as absolutely grotesquely un-american where was our president when we know that jacob blake was shot seven times in the back a black man shot seven times in the back and as he lay in a hospital room paralyzed he was shackled strange version of contrast my constituents are not fooled they are very upset and they're going to come out and vote okay congresswoman dean thank you very much for joining the program thank you for having me

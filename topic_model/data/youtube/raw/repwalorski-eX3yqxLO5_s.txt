I like to thank my colleagues for joining me this evening to stand up for the most vulnerable among us we stand together to defend the sanctity of life to speak out against a radical anti life agenda that would effectively legalize infanticide I have long fought to defend the unborn but I'm shocked that I now have to defend the right to life of newborn infants these precious children are imperiled their rights are under attack their lives are under attack and this house has a responsibility to act tonight the American people heard our call to action it's time to vote on the born alive abortion survivors Protection Act will the leadership of this house listen or will the Democratic majority to continue to allow this march toward legalized infanticide if we don't send a strong message that every baby has been endowed by its creator with inalienable rights that we are not defending the fundamental principles of the Constitution if we don't protect these children from harm we're abandoning the basic truth of our humanity I want to thank my colleagues for standing with me here tonight I urge the support of the House bill HR 962 the born alive abortion survivors protect an act and to stand against infanticide and mr. Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

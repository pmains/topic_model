you're recognized um so what i'm understanding is there's merely trying to go to 2 million i must be missing something why would we not want to encourage to go to 2 million we're seeing the benefits in west virginia of getting the vaccine out we're seeing our schools opening up again some of our businesses are trying to open up again we're seeing some benefits of this why in the world i maybe i'm just missing something there's something quietly in the in the background here why isn't there why wouldn't we go to 2 million i hear the debate on this it's working in west virginia i'm sure it's working in some other areas why wouldn't we encourage going to 2 million now i i heard a few minutes ago someone saying about how after president biden took office uh skyrocketed the amount of vaccines that are available i i i i find that little offensive mr chairman uh because i they're acting as though was donald trump making the vaccine in the basement of the white house he had nothing to do with this this was from the manufacturers pharmaceuticals putting this thing out there and they're getting better at it so why aren't we why aren't we getting it in the arms of more people across america because that was my opening statement i made to you was i think getting the vaccine should be our top priority far more than anything else that we're going to be working on today on all these amendments getting that in the arms of people because that will open up our schools and open up our businesses so why in the world would someone say i'd rather stay at a one million a day instead of two let's be more aspirational let's let's reach out to try to get this thing solved rather than play political football with us so i with that mr chairman i'm just a loss why we would not adopt two million a day rather than one we see the benefit so unless someone else wants to balance my time i yield back

chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security and a guy that you have seen just about everywhere congressman I want to thank you for coming into the studio it's always good to see we're laughing having a good time here uh you toward the border recently and I know we've talked a lot about that you and I off the air tell us what you saw down there what your reaction is and what you feel can be done to fix it or you know what was your reaction we surprised by what you saw are you figured as much I've been think I've been down there before I think the point was to take members who had never seen the border down there like a guy from New Jersey for instance right so we went down to San Diego we saw the fencing we saw the aviation assets where we found were there digging under the fence and they're also boats going around the fence to drop their loads off and then to son sector and we have a lot of DoD assets technologies that are pretty have been fairly successful plugging that whole lot but when you plug one hole up another one opens up right and we've had this ad hoc approach for decades and throwing a lot of money at the 75 billion dollars and the best success rate me it was forty-four percent apprehension and I think that's unacceptable and what we found is where are they crossing now Texas the Rio Grande Valley is going to fifty-five percent in terms of a little crossing so we went down there it's more wide open they don't have the resources in Texas that we need we literally saw a body as we were out on a boat on the Rio Grande a body and build a floating on the river so curry so yeah the number from New Jersey it was dressed in his pink khakis and blue blazer looked at that and said do you want to mention anything sir he said he says my god this is really a war zone down here and I said it is and that's what I want to take you down here to see this so we put together the last time we talked you had suggested that there will be pieces of legislation that will make up what the house immigration stance is the bill that will somehow have to be merged with the Senate immigration ability in a committee in a committee meeting and we're going to have to that's where I think the rubber is really going to meet the road what do you see right now you've got your bill that came out of you committee other pieces of this immigration legislation being drafted together being cobbled together in some way well might you know my planes of jurisdiction our border security get operation control the border we define it as a ninety percent apprehension rate within two years after the plan is submitted our stakeholders or the coast guard the border control were shares the board of governors National Guard all coming together with the ranchers as well and say here's the the national strategy and then the plan comes forward then we fill the capability gaps in the Congress from they report that to us where do we need these resources what they did in the Senate was misguided in three days Chuck Schumer from New York is the architect of how to deal with the southwest border and he throws 50 billion dollars of the problem without any rhyme or reason we want to do this a smart way the thoughtful way so we call from national strategy and then a plan and then we allocate those resources where they need to go so we stopped making these mistakes we've made you know for decades and i think that's that's a smart way to do this the congressman mike mccall joining us this morning congressman let's talk a little bit about egypt because that has got a lot of people's attention right now long syria but we see what's going on in Egypt Morrissey was supposedly elected democratically now the people of Egypt not have get all of the Muslim Brotherhood we saw that one coming but the money that we're sending to Egypt or supposedly sending now we don't really know the administration is sending all of it or some of it should we be sending any money to Egypt because we don't know whose pockets it ends up and once it gets there well we've been doing it for a long time and then the Arab Spring have occurred now the president encouraged the Arab Spring now what do we get out of the Arab Spring we get a winter and we got the Muslim Brotherhood taking over Egypt essentially what happened what the military is done is they've come in on the behalf of the secular people populations and we're fed up with these Muslim Brotherhood guess we're fed up with a Sharia law they're trying to implement in the country and we're going to kick them out and we're going to put them in jail so I'm you know a little bit torn I'm not a foreign aid guy mad but I'll tell you what if I can support a force that will crack some heads down on the Brotherhood in Sharia law I personally think that's a good thing if it was economic assistance I'd say no but if it's supporting a military force that is cracking down on the Muslim Brotherhood which is one of the biggest threats we have out there they're trying to take over all of North Africa in Syria I think that's a good thing all right Congress only do a quick traffic and weather break here if we can and then we'll come right back with Texas congressman mike mccall 723 right in the button we are pleased to have with us texas congressman michael collies the chairman of the Congressional Committee on Homeland Security let me talk a little bit about a tough Fort Hood and I believe Fort Hood is in your district correct just north just know with your district obviously it's Sharon just mentioned deliberation still going on as to whether or not this guy gets the death penalty he wants to be killed I mean he wants to be monitored congressman should we give him what he wants in your view I think it back night well I over sell a lot of death penalty cases when I worked in the attorney general's office and I haven't seen a stronger case that would work the death penalty than this I went to the ceremony I saw the 13 combat boots and the helmets I saw the wounded soldiers at the time I asked him you know what did he said before he shot you and the response was all who I bar which is the classic jihadist terminology got his grade I knew at that point it was something more than some guy that just snapped it was tied to something greater this was an act of terrorism on American soil and I think what I get so frustrated about is that this administration will call what it is whether it was Benghazi you know anywhere else in the world to call that workplace violence and not an act of terrorism is such an insult to the victims because it also impacts their compensation it impacts their ability to get VA benefits and impacts their ability to get purple hearts right and I think it's a real less slap in the face and i would agree and i talked to Senator Cornyn about this yesterday and I think we all agree on that the circular argument there giving for not allowing the purple are to be given but you know should this guy actually be should be kill because that's what he wants maybe a better sentence would be to keep them in prison for the rest of life well i think you know it's a capital case i think the jury is going to come back and find them guilty of that and give him the death penalty and you know in his own words you said I killed our soldiers to protect the Taliban I mean what more evidence do you need this is an act of terrorism congressman I got one more for you a DOJ yesterday filed a lawsuit I don't know if anybody was surprised by this trying to prevent I believe photo voter ID and redistricting just long enough to get through the midterm elections they feel Democrats may have some traction in Texas your view on this I don't think this goes anywhere once this this gets to any kind of court I think they're just looking to delay it as long as I can well redistricting the Supreme Court has basically come down and said you know it's basically get to the states at this point and and so I think Abbott's going to follow the supreme courts rationale I think that's going to go forward in a timely basis with respect to voter ID I mean my god you need a identification card and check out a library book you know so when you drive your car yet to the driver's license so to to exercise your most basic constitutional right seems to me yet that's some sort of identification as to who you are and the reason why is because we see seen so much a fraud and corruption in the voting process and I think that's what the law is designed to do you know have an identification card it says who you are I think that's not a heavy requirement ok most people agree this is a common-sense idea no question about it and I think that once this thing does get to court as they look at it you're not going to go back to nineteen fifty-eight elections they will look at recent elections and they will see that in Texas we have upheld voters rights our time is always too short with you congressman and I want to thank you very much for for taking the time for coming in for enjoying you know our laughter and in the seriousness as well keep up the good work and we get a big job ahead of you and I need to get you back we need to talk about a lot a lot of different things but we certainly appreciate you I know you're not a morning guy I you know not but I get up for you you know that's that's you're the one person I'm going to wake up for indecent like this but doesn't know me everybody's the same my bill is about border security first and the immigration reform that's part of judiciary's deal but I think we have a real opportunity to finally get this thing done and that's my main focus congressman thank you for your time we sure appreciate it we're back for the news the bottom of the hour next

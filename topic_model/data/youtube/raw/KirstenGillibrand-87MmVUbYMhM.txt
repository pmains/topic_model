all of those ideas people was all Bernie they're so radical hell three years all of those ideas and many more are now part of the political mainstream did he make those ideas mainstream or impact your thinking well I ran on medicare-for-all in 2006 and I actually got elected in a two-to-one Republican House District running on Medicare for all with a public option letting people buy in at a price they can afford I ran for re-election in that congressional district again two to one Republican registration and I won it by 24 points so I've been talking about it since 2005 I don't know when senator Sanders started talking about it but I got to help write the bill that we introduced together and the part I got to work on was this transition having a four-year transition where people could buy in at a price they can afford which to me just creates competition it allows people to choose whether or not they want that public option whether they want access to Medicare at an affordable price but if it is at 4% of income that's affordable if you make $100,000 and you have to pay $4,000 to have access that's affordable and probably less than you're paying today and it would be self-sustaining especially if you let Americans buy in overtime and ultimately make it single-payer and an earned benefit

I'm compelled to rise in opposition today to this resolution which would block the EPA's good neighbor clean air rule from being implemented before I talk about the real world impacts that would result if we block this new clean air rule I'd like to go back in time 21 years ago when his body debated the last major update to the Clean Air Act that day we weren't debating how do we could have delay our clean air laws we were considering legislation bipartisan legislation that would improve our clean air laws and make them stronger eighty nine senators approved the cleaner act amendments of 1990 Republican President George Herbert Walker Bush signed them into law we're all the better for it I believe that we can protect our environment and grow our economy at the same time it doesn't have to be one of the other in the Clean Air Act clean air act amendments of 1990 a great examples of just that for every dollar we spend installing new pollution controls and cleaning up our air we've seen $30 return and reduced health care costs better workplace productivity and saved lives in other words for four decades fewer people have gotten sick and missed work because of the Clean Air Act just last year it's estimated that 160,000 people lives were saved from the clean air act protections that are in place today and here's some more good news our economy didn't take a slide because of these protections either quite the opposite since president former President Bush signed the bipartisan clean air act amendments of 1990 into law electricity rates have stayed constant and our economy has grown by sixty percent despite the successes more needs to be done we know more today than we did 20 or 30 years ago about how pollution impairs our health we know even more about how pollution travels from one state to another we know more about how to curb that pollution in ways that make sense and are cost effective my state of Delaware has made great strides in cleaning up its own air pollution investing millions in clean air technology unfortunately air pollution knows no state boundaries and easily drifts from state to state Dell are like many East Coast states sits at the end of what I call a mirror tailpipe that means most of the pollution in Delaware isn't caused by sources in my state is caused mainly by sources in Ohio or Indiana or other states in the Midwest in fact ninety percent of Delaware's air pollution comes from beyond our borders as governor of delaware i could have shut down our entire state economy we would still have been out of attainment in public health standards this is pollution we need our neighbors to clean up and unfortunately that hasn't always happened sadly many of our up when neighbors have not invested heavily enough in no clean air technologies some states have even built smaller smokestacks so the pollution would fall on neighboring states keeping their are clean in making our air dirty at the end of the day downwind States can spend millions of dollars to clean up their act but unless we require upwind States to make serious reductions then states like mine won't get much healthier and people will continue to get sick and die for all delawareans and all the others who are living at the end of that tailpipe I say enough is enough the EPA and the courts agree this is why the EPA has implemented this cross-state air pollution rule this rule follows the intent in the direction of the clean air act amendments of 1990 it ensures that all we do that all of us do our fair share to reduce air pollution that's the way it ought to be like my colleagues I try to live my life by the gold and will treat other people the way we want to be treated that's why this rule is fair my state my neighboring states shouldn't have to suffer because other states aren't required to clean up their act at our expense furthermore if you ignore the fairness and equity arguments for the cross-state air pollution rule it's still a no-brainer because the cost of benefit ratio of these new protections is over whelming this role will save up to thirty four thousand lives this year that's roughly the number of people that fit into fenway park for a red sox game all these great benefits will be negative if this resolution passes to my friends who are thinking about voting for this resolution let me just ask this what if the prevailing winds of this country were blowing and center from west to east from east to west and what if those of us who live along the east coast from virginia domain chose to operate older dirtier coal-fired electric plans and what if we built tall smokestacks that said the harmful emissions coming from our plants upward into the air a bit carried away two regions only to end up in the air breathe by people living in the areas to our west in widened by operating these older dirtier power plants we lower the cost of electricity along the east coast while raising it for our neighbors in the Midwest in what if I operating these older dirtier power plants we decrease the health care costs associated with dirty air for Americans living along the east coast while increasing health care costs for Americans living in the Midwest I'll tell you what they'd say they'd say it's unfair they'd say we shouldn't be able to get away with polluting their communities year after year they'd say somebody should write this wrong they say haven't you heard about the golden rule that their monitors to treat all others the way we want to be treated they'd say enough is enough here are the facts the technology exists to end this scourge of pollution tilly's all around the country you've already installed it in doing so they put tens of thousands of people to work including hundreds in my home state of Delaware utilities have the money we have a trained workforce that wants to do the work we just need to act a clean environment in a strong economy can go hand in hand we don't have to choose between one or the other join me in defeating this proposal give your neighbors who live in my part of the country are part of the country give their kids their grandparents air to breathe it won't send them home from school or work we're off to an emergency room we're into a hospital or worse yet take their lives please join me well no against this motion proceed to the resolution Thank You mr. president

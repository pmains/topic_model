it is make-or-break month for healthcare and President Obama now under fire for members of his own party Democrats forming their own angry chorus furious at the White House for dialing back its commitment to the so-called public option they are crying betrayal and vowing to fight back so our big question tonight is it all or nothing when it comes to health care reform and one of those who wants to keep the public option is democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters who is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus she's joining us tonight from Los Angeles in Washington Ezra Klein whose staff reporter for The Washington Post and he is keeping a blog that focuses largely on health care policy and here with me in New York are senior political analyst Jeffrey Toobin joining us as well welcome to everybody congresswoman let me start with you on this you you said that you won't vote for a bill without the public option why is this a deal breaker for you it's a deal breaker because the whole idea behind behind health care reform is to bring down the cost we cannot bring down the cost unless there's a public option that will create competition we cannot turn this over to the same people who have been you know making the cost of health care just go off the scale the premiums continue to go up they continue to make more money and the CEOs continue to make big salaries we've got to stop that the only way to stop it is with a public option well congresswoman you present Clinton who knows quite a lot about what it's like to fight for health care and fail has been warning liberals you know not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good here and let me just play you a little bit of what he said this is to a group of liberal liberal bloggers as we can listen it is politically imperative for the Democrats to pass a health care bill now because one thing we know one thing we know and that I've lived through isn't if you get out there and then you don't prevail the victors get to rewrite history and I want us to be mindful that sometimes we may have to take less than a full loaf so what do you think about that sometimes we may have to take less than a full loaf are you are you not prepared to make anything listen no let me tell you you know I'm one who supported a single-payer plan most of us progressives did support a single-payer plan they asked us not to push on that that that was going to be impossible to do this would cause a lot of confrontation we backed up on single player and decided that we would go with public option that was supported by the President of the United States and we consider that we've made a huge compromise and so it's not that we want the perfect we want what it's credible you cannot have credible health care reform if you don't address the issue of the rising costs and this is not just about the uninsured this is about working people who every day go to work and increasingly they're paying a larger percentage of their income for healthcare a band in recent years let me let me have Jeff back it up a little bit and just explain to people what we're talking about when we talk about the public option what does that mean right people sometimes talk about these things in short-handed code in simple terms public option is we all know what insurance companies are most of us have our insurance through aetna united healthcare Oxford whatever the idea behind this plan is that there would be a different plan Uncle Sam's plan run by the government where you could get insurance through the government and conservatives say well that's unfair to the existing companies because they would undercut drive them out of business like congressman waters say supporters of the plan say look it's just good competition and there's no reason why it would be unfair look how well UPS and FedEx do competing against the post office that's that point that the president is president maids at any time again many as well let me go to this on you you heard congresswoman water so there I get for how intense the the anger is on the left over this and are they willing to really put muscle behind it it's very significant right i mean i think that for the left and for that matter for the right the public option has become the single symbolic measure of success on this right i mean it's a big bill the parts are hard to follow and it's hard to say whether you're winning or you lose in but this has become the way people decide that now as for the muscle piece of things i mean it's going to be a tricky fight a congress what the congresswoman and the Progressive Caucus have made an argument that if you try to sacrifice the public option for a couple votes in the Senate you're going to lose so many the house you can't pass a bill at the end of the day they're having trouble prosecuting that because people think that they're not really going to kill health care reform but you know I've never you know I've spoken with the chairman of the cot chairwoman of the caucus and they seem very serious about it to me but but address that argument if you would congresswoman that that I guess bottom line is they think you're bluffing well let me just say that this is a dynamic process and for those of us who feel strongly about having a public option have an incredible health care reform bill not caving in so much that what you get won't amount to a real reform we're serious I'm told that someone said oh you don't have to worry about the progressives will eventually get them I don't think that is the case this time I think that we have a lot of people who feel very strongly about this we're going to hold firm and we're going to demand that we have a credible health care bill no one can say that we're not willing to compromise at any time any place anywhere we did that on single-payer we showed that we were willing to work with the blue dogs and the opposite side of the aisle and anybody else who didn't like single-payer so we backed up and now we are insisting on having a public option and I think that's where we got to stick all right congresswoman waters uh Maxine Waters joining us tonight as recline and jeff toobin who's going to be sticking around to talk to us again a little late

thank you so much mr speaker you know i we started this out with the ranking member saying that we just wanted headlines i absolutely i absolutely want headlines to bring to the attention of this country the poverty in our schools i want headlines about the crumbling schools my children go to school in i do want headlines about the disinvestment in public education that my colleagues continue to do i want the headlines so i i admit it we also talked this morning for i mean this afternoon about how equality cannot mean uniformity but it can also not mean doing nothing but giving lip service to a problem which is what my colleagues do they talk and do nothing not one solution comes from the other side of the aisle not one i didn't hear one today and then we talk about this this this amendment that's coming to use another fund to help us do some of these things they don't tell you that that fund is a fund that is used for mental health for children so they want us to choose between integrating schools and the mental health of our children i think that that's not if that's the best they've got i'm so very very disappointed mr speaker because at some point we have to reckon what with what is going on in this country today and deal with the racial segregation of my children and they are all my children mr speaker if we fail to begin to address this issue and this is only a beginning then we can no longer say we agree that every child should have access to a quality education that every child should go to a school that has the kind of equipment that they should have that every child has internet or broadband access that every child has an opportunity to succeed if we don't do this we don't mean it i yield back the balance of my time

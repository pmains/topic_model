if you ask me what the big issue between the Republican Party Democratic Party if you had to pick what issue to define the different size pics Bobcats we all believe health care system is broken I think do you agree that we can improve the current health care system here's where Republicans are going to make mistake i voted against obamacare like 75 times the house is voted against obamacare like 175 times I think we've convinced people we don't like it but what have we not done there you go i bought a republican plan I've got a Republican plan that says competition is good if any of you ever go to the doctor and ask them how much it goes I never have I should when I buy a car I go to like 10 car dealers when you go to the doctor I don't shop around and say what you gonna charge me to take out my opinion we pay our deductibles and we don't care we've got to attach ourselves to our own decisions do you agree with it if you spoke your to pay more because I'm paying for you when you spoke if you have a healthy lifestyle you were to get a better deal for to take private sector concepts and put them into the insurance system but maybe anybody here lost a loved one the cancer I lost my mom a pre-existing illness if that excludes you from insurance that's crazy I don't want to knock people out of insurance because they've been sick let's create a risk pool I don't mind children staying on the parents policies while they're going to college I just don't want the government to take over every health care decision in America because we're just not really good at that private employers are going to 29 hour work weeks why because the cost of insurance under Obamacare is too expensive the people he wants to help he's hurting unions are saying you know what thank you but no thanks the unions for God's sakes are on our side so what to do come up with a Republican plan right keep show up showcasing how bad Obamacare is in terms of this structure but the one thing I don't want to do is make it about us defunding Obamacare Ted Cruz has a bill I'm on it I've already voted twice to defund it I will do it again but here's what they're proposing if the president will not agree to defund Obamacare how many of you think he will I don't think so he might but I doubt it if he doesn't agree to it I don't think it's smart tactically for us to say we're not gonna find any of the other government because how about justify not paying people at the Air Force Base because I can't convince him to come my way how'd I justify shutting down to the hospital and stopping social security checks cuz that's what surely what will happen then it comes about us so what I think we ought to do is have a plan that every Republican get behind between 9 2014 and make every Democrat own a volunteer all of them voted for it and they're running away like scalded Dawn's this campaign should be about do you agree with vomit care yes or no if you're a Democrat would you be willing to replace it working Republicans and if they say yes we're off to the races right if they say no they're gonna lose now what am I going to do I'm going to offer legislation that will allow every state to opt out if you want to so I'm going to take this debate out of Washington's governor Haley's I like a lot is going to have a democratic component right I want to ask him would you allow South Carolinians stopped out of Obama care if they chose let him say no I'm going to ask every state house candidate if you got into the State House would you vote to stay in or would you vote opt out can you imagine that debate all over America getting this debate out of Washington back home I think it's the smartest thing we can do if Obamacare is really a good idea let people vote if they want to be in it or not can you imagine how that would affect 2014 if in every congressional race the first question is do you support allowing your people to get out if they want to get that to me is smart that to me will unravel Obamacare not because Lindsey Graham doesn't like Obama because people rejected point you

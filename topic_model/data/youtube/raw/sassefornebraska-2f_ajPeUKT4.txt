let me ask you this because you really are considered as somebody one of the rising stars in the conservative movement but I think this presidential primary is exposed a difference of opinion of what conservatism even means right now and you have a version that Trump has you have a version that Cruz has and I would argue you have a separate version that say a Jeb Bush and John Kasich add let me ask you because a lot of people are looking to you as one of these future leaders of conservative movement what is a conservative in your view today define conservatism in the 21st century via Ben Sasse thanks that is a great question America is the most exceptional nation in the history of the world because the US Constitution is the best political document that's ever been written because it says something different than almost any people and any government has believed in human history most governments in the past said might makes right and the King has all the power and the people or dependent subjects and the American founders said no God gives us rights by Nature and government is just our shared project to secure those rights government is not the author or source of our rights and you don't make America great again by giving more power to one guy in Washington DC you make America great again by recovering a constitutional republic where Washington is populated by people who are servant leaders who want to return power to the people and to the communities because what's great in America is the Rotary Club it's small businesses its churches its schools its fire departments and it's little leagues across this country what makes America great is not some guy in Washington who says if I had more power I could fix it all unilaterally that's not the American tradition and you believe Donald Trump is simply not a conservative hey listen what Donald Trump is actually set out there is when I'm president I'll be able to do whatever I want no that's not the American Way the American tradition is to say the executive branch is to faithfully execute the laws not try to run the country we don't need anybody to run our country we need Washington to faithfully execute the laws and reaffirm American greatness which is in the communities of Nebraska and Iowa all right Ben Sasse a new senator from Nebraska Republican thanks for coming on the show and uh I'll see you nya WA thanks Chuck you got it thank you

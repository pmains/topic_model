up here senator wicker Thank You mr. chairman and the Chairman PI as you know accelerating broadband development in rural areas as a priority for many members on both sides of the diets I've worked closely with you and the Commission to ensure that the agency's data collection methods regarding mobile broadband coverage are standardized senator das data is necessary to ensure that funds used to expand broadband deployment are targeted to truly understand unserved communities in rural America and in my state of Mississippi would you agree that standardizing data collection is important to target funds accurately to deploy the broadband and underserved and unserved areas and will you commit to ensuring that the baseline coverage data collected from carriers for the mobility fund pays to challenge process be standardized and please discuss how the draft order circulated last week on the mobility fund challenge process achieves that objective Thank You senator and this is one of the reasons why we broke with long-standing practice in my second week in office and instituted the policy of publish publishing every single proposal in order the FCC was considering at least three weeks in advance no where is the thicket more complicated than this one we want to make sure that we get it rights for Americans Wireless consumers and that requires us getting the data right and so last week as you pointed out we published the proposal that we're going to be voting on on August 3rd to ensure that this data is accurate and I understand that standardized data collection is one of the issues that has been flagged we would love to work with you and your staff any interested stakeholders frankly to make sure that on August 3rd we ensure that we have a process that makes the the input accurate so that the output can be worthy will this be a one-time data collection with respect to mobility fund phase 2 currently that is our expectation but obviously we're always open to suggestions on ways to improve our overall data collection or to broaden will I'd like to mention to all three of you then the various a serious question as to how the mobility fund challenge process will ensure that recipients of the funds are meeting build-out commitments over the 10-year period would you like to come in on that I'd be happy to senator every dollar that is spent by the FCC that is ultimately collected from the taxpayers has to be deployed it cannot be simply poured down the drain and that requires build-out and so we have instituted aggressive reporting obligations and build-out obligations as well to ensure that that money actually goes to building out 4G LTE and unserved parts of the country we do not want that money to be wasted American soil consumers simply don't have time to wait let's let's have a further discussion on that with members of the Commission well that the draft order specifies that cell edge probability and the cell loading factor will be used by carriers when creating rural coverage Maps some people remain concerned that additional factors such as the assumed signal strength also need to be standardized or disclosed in order for the data you receive to be reliable will you commit to working with me and those stakeholders to address these concerns before their order is finalized I would be happy to senator thank you and I look forward to you briefing me and my staff on your about your efforts in this regard now let's talk about the federal permitting process and I'll go back to you mr. chairman I understand the FCC is working on a proceeding to modernize the Commission's approach to the National Environmental Protection Act and the National Historic Protection Act to accelerate the deployment of wireless infrastructure there are many onerous rules in place today that prevent or delay deployment including the implementation of antenna sites that are critical to wireless network build-out please discuss how an update to the Commission's approach towards environmental and historic reviews may accelerate the deployment of mobile broadband and the proliferation of 5g networks to both urban and rural areas particularly in existing public right-of-ways already undergone environmental and historic reviews we're broadband infrastructure has already been deployed and do you think Congress needs to act on this issue all great points obviously the regulatory review including environmental and historic preservation review that employed that applied traditionally to 100-foot cell towers may not be as relevant when you're talking about a small cell that could be as small as a pizza box or that you could hold in your hand and so we want to make sure for these less obtrusive lower power deployments that we tailor the regulatory burden to the nature of the deployment as commissioner rosenworcel has pointed out and so that's one of the things we're looking to work with all interested stakeholders on to figure out what is the appropriate calibration of those rules with respect to small cells and distribute antenna systems and the like in terms of additional authority it may be helpful in some cases for Congress to give us that authority with respect to 5g for example the SEC is a jurisdiction of her pole attachments is somewhat circumscribed and so we'd be happy to work with you any members of the committee who are interested to find creative solutions that would help us secure the benefits of the wireless revolution to come mr. Carr do you think Congress needs to act in this space or do you have the authority need senator thank you for the question there are certainly some actions the SEC can take in terms of streamlining Congress's help here would certainly be welcome whether it's big ones legislation or work with respect to federal lands where the FCC might have more limited authority thank you thank you mr. chairman Thank You senator wicker

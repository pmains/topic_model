speaker it a Dolman my friend and I know each other for well over a decade Israeli the small place and we have mutual friend and he would help me in various initiative that I supported when he was in in various government position we have not always been on the same side of the political fence though I've been protesting the occupations in 69 where it was born into family of strong supporter of the vision of Greater Israel a vision akurdi him into politics but we must be clear Aidan I shared similar dedication to the health and well-being of the Jewish homeland he who devoted his life to Israel going into politics serving years of Jerusalem deputy mayor then mayor then joining Prime Minister a real shawan government and then leading the country of the Prime Minister himself these are action of a man for whom the future of Israel is of primary importance after the Second Intifada it clear to me that they owed came to new understanding of what it it take to truly secure Israel Georgia Democratic future much to the surprise and often great warrior of his fellow political traveler it would began to talk openly about two-state solution he was the first minister in a real show on government to talk about withdrawal from Gaza and part of the West Bank in his speech in being at ben-gurion grave I think in 2004 but tweet three or four yeah occupation was clearly destroying Israel from within na would further recognize the harsh demographic tools if Israel wanted to remain Jewish and democratic homeland the dream of grated Israel could not be realized I think with some time underestimate the enormous city of this kind of paradigm shift for someone who was raised in the home driven by the teaching of zaire Jabotinsky to say we have to give up land we present almost a bombshell of thought and in this Haywood thinking we fled reflects that of a lot of people in this room many of us one thought a different approach to peace and security was possible but when faced with reality didn't look away instead choosing to embrace the need to end the conflict and pursue such agreement is the best possible expression of our dedication of Israel to Israel nao does not stop walking for that gold since se vote in the New York time recently Israeli simply do not have the luxury of spending more time postponing a solution now it's a time they will be no better one I will bring him up here just in just a minute but first I want to say just one more thing ayo this Fame married to a wonderful woman Alyssa the in a father of five children who have long been to the left of him politically in his world nothing happened as we sit here in this room surrounded by like Tinker preparing to lobby on the hill tomorrow and then go home to our family and communities where many people may still feel the very idea of negotiation think about the all my family think about power of love and respect think about the power we have to change the way our family and our community talk about Israel and the conflict if we want to make history that the only way you will be able to do it by winning over who may not yes see what we see I'm grateful to our dollar for his leadership on the question of two-state solution and deeply admire scars and conviction we are honored to have him here tonight please welcome a doll you

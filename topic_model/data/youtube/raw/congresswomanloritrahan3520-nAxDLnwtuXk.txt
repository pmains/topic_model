hi I'm congresswoman Laura Han and I thank you for tuning into the first discussion in my conversation series being the change conversations with leaders in the fight to end racial injustice it's been over a month since George Floyd was brutally killed by Minneapolis police officers in the midst of the koban 19 health crisis that is disproportionately affecting black and brown communities all over our country Americans are reawakened to the pervasive racism and inequality that exists in our country the passage of time has only confirmed that we must continue tough conversations and expose racial injustice in all its hiding places over the coming weeks I'll be joined by experts to talk about how racial inequality continues to affect communities of color and about how we can use this moment does a turning point for action how we can be the change once and for all we'll be talking about disparities in health care education housing and environment and I look forward to keeping you all updated on when those will be taking place right here on Facebook live given the rightful outrage and demands for change following the murder of George Floyd and the recent action we took in the House of Representatives to overhaul policing in America it is only right that we begin this discussion series with my esteemed colleague and activist leader congresswoman Karen bass who in addition to proudly representing California's thirty seventh congressional district also serves as the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus you may know chairwoman bass because of her leadership in crafting the George Floyd Justice and policing Act of 2020 legislation we passed less than two weeks ago to overhaul policing and communities across America by ending police brutality requiring increased transparency and making sure that officers are held accountable for their own conduct but nearly 30 years ago chairwoman bass and other activists activists work hard to make the horrific police brutality committed against Rodney King in Los Angeles a moment for police reform and a call to action for all those looking to combat racial inequities she founded the Community Coalition a community-based social justice organization in South Los Angeles that empowers residents to become involved in making a difference in just four years after being elected to California State Assembly she was selected by her peers as the 67th Speaker of the body making her the first African American woman in history to serve in this powerful position chair woman bass was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 where she is a leader on reforming America's foster care system and strengthening our nation's trade and economic relationships with many African countries she was also a distinguished member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the House Judiciary Committee where she serves as the chair of the Subcommittee on crime terrorism and Homeland Security chair Wilma bass thank you so much for joining us today it is my pleasure to be with you and let me just let all of your constituents know how lucky they are to have you as a representative now although you're a new member of Congress a year and a half in Congress no one would ever know because the leadership that you have displayed your constituents really need to be aware of how well they're represented and I really appreciate you doing this series it's so important because this is an incredible moment in our history a moment that is sad you know it's mixed with so many emotions but the main emotion that I feel is hope I feel hope I feel the energy from the streets and you should know the way the legislative process works it can take 30 days or 30 years but because of the people who have been peacefully out in the streets it has moved us along to deal with this issue and so the fact that people in your community are looking at the issue of systemic racism and everybody can play a role because it really doesn't matter where you live you can look at your own situation and say what is happening with policing in my area what is happening in the schools what is the suspension and expulsion we're in the middle of a pandemic how is it disproportionately impacting the people in my community and so that allows for all of us to play a role and I think the most important beginning is to educate yourself so one thing that I've been saying everywhere representative Tran is the documentary 13 yeah you can get on Netflix it's for the 13th amendment it's a great way to start to understand the history the history of policing in the United States absolutely and you know it is across communities in the district that I represent people are educating themselves which I I think it's been just illuminating it's also been empowering especially for our young people I mean I hosted a discussion with some of the youth leaders of the movement here locally and it was it was incredible just how straightforward I mean first of all they were on the front lines of this movement right so they're tired I mean this is their this is their moment to act to be bold to fight for this their change and it's 24/7 for these youth leaders and so they have no patience for people who are uneducated to come to them with their you know questions it's like they were very explicit go to Google you know find and you know what it was great advice because there are so many things that you know we haven't either haven't learned in our classrooms or you know we just you know they're all starting to surface now and people are looking through it through like a very clear lens and that is that is certainly progress when we think about you know more people fighting for this for these changes so alright I have to ask you can I dive into a couple of questions all right because you can you've been talking about racial inequality and injustice for a long time and there are many young people wondering you know what path do I take to make a difference so how did you come to decide your path well you know it's interesting my Pappy volved I started as a child being very interested in what was going on around me it was a moment like this that I grew up in where there was change happening everywhere and the leadership in our country we were questioning in a major way and I just always looked for what was going on in my community what could I directly get involved in and I don't care where you live there's definitely ways to get involved you know Lori I never thought about elected office that was like the furthest thing from my mind it really just kind of evolved what was consistent in my life was that I really wanted to devote my life to social and economic justice and then my path kind of evolved issues that were happening at the moment grabbed me just like Cogan is happening now and policing is happening now back when I was growing up it was the anti-apartheid movement our war or different things like that that grabbed my attention anyone anywhere any age can make a difference yeah it's so true and that is that is where we get our hope and optimism right now and we're seeing young people flood the streets the parks the comments I mean it doesn't matter what community or what type of community you live in you know young people are saying this is wrong and this is not this is not going to continue on our watch so you know Congress passed the justice and policing act less than a couple of weeks ago and we do mind explaining just to folks tuning in the significance of passing this legislation well I've been in Congress now 10 years but my colleagues that had been there much longer than me tell me that this has not happened before you know this moment what has happened in the past when someone was murdered you know on video people would always raise questions well we're not really sure about this not really sure about that there was no discussion of dispute over George Floyd and I think that brought us together but in the bill just to mention a couple of features of the bill the bill tries to hold officers accountable because when when all I saw that horrific video that officer was literally looking in the camera with his hand in his pocket while he was committing a murder he clearly knew he was acting with impunity he didn't think anything was gonna happen to him at all so the bill addresses that the bill says you shouldn't use a chokehold you shouldn't knock a door down that what happened to Brianna Taylor if you're a bad officer you should be in a database you shouldn't be able to hop from city to city but one of the pieces of the bill that I'm the most excited about is the part that offers grants to communities because while we're all going through this time period of saying well what should policing be what does it mean for my community to be safe then we can provide resources to communities so they can actually do that visioning process yeah which is so important right because there are many calls that are you know police officers take where they're not the best suited right to handle that call you know they have to deal with our homelessness problems our substance use abuse problems are you know so many issues that confront a community that you know it's I do think that on a municipal level folks are now saying you know how can we make it so that we have more you know we have more empathy we have the proper treatment on the other end of that phone and so it's those are those discussions are really important and there they are they're happening I've been involved in many listening sessions so that people can have their voices heard you know folks are are sitting down listening taking all that in and then putting together whether it's a citizen condition to oversee next steps or some accountability measures I mean folks are really leaning in to make the changes that are necessary which is which is really important okay so in past conversations you know I've talked with folks about how taking on police brutality isn't the only solution to ending racism discrimination and bias and our kind rather it's you know it's the first step and it's the one that we were confronted with most immediately no one could have hurt their eyes but you know I I saw the education labor committee you know we're looking at how history is being taught in our country we're looking at the pipeline of teachers so that you know diverse student body actually have diverse teachers at the head of the classroom certainly we just finished the mark-up of the Defense Authorization where we took on you know changing the names of our our military bases there's this affects every aspect of our society so can you talk a little bit about what steps we need to take next need to take now yeah absolutely well you know and let's view it in the context of what is happening today and so we're talking about policing but there's this issue that does impact all of us called kovat and and that is something that everybody can get involved in so you sit on education and labor and I really worry about education that's happening right now or there isn't happening right now where kids are not in school right so we know in the education system we already have the inequity that is there we know that well just think that that inequity is compounded now because not every home has the technology to do what we're doing now and in in my community even in the poor part of my community because it's Los Angeles which is a relatively affluent area the kids are sent home with laptops well that's just wonderful but you're making the assumption that the parent knows how to use the laptop so that's even something that people could get involved in on a community level what I have found is is that in times of great crisis people want something to do something physical to do how can I specifically help well in your neighborhood you could look at your neighborhood schools and you could say are there kids there especially in the lower grade levels an assumption is made that every young person knows how to use technology which is probably too true when you hit your teen years but not when you're five or six or seven and looking at the essential workers in your area and what is happening with their children so I think there's so many ways that colvett is impacting us in ways that we could all get involved in safely a hearing the public health guidelines but you can still make a difference that's great and you know there are I mean I don't know how many calls I sit on with you know local activists who you know are looking for that guidance what can I do I want to be helpful you know I've got you know I've got some discretionary time put me to work right and so it is those you know those tangible steps that you give them that you know can make all the difference in the world whether it's you know helping with food insecurity and making sure those school lunch programs and school breakfasts are still getting to where they need to go or ensuring that kids have the instruction and the technology that they they need because our Community Action agencies for example are on the front lines of so many of these things but you know they the volunteers and just the folks that they need to make sure that those services are provided are so important I am NOT going to keep you very long I know how busy you are I'll ask my question but you know fixing inequality that is persisted for generations you know it's not going to be easy it's not likely going to happen overnight but what advice do you have for people who are looking to sustain the movement for justice and what are some of the best ways you know and you've already alluded to some of them for but for everyday folks to help the people who are leading the movement and you know you kind one thing about movements as they ebb and flows and and right now we're in a flow because we have multiple crises that are happening we have a health crisis and economic crisis a crisis and in policing and so people often ask me well how have you sustained yourself over all these decades and what has sustained me what keeps me going is really the energy from all of the activism today even with my own staff Laurie I told them I said you know what be safe but go out and participate in the protests right helpful to do that it really is and I I just believe that people need something concrete to do it's important to do something even if it's small I may focus there are so many issues to be involved in whether it's education or healthcare or jobs are the issue of people coming out of prisons and needing to you know incorporate themselves but find a focus and get involved even if it's in what you feel might be a small way you can just make such a huge difference mentor a younger person take somebody under your wing you know a whole group that is left out of this equation our foster youth who don't have families that they can necessarily go home to so looking for a way to get looking for an issue or a focus to get involved I think it's a really important thing to do you mentioned the Food lines whether it's distributing food at schools are at a food bank but physical activity I think is absolutely key to sustaining your motivation in your hope yeah absolutely and I'm glad you brought up foster youth you know my mom spent the majority of her childhood in an orphanage and then after care yeah and so one I I appreciate and I don't get as much time to talk to you now because we're separated when we're done thank you for all of your leadership and in terms of young people connecting with each other this is a moment where you see so many you know young people having conversations with each other joining together I mean the majority of events that I've been to have been lead and protect you attended by young people some folks haven't probably had conversations with each other you know before never mind like deep substance of Connor seems like they're having now so don't leave anyone out of the movement bring bring everyone along with you you know Karen I was the last trip I took before koban 19 struck our country was down to Alabama for the civil rights token oh yeah I brought my young girls they you know ten and six now but you know we were at the Greyhound station within the the Freedom Riders just jumped into their music and they're singing all the songs from the movement and that was one of the things that forget the fellows name but he said you know what you have to bring back music because you know when we were protesting whether we were marching whether we're riding on the bus whether having a sit-in lunch encounter we were singing because they can't put you in jail for singing so my daughter looked at me at the last protest that my six-year-old said you know mom what are we singing today and I think that's what's what's so important is we sort of press on for for real change you know let me mention one other thing too that that people can do since we're in the zoo environment is that you can organize discussion groups so I mentioned the movie 13 you know you can get together with a group of people to watch that movie all on one night and then do a zoom call and talk about you know and that's just one example but having those conversations where you can share your thoughts what you've learned your feelings all of that is important to keeping to sustaining you because you don't want to see some things and go oh my god this has been going on forever I can't do anything about it but you know you have to stay in contact with social beings even if we have to socialize this way it's actually been you know Scott is a good side to it because number one I'm here talking to you and to your constituents not wouldn't have been doing that because it would have been difficult to travel to Massachusetts you know hey I traveled to Massachusetts I've been meeting members and their constituents all over the country so there is a good side to this it's over I know but look giving more people access to chairwoman Karen bass as a gift so I'm happy that zoom provides the platform well thank you I really I know how you're pulled in a million directions so I want to thank folks for tuning in and thank you chairwoman guys for taking the time to join us know your leadership on these issues is so important and and I look forward to continuing our work together to end the disparities that have just persisted in our country for far too long and if you all out there have would like to share anything in the future we'll be doing these conversations again and again please visit the website treehouse gov and click to contact me to share your thoughts on what future conversations should look and sound like the link to contact me is also in the chat so be sure to click there as well and as I mentioned before we're going to continue these conversations they're so important we're going to have them on a range of issues but all touching on racial injustice in our country so stay tuned for those updates about our next discussion and in the meantime don't forget that we're still navigating a pandemic so continue wearing your mask maintaining a safe social distance whenever possible and keep washing your hands to keep yourself and the folks around you safe but thank you again

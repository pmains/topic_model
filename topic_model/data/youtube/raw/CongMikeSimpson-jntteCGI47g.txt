what we want to do is reduce spending and that's what we're that's what we're trying to do with the budget that we're bringing to the floor uh everybody talks about draconian cuts you got to remember this is on top of uh enormous increases that have occurred over the last couple of years so it's not as draconian as a lot of people would like but i appreciate your your testimony i appreciate your hard work on this budget i know it's hard to put together a budget even if it is one that most people i want to say this respectfully but most people don't take seriously most people don't think this is ever going to be enacted all the right words are used i think the ranking member said this is a tough love budget if this was the tough love that my father had showed me when i was young i'd still be a juvenile delinquent some people think i still am i understand that i've heard that i've heard that we have to make tough choices are going to be necessary we have to live within our means let me ask you this budget theoretically goes to balance in what 16 years well it does it's going to take a long time to go to balance we first have to stabilize the debt there ever a balanced projection out there um you know it it we to get to balance will require a set of decisions that are beyond what anyone's discussing right now every all the conversation no one discussing that well i'll tell you the last time i testified before this committee i presented a balanced budget with a surplus i understand what it takes to get to a balanced budget we've gone through 10 years of a combination of things that have driven the deficit up we've had an economic crisis but we also had decisions to not pay for what we were doing we now are going to have to deal with the results of that and it's not going to be a quick process i know that i left things in pretty good shape 10 years ago i look forward to leaving things in better shape when i'm done this time i don't deny that you did we have a tendency in this committee to sit and look back at certain indicators that prove our point of view all of those don't really matter what matters is where we are today and where we're going to be in the future and what the american people are saying is get your fiscal house in order i don't see this getting our fiscal house in order i've noticed that everybody says well this we're gonna have 400 billion dollars in cuts and savings in this budget like that's some big deal 400 billion dollars yeah it's a lot of money that's over 10 years right yes that's like 40 billion dollars a year the budget this year's proposal is 3.73 trillion 40 billion in savings this is less than 1 or around 1 in savings this is not tough love this is this is continuing the path we're currently on with no future balanced budget ever in this proposal and the american people are rejecting it frankly congressman let me just say a couple things first um you we have put what we believe to be a very serious uh proposal it's comprehensive forward we don't think we have a monopoly on all knowledge or wisdom we look forward to seeing the ideas that are put forward and when you put forward a budget that reduces the deficit i'm sure there'll be things in it that we can agree on there will be things that we can agree on and that's what this is the first step in the process i know that it's easy for pundits on the outside to dismiss uh you know the starting point but the president's budget is the starting point and it is a frame it is a comprehensive frame and i think that it does achieve something very important which it stabilizes the deficit at three percent of gdp by the middle of the decade and while i totally agree that we need to be on a path that goes beyond that and i wish we were on a path where we could together talk about balance until we stop adding to the national debt we can't talk about getting to balance and this budget would get you there we won't agree on all the details and i know that some of the actions that have been taken in this house do cut spending i haven't seen the actions yet that reduce the deficit and i look forward to that i know that it's the beginning of the process and and we will work together when we see your proposals well we all understand that you are not going to get to balance by simply cutting spending but spending is a portion of how you get there you also have to look at the entitlement programs with this budget totally left out in terms of reform the entitlement programs and everyone i think the american people understand that we have to address entitlement reform and leadership has to come from the white house to do that quite frankly congressman we agree that we need to reduce spending i think if you look in this budget this is possibly the toughest budget certainly a democratic president has ever put forward cutting things that are very very important priorities things that many of us have worked for decades because we believe in to grow we've said we've got to tighten our belt we've got to do what every american family does and make the tough choices so i think there are real tough choices in this budget i don't think it's fair to say that we haven't dealt with entitlements we certainly haven't dealt completely with entitlements but 62 billion dollars of savings to pay for medicare in the next two years is something it's real it's a first step it's a down payment i think that if we're going to work together on entitlements we also have to acknowledge that social security is not driving the deficit between now and 2021. you know i worked on social security reform for well 1983 i was working on the reform bill so i i deeply deeply believe that we have an obligation to current workers to future retirees to current retirees to have a system that's sound and reliable for decades and decades to come but it's not contributing to the short-term deficit we should do it because it's the right thing to do right appreciate it thank you

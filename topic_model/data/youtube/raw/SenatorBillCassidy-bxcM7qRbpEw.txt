welcome back shrinking Social Security we have only a decade left until the federal funds run dry and social security goes in solvent Senator Bill Cassidy is working on a bill to overhaul the program that reportedly includes raising the retirement age from 67 to 70. the senator joins us right now Senator it's great to see you this weekend thanks so much for being here thank you Maria thank you for being interested in Social our plan isn't final so raising the age is not necessarily part of it might be might not be but we're choosing to fix Social Security so that people who are on it now don't get a 24 cut President Biden's chosen to ignore it which means under current law people will get a 24 cut in what they're getting from Social Security when the program goes in solvent nine years he chooses to do nothing we're choosing to save it well I think that's very well said and I think you are right about President Biden saying that uh not not saying anything about about this look we know that Social Security is going insolvent within a decade the committee for a responsible budget has been raising the red flag on theirs but the president keeps saying that it's Republicans who want to take away American Social Security I assume he's referring to things like this your plan to try to keep it solvent what are the Alternatives other than raising the the age what are you looking at in terms of alternatives to that if that's not part of it under current law when the program goes insolvent those folk turn currently like right now depending on social we'll get a 24 cut or we raise taxes 27 percent are if we try and borrow our way out of it we change the law and borrow a way out of it when we double our national debt so much so that CBO says they can't even model how bad it will be that's what President Biden's choosing we're choosing something different yeah we're going to learn more because he's coming out with his budget in terms of higher taxes are are you expecting that the president feels that can be fixed with just raising taxes uh he thinks that you can just raise taxes on the very wealthy uh basically you cannot do that that is what he says to pretend that he has a plan but he knows it won't work he knows it won't pass and so but he gives him kind of a fig Leaf of a fig Leaf of kind of credibility it's only a fig lead he's choosing to let the program go unsolvent we're choosing to fix it yeah well you're right there's no plan so far to fix Social Security out of the white house so we'll be watching uh the timing on this meanwhile the president is threatening his first ever veto after the house and the Senate struck down his woke ESG investing rule this president in the retirement of 152 million Americans to pursue an ideological agenda you know when you invest your money in retirement you want the best return I'm told like a one percent difference in return over years makes a difference between living your dream and having to continue to work he's willing to sacrifice your dream so that he gets his ideological kind of you know what he wants it's wrong he's using our future to pursue his ideological agenda well I I think you know if if there are investors out there who want to pursue ESG they can do that but haven't we seen records of the performance of ESG related funds underperform uh the market and underperform other areas so with a rule that forces fiduciaries to go and invest in ESG related items you're actually you know you're you're likely underperforming what you could otherwise be investing in absolutely and you know what I find particularly bitter about this think of all those workers working in some industry related to oil natural gas chemicals you name it all the things we need for Modern Life they're putting away their dollars for retirement they're sacrificing living a little less now so they can live better in the future he is using their future plans to punish their current job under his rule that firm you're working for will not have the same access to Capital to expand to grow to keep you in business to keep you in work to make you have a better wage he's using your future punish your present and that's particularly bitter well look everybody needs to live within their means right that that's how you you get through but America is not we're facing debt of 31.5 trillion dollars and the president is still not committing to stopping spending in fact he's asking Congress now for more money because he says he wants to investigate covid fraud another almost two billion dollars so do you expect a compromise at all as you raise the debt ceiling in the coming months I I do expect some way forward but you're making the broader point I think the president thinks as long as since it's on somebody else's watch he's going to be out of office in two or four or six years so as long as it's somebody else's watch he doesn't care if the bill comes due and a social security program that goes and solve it or your retirement's not that that is not as good off and and by the way you're getting less social security or the inflation that he ignites it's somebody else's responsibility in the meantime he gets a sugar high that's wrong it's not what a leader should do we need a different we needed I think we need a different president but we need a different approach from this president all right Senator we'll be watching all of that thanks so much for being here thank you Maria

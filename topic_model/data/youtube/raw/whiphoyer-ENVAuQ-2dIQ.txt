I want to thank mr. Nadler for yielding mr. speaker that's just the way it is since the start of 2017 more than 14,000 340 people have been killed by gun violence in the United States more than any other country on earth that's just the way it is more than 29,000 150 have been wounded more than 680 of those have been children in October 58 people were killed and 515 wounded in Las Vegas in the worst mass shooting in our nation's history but we don't have a bill on the floor to prevent the creation of machine guns which are illegal by bump stocks just five weeks later a gunman entered a church in Sutherland Springs Texas and killed 26 worshippers while wounding 20 the majority's response bring to the floor a bill that makes America less safe more replete with people carrying and concealing weapons in our communities this bill says if you want to carry a concealed weapon in a state that doesn't allow it constitutionally no problem get your concealed carry license in another state that does in other words every state no matter their own judgement talk about states rights no matter their own judgment must be subjected to the policies of the least protective state in the nation instead of addressing the very serious problem of rampant gun violence in a constructive way the Republican majority is bringing to the floor a bill that makes it easier to hide dangerous weapons in public Newtown Aurora Orlando Las Vegas Southerland Springs and community after community after community what will it take for this Congress to act what will it take to face this challenge instead of ignoring it how many more will not live to see the new year or begin it with debilitating injuries they will carry for the rest of their lives how many times will we have a moment of silence and a year of no action defeat this bill it's rational provision of NICs making sure people report does not justify the danger it expands support the rights of states to protect their residents from hidden firearms do not ignore the crisis that confronts our country have a moment of action a moment of legislating more safety not less not simply a few seconds of silence to lament the loss of life whether it be in Las Vegas or Orlando or in our own communities defeat this bill come back and do some positive constructive work that makes America safe again the gentleman from New York reserves the gentleman from Virginia mr. speaker you myself 15 seconds

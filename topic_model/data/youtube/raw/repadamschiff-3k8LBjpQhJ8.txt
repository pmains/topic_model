THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THE REPORT  IS MISLEADING AND THAT THE U.S.  DOES QUOTE NOT PROVIDE  INTELLIGENCE WITH THE INTENT TO  KILL RUSSIAN GENERALS. JOINING ME NOW, HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN, ADAM  SCHIFF. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US THIS  MORNING. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS "NEW YORK  TIMES" REPORT, THE PUSHBACK THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM THE WHITE  HOUSE, IS THIS SIMPLY ABOUT  SEMANTICS, WHEN IT COMES TO THIS INTEL AND HOW IT'S BEING USED? >> I THINK WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS AN EFFORT BY THE ADMINISTRATION NOT TO DO OR SAY THINGS THAT WILL  ESCALATE THE CONFLICT. WE ARE PROVIDING REALTIME  INTELLIGENCE TO UKRAINE TO HELP  IT DEFEND ITSELF. I DON'T THINK THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO GO INTO SPECIFICS ABOUT JUST WHAT KIND OF WHAT  CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT WE WANT TO  MAKE SURE THAT UKRAINE IS  SUCCESSFUL. THEY'VE BEEN INVADED BY THEIR  NEIGHBOR, THEY'RE THE VICTIM OF  WAR CRIMES BY RUSSIAN FORCES,  AND THERE'S A LOT ON THE LINE  FOR UKRAINIANS, MOST OF ALL, BUT ALSO FOR FREEDOM-LOVING PEOPLE  AROUND THE WORLD. WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN  SHORT OF GETTING INTO A SHOOTING WAR OURSELVES WITH RUSSIA, SO I  THINK THAT THERE ARE EFFORTS BY  THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO EXACTLY THAT AND OBSERVE EXACTLY THAT  LINE. >> AS WE HEARD FROM GENERAL  MILLEY, THE PIPES ARE OPEN AT  THIS POINT. WOULD THIS IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE INTELLIGENCE THAT IS BEING GIVEN TO UKRAINE. >> WELL, THE NATURE OF THE FIGHT IN UKRAINE IS CHANGING. THE RUSSIAN FORCES PREVIOUSLY  WERE WIDELY DISPERSED. THEY COULD BE PICKED OFF BY  UKRAINIANS AND AMBUSHED, AS MANY OF THEM WERE. NOW THE RUSSIANS ARE  CONCENTRATING THEIR FORCES IN  THE EAST. A LOT OF THE FIGHTING IS AT LONG RANGE, USING LONG-RANGE  ARTILLERY. SO IT IS CHANGING THE NATURE OF  WHAT WE PROVIDE IN TERMS OF  WEAPONS. WE'RE GIVING THEM LONG-RANGE  WEAPONS LIKE HOW ITZERS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THEM WITH THE  INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY NEED,  BOTH TO DEFEND THEMSELVES  AGAINST RUSSIAN ARTILLERY  ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO MAKE THEIR  OWN ATTACKS ON RUSSIAN FORCES  MORE SUCCESSFUL. SO AS THE WAR CHANGES, THE  NATURE OF OUR SUPPORT CHANGES,  BUT THROUGH IT ALL, WE WANT TO  DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO HELP  UKRAINE SUCCEED. >> IN TERMS OF THOSE NEEDS, YOU  OF COURSE MET WITH PRESIDENT  ZELENSKYY IN KYIV AND SAID THAT  HE BROUGHT UP NEEDS YOU HAD NOT  HEARD BEFORE. WHAT ARE THOSE NEEDS? >> WELL, I CAN'T GO INTO THE ALT OF SPECIFICS, BUT SOME OF THEM  DO RELATE TO THE CHANGING NATURE OF THAT WAR, THAT WAR. SOME OF THEM, IT DIDN'T SURPRISE US THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN. BUT NONETHELESS, AS THE NATURE  OF THE CONFLICT HAS CHANGED, AS  THE NATURE OF THE HUMANITARIAN  DISASTER HAS CHANGED, THE NEEDS  CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. AND A BIG PART OF OUR PURPOSE IN BEING THERE WAS TO HEAR FROM HIM DIRECTLY, WHAT WE CAN DO TO BEST ASSIST. SO THERE WERE NEW ITEMS THAT  CAME OUT OF THE DISCUSSION, BUT  NOT ONES THAT I CAN DISCUSS WITH YOU TODAY. >> SO YOU CAN'T DISCUSS THE  SPECIFICS, BUT ARE THOSE NEEDS  THAT YOU FEEL THAT THE U.S. CAN  MEET? >> YES. ABSOLUTELY. AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS CERTAINLY PART OF UKRAINE'S PUBLIC LIST OF ASKS, BUT GIVEN THAT THIS FIGHT  HAS MOVED TO A LONG-DISTANCE  KIND OF A FIGHT, I THINK  MULTIPLE ROCKET LAUNCH SYSTEMS  WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, I THINK IN THE EARLY  DAYS OF THE WAR, THERE WAS A  CONCERN THAT WE COULDN'T PROVIDE UKRAINIANS WITH ANYTHING THAT IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO TRAIN THEM  ON. BUT AS THE WAR HAS DRAGGED ON,  IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE MORE TIME  TO TRAIN UKRAINIANS ON MORE  SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS AND I  THINK WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM. SIMILARLY, REOPENING THE PART OF ODESA IS IMPORTANT TO  UKRAINIANS, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT  TO PEOPLE STARVING ALL OVER THE  WORLD, BECAUSE UKRAINE IS SUCH  AN IMPORTANT BREAD BASKET FOR  THE WORLD. SO HELPING THEM WITH THE  MUNITIONS THAT THEY NEED TO SINK THE BLACK SEA FLEET, WHICH  THEY'VE SHOWN VERY CAPABLE OF  DOING, BUT COULD BE MORE CAPABLE OF DOING IF WE PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RIGHT TOOLS. >> I WANT TO MOVE ON, BECAUSE  THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER  TOPICS THAT WE IMMEDIATE TO HIT. YOU, OF COURSE, SERVE ON THE  HOUSE COMMITTEE, WHICH IS  INVESTIGATING JANUARY 6th. DONALD TRUMP JR. MET WITH Y'ALL  YESTERDAY. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE  ME SPECIFICS ON WHAT WAS  DISCUSSED. WE'VE BOTH BEEN DOING THIS LONG  ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT, BUT  ACCORDING TO OUR OWN CNN  REPORTING, HE WAS THERE FOR A  LITTLE OVER THREE HOURS,  ANSWERED ALL QUESTIONS, DID NOT  TAKE THE FIFTH, WAS CORDIAL. HE'S NOW THE THIRD FAMILY  MEMBER, RIGHT, TO MEET WITH THE  COMMITTEE. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HIS LEVEL OF COOPERATION AND EVEN HIS  WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK WITH THE  COMMITTEE? >> YOU KNOW, I'M AFRAID I CAN'T  DO THAT. WE DON'T REALLY CONFIRM WHO  APPEARS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. WE ARE GETTING A GREAT NUMBER OF WITNESSES, MANY OF WHOM  SURPRISED ME WITH THEIR  WILLINGNESS TO COME IN. SO I THINK THE BODY OF  INFORMATION WE ARE ACCUMULATING  CONTINUES TO GROW AND GROW. BUT WE'RE REALLY NOT COMMENTING  OR CONFIRMING. IT'S REALLY UP TO WITNESSES  WHETHER THEY WANT TO DISCUSS ANY TESTIMONY OR COOPERATION WITH  THE COMMITTEE. >> AS WE LOOK AT WHERE THINGS  STAND, THERE IS NOW MORE AUDIO  OF REPUBLICAN LEADER KEVIN  McCARTHY. OF COURSE, THIS COMES FROM  JANUARY 8th, TALKING TO SOME  SOPTOP AIDES. I WANT TO PLAY THAT QUICKLY. >> WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID WAS  ATROCIOUS AND TOTALLY WRONG. I DO THINK THE IMPEACHMENT  DIVIDES THE NATION FURTHER AND  CONTINUES TO DIVIDE THINGS  GREATER. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO REACH OUT  TO BIDEN. I WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO MEET  WITH BIDEN. BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I WANT TO SEE ABOUT US MEETING  WITH BIDEN, SITTING DOWN, MAKE  ATE SMOOTH TRANSITION TO SHOW  THAT AND CONTINUE TO KEEP THOSE  STATEMENTS GOING. SO HOPEFULLY, I KNOW HE'S GOT TO TALK TO PELOSI THEN HE'S GOING  TO HOPEFULLY HE CALLS ME TODAY. >> WE'VE HEARD CONSISTENT  COMMENTS FROM BEHIND CLOSED  DOORS FROM KEVIN McCARTHY. THE REALITY IS THAT TODAY IN  2022, HE SUPPORTS DONALD TRUMP. TRUMP HAS SAID THIS IS BASICALLY WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE, ALL IS  GOOD. WHAT DOES THIS AUDIO COMING OUT  NOW CHANGE? DOES THIS HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE'S  INVESTIGATION? >> IT CERTAINLY HAS AN IMPACT ON OUR INVESTIGATION. IT HELPS TO FLESH OUT WHAT KEVIN McCARTHY WAS DOING AND WHAT HE  WAS SAYING, BECAUSE HE HAS LIED  SO OFTEN SINCE THEN ABOUT WHAT  HE WAS DOING IN THOSE DAYS AND  HOURS. AND TRAGICALLY, I THINK IT  UNDERSCORES FOR THE WHOLE  COUNTRY THAT IF YOU ARE WILLING  TO TELL THE TRUTH, THERE'S NO  PLACE IN REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP  FOR YOU. KEVIN McCARTHY RETAINS HIS  POSITION, BECAUSE HE'S WILLING  TO LIE FOR DONALD TRUMP. AND DENY ALL OF THOSE  CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU JUST  PLAYED. SOME OF WHICH YOU JUST PLAYED. BUT OTHERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO  TELL THE TRUTH, LIKE LIZ CHENEY, THEY'RE FORCED OUT OF REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP. TO ME, THAT'S THE REAL SCANDAL. NOT McYATER'S LIES OR HIS LIES  ABOUT HIS LIES, BUT RATHER, THAT THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THE TRUTH  AT THE TOP OF REPUBLICAN  LEADERSHIP. >> REAL QUICKLY BEFORE I LET YOU GO, THE WHITE HOUSE -- KAITLYN COLLINS ASKED ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY. SHE DIDN'T HAVE SPECIFICS BUT  THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS BEING  OVERTURNED SHOULDN'T COME AS A  SURPRISE AT THIS POINT. ESPECIALLY WITH THE RULING IN  THE MISSISSIPPI CASE BEING  IMMINENT. IS THE WHITE HOUSE PREPARED FOR  THIS MOMENT? >> I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANY OF  US WERE REALLY PREPARED FOR  THIS. IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN A SPECTER  HUNTING THE COUNTRY FOR DECADES. DURING THIS ERA WE'RE SHOCKED ON THE ONE HAND AND NOT SURPRISED  ON THE OTHER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE UP  AND TRY TO PASS LEGISLATION IN  CONGRESS TO MAKE ROE THE LAW OF  THE LAND. I HAVE TO HOPE THAT MAYBE SOME  OF THE SENATORS WHO ACCEPTED AT  FACE VALUE THOUGH THEY SHOULDN'T THE FALSE REPRESENTATIONS OF  THESE JUDICIAL NOMINEES THAT  THEY WOULD UPHOLD PRECEDENT AND  RESPECTED PRECEDENT,  PARTICULARLY IN THIS AREA, WHEN  THAT WAS PROVEN TO BE SO  DEMONSTRABY FALSE, THAT THEY'LL SUPPORT A STATUTE TO PROTECT ROE AND NOT ALLOW THE FILIBUSTER TO  STAND IN THE WAY, BUT TIME WILL  TELL. AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD GO  BEYOND, FRANKLY, IN MY VIEW, AND EXPAND THE SIZE OF THE COURT,  GIVEN THE WAY McCONNELL HAS  GAINED THE SYSTEM TO ADD TWO  SOCIALLY CONSERVAT

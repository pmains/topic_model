hi this Catherine Cortes Masto representing Nevada and I am here with some of my great friends to talk to you about public lands and the meet in the fact that we need to protect and preserve our public lands so senator Heinrich and Senator Harris are here with me and I just want to have conversation with you talk to me about your your monuments your national monuments in your state well what if our monuments is just our beautiful red glisten sequoia trees and and we have dedicated rightly public land so that any California man anyone in our country can go and to see the beauty of who we are as a country in terms of our natural Monument and I just think it's so critical that we remember is that an economic driver for California I know California is always looking for tourism that's a great point yeah absolutely New Mexico has a long history with our National Monument the person who actually drafted the antiquities Act for the congressman who introduced it was from New Mexico so we have monuments going back to white Dan at the early part of the 20th century and then our new ones are Rio Grande del Norte and organ mountains-desert Peaks both of which are under review not right now by the Trump administration right and that's why we're here talking to you in Nevada we have a gold views in basin and range and like Martin said it is an outdoor economic boom for for our recreation in the state of Nevada one hundred forty eight thousand jobs alone by outdoor recreation fifteen billion dollars generates our economy and so we're asking you to get engaged we need your voices right now the administration has opened up public comment to hear from the public on whether or not we should protect our National Monument we think we should so we're asking you to reach out and go to the view let's go what is it regular I gotta lie the temp that's right okay and tell your friends so a lot of the rhetoric we've heard has been that these these monuments sort of happened from Washington DC and were imposed on people and other places in New Mexico that couldn't be more further from the case these were campaigns that were driven local communities County Commission mayor's city councilors local community groups and in fact we just had the biggest turnout one of the county commissioners told me in in their history to reaffirm the support of the County Commission in Dona Ana County for organ mountains-desert Peaks and say we want to keep our Monument like it is what's it been like in California into that same thing and outside with an emphasis also on how much our teachers love mine because it's one of the best things to take students and kids out at field trips and let them enjoy the natural beauty of our land so I got a brag about something and suggest something to you we are Girl Scouts in New Mexico have made Girl Scout patches the first monument patches was for organ mountains-desert Peaks and now that is spreading around the country but don't forget when we talk about outdoor recreation we also talked about hunters right yes right so the hunters in my say all supporter National Monument and there no reason to protect our public lands we don't want them to be in private hands which takes away the opportunity for all of us to share enjoy real public land I've actually had a chance to to hunt in the organ mountains-desert Peaks national monument for javelina when you don't exist in many states but though we liked him in New Mexico I knew you know that I knew you know that Marty barbecue so thank you thanks for joining us and we please don't forget to make you saw earlier that's right thank you

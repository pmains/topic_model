well i want to see what we're what we're looking at here oh this is this is alaska statewide in alaska so we're we're here today to talk about um what everybody's talking about and that is record high gas prices and whether you're here in washington dc or whether you are up north in alaska everyone everyone is seeing the impact for nine days now we have seen the national average of our gas prices above the highest ever levels if that doesn't get folks attention i'm not quite sure what will i come from a state where yeah we're an energy producer we recognize that but yet we pay some of the highest energy costs in in the country and right now our gas prices are the sixth highest in the country statewide regular gas has increased by more than 50 percent over last year it's actually been 52 percent as of yesterday alaska's at statewide average was five dollars a gallon this is the highest ever average in our state and again we're used to somewhat high prices but when it's on average over five dollars in places like anchorage and fairbanks think about what that means to our rural rural communities over 80 percent of our communities are not connected by road so fuel comes in by barge fuel comes in by air in fort yukon up the uh yukon river gas is uh seven dollars and 25 cents a gallon up in no tack just above the arctic circle it's a stunning 11 a gallon and so think about what that means it's not just what you're paying when you fill up your your your car it's everything else that is associated with it if you're a fisherman in cordova alaska we had a we had a conversation with a fisherman who said that last year at this time he fueled up his boat paid 2500 to fuel up his vessel to go out and uh and fish for black cod this year same time one year later he paid exactly double he paid five thousand dollars to fuel his vessel in the meantime the costs for food and for his crew have gone up by 10 percent and the cost for insurance has gone up by 30 percent what hasn't gone up is the prices that he's paid for his black cod so you look at this and this is absolutely unsustainable it's so it's it's not just the price that you're paying at the pump is what you're paying to keep your homes warm in no attack where again you've got pretty high oil prices think about what that means for your home heating fuel twelve hundred dollars a month how how is any of this sustainable how can you have sustainable communities so we're we're now at uh at a very exciting time in our in our in our state's calendar it's spring spring brings the uh a break up along the river system and the ice goes out in the sound but it's equally exciting because that's when the barges come so you haven't had fuel for since since the fall so think about what that means to these communities whether you're for yukon at seven dollars and 25 cents a gallon or no attack at 11 a gallon and you're now locked into a spring fuel barge delivery where they're anticipating that the increases will be a dollar fifty but not just a dollar fifty that you're you're transitioning into but you flip the switch on that now these are the everyday realities that people are facing so you can't afford to to fuel your boat to go fishing you can't afford to put fuel into a snow machine or a four-wheeler to go hunting so this is real this is real now you're gonna hear my colleagues talk a lot about the prices in their state which are impacting the people that they represent but alaskans are saying all right we're dealing with this right now what are you doing in washington dc to to address all of this they want to know what's the plan here right now we've got an administration whose plan is to blame anybody but them and their policies they're quick to blame it all on putin yes there is a war yes we recognize that but this these price increases started long before putin crossed into ukraine this is this is not something where you can just blame big oil and go after price gouging this is not this is not something where you can attack others when it is failed policies that this administration has put in place it it really comes down to basic supply and demand and we know that supply matters and domestic supply matters if we're not learning anything from from ukraine and russia and what we're seeing in eastern europe domestic supply matters so the biden administration needs to reverse its anti-supply actions it needs to take its bad ideas off the table it needs to restart our development programs it needs to start approving crucial projects that deliver greater supply it's a pretty simple choice here we can pick alaska over iran we can pick wyoming over venezuela so it's pretty easy here my colleagues are going to have a great deal more to say about this so i will turn to the senator from wyoming the ranking member of the energy and natural resources committee who's been leading on these issues for a long time senator braso thanks lisa so today for the ninth day in a row energy prices in america the price at the pump has hit an all-time high four dollars and 56 cents a gallon there's the comparison today than the day when joe biden took office when it was 2.38 cents a gallon there's not a single state in the country where gas is under four dollars a gallon today and in wyoming where people drive the most miles per capita than any other state in the country people are feeling it particularly hard and joe biden seems to be willing and committed to keeping the cost of energy high for the american people for the foreseeable future otherwise why does he continue to choke and strangle energy production in america just last week he canceled three major lease sales for exploration for oil and gas in the united states just canceled him you know he can't have it both ways one day one day last week he said it was putin's price hike and the very next day he canceled these lease sales the american people see through this they understand this joe biden has lost all credibility in terms of his ability to deal with inflation the cost of energy and the american people have lost all confidence in this president to relieve the pain at the pump when people drive by a gas station a convenience store and they see the price right up there on the sign and you see prices like that people wince because they know for sure that that means they're going to have less money left over for food for clothing or to do things with their kids and what's the president decided to do well he's come up with a gimmick to release a million barrels a day of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve it's done nothing to relieve the pain at the pump but it has made us more vulnerable i mean that energy is there in case of a true emergency and it may not be there with the way he's kind continuing to release a million barrels a day all the way up until election day the american people know we have the energy in the ground and joe biden will not let us get it out and why won't he let it get out well because he is so beholden to the climate extremists that's the altar at which he worships so it is no surprise that the american people think we are going to pay high prices for a long long time to come and it's a reason that three out of four americans today today say our country is headed in the wrong direction [Music] um someone showed me a uh a facebook post yesterday and the poster commented my my neighbor is so excited he just filled up his gas tank for 28 bucks the bad news is it was his lawnmower and and i think that kind of reflects the sentiments in america today um not just in not not not just gasoline prices but inflation and it is a serious problem for for lower middle income and poor americans for upper middle income and higher americans this inflation led by gasoline prices may may cause them to have to choose between amazon prime and netflix but for less fortunate americans it's a choice between filling up their car paying their rent buying the food it's no mystery why we're having this inflation and gasoline when you're when your demand remains constant or it increases and your supply shrinks you're going to see price increases every single time why is supply shrinking well i think the main reason there are other reasons but i think the main reason has to do with president biden's energy policy we know now after 14 months that president biden's energy policy is wind solar and wistful thinking the american economy is the most powerful economy in all of human history it can't run without energy eighty percent of our energy comes from fossil fuels some day that will be lower but that day is not here and gasoline markets and oil markets are like every other market they don't just the price does not just reflect the current situation markets are forward-looking the price of gasoline today and the price of the oil and natural gas also reflects what people who produce the product and who buy the product think about the future and there's no question there's no question that they look ahead under the body administration and and see that they expect the biden administration to continue to do every thing it can to uh to bankrupt the oil and gas industry and i know that by the administration will respond by saying oh kennedy we're producing more oil today and natural gas in america than we ever have but once again these markets are not just today looking at today they are uh they're they're they're forward-looking and and that's just basic uh basic economics 101. i'll give you one example quickly the president says i'm not against oil and gas all you have to do is look at his proposed new rules for the national environmental policy act the proposed rules for nepa take a good look at a pipeline because you won't see another one in america if these rural rules pass you and you you you can't produce certainly natural gas without pipelines so thank you for being here yeah iowa is a very rural state and many of the folks that live in our small town communities do have to commute they have to commute to get to their jobs and the cost of fuel today is really putting a strain on those individuals that are just trying to get out there and and do their jobs we have seen this all across the united states but in in iowa in particular we hit an all-time high this past week the highest fuel has ever been in history in the state of iowa and our diesel fuel is even worse so when you look at four and a half dollars or so for gasoline we have diesel now that's over five dollars a gallon and this is the spring planting season in iowa and our equipment runs on diesel and so when you look at the cost of the inputs that our farmers have a lot of that falls on the fertilizer shortage a heck a lot of it falls on the fuel prices you know and then it is driving up every part of our economy we rely on transportation to get goods from point a to point b and the fuel costs are wrapped up in those goods with inflation the fuel costs all of our families are paying fifty two hundred dollars more this year for the same goods and services that they paid for last year uh it's really hard on uh folks across iowa this crisis it's it's self-inflicted you've heard my colleagues talk about what we can do as a united states and what the administration should be doing first and foremost let's unleash american energy we have the capabilities we have the skills and we have the resources right here in the united states to be energy independent we shouldn't be subjected to these prices iowans should not be subjected to these prices so i am encouraging the administration to get out there rethink their dependence upon this deranged climate policy really do the right thing for americans put americans to work let's use our own natural resources here so this hurt it's going to keep going and unless president biden decides to do something different and i pray that he does because it is destroying our rural communities well with the highest number of illegal border crossers in history last month we have a 40-year high in inflation we have families that can't get access to baby formula and for the ninth consecutive day in a row we hit the highest gasoline prices in the history of our country to put some context in this we i feel somewhat guilty talking to some of the other states on this because when we were gathering here in the same room a month ago this is a comparison of the pictures that i showed you a month ago this is no reno oklahoman el reno oklahoma you can get gas a month ago for 3.95 as of this week it's four dollars and 34 cents and that's cheap for a lot of other areas of the country and what they're experiencing listen this frustration that we have is this white house does this all the time right now constantly on energy production that their focus is we want more energy we want more energy and then when they ask for permits if they ask for leases if they ask for permission to do seismic tests offshore they say no no no so publicly they're saying one thing and then privately they're saying does producers something very different what does that really look like in real life well the administration as they shut off seismic studies in the gulf of mexico they can say well the leases are out there but you actually can't go drill because you can't do the seismic work so instead the president will go to iowa and will say we're going to increase ethanol production and then the very same week the president steps up and says we're going to release a million barrels of oil a day from the strategic petroleum reserve well mr president you announced that march the 31st and march the 31st when you made the announcement we're gonna release a million barrels of oil a day from the strategic petroleum reserve average price was four dollars and 22 cents now we're hitting record highs well above that listen this constant rolling piece that we see is the constant increase of prices based on the administration saying they don't want more supply but they actually want prices to go down that's not how it works this week we in fact just yesterday we had a hearing with some of the folks from canada and some of the energy producers from canada and some of the canadian government officials and they were astounded that just months ago president biden announced that we need to get more oil into the united states and so he went to russia and to opec and encourage them to produce more oil when the canadians were saying we have ready oil available right next door but for whatever reason the administration doesn't want canadian oil and is discouraging the production of american oil all the while saying i wish the prices would go down the same time we've got investors doing this esg like blackrock and others that are actually trying to cut off access to capital for oil and gas companies that need access to capital to actually do the drilling in the operation they're making the capital more expensive because of the esg standard that they put out there listen americans feel this this is what real life looks like every single day for oklahomans when they're trying to figure out how i'm going to buy groceries and all the different effects that they're actually feeling when when oklahomans ask me why are prices up so high i can point to this every time because the price of diesel is up that means every single product that we buy that's transported on a diesel truck all just went up in price the price of all shipping went up the price of all ag products just went up because every single tractor fuel price went up skyrocketed so we're feeling the effects on every single area of the economy because president biden is unwilling to deal with the base of our economy that's energy prices so the average price of a gallon of gasoline across country now four dollars and 56 cents a gallon it just keeps going up how much higher is it going to go there isn't a single state in the country now where gasoline is less than four dollars a gallon and if you want to buy diesel add another dollar on top for a gallon of diesel so north dakota my state is a big energy producing state but we're also a big ag state now think about what those prices mean for our farmers who are now just now getting out in the field not only the fuel the gasoline the diesel that they need to run uh their tractors or other equipment but fertilizer think of what that look at what that's done because fertilizer is very energy intensive right okay so not only is there fuel much higher now their fertilizer if they can even get it that's much higher too that puts a huge burden on the people that produce our food supply every single day and oh that's not just a burden on our farmers and ranchers what does that translate into well our farmers and ranchers produce the highest quality lowest cost food supply in the world that every single american benefits from every single day but when they have those increased energy costs caused by the administration's energy policies that affects every single american every single day because it's in the food supply right so when you look at inflation a huge component of inflation across the board in every product is that energy cost and it's because the bite administration has put the handcuffs on our energy producers whether it's restricting things like keystone xl pipeline or restricting our ability to build gas gathering systems so we don't have to flare natural gas right instead we can get it to market whether it's putting a moratorium on federal lands on shore and offshore and oh by the way then he says well we're going to reverse that but he only opens up 20 percent but he raises the royalty rate and then he stops actual leases he just stopped at least in alaska he just stopped leasing in the gulf of mexico so that moratorium continues but then the administration says well no just produce the leases you have well the problem there is they're holding up the permits and the ability to produce those leases because of the blizzard of regulations and in the courts so those leases then can't be produced either so it's the regulatory burden they put out there as well and then it not only affects us in terms of our economy it's a national security issue our inability to permit lng facilities means we can't get natural gas to our allies in europe and western europe and so that what that makes them dependent on russia at the very time that we're working to fight against to support ukraine in their fight against russian aggression so it's not only an economic imperative that affects every american every day it's a national security imperative we need a change in this energy policy we need a change in this energy policy right now for all those reasons and more and that's why it's incumbent on all of us and people across this country to stand up and say all right biden administration enough of this enough of this quit telling us that you're trying to help us with this inflation problem when you continue to restrict our ability to produce energy in this country well thank you all for being here and i think that you can hear the frustrations in everybody's voices and also i think we've done an excellent job of framing the issue and we don't have to do it too much because it gets framed to us every weekend i come from west virginia we drive everywhere we drive to school we drive to work we drive to the grocery store we drive to church we drive to see our families we drive to see our friends i mean we are rural america where cars are the only way to get to the places that you need to be and so i think what what people want to hear is i get it that you understand that gas has gone up in west virginia today i think it was 400 4.34 cents uh it's now nationally 4.56 up they want to see somebody take responsibility and the president is the one who said when he was first elected i'll take responsibility instead of blaming others and honestly all he's done in this instance something that hits everybody every day in their pocketbook is blame everybody else he blames vladimir putin he blames covet he blames even american businesses and uh if you just even look and try to deflect his his reasoning on who he blames you can see that the prices were escalating well before vladimir putin ever invaded ukraine they've been escalating for a year before we even heard him talk about it with any kind of meaningful uh discussion so you know we have these high uh gas prices we know that uh the solutions are there and we've heard uh folks talk about it i know lisa on the on the energy committee has worked hard on unleashing uh the american entrepreneurship and the american energy certainly i come from an energy state as well that can be a contributor to help bring america back to that energy security and those in the and the security of families knowing what their obligations are going to be when they fill up their car so i was actually uh in my driveway and i was going to take a walk and this a guy in a truck is driving by stops this true story his name's craig and he he tells me that he has to fill his truck up every day and it costs him a hundred and forty dollars to fill his truck up every single day it's diesel i said well what was it before what was it before all these prices went up sixty dollars so it's basically almost two and a half times now for him to fill up and it's gone up probably even more since we had the conversation over the last weekend so it's time for the president to take responsibility that's actually going to result in pulling together and lowering these gas prices so i would say we have heard from west virginians i know you all are hearing from people on on your uh websites uh i just brought a few with me i went past a gas station today in huntington gas is now 425 so this is obviously a little probably dated to last week a gallon food is going up utilities are going up i'm a senior and i'm barely making it senior citizen huntington west virginia quote this is a father and a husband in wellsburg which is the very tippy top of our state i fear before summer i will literally be choosing which to pay fuel for my vehicle or food or food for the table for myself my wife and my two small children and then lastly a woman in fayetteville which is right near our new national park i would encourage you to visit says with the increase in gas and diesel everything else increases it doesn't seem that anyone in washington cares so i would ask the president to take responsibility and and make sure that our our friend in fayetteville west virginia knows that we care and work on this very very deep and expensive gas crisis that we're seeing in front of our american public thank you thanks lisa harry truman famously had on his desk a plaque that said the buck stops here joe biden seems to have replaced that plaque with instead the phrase the buck stops with putin because nothing is joe biden's fault well i'll tell you what the little stickers on gas pumps all across the country illustrate the american people know exactly whose fault this is this was deliberate this isn't an accident this isn't an unintended side effect this is exactly what joe biden promised he would do and it's what he's done if you look at when biden was sworn in gas nationally was two dollars and nine cents a gallon on that first day what does biden do he cancels the keystone pipeline boom day one what does he do after that january 27th a week later he halts all new oil and gas leases on federal land both onshore and offshore federal land onshore and offshore comprises roughly 25 percent of u.s oil and gas production next february 19th he rejoins the parrot's climate agreement notice what's happening to the price next may 7 2021 biden takes 30 percent of land off-limits to oil and gas price keeps going up june 1st he halts drilling in anwar the incredibly petroleum-rich section of alaska with vast reserves very small portion of alaska he shuts it down price keeps going up june 30th congress reverses the trump natural gas regulations october 7th biden reverses the trump nepa regulations october 29th interior begins the quote social cost of carbon designed again to drive gas prices up november 15 a moratorium and oil drilling in the chaco canyon and then february 24th russia invade ukraine by the way biden is trying to blame putin for the increase and listen putin bears some responsibility for that increase but he doesn't bear responsibility for all of this all of this happened before putin invaded ukraine march 21st march 1st rather biden releases oil from the strategic petroleum reserve march 21st the sec proposes an anti-oil rule let's shut off equity by the way you combine that with the banking regulators that biden put forth who are trying to shut off debt so if you have no equity for drilling oil and gas and you have no debt for drilling oil and gas you know what that means you have no money for drilling oil and gas and what happens is the price keeps going up and up and up and then may 12th biden cancels the remaining lease sales this is decision after decision after decision designed to cause the price to go from two dollars to nine cents to 4.40 cents a gallon on average just yesterday i led a letter with 19 of my senate colleagues to biden's secretary of commerce asking her to stop slow walking permits for oil and gas exploration in the gulf of mexico gulf of mexico has massive reserves at its peak produced roughly 2 million barrels a day and yet the biden administration is slow walking permits at every stage this is deliberate it's not an accident it's the radical green new deal politics because joe biden believes if gas is five dollars a gallon or six dollars a gallon or ten dollars a gallon that if he imposes enough pain on working men and women if he has enough moms that have to spend a hundred bucks to fill their minivan if he has enough guys that are spending 150 bucks to fill their truck that eventually everyone will have this this this epiphany and get rid of that truck or get rid of that minivan and everyone will go buy an electric car and he's willing to make the american people suffer because of his political agenda this is wrong it's cynical it's abusive it's cruel it's hurting the most vulnerable in our country and it's all deliberate [Applause] thank you as i go around arkansas the number one thing that i hear is inflation this is why it's not magic this is why president biden in the latest polling is at 38 percent if you poll him on hand how he's handling inflation it's much much much lower than that it's not just about gasoline certainly if you take 20 30 we're all two-way junior families or individuals but you take 20 30 out of each one's pocket each week at least you wind up with people just not having any disposable income left so it's a huge problem in that regard but it's not just gasoline people have the ability to somewhat back off on that in arkansas we do a tremendous amount of driving like shelly was talking about in west virginia so maybe you don't drive quite as much diesel is two dollars a gallon more expensive than it was a year ago there's no way to get out from underneath that every product my suit this dice everything in this room was either trucked in or railed in or whatever and so as a result those those prices aren't going to go down they're feeding the fuel and so again it's not just the cost of gasoline in your tank it's your food which depends on fertilizer depending on natural gas it is uh your electricity which is probably 50 or 60 dollars more higher this month than it was a year ago the list goes on and on i'm particularly worried about the northeast with heating oil there'll be people that are colder this winter simply because we're going to have a significant increase nobody's talking about this but come winter time we'll have a significant increase compared to what we have now so these are serious things that we need to consider rarely do you have a problem that the answer is staring you in the face and that's really what we've been talking about the reality is is a good part of that we really do need to consider uh making it much easier to lease to go forward with oil expo exploration and then again allow the pipelines that deliver that oil in a very environmentally sensitive way to be built and used what we don't need is talking to venezuela talking to iran where certainly sending those dollars to those countries from the wealth of the united states makes no sense at all but also if you really are concerned about the environment there's no way that the venezuelans that the iranians are going to produce it in the environmentally sensitive way that we do in the united states and i too thank you for being here and i wish that i could say that canceling these latest oil leases came as a surprise but it is no surprise at all the day joe biden put his hand on the bible and he was sworn in as president of the united states he began this to destroy american energy and it's just par for the course that he continues this war on american energy it's also par for the course for them to blame everybody except the white house and the president they blame democrats they blame i mean they blame republicans they blame putin they blame all companies but americans that has been said here before at this podium they know better you know as senator kennedy said this is just the basic fundamentals of economics a ninth grader can figure this out and so many of us has we've introduced legislation with real solutions that to address this it's fallen on deaf ears so it is purposely done and the biden administration and the democrats need to take this crisis seriously and stop finding every excuse in the book to shrink energy production and until this happens every family and business in mississippi and around this country will continue to pay the price of biden's failed energy policies thank you we've had 45 minutes of this and i think you've gotten a sense of the impacts across the country on on everyday american families whether they are from alaska or arkansas or places in between so maybe just two really quick questions please go ahead let's say the president did absolutely everything that you're calling for exactly how long weeks months exactly how long would it take for prices to go down at gas stations and americans well i i have suggested and i think senator cruz did as well that when the signal is sent that this administration recognizes that domestic production our own energy is an asset and not a liability that then sends a signal to the markets that can be real that can be immediate and can be transformative that sends a signal to investors that have been holding back that sends a signal to those who have said and i just don't i don't think that it's going to be cost economic to go forward with this particular lease because every indication that we're getting from this administration is as soon as i take step one they're going to shut me down so that can be immediate that signal can make a difference and all it would take is president biden to stand in front of a microphone and say given what is happening in this country the unprecedented place that we are at today the impact on everyday americans i've got an obligation to say americans are going to come first and american energy production is going to come first he could do that today go ahead um what about the dynamic we hear from independent market analysts at the biggest most primary uh factor and holding back domestic production is this investor sentiment saying you know things are pretty good it's pretty good to be in the oil business in texas right now in terms of profits coming in with these high prices and they don't want to hear about capital expenditures that's simply not accurate i talked to oil and gas producers in the state of texas every week sometimes every day today i was visiting with the ceo of a major pipeline construction company based in texas they said in the last year and a half their revenue from pipeline construction has dropped two-thirds dropped from 900 million to 300 million and the reason is simple they said you can't get a damn permit you can't build a pipeline and so and by the way they also build uh solar panels they said they can't get those built either the amazing thing is this administration their policies are hammering the energy industry i was out in in uh midland odessa the permian basin incredibly rich petroleum reserves able to power america's needs the folks there they want a drill they can't get capital because this administration has succeeded in drying up capital where the banks the big banks in wall street this administration has pressured them and they're out of the business of loaning for new production you can't drill if you don't have the capital to drill just yesterday i and other members of the foreign relations committee had had coffee with the prime minister of greece we talked about the war in ukraine i asked what can we do to stop putin what would be effective he said america needs to produce more oil and gas and we need to buy more oil and gas from you guys it ain't complicated but this is delivered and by the way biden told you he would do this on the campaign trail he promised if i'm elected i will shut down drilling i'll end it and so everyone in the corporate press that says well gosh this is other factors you know my favorite talking point from the white house that they say from the podium is this is just greedy oil companies you know what fine oil companies are greedy you know what they were greedy when it was two dollars and nine cents too under that theory a year and a half ago oil companies didn't want to make money and suddenly they do it's absurd this is what biden promised he would do and it may be the only campaign promise he made that he's actually delivered on and there's a cynicism number one they think the american people are stupid that they don't understand this is deliberate but number two they're willing to say they don't like the choices you make some of you may drive a pickup truck some of you may drive a suburban and this white house says we don't like your choices so we're going to make it hard for you to pay your bills we're going to make it hard for you to feed your family we're going to make it hard for you to pay your rent because if it's so hard you'll suddenly wake up and say i need to buy me a 100 000 electric car with a battery made in china and you know what that's not joe biden's decision to make the american people ought to make a decision about their own families and this is cruel and it's deliberate thank you all thanks matt thank you guys i know that it's a little long thank you guys for pushing through with us

what a great day for america the decision finally came out it is official roe v wade is not the law of the land for the entire country of the united states of america this is a victory for those of us who have proudly stood up to protect the unborn i'm excited for the future i'm excited for the future of the children that are going to be saved and be the next leaders in this institution behind me or in the capital that's in front of me and this is a day though that unfortunately our home state of illinois we can't celebrate because the taxpayer funding of abortion in illinois the use of those dollars to kill the unborn is not going to change so let this day be our day we begin to go elect more pro-life republicans in the state of illinois to change our home state thank you god thank you to all who have fought for so long i stand with you side by side this is a great day for america may god continue to bless this great country

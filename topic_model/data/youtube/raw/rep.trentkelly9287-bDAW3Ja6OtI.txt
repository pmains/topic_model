I saw something a few seconds ago and I don't know if you've seen this was a breaking story that Russian Navy has placed its nuclear submarines on a high state of combat Readiness Russia has also moved its strategic bombers to reportedly an air base that's kind of was closer to the ukraine-russia border and also conduct a large-scale nuclear exercise next week when Joe Biden is in Poland any thoughts on this one or any comments no you know uh Russia and Vladimir Putin has continued to use the threat of nuclear war and tactical nukes against Ukraine which just shows he's losing listen he can't afford to lose this fight uh he attacked Ukraine he can't afford to lose it so he's posturing up to listen but you have to take it serious um he is not a rational person and so I don't think anybody can get in the mind of Vladimir Putin to see whether he will or will not use those but it's business just as usual we've had repeated threats throughout the entire almost one year that he met what would Ukraine have used in nuclear weapons and we just know that he does this because that that creates a whole new ball game for the world has your life changed since uh January in the swelling ain't swearing you know I know that uh it's listed as you're a member of the House armed services committee you're serving on as a ranking member of the subcommittee on the intelligence and special operations and also serves on the budget and AG committees and and and for people who don't know this little bit of a trivia you are the when I guess this is still current highest ranking military official currently serving in Congress yeah that's uh that's pretty neat I think that's uh currently serving I think that's in the history of the house I think that we're a couple in the Senate who may have been more but uh in the house that's really amazing but now you know the cool thing is I'm not a ranking member anymore I'm the chairman of the sea power committee and a chairman on one of the uh subcommittees of Defense uh the defense um defense subcommittee on the intelligence committee I'm the chairman so that's a big deal that means that's what I'm saying your life has changed since January uh tremendously so all right now tell me first of all help us out here can you can you tell us what the truth is about these balloons was the first balloon actually a Chinese balloon the second ones were I don't know hobby balloons tell us what you know about this yeah so uh we we know the parts from the Chinese claimed that it was a uh a balloon that uh had just blown up course so the Chinese did kind of claim that real early and uh it was shot down and of course uh we needed to shoot that thing down I can't tell you a whole lot about what we know about that but but I can tell you it needed to be shot down and I can say that Joe Biden allowed it to fly uh and go across the entire United States before he shot it down the others uh I think is probably just a little bit different in nature and have not had a really in-depth briefing on those but as far as the first one you know he should have shot that down much like he does always he always does the right thing about four days after he should have done oh can you can you can you actually say that or you feel confident about it uh Congressman Kelly that he um that he blocked any Transmissions that this was blocked from whatever technology you might have so when they were come when they were making that path over the United States of America they got no information at all are you confident in that or you think that's just something he said well I played God I think anytime you have surveillance stuff looking at things I think it's hard to block them from getting anything of value and I I'll leave that at that I don't have any specifics but you know it's impossible if I'm uh putting binoculars if I'm watching you and you put up a blocking screen but you move outside of that do I pick up anything about you absolutely and so you know did we block everything we needed to block I I can't I can't I can't full confidence say that it was it was really kind of embarrassing to be honest with you because I was watching the press conference the other day and he said this because if you're a fisherman and you you know you use sonars and everything there's a squelch if you ever had a CB radio or some of these radios there's a squelch where you most of us people in Mississippi know that and he basically said that he said the only reason we're seeing more of these is because we turned up the sensitivity which means he moves the squelch up a little bit well that's about as stupid as you can get uh because it was done as you said four or five days afterwards in the first part so we had no idea these balloons were there I think the blues were reported initially by just observers on the ground yeah I think if observers on the ground if a newspaper hasn't broken that seen by just regular individual regular citizens seeing it wondering what it was I don't think we would have ever known I don't think he would have ever reported it even to Congress or anybody else that he had to be there before today let me ask you this question because I asked I've asked this before it didn't get a good answer to it the president is in the Ukraine he'll be going to Poland and he's in the palace over there with zelinski how does that work because Nancy one of did you go over there by the way I have not I have attempted twice in both time my trips have been canceled uh what what he probably went directly in but when we go in generally we go to Poland or somewhere and then go in by ground when we go in yeah but I mean when Nancy Pelosi went over there and we had another delegation go over there there's been several people I think with his Schumer goal or Shea Adam Schiff somebody else went over there but how do you just in a war country that's in a war zone how do you actually have the president to go over there feel safe enough to do that well I mean there's security but there's always risk you know anytime you travel to a war zone uh there's no 100 security and so people just choose to expose themselves back but there's a lot of oversight and things that we need to do to make sure things are being spent the way they're supposed to that weapons are being used the way they are you know and I know a little more than the American public I'll tell you I have a higher level and a higher degree of confidence that they're using the right weapons in the right way and that they are not being abused I think uh we're trying to get DOD and some other folks to declassify some of that stuff so the American people will have a little more confidence in that I think they want it now more than ever because we've already spent 50 billion dollars we have and I can tell you that the folks on the Committees that have jurisdiction have a much greater and even other members of Congress who only Committees of jurisdiction have a lot of Doubt so we're working with DOD to declassify some of that stuff and show just exactly how we are accounting for those things and we know how and where they're being used why isn't there more of a push on our part since we're writing the checks for most of this to ask of the zielinski to see if it can come to the peace table not to cut a deal to give away any of the Ukraine but just to find a way to talk and do and not not that Putin's going to do this because I I think and I think you've said this if Putin doesn't win this he's gone he's gone financially and maybe even physically yeah 100 and it's hard to push people you know Europe's trying to do that push him into these dogs but as far as Ukraine this and uh people forget about the Crimea in 14 2014 they've already invaded and taken Ukrainian space and uh I think short of them I mean if we were in the United States and they had uh well we might let them keep California if they had uh the East Coast uh we uh we would not let them stay here and talk about negotiating peace until we completely expelled them and I think it's hard to do when uh it's the sovereignty of a Nation at stake like you say that but I wonder how much of the border is controlled by MS-13 right now because of Joe Biden so that's another story and and we've got to do something with that absolutely we absolutely our border has not been secure and we just have more and more people come over and more and more dangerous people come over our border illegally what's what's the schedule of hearings right now as far as any hearings that you guys are going to be conducting well we're home this week I'm actually flying out to Seattle to visit some uh some some bases and uh Naval bases out there is my new uh his new committee on chair but uh next week we'll get back and uh there's tons of briefings that we have via phone I don't trust those very much Paul I like to be a person because anything that you can get on open source is not a value uh in most cases yeah yeah well look I I thank you so very very much and I thank you for spending the time with us and and anytime there's something breaking that you can't talk about I know in your position it's rather sensitive but it's always good having you on sir yes sir thanks Paul you have a great morning you got it the uh Congressman uh from the first district Trent Kelly

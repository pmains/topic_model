I am going riding it in the big story this afternoon premium support it could soon be the new Medicare if the latest overhaul plan comes into law it is a bipartisan proposal penned by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden along with House Budget Committee Chair Republican Paul Ryan remember his other attempt to reform Medicare earlier this year it was really ripped apart by the Dems deemed as the death of Medicare as we know it but this is a new attempt and in it seniors would have the option to pick traditional Medicare or use a quote premium support government voucher in which they will be able to buy private insurance through a national exchange remember we don't even have a national exchange because we have a monopoly so the creation of a national exchange alone at least one of consequence and of itself could effectively be a neutralization anyway of Medicare as a campaign talking point in 2012 and quiet some of the political pro-wrestling long enough to actually achieve some meaningful reform like a national health exchange for all of us or at least some of us no wonder the possibility of such things is being dismissed by the White House as radical with us I now for a dr show exclusive the plans co-sponsor and an old teacher and inspiration on this subject US Senator Ron Wyden and Senator it's a pleasure to see it Thank You Dylan we've had lengthy conversations going back years about the idea of matching patients with doctors in a national exchange as they do in your with your staff there and everybody else in the Congress it appears you have a victory here at least in trying to expand that available pool is that correct there's an opportunity here Dylan I think everybody understands you cannot get on top of this health care challenge unless you tackle Medicare it is a huge issue and we need to approach it in a different way one that brings people together constructively here's an opportunity to put side by side traditional Medicare with its marketplace a clout and it's been very popular with progressive folks and then say it should go up head to with those who favor choice and competition and I think the to hold each other accountable what is the greatest barrier I think this way there have been clear barriers to your efforts to do this one of them is the stranglehold of the private insurance monopolies which doesn't want to deal with the competition another is organized labor which has a benefit of very strong negotiating capacity to get health benefits in an employer-based health system and a national exchange where healthcare is pretty much bad for both of those special interests what me and they're both very influential where you work how do you believe you can navigate against them you have just described Dylan what I call the status quo caucus there are a wide array of special interest groups that benefit from doing business as usual that's simply indefensible you look for example just at the failure of the super committee as a result of the failure of the super committee there are going to be additional reductions in Medicare spending so we've got to say this can't be put off any longer I think this is an opportunity to make some basic kinds of changes and when I look at this program there are some obvious kinds of opportunities for example congressman Ryan has agreed to support something I feel very strongly about and that is to cap the catastrophic expenses of senior citizens face under Medicare that's not there today that's an improvement in the program Matt Miller who was a panelist and a guest host on this show wrote of your proposal the following he said referring to the white and Ryan proposal this is the most fascinating policy and political maneuver of the year I don't know what that says about our year that may be an indictment of the year on some level but it certainly is a compliment whether however you want to interpret it was there an aspect of this where you're attempting to show a constructive behavior between people in Washington I mean this just feels like there's more to this than just the health care legislation when that was being very generous of course and I think again there's an opportunity to tackle major kinds of issues and particularly in the healthcare arena for example we ought to smooth the transition to Medicare and one way to do that is to expand choice for employers and employees so what congressman Ryan has agreed to do and it would be for literally millions of workers is bring back something I felt strongly about and that's free choice vouchers let's give employers who want to the opportunity to give their employees funds for their health care will be tax free for the worker a tax write-off for the employer give that worker and employers more choices and give the worker the opportunity to go to these exchanges and get a better deal on their health why do you think the White House is calling it radical well I am NOT certain that all the folks up there have read it and for example one of the things that I was struck by is congressman Ryan and I have agreed to have a more generous a rate of growth for seniors under Medicare than the terms that the president offered during the deficit reduction on negotiations with a speaker Baker Speaker Boehner so my hope is is that as folks over there I get a chance to look at the specifics will begin the opportunity to really see people work got work together and not just to criticize yeah and as you may or may not know but I've good i have a book coming out next month called greedy bastards and let's make sure it's at powell's in Portland and there's another store up in New York you know argued and Dean I'm gonna call try and cut a distribution deal with you but one of the points that I make one of the tools that greedy bastards use is their influence over government to avoid competition it is a great way to make money it's a great use of money to pay a politician to help you preserve a monopoly we watched mccarran-ferguson i believe it was during the last debate come up and getting shot down right now the health insurance Lobby spends I guess last year 376 and a half million dollars the point is what you represent in these sort of real basic American values of hey what would happen if we allowed people to compete and choose which is crazy apparently that's a real threat to the profitability of the health industry do you feel like you have any more push in your in your effort now than you did three years ago when you tried this I do and I think particularly people are looking at approaches like that offered to members of Congress in the federal employee health benefit plan if an insurance company in effect Mouse's around a member of Congress delays on paying a bill doesn't follow through on what they're contractually obligated to do the member of Congress can fire their insurance company they can do what actually goes on in the marketplace they can say this isn't satisfactory I'm firing you and go make another choice if it's good enough for members of Congress it ought to be good enough for the rest of us and that's the kind of approach that I think ought to be available to seniors seniors want to keep traditional Medicare I'm going to fight with all my strength to make sure they can if they want to choose one of these other alternatives they all have that choice as well senator from your mouth to the laws of the land we shall see Thank You solid at you as well Ron Wyden ladies and gentlemen

thank you all very much for being with us and apologies that it's so hectic you can see senators running hither and thither trying to keep up with hearings in the floor I read all of your testimony last night and of course we're lucky to have all of you for individuals with lots of expertise in this area and I I come to really try to zero in on a couple of factual judgments and it really stems from some of the discussions you and I have had dr. jürgen with respect to changes in the energy business and let me ask specifically about the oil futures business when I look at the numbers it seems to me that there has been a dramatic change in the last four years and I want to just see if we can get on the record whether you share that view it looks to me like four years ago the non-commercial traitor the person who's in effect called a speculator these traders held less than half of the futures contracts for crude oil so a number of years ago we were talking about you know people who held these futures they were trucking companies they were airlines these kind of people who weren't you know traders now today according to the chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission these traders now account for eighty-five percent of the crude oil futures market and I read your testimony last night and none of you touched on this factor the changes in the oil futures market so I think the first question I want to get into we just go right down the row do each of you believe that this change in the significant number of traders commercial traders in the oil futures market is significant just yes or no it's now on the row dr. maybe is not allowed I mean that's really well I I actually think it's a legitimate question and one that we're very interested in but it's it's hard you know well you got very short answer we don't even think you're not imposing any gag orders okay well it's good because one of the questions is you know first of all there's a lot of because someone has a title or how they're categorized as an organization you know does not necessarily tell you what the motivation is behind a particular trade is one question the other thing is there's a lot of activity that goes on off the exchanges that are not included in the in the data but I would say you know the general perception I would tend to agree with you that there's a lot more activity very but I just trying to be we're just gonna try to see if we can get some facts on the record then i'm going to ask some questions they'll get into your opinions doc dr. jürgen well it's hard to early for you because you have educated me on the fact there are a lot of changes going on and because you all didn't touch on this one in your testimony I just want to see if you all share my view that this has been a significant chance well I think yes it's been a significant change I don't think based upon our understanding today that it is the driving force that can accentuate things I was thinking that when there was a crisis with Iran in 1979 and 80 there were no futures markets and the price also went up very sharply so that it's it's it's part of the mix and a very visible part I guess Frank it's your graphic so senator part of the reason I think we didn't go in detail in any of our testimony was because at one point I think we anticipated a second panel with the commissioners CFTC commissioners so we're going to leave that kind of to their area of expertise I agree with with what Howard and Dan have said I mean I think there's been a change in the market I don't want to characterize it as as necessarily good or bad there are new players it's part of what we're calling the kind of the new fundamentals which used to be just supply demand and inventory there's a lot more it's a lot more complex market yeah I think the reason it wasn't really highlights and testimony is that were reasonably happy with the supply demand explanations as to where prices are and why they've behaved there's not a big residual left over to be explained by something else so in that sense I don't think that changes makes a difference as to where the prices today I think I'm back on in some way this is a great American business success story the success of the exchanges in deepening the liquidity deepening the involvement for me more liquidity is a good thing these are a small part of sorry a significant part but of a very large global oil market that makes up which has all kinds of other bits on top of it seeing more liquidity come on to regulated exchanges again should actually be seen as a good news I much prefer to see activity taking place somewhere where I can see it so I I don't think it's a problem in terms of increasing prices one further thing on this and just go back on stuff I do think we do need to draw a distinction between activity by institutional investors and hedge funds let me just see if I can get one additional question in Goldman Sachs has produced and analysis suggesting that the speculation premium on crude oil could be 23 dollars a barrel or 56 cents a gallon at the pump the Consumer Federation produced their analysis including speculation as twenty percent to the price at the pump or roughly fifty cents a year ago as we discussed briefly earlier the Exxon Mobil CEO stated that speculation had increased the price of a barrel of oil by twenty dollars now can I just get a yes or no with respect to this question whether you think these analyses because all three of them all three of them agree that there was a speculative premium for a barrel of oil I would just like to know whether the four of you think that all of these analyses are wrong let's just go right down the row and I've taken an extra minute but there they were three separate analyses done by three different organizations with different philosophical roots and all of them concluded that there was a speculation premium and I've just like to know if you think those analyses are wrong let's just go right down the road I mean I would want to read the specific studies first before I commented on them but I think I think a lot of the issue you know sometimes the different assessments of the role of speculation have to do with the standard of proof or burden of proof that's applied you know if you apply and an innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt standard I think my reading of the literature as a whole not just these three studies which I haven't read is that speculation wouldn't be convicted if instead you look the guilt is confirmed unless innocence is demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that some jurisdictions use when considering whether it was honor 8 and release convicted prisoners speculations probably not going to get out of jail anytime soon so you know I mean we think I'm having this discussion it going to take that as a no you think these now I know I said I don't know what what's what's your stand I have a feeling that different people who have this discussion are really applying different standards of proof and that's the issue as much as look as the competition of these different results but that's might be dr. jürgen oil prices natural gasoline prices are both up twenty percent since the UN issued its report about Iran's nuclear program so I would not call it a speculative I'd call it a risk premium or security premium but there is a premium that reflects this increased tension and anxiety in the market and not surprisingly i agree with both Howard and Deanna I mean that I think that there is a premium the market over and above finding and development costs I wouldn't have to read all to speculation and I would like to see what the studies are in the definitions are really important center yeah likewise it's a no for me those studies don't sound those results don't very very plausible I think partly evidence of this is if there was a large spectra premium then prices would then be higher than a market price which should mean that we be seeing large surfaces building up people in the physical market will be asking for discounts because they want to play the proper physical price not the inflated speculative price what we actually see is in the International physical market today in brent people playing large premiums get their deliveries accelerated it's quite the reverse there is no global surplus building up instead we have limited spare capacity we've had eight straight quarters of global inventory drawers we finally have a balanced market at this price so I just think that is it's incorrect to think in terms of spectra premium let's go to Senator Murkowski I just think it's striking gentlemen when all four of you say that organizations from Goldman Sachs to the CEO of mobile or off base we've got to do some more digging on this because I will tell you I don't just operate under the assumption that somebody with a Xerox machine can turn out the study and that ought to be what we make public policy but when you have this cross-section of groups and individuals representing such a wide array of philosophies saying that there's a significant speculation you know premium that's something that has to be addressed by policymakers

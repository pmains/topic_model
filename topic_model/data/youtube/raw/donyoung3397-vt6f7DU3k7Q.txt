you know this is a strange year because we had a new era of no earmarks and a set time where everybody was bit mad at everybody and it's not been good as far as it Congress as a whole but i think my major accomplishment this year other than helping individual Alaskans has been an ability to be can refund the railroad permanently fun the ferry system and get Road money for the Alaska Natives or they can build roads and villages that was a big stroke of business especially in the conference and I really feel good about that but my biggest goal is when I get a letter I try to respond and try to help individuals sometimes I can't do it I tell them I can't do it but my office is a good office and we've been very good at over the years of helping people individually

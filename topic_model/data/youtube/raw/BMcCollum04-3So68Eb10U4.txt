Thank You mr. chair and I too would like to express my concern at itude for a friendship I've had with a classmate mr. Israel who is going to be leaving this committee on leaving Congress to go on to a new chapter in his life and as an author I'm sure there might be many many chapters coming in your life I'd also like to thank every two will be down to one author mr. chair I would also very much share your appreciation and all the work that our staff does together the way in which they work together to make our jobs much easier and as you pointed out there's a lot of work for them coming down the pike here so I would like to thank the staff or what they've done today and what they're going to be doing tomorrow mr. Chairman I would also like to thank you and your staff and working with me and our staff for such a collaborative approach this subcommittee has a very challenging portfolio of issues and i really want to commend the chairs efforts to find solutions in another difficult budget year however the majority's failure to adopt a budget resolution in its piecemeal approach to the subcommittee's 230 B's allocations that you're made our work more difficult more however such a lack of transparency has placed the entire committee at a disadvantage and has pushed us far from what I consider regular order regular order and having our allocations at the beginning of the appropriations process the FY 2017 subcommittee allocation has been pointed out is 64 million dollars less than the fiscal year 2016 enacted level and that means many of the needs of important programs vital to protecting our nation's natural and cultural resources will not be met as a far outpace a stagnant allocation with this constraint top line number it's difficult choices have to be made and sadly important programs vital to protecting our nation's natural and cultural resources did not receive adequate funding most significant programmatic cuts were in the Environmental Protection Agency which is going to receive 164 million dollars less than the FY 2016 enacted level this will cut the impact of the agency's ability to protect human health the health of our environment to ensure clean air and clean water for our families and for our children this year the critical need for the EPA was unmistakably pointed out is our nation watched a tragedy unfold in Flint Michigan where children were poisoned by the lead in their drinking water so I find it difficult to reconcile the cuts recommended in this bill with the public health challenges faced by this country Flint is an accumulation of years of weakening the EPA through budget cuts over reliance on state agencies to manage federal environmental laws and our communities deserve and expect their government to provide clean water and basic public health protections the residents the children of Flint were betrayed by their state government and to this day they still do not have safe drinking water available from the tap in their house or their school the levels provided in this bill for the state revolving funds are inadequate to deal with the decaying infrastructure in our nation no less emergency in Flint so I look to work with the chair with all the members of the house to improve those numbers and that's why it's imperative for this committee to work to find those additional funds Flint is an emergency designation while this bill does not provide funds specifically for Flint I want to thank the chair for the language in the bill that provides additional authority for states to offer debt relief within areas of elevated levels of lead in their drinking water this is a good thing mr. chair but there's still more work that needs to be done I'm very proud of the subcommittee's nonpartisan approach by addressing the issues facing our Native American brothers and sisters and while I'm pleased that this bill burr an increase of 443 million dollars for programs critical to Indian country I would be remiss if I did not point out that even with this increase funding for Native American programs is still 172 million dollars less than the administration's request mr. chair we work together to do our best nonetheless this bill by working together well and keep our commitment to providing Native American students with safe schools that are conductive to full learning and fully funds contract support costs so that tribes are not penalized for exercising their self-determination rights this bill also recommends 3.9 million dollars or twelve percent increase of the subcommittee's allocation for wildland fires but once again the majority has failed to adopt a very common-sense reform bill championed by Chairman Simpsons wildfire disaster fund building and every single member of this subcommittees that co-sponsor that bill so mr. Simpson we stand with you to bring it to the floor but once again the majority has not done that citing committee jurisdiction we don't were not able to do it in here jurisdictional issues aside however did not hinder the majority for including harmful legislative writers and I must express my deep concern and disappointment with the 29 bipartisan writers in this bill its veto babe such provisions that seek to turn back protections for endangered species restrict control of greenhouse gas gas emissions undermine clean water and clean air protections they do not belong in this bill and their effect would be to undermine important environmental laws endanger Public Health and Safety and deny that climate change is having an impact on our planet however I am very happy to say that one of the bright spots in this bill is the continued support for our National Park Service's centennial initiative the bill recommends an additional eight hundred million dollars for the centennial these funds will be used to strengthen the foundation of services and make an essential infrastructure investments I'm also pleased that there's an additional three million dollars provided for the civil rights initiative grant program fundings included in grants and needs to historical black colleges and universities finally I would like to thank the chairman for working to resurrect save America's treasures program this program fund preservation and national significant sites structures and artifacts I am proud that we were able to restart this important program and I will work diligently to make sure that's included in the final bill I look forward to working together with you mr. chair and all the committee members an appropriations process to produce a responsible bill that both parties support mr. chairman thank you for your courtesy of an opening statement and I yield back

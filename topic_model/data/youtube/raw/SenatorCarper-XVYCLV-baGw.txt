friday or so ago I was in newark at the New York Senior Center and I was there to urge senior citizens to join the rest of us and a bunch of senior citizens all over America to help us reduce the loss of money for the Medicare trust fund due to fraud a lot of crooked people out there trying to steal money not just from senior citizens but also from our treasury from the Medicare trust fund we're asking our senior citizens to do is to join the senior Medicare patrol be part of the eyes and ears to help it straight out fraud in Medicare and I thought it's good a good exchange good presentation good question answered and as it turns out the heart and soul of the health care reform legislation is something called Li exchange in fact we're going to have 50 exchanges which are large purchasing pools one established in every state across America and into that purchasing pool people who are individuals or families or small businesses even mid-sized businesses can participate create a larger purchasing pool by their health insurance from a larger purchasing pool drive down the price get a better result for for that money and when the exchanges are created and stood up in 2014 that's what we have to do we have to by law senators representatives our staff buy health insurance through the exchange private plans that will be competing for the right to serve or sell an insurance to all of us through the exchange if Delaware wants to enter to a interstate compact when we stand up and establish our exchange we want to stand up by and have will say interstate compact with Maryland or New Jersey or Pennsylvania or some other state to create a larger purchasing pool we can do that but when you enter those interstate compacts with those other states insurance sold in one state will be sold in another oh we have some some new tools in the the new law one of the best tools is actually when we come through the the information like mine the mind the data if you will we actually find clues it suggests maybe frauds occurring some cases it can be doctors ordering providing services for people don't exist doctors they don't exist like their fan of doctors some cases they're ordering medical equipment for people don't exist and they are maybe already deceased so we provide a number of good tools that were enable us to identify those patterns or fraud and to be able to go out and shut it down and the other thing that we do is we have the ability to go out and whether miss paid money we made mistake a mistake payments are like 50 billion dollars last year just in improper payments in Medicare lung for us to be able to go out and recover the money and the money that's recovered goes back to the Medicare trust fund sir there's a number of things that we can can do one of the one of the smart things they do in credit cards before if and this happened my family recently my wife was going to go to India where son was living for a while and the she's a she allowed him to use her credit card and in India and it's enough alarm signals that her credit card company said well who's this using his credit card in India they shut it down and as it turns out he probably should have but it was it was actually legitimate purchase we need to be able to do that with Medicare when you see patterns of consumption of health care that really are so different from a person's profile whether it's equipment that's being ordered pharmaceuticals that are being ordered treatments that are being provided that just send up some warning flags and under our new legislation it will the question of what should we start on first we start start trying to clamp down in the fraud or should we go in and try to do some some major changes to Medicare as it turns out we're doing both and one of the things that we're doing is doing number of things that will ultimately enable us to get better results for less money I am an old naval flight officer for 30 almost 30 years of my life I received annual physicals from the Navy on my birthday month in my birthday month or January the reason why the military spends money on annual physicals is to catch problems when they're small we also have a lot of people who take medicine in the Medicare prescription drug program and the sometimes they their eligibility runs out during part of the year we call it falling into the doughnut hole and some people stop taking their medicines they get really sick the end up in emergency rooms you end up in hospital it's not very smart and the pharmaceutical companies going to help us close that doughnut hole starting actually this year and the likelihood that people will stop taking the medicines that's going to be reduced so we're doing some things like that and also co-pays for like colonoscopies and oh gosh mammograms prostate screening so we have had these co-pays in the past really keep people from getting these preventive care and the ability to detect problems when they're small so all that's changing the theme that runs through all of them is better outcomes for less money better healthcare outcomes for for less money and while we're doing that we're trying to make sure that the those crooks oh they're out there trying to steal the money out of the Medicare trust fund and take advantage of our seniors that they're going to find it more difficult and we're going to be more likely to catch them it's a Medicare senior patrol and there are hundreds actually thousands of seniors all across America for joining us in an effort to clamp down on fraud help us to identify look at their Medicare statements every month when they get these Billings seated something your look untoward or in inappropriate if they see things or hear things they report report it and we can stop and nip it in the bud so the center cover and I are the like the two senators but we've got a great army of volunteers out there and it's an army that we want to grow

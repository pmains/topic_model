HAVE FUN THANKS AND WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.  >>> JOINING US NOW, CONGRESSMAN  PATRICK McHENRY. HE'S THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE. WE CAN'T HAVE YOU ON WITHOUT SAYING THAT YOU'VE GOT THE BEST  NAME FOR A POLITICIAN -- >> THANK YOU.  >> REALLY! I MEAN, IT'S LIKE, YOU'RE THE  SON OF LIKE PATRICK HENRY OR SOMETHING. ISN'T THAT WHAT McHENRY MEANS? >> YEAH, THE Mc MEANS "SON OF. >> YES THROW YOU RING IN WITH THE OTHER 20 WHY NOT? THEY WON'T GET THE NOMINATION  ANYWAY WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT? >> I'M A HAPPY PERSON, THAT'S  WHY. THE EXCHANGE I GOT TO SEE  YESTERDAY BETWEEN SECRETARY  MNUCHIN AND CHAIRWOMAN WATERS IS KIND OF LIKE SITTING BETWEEN YOU AND ANDREW --  >> THAT'S WHAT WE SAID MAKES US LOOK LIKE OZZIE AND HARRIET, WE SAID I KNOW.  >> I FEEL LIKE MELISSA,  ACTUALLY, THIS MORNING --  >> OR BECKY. YESTERDAY WE HAD --  >> YEAH, OR BECKY. >> CONGRESSMAN, YOU'RE ALREADY PREDICTING THIS IS GOING TO  PROBABLY, YOU KNOW, NOT BE AS  BAD AS WHAT WE SAW WITH  CHAIRWOMAN MAXINE WATERS,  OBVIOUSLY, AND MNUCHIN, BUT YOU  THINK DEMOCRATS ARE BASICALLY  GOING TO SAY THAT THE BANKS ARE  TOO BIG, AND YOU KNOW, THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING. BUT YOUR POINT IS THAT, YEAH,  THEY ARE TOO BIG BECAUSE DODD/FRANK MADE THEM TOO BIG.  >> RIGHT I MEAN, TEN YEARS AGO, WE HAD  THE SAME CREW OF EXECUTIVES -- THEY WERE DIFFERENT EXECUTIVES,  BUT SAME SORT OF REPRESENTATIONAL SET OF BANKS -- TESTIFYING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE  IN THE MIDST OF THE FINANCIAL  CRISIS TEN YEARS LATER, WHAT'S GOING  ON WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THIS  HEARING TODAY? WHAT IS THE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE? I THINK THAT'S A HEAD-SCRATCHER. OUR MARKETS ARE STRONG OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE STRONG. WE'VE GOT HEADWINDS GLOBALLY THE IMF REPORT OF REDUCING GLOBAL GROWTH IS PROBLEMATIC THE QUESTION OF BREXIT, THE  ISSUES OF CHINESE DEBT, THESE  THINGS ARE SIGNIFICANT BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANT QUESTION TODAY IS THE NATURE OF  DODD/FRANK THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE BIGGER  BECAUSE DODD/FRANK REQUIRED THEM TO BE BIGGER, AND WE HAVE FEWER  BANKS NOW THAN WE DID PRECRISIS, DRIVEN LARGELY BY REGULATION SO IT'S A RESULT OF THEIR  POLICIES THEY PUT IN PLACE, THE  DEMOCRAT PARTY AGENDA, THAT IS THE FULL CULMINATION OF THIS HEARING TODAY BY WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO BEAT THESE COMPANIES UP FOR COMPLYING WITH THE LAW THAT  THE DEMOCRAT PARTY GOT THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND SIGNED BY A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT.  >> SO, YOU WANT -- YOUR INTEREST IS IN INSURING GREATER COMPETITION AND CONSUMER CHOICE. IS THAT ANTITHREATICAL TO A LOT  OF THINGS THAT YOU FIGURE YOUR OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS THAT YOU'RE  GOING TO HEAR? IT'S KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE'LL GET, ISN'T IT >> QUITE FRANKLY, I MEAN, WE HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT OUR FREE MARKETS AND THE NATURE OF OUR  MARKETS RIGHT NOW. >> YEAH, WE DO.  >> THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL DEBATE IN POLITICS EVERYTHING ELSE IS OBSCURED WITH SORT OF THE CIRCUS ATMOSPHERE OF YELLING OR TWEETS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL DEBATE IS  ABOUT THE NATURE OF OUR MARKETS. AND I BELIEVE IN FREE MARKETS. I BELIEVE COMPETITION WORKS. AND I THINK CONSUMERS BENEFIT  FROM THAT. >> CONGRESSMAN, YOU'VE BEEN  TOUGH, THOUGH, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY, ON TIM SLOAN I REMEMBER SOME OF THE HEARINGS --  >> YES.  >> -- IN A SIMILAR WAY TO THE  WAY MAXINE WATERS APPROACHED HIM. >> WELL, IN THAT HEARING, YOU  HAVE ONE OF THE LARGE FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS, THE HIGHEST HEAD COUNT OF AMERICAN EMPLOYEES, THAT HAS BEEN FINED BY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR REGULATORS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, IS  STILL NOT COMPLYING WITH THE VERY THINGS THEY SAID THEY WOULD COMPLY WITH, AND YOU'VE NOW GONE THROUGH TWO EXECUTIVES IN 2 1/2  YEARS. I THINK THE NATURE OF THAT HEARING WAS FUNDAMENTALLY  DIFFERENT THAN BRINGING THESE  SEVEN GSIBs IN FRONT OF OUR  COMMITTEE TODAY, FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. >> CONGRESSMAN, WARREN BUFFETT WAS QUOTED OVER THE WEEKEND IN THE "FINANCIAL TIMES" SUGGESTING THAT THE NEXT CEO OF WELLS FARGO SHOULD NOT BE SOMEBODY HISTORICALLY FROM WALL STREET, FROM A GOLDMAN SACHS OR A  JPMORGAN, BUT FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THE RATIONALIZATION THAT HE  PROVIDED FOR THAT WAS  EFFECTIVELY THAT THE CONSTITUENCY IN THIS CASE MAY BE WASHINGTON DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT  DECISION AND IF SO, WHO WOULD YOU RECOMMEND, WHAT KIND OF PERSON >> NO, I THINK IT'S FOR THE  BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DECIDE WHO IS BEST GOING TO LEAD THEIR  INSTITUTION, RETURN VALUE TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND DO RIGHT  BY THEIR INSTITUTION IT SHOULD NOT BE ME AS A POLITICIAN OR AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, EVEN WITH THE POSITION I HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE, TO MAKE A DECISION  LIKE THAT OR TO BE DIRECTIVE OF  THAT WARREN BUFFETT IS A MAJOR  SHAREHOLDER OF WELLS FARGO HE HAS A VERY DIFFERENT POSITION IN THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING. I THINK RETURNING VALUE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS IS A FUNDAMENTAL  ISSUE. DOING RIGHT BY THEIR CONSUMERS AND GROWING THEIR PLATFORM IS A  FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. >> SO YOU LIKE THE CAMERAS I MEAN, DO YOU PREDICT THERE WILL BE SOUND BITES THAT WE'RE RUNNING TOMORROW, CONGRESSMAN? >> ARE YOU GOING TO BE THERE TOMORROW, JOE? >> YES THEN THERE WILL BE BLOOD --  >> THERE WILL BE SOUND BITES.  >> THERE WILL BE BLOOD IS IT MORE "SURVIVOR" OR MORE OF "THE BACHELOR" OR WHAT KIND OF REALITY? I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE CAMERAS HELP BECAUSE WHAT IS IT THAT HAPPENS  TO THESE PEOPLE WHEN THE CAMERAS START ROLLING? >> SO, YOU HAVE SEVEN BANKS, THREE DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS, REALLY I JUST WONDER HOW MANY QUESTIONS CUSTODIAL BANKS WILL GET, RIGHT? BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FINANCIAL  SYSTEM, FINANCIAL ECOSYSTEM. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT DEAL OF DIRECTION GIVEN TO THEM. THE QUESTIONS I CARE ABOUT,  THOUGH, ARE ABOUT REGULATION,  ABOUT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW,  AND GLOBAL SYSTEMIC RISK, WHICH  IS THE HEARING WE SHOULD BE  HAVING RIGHT NOW, NOT ABOUT THIS SORT OF CIRCUS >> WELL, I JUST WONDER WHETHER CAMERAS HELP OR HURT WE ALL WANT TRANSPARENCY, BUT  THEN I SEE THE WAY THESE POLITICIANS ACT AND I DON'T  KNOW ANYWAY, CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU.

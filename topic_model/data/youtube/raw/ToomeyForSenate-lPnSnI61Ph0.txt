well on Wednesday Arlen Specter sat down in Washington DC and did an interview with a radio host from Philadelphia he squared off against michelle bachman the congresswoman from the great state of Gretchen's birth which is Miss nomer babysitter well there you go she was indeed anyway they didn't get along well how do you know it was embarrassing listen to this oh wait a minute I'll stop and you can talk okay I'll treat you like a lady so act like one was what did you vote for I voted for prosperity I didn't vote for the government takeover of private industry she said I voted for prosperity while prosperity was on to a bill or what was simple why don't we make oh wait a minute don't interrupt me I didn't interrupt you act like a lady well I think I'm sure lady I think you are too that's why I'm treating you like one but just don't interrupt me wow it's like an angry man who shot and who should never do another radio or TV interview ever again who talks to a woman like that let alone a congressional colleague he's telling her how to act like a lady does he have any experience with that and the other thing is michelle bachman is just making a point and she kept her cool why does he talking down to it think about this if you remember he's running he's in the primary right running for the on the Democrat against Joe Sestak that's right curl these specters up a little bit though although Pat Toomey is ahead of him but if you are a woman in the keystone state of Pennsylvania and you hear him talk to her like that act like a lady what do you think yeah no excuses for Arlen Specter but obviously he's a little upset since he switched parties in the last year from Republican to Democrat and then he saw what happened in Massachusetts he's probably a little nervous and a little angry but no excuse to treat anyone like that michelle bachman actually had a very even-keeled response to being attacked the person interviewing us had asked what I thought about president obama's year i disagreed I told him that I think we should focus on prosperity and job creation and senator Specter turned and then questioned whether I was a lady and told me to basically sit down and be quiet it was actually stunned at the arrogance you can really tell that the Senate is the so-called world's greatest debating society can't you yeah quiet down I'm talking away

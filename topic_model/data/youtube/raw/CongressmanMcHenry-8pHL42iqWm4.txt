it's the gentleman from North Carolina mr. McHenry is recognized for two minutes Thank You mr. speaker and I want to thank my colleague mr. Isaiah for his hard work on this piece of legislation well-crafted and a very important reform the American people need to understand and appreciate what they are American people understand is that Washington regulation is preventing them Americans from realizing the dream of homeownership these arbitrary Washington created barriers are keeping young people recently married couples low and middle-income Americans from accessing mortgages they need to own a home that's wrong right now consumers are bearing the brunt of regulatory overreach under dodd-frank according to the most recent housing data the US homeownership rate is now the lowest it has been in 20 years young homeowners are being hit particularly hard for example in my district in Buncombe County in Asheville the number of young homeowners fell to a level not seen since the year 2000 that's unacceptable combine these figures with recent reports indicating serious distress in the credit markets and it becomes clear that young lower and middle-income Americans are being squeezed out of the dream of homeownership it's important we note that this bill will will not do a number of things nothing in this bill undoes the dodd-frank requirement that lenders ascertain a borrower's ability to pay nor does a bill in any way change the strict underwriting standards that the CFPB has set for qualified mortgages instead this bill simply allows more loans to fit under the current limitation on points and fees thereby expanding access to credit at a time when credit is still very tight it's also it also provides clarity to the calculation of points and fees which allow more loans to meet the requirement of qualified mortgages these are very important reforms very necessary forms and good for American homeownership and I congratulate my colleague for crafting this fine piece of legislation and I urge my colleagues to support the matter time of the gentleman and the talent of the job

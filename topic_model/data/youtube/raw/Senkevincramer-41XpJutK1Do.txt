good morning everybody good morning thank you for the irrevocable gift of your time this morning and uh coming out to learn a little bit about xm and contribute to the discussion because we're mainly in learning mode and i want to give a little bit of a background on what brings us here and and then turn it over to some other smart people and more most importantly turn it over to you all and um but first of all i want to say thank you to dickinson for hosting us thank you for to kiama kmm for hosting us we've had a wonderful tour and it was interesting um just to give a little history when oh i don't know time is so deceiving you guys but a couple of years ago when kimberly reed then the president of the xm bank called and said um i want to come to north dakota and see what you all got going on there and do a little round table and um what do you think and i said of course i'd love to have you and and so we put together a nice shindig in fargo and i went down to wapton to tour to our plant much like we did here um and it was kind of a big to-do well then um when when director bach is called i said let's do something completely different let's go to the western edge let's let's tour not a direct exporter but a subcontractor and let's demonstrate um how axim works in the entire supply chain and so here we are and of course in fact rachel as rachel could attest when we had the meeting to talk about what what what do you want to do with it we had a fairly short time frame i said it didn't take me 30 seconds to say let's go to kill your manufacturing didn't i is that it yeah it's the first words and and the reason being because even back before it was in congress um kristen and and her family were were advocates for export import bank as a tool financing tool to help their one of their largest partners of course boeing that's all relevant to the discussion for this reason you know i stumble around in politics and you know mostly mostly failures but hung in there long enough to see a success um in fact um if steve when i write my memoirs there'll be a chapter about you and it's already basically written in my brain um but but all these decades later not only do i find myself in congress but i find out it's not as easy as i thought right and um i was in the house now spencer had already he'd already abandoned the house when i got there so we just sort of i think we sort of shook hands on the way in and out and um and i was on the got on the energy and commerce committee but not on the finance committee or ways and means or any of the real heady stuff but this much i knew for sure that that no that in a little place like north dakota in this center of the north american continent if we had to eat everything we produced we'd be in a lot of trouble we'd be very fat and our farmers would not be very successful and and then i find myself um you know and prior to that of course at one point ed shaffer says we're going to change you from tourism director the economic development finance director to which i said what i know about banking you could tap into a small thimble and he said that's okay we need a promoter and i said well that i can do but please don't ask me to talk much about finance right sherry can attest yeah he was dumber in the post right robert i know robert's thinking that was the dumbest idea i'd ever had anyway so but but but that's what i was i was a promoter so what i didn't know about finance i figured out that it was important right there some deals are bankable todd right some deals that need the bank of north dakota some deals that need maybe a federal you know program not that they were bad deals they just didn't fit the bankable mode and so this is where the aggregated um generosity of the american taxpayer comes in so our world's getting to be larger in population but seemingly smaller in size and so i learned about this little thing called the export import bank so i go back i'm in i'm in the house of representatives we have some pretty strong leadership that doesn't like the export import bank and they let it lapse and when i say lapse i mean the author the authorization literally laughs right and and now remember and this is going to be just i'll just be as raw as i can be okay so forgive we're all we're all family so most of the leadership to oppose the export-import bank of course are republican and and other conservative organizations and stakeholder groups and we're in the majority and we have a farm bill and we have all these things that require authorization and the export import bank labs is because the chair of the banking committee or finance financial services committee allowed that to happen on purpose so the only way to bring a bill up that would reauthorize it when you don't have the support of leadership in the hou unlike north dakota not every bill gets a hearing much less a vote and so it is for 218 of your closest friends to come together and say we're going to force this to the floor that's called that's called a petition so you have you literally have to petition the floor the leadership to force the bill to come to the floor and it's called discharge now that since since we were in the majority obviously there weren't enough democrats to bring it to the floor because 218 is one more than half that's that's what's tough about being the only member of the house representatives in a body of 435 people and so we started a discharge petition and we needed 40 republicans to sign the petition and then every democrat would sign it and we'd have a vote which would no doubt pass overwhelmingly that's the other thing you know one of the reasons you don't bring a bill to the floor is to protect us from ourselves that's what leaders think sometimes and so i was the 40th republican you needed 40 of them i was the 40th republican to sign it and we bring it to the forum we we discharge the petition and we do a five-year extension well that extension came up again when i find myself in the senate this time i'm on the banking committee now i sit at the kids table on the banking committee but nonetheless you know i'm one of the cool kids and so i'm sitting on the end of the table and straight across from me is a a house classmate and senate classmate of mine kirsten cinema and she's sitting on the kids table on the democratic side and we knew we had to we had to reauthorize by that point not only even if he had authorization there wasn't a quorum on the board because that's the other thing if you had a president that didn't care a lot about it and neither barack obama nor donald trump really cared a lot about the export import bank so so they just they just stop appointing directors and you can't do business so there's a lot going on at this time okay so fast forward donald trump becomes president i become a senator i'm on the banking committee and kirsten and i figured let's let's really do something big and we propose a bill to to extend the export-import bank's authority for 10 years which is twice what it's ever been done before but we had a number two republican on the committee we had another another former chairman on the committee who also was the chairman of the appropriations committee who don't like the export import bank in other words we were never going to have a hearing on the export import bank except the senate has this weird tradition of big bills at the end of the year that need to be passed and um if you can attach something to that it's like christmas right so that's why they call it christmas trees we hate it right as citizens as taxpayers as voters we watch from the outside go this is the worst system in the history of the world except you still have to get some friends on board and and so one day realizing we were this was never going to happen i called donald trump who never liked the export import bank but i worked on them for literally you guys for three years at least two by at that point and he said he said to me said you know let me call the chairman and see if we can't get this on he said you know i i used didn't used to like the export import bank and then i thought well this is good for ge and boeing but he said you know what i've learned kevin it's good for the small manufacturers they use it as much more than anybody including all of those in the supply chain and i pretended like i'd never told them any of that stuff before i said you're right mr president you're you're brilliant and um and lo and behold we we did not get it for 10 years right we got for seven which was still which was still historic okay i'm a believer i'm an old economic development director that didn't know much about finance but i knew we didn't have enough and we needed to use all the tools at our disposal and there are 85 other countries that have export credit agencies 85 competitors that had a tool that we at the time did not have now that's not that's a competitive disadvantage we're the greatest country in the world the most productive country in the world the biggest consumer country in the world you ought to have at least modest tools that can play in the same at the same level as other countries so that's why i care so much about it and i'm so grateful that um that spencer called as a director and that they they've noticed that north dakota is a player and and they took the time to take all of the legs of a long airplane ride to get to dickinson on a monday which was to accommodate my schedule not his um but he did all of that to be here with us so what i'm going to do for the rest of this time is i want to right now i want to turn it over to the mayor to say welcome to all of us yeah and then i want to turn it over to kristen to say welcome to all of us and then i'm going to turn it over to spencer to give us the latest and greatest and then we're going to turn it over to you all to um bring us your stories ask your questions enlighten us and um and we'll just have a good family discussion so with that mr mayor thank you for welcoming us well thank you senator kramer and uh welcome to director bacchus uh to our great city and and thank you kristin and kmm for hosting this event just like to welcome everybody anyone not from dickinson please mingle with many of our our great producers here in town they have a great story every one of them from baker boy to tmi to stefas to kmm stone mill we have this this great manufacturing community out here in the western edge and you know besides the oil we have this uh you know great ag base out here we're such a diverse community and we're just trying to get that message out to the world you know what dickinson can bring to the table uh we're so happy uh that director bacchus could bring the exum here to have a discussion um amongst our community members and from other members within the state this is a just a great event thank you so much for bringing it to dickinson senator thank you director thanks scott for and for your hospitality um i think i'm mixing up the schedule a little bit bit because i do i do want kristen i want kristen to talk next because i wanted to of course it's her facility she's the landlord um but tell their story a little bit and then turn it over to spencer well i definitely appreciate and very thankful for everybody's presence here today and just really want to thank you senator um and director bacchus for seeing firsthand uh the the quality work and the opportunity that export import bank and those loans issued to emerging airlines and emerging country and developing nations provide right here in our nation's heartland and here in dickinson so it's just it's amazing because it is sometimes frustrating when people just call it oh it's the boeing bank and it only benefits these larger uh customers because in reality it really does drill down to the supply chain and uh and it really creates a lot of opportunity here for growth continued growth and it develops new relations uh with other countries so just very thankful uh to have this discussion grateful to to give you a tour and also just very thankful i think one thing that's also very unique about north dakota is we have such wonderful working relationships with our members of united states senate and congress and and so it's really nice to be able to have that personal touch and just grateful to have you here today and look forward to this this discussion so thanks thanks for being here everyone thanks kristin you know with regard to the relationship piece you guys i loved being in the house spencer i really did but really when you're the only one from an entire state and 434 of your colleagues come from somewhere else i used to say to get to 218 all i need is montana wyoming alaska and south dakota and there'd be five of us you know in other words it's you know it's a you make a lot you have to do a lot there's a lot of horse trading in the house um but the great thing about the senate is that everybody gets two and this relationship right this is special you guys if you ever doubt the importance of our electoral college and the three three um the three branches and the bicameral legislature this this is an example of why it matters that that we have these opportunities because as much as as much as um kirsten gillibrand might like to do this with all of her communities in new york or as much as as ted cruz might want to host one of these and every you know community in a you know in texas they don't get to but i get to i get to and i get to swing by i get to swing by dale's office and have coffee um because he's in town you know what i'm saying and we and and that's a that's special so with that uh you've already figured out he served in the house from alabama he was both ranking member and chairman of the financial services committee um he retired just in time and uh and now gets to use his skills in lots of ways and his his rolodex and his background in lots of ways but but we're especially grateful that you accepted um the the administration's appointment to the ex-im bank to bring that that experience there the experience of both of the bureaucracy in the legislative process as well as business and and being a stakeholder advocate um and we're really really grateful that you got up really early uh in mobile to to be in dickinson this morning so thank you and welcome thank you well um i the reason i came here ultimately i did two things i wanted to see kill deer manufacturing because uh to see these businesses in a place like dickinson which really make a critical difference in the community and financially educationally culturally in every business that xm supports is a unique story and it's about you know american entrepreneurship it really is it's about kristen's grandfather you know she explained the route he took and now you've got a real treasure here you've also got a viable financially stable company here partially because of your senator senator kramer and i and i'm not you know that may sound like wow that's quite a reach it really isn't kill deer depends on boeing and what do you hear about boeing if you read the national publications bank of boeing you ever heard that we're the bank of boeing elizabeth warren bernie sanders and a few on our side too you know when you get to the extremes yeah it kind of reaches around and there's some some similarities but elizabeth warren says you know we're just there for boeing bernie sanders says we're here to subsidize wall street yeah uh kristen i don't think you're wall street and your main customer is boeing so we're the bank of kill deer manufacturer and i had a we wouldn't be authorized if it weren't for senator cramer um one or two other courageous republicans and let me tell you we had we had a lot of republicans that supported the bank but they didn't want to step out and cross some of their big money supporters um you know the club for growth said you know we're against it because the koch brothers 40 years ago one of their competitors got a grant from xm and they've held it against them ever since he mentioned the appropriations chairman which he had the horse train with yeah he had to give him you know they had the horse trade you get this you get that he has airbus in his district and he doesn't like the fact that we subsidize boeing he kind of overlooks the fact that the french and the europeans and the english they subsidized a little over twice as much subsidies for airbus and just to tell you the importance of having a xm a functioning accent which senator kramer was was really key when we were shut down in 2015 i wasn't on the board um boeing lost they had 60 percent of the business when we opened back up in late what 2017 we boeing had 35 of the orders that year yeah and let me tell you something when it comes to market share any of y'all know in business it's easier to hold your market share than it is to capture market share once the chinese or or airbus starts selling airplanes to a to a airline in romania where they were buying boeing you know airbus has got a leg up and we and you know it's sad in south america alone we lost 40 percent of our exports in two years in the whole continent why did we lose it well one reason is because we quote sub corporate subsidies well look that's the world we operate in you know our competition if we don't try to live in a spot leveling the playing field i mean can you you imagine when the chinese give six or eight percent of just whatever company wants how that tilts the playing field america we we're known we're still known in the world one thing that we have not lost and this is this is our silver bullet people still know we produce quality we're quality we're not we're don't we're not cost i don't know that we'll ever be at cost and companies that have bought a chinese park instead of an american part because it was 30 cheaper and the american part lasted 10 years and all of a sudden two years later the chinese parts quit working for chinese the chinese signed a that they do this a lot we'll build something and then we'll sign a maintenance agreement and they find out that that maintenance agreement cost them dearly they they don't really care about the front end how much they they do a little bit but they they sell to own they end up owning they own six or eight ports and other countries in sri lanka they bankrupted sriracha they sure did they bankrupted them and the sri lankan government has to give 72 hours notice if they want to go on the port and you know how many sri lankans work at the port just the lowest menial labor and i'd say that that they're grateful for the jobs and it keeps them from starvation and there's no meaningful but i'm talking about just the worst of the most hazardous work they're all chinese workers they come in to build a road in jamaica they bring prisoners in and the prisoners are building the road and the prisoners were stealing the chickens from the farmers along the road and when they started stealing the goats that was like stealing your wife in jamaica and they they kicked them out told them no more we're missing too many goats but you know and and countries they're faced with this china says we'll just give you this it'll just give this is too good a deal and the chinese can do things we can't do we function on top of the table they do they function under the table on top of the table and it may surprise you but there's a lot of corruption in foreign countries you know there's some here but the scale of it and other places it's just for sale and it's it's almost impossible us to compete if we can't offer anything i was chairman and the of the house financial services committee a ranking member for six years and they kept this bank of boeing stuff up and then the most some of the bernie sanders and elizabeth were doing the uh corporate subsidy stuff and between them we held them off and i retired january of 2015. the new chairman that came up in was uh his main funder was people that wanted xm out of the way um and he told me in a conversation about three years before when i was telling them you know what are you you know what is the stuff with xm i mean i've got local companies small companies that built their business on xm on their their uh their short-term insurance guarantees and he said look this is actually word for word i've shared this with senator kramer he said look as long as we can buy something from china for one penny less that we can buy from here that's capitalism well it may be the most extreme example of capitalism but there's a downside and the good news is that after covid and after you know all these supply problems where we couldn't get tylenol you know we could get tylenol for two cents less and we could get you know a bottle of tylenol we could get it for a dollar or less and we could get it overseas or ibuprofen when we found out we couldn't get it period it was a problem that's a bigger problem when we find that we can't we cannot build a fighter jet in the united states without depending on enemies of america and you know y'all were i'm you know i'm 73 years old my my all my uncles they fought war ii my father we manufactured germany and japan out of business the last year of the war we were producing six times as many airplanes as japan and germany put together we can't do that today it scares me and it's it's a national security problem and let me tell you kill deer is defending america what whatever else those folks are doing out there they are securing our national security i went to gulfstream in savannah and um they're not bowling you know the first thing they asked me they said we sure hope y'all keep supporting bowen and i said why is that and i had a pretty good idea already and they said because our suppliers are boeing suppliers and almost every comp endeavor company you know that we rely on for parts for a gulf stream and that's the largest private jet company in the world and we support about 20 of their their business and their most profitable business because saudi arabia for instance they just don't ask about price they're more concerned with what the lavatory looks like in the jet so it's their most profitable business and they have they have 82 color schemes and i thought well maybe i'll buy senator cramer or gulfstream so i think what's your smallest jet what's it cost they said 66 million i wouldn't want the smallest one anyway 66 million dollars they said you know we if boeing is in trouble we're in trouble because our all our producers are in trouble and the best parts we get we have to rely on foreign parts and i learned from kristin one great thing about getting out of birmingham where i'm from or alabama is i learned things i didn't know and she told me that what they produced for boeing mexico and china and morocco also produced some of those same parts and she told me something i've heard if i've heard it once i have heard it 25 times i've heard it from boeing i've heard it from other subcontractors they say they like domestically produced parts because they're quality and you know they're they're they've had some trouble with their latest the triple seven this is a triple seven yeah max well you know some of those parts came from overseas and that was the achilles heel cost we went out of you know we couldn't support them uh they had a problem with uh we could you know and we've had some suppliers that went out of business because of that because of the because they uh and and ours a lot of our folks supply airbus but it's hard to do because they would rather they'll pay a little more for a european park but what you need to know i guess as much as anything else there'll be a time when people from outside will come in and they'll run an ad against your senator or your congressman and they'll say he supports xm they may not even say that they may pick something they probably will pick something totally different that they said he did but probably behind it as much as anything is he supports xm and he supports local by local and let me tell you they're still koch brothers is not shut down in russia they're the biggest funder of club for growth they said we're not shutting down they're still making parts and and uh but people will come in and they'll run an ad against your senator and they'll talk about bank of boeing and you need to say to him bank of kill deer manufacturer like the people in vermeer in iowa who make the farm equipment they came in and they were criticizing one of their congressmen who supported them and the people at vermeer said xm is the bank of vermeer don't tell us that they're the bank of boeing they don't produce anything for poland they produce agricultural equipment but we've got i met senator kramer knows this i met with the premier of china the three or three back and i actually met i and two other congressmen our wife spent an hour alone with him we were there building a school with ups and it was on cc tv and at that time he actually said and i believe him he talked about moving towards capitalists he talked about moving towards our model they were actually at one time committed to becoming more capitalistic and and to have a good relationship this latest guy he's he's nothing like what we had before i mean the the one i talked to the guy i talked to who talked to my wife about how wonderful teachers are he said you know he he said what we'd say there's so much in common teachers are the key education is the key to our country he talked about a teacher that if he wouldn't be premier today if this one teacher hadn't taken him and had an interest in him and my wife was a high school teacher and they talked for 30 minutes we've got a different guy in russia now i mean we've got the same guy but hadn't we woke hadn't we realized that china and and russia are not there to build a friendship with us i mean we realize that and we can't if we can't manufacture weapons if we are again we build passenger aircraft you can convert those to tankers you can convert those to military a lot of we're actually restricted from middle military supporting military exports we're the only eca of the 86 that has that restriction they've tied our hands on this and that and all sorts of stuff and we were going to do something with ukraine with weather radar and somebody said one of our enemies said wait a minute you could use those to track aircraft and i thought to myself you figured it out they were right but we could not export that radar system three years ago to ukraine or two years ago you know we started they wanted it they came to us in 2015. we were shot down to 17. we started to talk to and and let me tell you legitimately it's the same radar that checks tornadoes that plots track i mean you you can it's multifunctional but they don't have it because somebody said you can't do that xm so i'm uh i've said i've said enough i i don't if we're going to ask questions i was at the end of vietnam i was a medic and i went in about a year before the war was over and i was in the second class we went to fort sam for a year to train as a medic and didn't go the class right before us didn't go every other class every month went and we used surplus helicopters from vietnam and the reason we were told we did is these were broken down old helicopters that made too much noise and so they made a lot of terrible whining noise and whistles and when you were on them for 30 minutes you couldn't talk to each other so when i tested out of the military i'd lost 40 of my hearing so so talk loudly when we ask a question yeah so i've i've suffered from hearing loss since i was 21 years old because of those because i'd also refusal to wear earplugs because real men didn't wear all right here's why i want to do that there's a number of things across mine there's three three three areas i want to explore one current users current customers and we have some um how to bank it because one of the things i don't think we've said yet is well i referenced it a little bit todd when we referenced you and that is exim is like the bank of north dakota in the sense that generally they work with a cooperative bank a collaborating bank they don't start out they don't start the deal right and so i you know and we have some banks that maybe do some have done some export stuff maybe some that don't maybe talk a little bit about exporting export north dakota and what up what other opportunities might exist for others who haven't who have seen the opportunity but haven't taken the dive okay so sherry i'm looking at you i didn't tell you up front but you're our current customer and in your company why don't you tell us a little bit about that experience what what you do and and why this matters i'm assuming it's a good answer so i'm just i know it is you're right you're right with that um so leonardi products is a mining and processing facility based out of williston and um the product that leonardite that we mine is it's uh rare throughout the world so about 50 of our product is exported and we have the same customers one after another but we recently uh well the product is used as a fertilizer additive but also as an oil drilling mud or drilling liquid additive so we do sell we started selling to saudi arabia and egypt and we have repeat customers and because of the problems with the supply chain and the expense of exporting it's quadrupled in the last two years a lot of our customers can't really afford to pay us up front and then pay for shipping at the same time so we've had to make some allowances and we're a small company 20 employees we don't really have we can't really go without cash for a long time so we um even though we're confident that our customers will pay us we we are customers of xm um because it's uh we consider it insurance and insurance policy so that should there be any political unrest throughout the world um we'd be able to get our money if we needed it what kind of unrest could there possibly be doing business with saudi arabia in egypt i can't imagine why that's right and those are just some of the companies we deal with we deal with other small companies in northern africa and the middle east we actually have some problems with saudi arabia of course yeah because you'll have a prince over there that he he pretty much does what he wants to and he'll their first response sometimes is we're not going to pay that much yeah well and we we work one thing we do to help you cherie is we we uh sheree sherry shay i'll answer you we uh we talk to our embassies yeah well in our test our customers customer is aramco yeah so uh we're very careful about that but and that probably on that scale but you know it's amazing now what we do dennis griffin didn't stand up dennis dennis was the regional coordinator here and he's been to bozeman he's been fargo by far is around fargo he's he's worked with companies up there you've got a concentration of x-m companies there but he we now have you know we work through insurance brokers too most of your most of our insurance short-term insurance we work through brokers and so he's new job he is no longer regional director we're training somebody else here he is one of our four he is in charge of broker management because the bank is down to 370 employees we need 500. we actually when we did the marshall plan we did the marshall plan everything was bought in the marshall plan they had 2 800 before but we don't need that of course you ever heard a federal agency didn't need more yeah right but let me pause and tell you this we're unlike any other federal agencies let me tell you i've walked through i've walked through some federal agencies i'll just stop there i hate most of them but we our main concentration is engineers engineering degrees our second concentration is accountants you would have thought lawyers wouldn't you you would have thought maybe you know no our main occupation there i mean our our most i think uh 50 something of our employees are engineer mechanical structural environmental you know and uh you you mentioned uh oil and gas and i'm so i'm hitting differently when we were shut down exports out of houston dropped 40 percent yeah well when i got on the board the first three companies that urgently wanted to talk to me one was the port of houston and two were houston where they were oil and gas because we export a lot of oil and gas stuff and you know we are still committed i am and i think the the board is we're committed look look what's happened recently we're committed to energy we're committed to domestic energy and we can do it right um we're we're under no illusions and i uh there are people that are but that's why we need people that aren't like your senator okay so here we do it better than anybody but sherry really raised i think an interesting point and that is there's an expertise that you're renting when you're doing business with with xm so miss kim i want i know i'm putting everybody on the spot because i talked to none of you before this but maybe you could help us understand for anybody in the room who's a manufacturer producer or something or you know in a va in a supply chain somewhere that hasn't exported maybe you could share a little bit about the potential the opportunity that exxon provides and your shop and along with the you know the commercial service and others there's a lot of resources sure hi my name is chuan kim the north dakota trade office so as you some of you know we have many companies under our arms that we are assisting their exporting business and many of the companies on when they are exporting they always ask us how can i secure my you know payment so we have talked to dennis many many times and we connected them to dennis so we always introduce hey there is exim bank credit export credit insurance so that is not only as sherry mentioned not ensuring your payment but also that is account receivable management so it will be a great tool when you work with ex-im bank taking export credit insurance that will also allow you to manage your account receivables and that with that many companies very uh you know feel ease and also even they approach it by a new uh new customers they feel you know less risk of course there is a risk when you are doing business with new customers but exit banks you know services and programs that will open a new business with the new customers that you haven't met or haven't talked but that will be that will also you know lead them as a second or third as a long-term you know buyers and even future partners so that that's what we uh trade office we do and thank you again dennis one thing that we have got that a lot of people don't realize because it's new but we have what's called supply chain working capital where and listen uh a lot of our companies were under stress in the last two or three years and their subcontractors were hesitant to do business with them because you know they couldn't they couldn't pay till they delivered the product and we now have a program where we will um you you bring something and you say i've got a contract i can if i get this contract i can i win this contract i supply 400 harvesters to ukraine now i got a problem with the bank saying ukraine isn't safe we can now go back into ukraine and uh we can check out how legit we'll take it we'll take a risk on ukraine we're you know as we know we're on we're on the ukrainian side of this deal and um but you know it doesn't have to be that it can be a peanut guy that suddenly he gets a call from a country in south america and they want so many peanuts and he it's about eight times more than he can produce so he wants to go out in which he did and he go he went out and bought peanuts from different suppliers and farmers and he used our working capital because if he'd gone to you know now a bank participated so we had a bank that was part of the deal and and they actually administered but we guaranteed most of it the bank had a small piece because the bank couldn't have taken off you know they they go to the regulators and they say hey we're you know we're going to do this deal it's 20 of our our loan you know buying peanuts and you know that happened in aviation a lot of banks that were trying to help boeing the regulator said you've got too much of a concentration and their credit rating is has gone down uh now let me tell you another point we have companies that five when i got on board i went down and visited them just two of them i think of and they were 70 of their business was overseas one was a candy company and they're they shipped more to japan than any place else their biggest uh customer here was disneyland where they made the balls the candy balls the little bitty balls pastel balls for space mountain but peru and bolivia and two or three others the kids there in japan love this stuff and they all sorts of weird stuff we they were going into these countries they didn't know anybody we were able to do the due diligence we identified these people today the candy company still uses us when they go into a new market but in japan now they have got people and they're dealing with two or three companies there's they don't need us anymore yeah they they're in that market they know that market uh same in in most of their their but they're still using us somewhat you know in some of south america just depends we've got a company that produced pet supplies that they started with in their garage and when i visited them they were exporting it's high-end pet supplies it's the highest end you can get you can buy a dollar and a half uh vitamins for your dog you can also buy at walmart a 14 bottle of water it's this company now i visited the company and a year later every day two amazon trucks a walmart truck came up and they were expanding and they went into the smallest camp the poorest county in north carolina and they established 280 new jobs where the unemployment was over 30 percent and the two congressmen thank goodness there were two congressmen divided that little county and one of them went from against xm to 4xm so they don't use us anymore yeah well that let's create some more of those so as you're talking and i'm looking around the room now we have some really savvy companies here that have done a lot of course we talked to ukraine i look right at rdo thinking whether they used to have a lot of trucks in ukraine at a store that are now being used by somebody but anyway um but we're going to get back there right it'll all be okay again troy i'm hopeful um anyway but companies that have been they've been very savvy and done a lot of exporting as well setting up businesses in other parts of the world mike of course with an international company was started north dakota now a global company doosan but i'm i'm looking over at dineen thinking okay tell tell us the stone mill story and let's imagine the you know the potential if we could have everything we wanted and every part of the world was our was our customer base or at least our potential customer base we did not rehearse this did we do we did not no so stoneman was uh started by my father uh so i'm second generation um and it was started with a need you know for for a market from for a simple farmer who is looking for a market for his crops um looking to diversify his crop base for many reasons ultimately created the company and and he did start on exporting um he started with garbanzo beans um which were not real popular yet in the united states at the time so he um did rely a lot on exporting used the xm bank quite a lot when it was available later on we used it right right now some of our bigger hurdles are are getting containers in the middle of north dakota but that's another subject but yeah whenever we do export it we're a small company we can't take the risk of um and all these customers are usually coming to you blind you don't know them you don't know friends of theirs who don't know anything about them um and so utilizing that insurance policy is really the only only way i will do business in an export environment otherwise we just we're just not able to compete and take on that risk commodities are already risky um highly highly risky and so then to not get paid on top of it is is obviously not a great way to do business so it's it is a important it's i don't know i feel like it's very very important for small businesses especially i know there's a lot of big businesses that use it as well from the sounds of it but um but right we we we just wouldn't be able to compete at all otherwise so you know you raised another interesting point i mean the container issue which we're all very familiar with and we haven't we have a broken supply chain for sure but the only way to even be in the game would be to know you had some financing to get one of those containers off wherever it is and they're in weird places um for the most part one of the bigger challenges is that in asia it's it's become more profitable to just turn them around empty than it has been to fill them with our products and get it back so we've got a lot of political issues we're working on in there okay so so again value-added yeah please do you use short-term credit and do you use our credit guarantee insurance yeah whenever we uh do any exporting we use the insurance for new customers yeah yeah and like they said you you can wean yourself off of that once you get to know your customer and we want to hear through your senator a lot of times you know we don't they people don't for some reason utilize their congressman you know you don't have to call us call them maybe somebody that's going to get after me for this but i'm a former congressman so you know call them tell them what you need they'll call me and i'll find out if if it's something we can do one mistake companies make i say it's a mistake they use letters of credit and our short-term credit in our short-term insurance guarantee payment is cheaper and other countries supply that for their exporters and if they didn't we could just another example we could say well you know our competitors don't have that advantage but it works better and and we can do a lot of due diligence okay so we have with the remaining time here's what i want to do i'll just open the floor now because i'm hoping that somebody has either a question uh you know what has some curiosity they want satisfied about the program we have some community bankers in the room we have bank of north dakota in the room which provides it's almost an unfair advantage in some respects but we like it that way um in terms of expertise and a lot of arenas that uh you know we wouldn't have but for that so let me just open the floor to anybody that's got a question comment thought story and if not i'll put somebody else on on the line on the hook yes roger rogers my name is roger gracious own a company in north dakota carried to north dakota healthy oil seeds we do processing especially oil seeds and uh we had some problem uh well we were using excellent bank very happy with excellent bank and then at the time uh it was thought and not thought to be but was accused of exim bank was accused of being a a um uh subsidizing like you mentioned boeing and and so it so uh it was um defunded for a while is that right oh yeah uh that's exactly what uh senator kramer led the charge and i'm i'm here but i'm i would say this anywhere he led the charge to get it reauthorized for a record number and let me go back and say something else about that do you know one other thing they used us against bank of boeing they said ronald reagan tried to shut xm back down you've heard that oh yeah ronald reagan when he was running as governor of california he said there's several government agencies i don't think we need and i think he was right about one or two but one of them was xm there were seven of them he shut down four of the programs he said two years into office i was wrong about xm i've heard from a lot of i didn't realize he said i was governor of california i didn't realize how many california companies relied on xm he doubled the funding for xm while he was president that does not stop people from telling that story yeah um roger do you have more of your story because no way just a little bit if you have time of course yeah and go back and ask it again because i i when you were talking yeah though it was it's reauthorized for 10 years now let me tell you that also helped us with several projects we are financing it was anadarko but they were above but we're financing the largest gas fine in the last 40 years off the coast of mozambique and it will be supplied with 80 percent u.s equipment and uh it um the isis attacked it y'all may have heard about a year ago where they attacked a project and killed a bunch of people that was that was our contractors and the uh but we that's part of that was the government was not working with the local people the federal government and they were and but we're we're back on track on that and that's going to it'll be the largest gas fund it's it's to be the largest ever other than kuwait and uh it'll be all american goods from now on and we'll have control over where it goes so it'll go though and it's in you know environmentalists were after us about it and all of a sudden the people in mozambique and two or three other countries said wait a minute it's going to electrify we're going to have world electrification in these countries and all of a sudden you know the environments had to choose between elevating people out of poverty like it did here in the 30s when you got rural and and choosing between that and being an environmentalist and we're going forward with that all right roger rap finish here thank you i'm anxious to um uh when when exxon bank was defunded we had a fair amount of money owed to us through a korean company and we're a very small company family-owned company and uh they owed us about a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars and for us that's quite a bit of money maybe it isn't 175 000 yeah that's a lot of money and because of that then the company then there was a uh agency that a private agency that came out that said this is a flax product we were shipping over there flex oil and some flax protein and milflax but um a government agency came up came out and said that the flax had something about it that they said was was not was was not good for a person was toxic and so then flax market dropped very quickly in the country of south korea because of that the company this company kind of didn't have a market and so we ended up being out 175 thousand dollars during defense defunding where did your pro where did your product go the product was over there already did you did you recover the product uh we did not recover the product so that's what you you lost the product and and the money yes 175 okay let me ask you this you had insurance is it insurance we had excellent bank yeah okay um yeah you had a insurance broker yes we do okay we there have been problems and i don't know your your situation i can tell you just some generalities dennis i you know is now supervising a fourth of the insurance brokers we're looking at those brokers we're trying to educate them they're mistakes that they make that we make clear to the exporter and to the insurance brokers you got to do this you got to supplies with the right information and we're we're trying to prevent i don't know that may not be i may be totally wrong but did you have any and i i i'm not supposed to talk about individual deals but did you have an insurance broker involved yes trade acceptance group okay and i'm not criticizing them or i'm not criticizing excellent bank but i'm just saying that when you when you talk about i mean when when there's claims of subsidies towards big business but we're a very small business and it helped us out a lot and and i just want to say that that that again that that we're a small company and helped us out and but so what year was that i just um i would say that it was probably ten years ago johan work with juwan and someone this eight years ago okay it was eight years ago okay thank you so i mean this is a great illustration though of the cost of the laps right the cost of political intervention and imposition in in something that should never have happened and i might add by the way on behalf of all the mean-spirited right-wing capitalist pig ogres friends of mine the expert airport bank makes money right i mean nine billion dollars it's a profit center for the taxpayers and they want to change our accounting to a different system but we're the only agency in the federal government they want to change that system to if they did all the other agencies and obviously i went up the hill and one of the i guess i don't know it was jeb or somebody's uh i think it was actually ted cruz oh my gosh i think he said we want to change it to to this kind of accounting i said well you have to change the law he said uh no we don't i said well yeah the the budget act says this is what all federal agencies and i said you wouldn't just do that to xm would you and and then i had somebody from i said have you talked to the port authority in houston lately that's the last i've heard but i think i don't think it'll stop him i mean i don't know i you know that one of the challenges of being the only member of the united states senate that doesn't want to be be president i can't understand what's in their minds so anyway hoeven tells me he doesn't want to be president either so there's only 98 of them that want to be president you know you just hit them at least think they should be yeah it's funding yeah okay that was a thank you for that illustration by the way i do wish we could get your hundred seventy five thousand dollars back though maybe roger any time we fail and and and you lose money it's a loss for now it's a loss for us thank you and and we're we don't you know we hate to hear that sometimes and there have been cases since i've been on one we couldn't legally there was nothing we could do that doesn't happen all right who else that's thank you that was a great illustration important other thoughts questions yes todd i thought maybe uh director thank you for coming senator thanks for having us so i'm learning a lot um uh director just so you know where i'm president of the bank of north dakota we're the only state-owned bank in the nation which gives us some flexibility we're a banker's bank all our services have to have a lead lender involved and so i've got a lot of my friends around the table here uh but we did develop a program a few years ago called the egg commodity export enhancement program that is for is specifically for ag commodity enhancements and so what um and what we're trying to make sure is that we don't duplicate what's already available if there's a way that we can help and enhance and and basically what that product does is for egg producers that are exporting a commodities we would be involved with a lead lender to provide the financing work with ex-im bank to make sure the insurance is in place and then and that's our collateral against the loan and and those sorts of things so um what i will do from my standpoint is i'll i'll we'll get with juan and and uh and dennis and sit down and make sure we're all on the same page and again we're always looking for are there other programs we can develop this is for a commodity exporters if there's a need do we need to develop another program that's for other exporters and i think that's the things that we'll take into into consideration and see if we can't uh work together uh to come up with some other things so you know and if we can develop something with y'all like that we could then do it with other of course you're the only you said state-owned bank which is unusual i didn't know that and i'm here chairman of the banking committee but i do now remember that i had heard one time that there was some strange animal up here growling around but uh which is obviously worked out well for 103 years and uh uh you know uh you're interfering with the cap free market right yeah that's what we would argue i'll i'll leave that to my banking friends let you know if we're interviewing we partner with we partner with banks we partner with insurance brokers we don't you know and they want us uh let me and i'm gonna get i know who i'm gonna get jim burris to call you okay and he's a banker and he's acting well he's no longer the acting chairman but he was for a while and i will say this the bible administration had the foresight to put a put a banking guy into that position and we've got a lot of those uh but he i'm gonna get him to call you and let me close by saying an impression i've gotten here uh when i tour these companies this company is family friendly and that's true of a lot of homegrown companies and when i was out there on the floor and i was talking to people and you were talking about flexible hours and this guy's he's a farmer but he comes in here and works three days a week because i got uncles that are farmers in alberta canada and uh they're bad years and sometimes you gotta you've got you know you got to have a good paying job to support the farm but a lot of them said to me my daughter is going to dickinson state i don't know where i guess that's here that's right here right here there there's the president sitting right there good yeah and uh where did you go i went to dickinson state i got this degree you know i went to north dakota i've got a degree from north dakota or my my child's you know or my husband's got my wife's gone back to get a teaching certificate you can't when you talk about x-m value-added or kill deer it's not just salary i mean it's it's raised the edge you know income good paying jobs raise the they raise the educational level and that'll pay dividends for generations to come and you know no there's some we're a lot of times we're now questioning what kind of education i mean you know i've got a son with political science degree you know he's an overrated he can he can wait he waits on tables you know but uh you know i would submit to you spencer that it does it raises you know income levels but i think it raises the gays to me that's what's exciting is that the community bankers become export bankers the community bankers suddenly have more assets to lend to entrepreneurs that that entrepreneurs have a vision you know this big and it goes to this big and and uh you know a john deere dealership ends up with a store in ukraine or or you name it i mean there's there's all kinds of opportunities now i will say this about getting out to a place like this i love it because inevitably the expectation is is exceeded um the creativity the risk take i mean these prairies were not you know were not settled by wimps the wimps all went to south dakota um or some places they went to new york city they stayed in new york that's certain um so our europe they stayed in europe well there's a reason that when if you drive around here you'll see ukrainian crosses in the cemeteries because those are the people that came out here and and it's it's really quite remarkable so that's why i played you know 103 year old institution like the bank of north dakota that um i think i think the critics have basically given up because the bank of north dakota like exim doesn't initiate loans they participate in laws they add value to the to the other institutions that but for the bank of north dakota they wouldn't have the expertise available to them or at least not as well coordinated and that's true by the way if the federal that's sba that's you know that's um usda rural development that's all of the various players in the entire value chain the financial services value chain come together at one up and that's the bank of record and i will tell you this when when we when i was negotiating like a madman for for a reasonable pvp program during during the cares act i had no less than three or four round tables virtual round tables with no less than 400 bankers at one time because the bank of north dakota provided that opportunity for me right up until an hour before we passed the bill we were still editing it and still modifying it to make sure it met what we what our local bankers needed now i'm not i'm not smart enough you know you served with sonny bono he was on the judiciary committee so it's not that bad an idea that i'd be on the banking committee i'm a better speaker than you yeah that's what i answered but but so my point being but we have this resource we have these resources when i have a question about local lending i go have coffee with dale because he'll give me at least two cups you know when i go to dakota community and stop in and and and you we we have an advantage in in this type of access and the bank helps coordinate that so yeah you know if you guys come up with another industry level that needs a little assistance they'll create the program that allows you to leverage xm okay we're we're at the at the end of our time but i i cheat a lot on that sort of thing i'm you know i'm a senator and well can i filibuster so let me tell you my uh people ask me if i've been to north dakota before my mother used to go up home in grand prairie in alberta once every year or two and i'd spend a month a month and the train would come out of chicago and it would exit the united states in portal and that's where they get on and inspect everything yep that's right but the train stopped in a town called my knot might not my not that was my mouth and i could get i got a coca-cola it stopped for long enough for me to get a coca-cola so i'm very impressed with mine it's all a matter of the time of year um i i will tell you i'll tell you one more that you don't remember it might it might make a chapter you know right after the easton chapter um in in the memoirs frank keating remember frank keating he was a former governor of oklahoma he was governor at the time of the oklahoma city bombing i went with them all over idaho and montana you made it to fargo yeah so so frank keating and sam brownback when i was on that trip you didn't remember me i did i do remember oh okay and you were on that on that trip and here's what you were doing in fargo that day that i joined you as i was a young public service commissioner robert young public service commissioner and they were there testifying to the conservative bona fides of one united states senator who thought he should be president do you remember that you were there for john mccain they were stupid john was john it was in february of 2008 it was a quick trip but we had a little news conference pictures in the fargo forum all the big things that was a good friend of johnson great guy um i supported a lot of losers i got a track record uh me too but i lost three times before i ended up with this dumb job so hang in there all right you guys um i again i appreciate so much this gift of your time your thoughts we'll hang around a little bit uh i think we're gonna talk to some reporters if there are any here i don't know if there are not so that means we have a little extra time rachel says there aren't any okay i want to introduce courtney bush carter this is her first trip stand up courtney out of she's just joined the bank a month ago or two right almost almost a year once i'm sorry time does his first trip with me and uh so uh it's courtney bush and when we hired her i said well it's always good to be friends with the bushes yeah so but uh she's this is she's done you've done a real good job on this trip so thank you very much and rachel rachel i called rachel about a week ago and i left i emailed her and i asked her to call me and i'm kind of used to the next day i put the phone down and it started ringing and i looked it was washington i said this this is not gonna be racial it was rachel that's how quick she did it so you got some good people i know believe me i've got the best um all right anybody else quickly story thought question curiosity how can tmi sell more to canada i don't know i don't know indeed anybody i want to give a shout out to to kyle good to see you here oh yeah that's our we've been very helpful with dakota bank and and then we've also certainly worked very much with the bank of north dakota so um just got good team here and a lot of good folks very grateful where would we be with our bankers right well thank you thank you senator and uh director bacchus uh for coming out here i mean this is uh you know been great to get everybody together and we have so many great um stories to tell i mean every one of these companies that sit here they started uh very small you know you look over at stefan's corporation over there at one point they were making church furniture and uh i used to mow paul stephens's grass it was uphill both ways um mowing his grass and and and where they've taken that company you look at baker boy where they've taken that company where they started off as a very small little corporation you know tmi what they how they started and how they developed into what they are killing their mountain manufacturing starting up in kildare moving to multiple communities in in the southwest part of the um north dakota and it how they've expanded and the quality of work that they do that they just get award after award we're just so proud of all our our manufacturing base out here in uh dickinson we have these great banking institutions we have these great uh community um organizations that are out here and and serving you know all these workers and we're continuing to work on quality of life in dickinson i mean we're excited what we have going on we have a brand new sports complex coming where uh you know we have our new hospital in town and and big clinic and we're working you know every day to to uh improve the quality of life out here so we can continue to addre you know attract workers to these manufacturers and these small businesses and and uh to include to get uh like you said uh direct bacchus get those uh teachers to move here because they are they're the first impression that many of our children that it lasts a lifetime if if they stay in our systems that you'd be at either the public school which is we we have one of the best public schools in the state if not in the nation we have a great uh proquel school system here and private school system and then they you know follow that up all the way through into dickinson state university now we're developing a cte out here a partnership between the city dickinson state in a you know private and uh public school system to develop that new technical like you were talking about degree wise what would he see in the future and that's what we're we're doing the partnership with the manufacturers here in town to co-op to what are the jobs that we need that this new um enterprise that we have with this cte we're putting people out in a couple of years into the workforce and then we have that you know of course we have just the the bakken which is has has done so much not only for western north dakota the whole state and i would say even the whole nation when the bakken came into play in 2009 um it probably saved the economy well i used to represent uh two railroads and uh not here but matt rose was a friend of mine and uh you know matt i can tell you the great guy came up through the ranks yes you do but uh the sand and the oil and the the it it it was good for the railroads well in in 2000 and coal yep and when 2008 when that you know that major catastrophe and the economy hit and we were flush with everybody came to western north dakota to look for a job overnight we were full of people and we took care of them out here we we did our best to accommodate and get individuals into the workforce and and find them housing and accommodate through the school system but uh like i said uh this part of the country as you said centered senators not for the week it uh it will test you and uh our ancestors were the you know they they proved it and they came from the ukraine and they were the germans from russia which is the ukraine and and they uh they came here in the swedes and uh in norwegians and they all came here and settled this part of the world and there was nothing out here when they settled and look what they've turned this this you know part of the world into and you go across the whole state of north dakota i mean all these uh small entrepreneurs that turn these companies into major major companies that are players across the united states and we just uh we're very thankful you came out here senator brought director bacchus out and uh it's uh you're welcome anytime come out anytime always feel welcome here when i when i go visit my cousin leroy erickson i'll ask him what country he's from but uh um this uh this is a wide open spaces out here it uh i used to go skiing every year at breckenridge with my boys and the first year i went i looked on a mouth and i stopped in st louis the first night and i thought i was halfway there and then and the next day i got through missouri and you know like three and a half hours and i said you know i will be there by nightfall and i i'm still in kansas you know i gotta i got to breckenridge at four in the morning so it's i'm glad y'all have 75 miles an hour it is wide open out here you know when i was stationed at fort benning one of my best friends was from seal alabama seal alabama seal the little little town right outside uh yeah seal and i brought him up here yeah and for uh like you said and uh he flew in at night and you know how alabama's full of trees and they say auburn's out on the prairie right well he saw what prairie was when he it was middle of the night and uh he landed here and the next day we ended up in the badlands and the sun came up out in the badlands and he just looked for miles and he said i i cannot believe this up here and he just loved it and i think anybody that comes up and and tours western north dakota just north dakota as a whole just loves this this uh part of the country because it's beautiful oh sunset sunrises you got to be on lake sakakawea at 5am trying to catch some eyes when the sun comes up nothing better thank you all thank you mayor thank you sir for joining us today i will say one one additional thing about kmm that it'll i'll never be the same in addition to the banking committee i serve in the armed services committee and the fact in spencer reference is the fact that every time you get on a boeing on a commercial flight you know that you're on a kmm supported airplane but when you see an f-15 screaming through the sky in defense of freedom around the world i was just down in skunk works a couple months ago looking at some black ops aircraft some that will be coming to north dakota some that will go other places and knowing that people here are making sure that airplane's going to stay in the sky to protect us that's that's another level of importance to the concept of making them in america every piece every component every bit of the supply chain so we've got we've got work to do but if we're going to cut off china we've got to build a bigger floor kristen and we got to find more people to work because that's to me that's we've got to be all about that you know i've been to china five times they are the kindest people in the world they are uh they're gracious they're i love the chinese people leadership they have heart horrible leadership it's the communist party you know and you know it's it's that's that's what the people in hong kong or taiwan will tell you they're chinese but they're not they're not that kind thank you all [Applause]

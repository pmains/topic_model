thank you mr chairman and thank you all for your testimonies this morning and certainly ms stevens thank you for your commitment to tamir who i believe is behind you and uh i will say as the kid who moved into my grandparents house at seven but i i didn't always appreciate the sacrifice of my grandparents the truth is that it takes time and age before you can look back with 20 20 vision and say my gosh how blessed was i so sometimes you love them sometimes you don't love them we talk about your grandparents but the truth of the matter is you always love them you don't always express it well and so i'm sure that tamir and i have that in common i'm sure that that he loves you beyond recognition and appreciates your sacrifice frankly the fact that you have 10 other kids that weren't your kids that you were able to help not only help along the way but you helped them graduate from school as well which is a testament to your sacrificial love and support of your community and we need more examples like that if each one would reach just one not 10 but just one our country would be certainly better off so thank you for your sacrifice you did touch on the topic of of resources and the importance of finding support groups and support systems and i'd love to talk for one second with miss clifton about the importance of legislation that may provide more resources certainly the ccdbg grants that come through the reauthorization act that for the first time makes kinship care families and children with parents over 65 eligible for support regardless of work or income requirements kim i would love to just have you talk with us about the child care experiences of south carolina from a grandparent's perspective and explain how this bill could provide more resources i think it's really important one of the biggest challenges that kinship caregivers and grand families face is finding child care often it's associated with the need to work and caregivers are forced to quit jobs because they have to um they don't have child care they don't have affordable accessible child care of course that was really exacerbated by the pandemic because even when caregivers can access child care right now there are so few places open that have room but because voucher vouchers child care vouchers haven't been accessible by most kinship families and they have a time limit of 52 weeks it's been really hard we've certainly worked with grandparents who have quit jobs because it is makes more sense to be home with the kids because they don't have child care and they need to know that the children in their care is safe with and it puts enormous financial pressure on these families when they can't work and and don't have the alternative to keep a job because they don't have child care so i'm i think the enhancement adding kinship families and the grandparents grand families over 65 would be an enormous benefit to families excellent thank you very much and i know miss engel also is living the reality and the truth of each one reaches one so often we talk about the sacrifices of the grandparents uh when they're taking the grandkids and that's certainly one perspective in a real perspective i'd also suggest that it's an investment not just a sacrifice but an investment of the most important currency we have the currency of love and sometimes as i read scripture it says love isn't just the emotion it's the commandment it's a commitment to do something and certainly i think you've demonstrated that commitment to do something good on behalf of those you love and i i hope that when we walk away from this hearing today we don't think of it just from a sacrificial perspective but sacrifice and investment leads to a healthier human being who happens to be related to you and that's all good news so i really do appreciate uh and respect your your affinity for doing the right thing and for investing your life your time and your energy and and your resources uh into your grand your grandson's life and to that end i'm going to turn right back because i do like south carolina have affinity for my home state and expertise that halos brings to the table as relates to resourcing in the legislation introduced by chairman casey myself and senator young the informing grand families act it would require states to communicate with grandparents who receive or are applying for tanf provide more information about additional supports sometimes we live in vacuums and when we're busy taking care of our loved ones we don't necessarily have the margin in our schedules to figure out how this complex web of resources actually work on our behalf so to the extent that you could help us understand uh how south carolina through things like the informing grand family grand families act could provide more support to raising your grandchildren i think that would be an enormous benefit right now um often grandparents don't even know they can access tanf and and that can be very cumbersome trying to apply we deal with many families that get rejected and then we help them navigate the system and advocate because they are eligible regardless of income through child-only grants but if they were given more knowledge about community resources any resources any benefits they may they may be eligible for it would be great because what we know is kinship caregivers and grand families grandparents raising grandchildren are less likely to know about resources even when they exist they're less likely to have knowledge of them or be able to access them so utilizing tanf is a way to provide resources for families because many of them do access them access tanf would be a huge benefit excellent yeah thank you man i know i'm basically out of time so i won't ask another question but i will prepare you for another question i oftentimes think to myself that there is a system of social services for our our seniors or for our grandparents and then we have a separate system of social services for our grandchildren who are the younger folks and the chasm between the two might be problematic so if we could figure out how to have a one-stop approach it might be helpful as well

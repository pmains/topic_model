i don't think anybody should be surprised how this trip went it was ill advised i don't know who is is coming up with this stuff over at the white house but what were they thinking to go to saudi arabia to beg them for oil and you're dealing with a cartel they're not going to deal with you what the president should have done is gone to texas going to louisiana maybe pennsylvania or north dakota maybe even go to alaska and deal with american producers where we can increase supply i mean the administration's on the right track they realize there's a supply shortage but that supply should be coming domestically not coming from uh from opec or any of these other countries opec plus that this administration seems to want to deal with other than dealing with american producers you bring up a great point the conversation should be had here at home yet the president goes there to a country that he openly said he wanted to make a pariah on the global stage right and he talks to mbs the crown prince um he brings up the horrific slaying of jamal khashoggi um he's asked by a journalist nbs you know are you responsible for this and he smirks essentially i think that kind of says it all yeah and you don't fist bump pariahs i don't know what kind of image they were trying to portray there but for what president biden said on the campaign trail about what he was going to do with saudi arabia and then we've got this vision in everybody's mind of him fist bumping uh the the prince there and it's just it's a bad image it's something that shouldn't have happened it's like a junior high mistake this administration is uh is on the wrong track and what on earth possessed them to think it was going to be a good thing to go to saudi arabia to negotiate with the saudis when all americans you know i saw a poll that said over 90 percent of americans believe that they or they have concerns with food processes they have concerns with energy prices we realize that we have the energy here we just need to develop it but all this administration wants to do and the left is they want to put roadblocks into domestic production and then no go negotiate with people that we shouldn't be negotiating with you don't negotiate with a cartel congressman a lot of this is about the green energy push right senator marco rubio was on hannity last night and he talked about it listen you don't put oil in your car you put gasoline that has to be refined those refineries have been closed in america because you have an administration that says we don't want any more fossil fuels who's going to invest more money in an industry that the president and his party is trying to put out of business and that's the problem right there's been a lack of investment in this industry when it comes to refining for example sir we've needed more refineries in this country for quite some time and that's one of the reasons that we're in the crunch that we're in but as he said no no big oil company wants to invest in building refineries at this point it would be billions and billions of dollars flush down the toilet and you've got wall street putting pressure on these companies not to invest in refineries if you could get past the regulatory hurdles then you've got the investment side of it i saw an amazing statistic just a couple of weeks ago where u.s refineries were operating at 94 capacity you know that's taking into account all of the maintenance outages and everything that's a phenomenal number uh we need more refining capacity but this administration is attacking energy at every level and they're being aided by wall street which is saying you know fossil fuels are bad so it's a barrier that's being put up everywhere you turn you know i was visiting with a company that's building a natural or a natural gas export facility they needed to put about 3 000 more workers on their site this administration while blaming the industry said that they couldn't put more workers on their shop because of tail pipe exhaust from their cars when they come into the parking lot you can't even make some of this stuff up maria and they just keep doubling down on stupidity yeah let me just ask you one more quick question sir house speaker nancy pelosi denying allegations of insider trading after financial disclosures showed that her husband paul he bought as much as five million dollars in ship stocks ahead of today's senate vote to subsidize the industry uh pelosi's office telling fox business quote the speaker does not own any stocks these transactions are marked sp for a spouse the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions congressman i mean this is something that's been going on for years and it continues to go on as a matter of fact yeah we saw this with the pelosi's with the tech stocks we know that americans 70 percent of americans believe that members of congress or their spouses should not be purchasing stocks but this is a pattern that's continually repeated i've never met paul pelosi but i know nancy pelosi and i know that just last night i was speaking at the rules committee trying to amend out a 90 million dollar earmark that she put in an appropriations bill for presidio park there in the lush part of san francisco so she's not beyond trying to play the system to uh to benefit her and her neighborhood there yeah this is a place where the cheapest house is 13 million dollars but apparently speaker pelosi thinks 90 million should go to fix up this golf course it's a good point congressman bruce westerman great to see you this morning thank you sir

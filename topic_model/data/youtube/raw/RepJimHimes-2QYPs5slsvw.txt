mr chairman thank you all for being here today and for your service very much appreciate it at this time um i expressed yesterday a great deal of skepticism about the strategy of uh arming the so-called syrian moderates um it i have this sinking feeling that we're already violating things that we know to be true like starting with the idea that it's generally historically a bad idea to get involved in a religiously oriented land war in the um i still have yet to receive an answer to the question of how a lightly trained uh force will fight two enemies at once ambassador crocker you may be right that we'll be able to convince a bunch of nineteen-year-olds who are seething with hatred towards president assad that what they really ought to do is go after isis i'm i'm not convinced i'm also very very concerned that while we all violently agree that we must not be seen as acting alone here in the eyes of the arab street and on the screens of our television you will see u.s aircraft u.s drones u.s airstrikes and what the one force on the ground in syria will be a u.s branded proxy army maybe in a region where hundreds of years of history shows that plans generally go wrong maybe this one will go right i don't know the the the truly discouraging thing here though is that we the discussion and this is why i really appreciate your presence has to date largely been limited to air strikes alone will not do it we need ground troops but clearly the experience in afghanistan and iraq would suggest that those two things alone don't do the trick of achieving victory degrading destroying all these words that we use you're here to tell us that this needs to be accompanied by cutting off the money diplomacy economic political change in these societies um dr rand maybe i'll start with you is there a single model maybe since the 1920s with kamal out of turk in turkey is there a single model that suggests that we can achieve the liberalization social economic the where sectarian uh fights can be ended and a true stable nation state can emerge in the last 90 years can we point to a country where all of what you call for has actually achieved the objective that we know to be essential to the defeat of these people thank you very much this is a great question and i appreciate you raising the issue of the longer term viability of liberalization and security in some of these states in terms of the historical question i would point to periods of liberalization in the arab and muslim world dating back to the 1920s the post-independence period there were nationalist movements that have arisen all over the arab world that have fought coherently not on the basis of tribe not in the basis of sect anti-colonial movements so there are examples of instances where folks have put aside their differences whether religious secular tensions or sectarian tensions um to try to build nation state and build institutions um which can just specifically sure there was egyptian uh liberation movements there was north african anti-colonial movements in the 1950s and 1960s isn't it fair to say those have really been the exception to the rule and those have lasted 10 15 maybe 20 years on uh tops um the the maybe the impetus towards liberalization movements have lasted that short time but the the drive towards a national state identity has endured in many of these places can let me let me ask a similar and related question ambassador crocker i'd love to bring you in here societal change without which this is not going to work is going to presumably require the ascent and the cooperation of the leaders involved here syria saudi arabia iran iraq just to get to the court here is there any evidence that any of the leaders of any of those countries are on board with the idea that there should be political and economic change the kind of political and economic change that you're calling for a very very important question congressman and let's let's face it and no one knows better than this committee there is nothing easy about any part of what we're dealing with uh you know among the hard questions is taking a look at our regional allies uh virtue well all of them are are are monarchies and if the egyptians come in you can add one autocracy so what do we do do we put primacy on building a coalition with those who have supported us in the past or do we put primacy on affecting change in their societies as we deal with a hot war against what i consider a an existential enemy of the united states hard questions um uh fortunately i no longer have to answer them i can just sit here in opine well today you do you know my vote would be you you work with the partners who will work with you and who have historically been allied with you um part of the tragedy we're facing um as dr rand notes there were these movements principally post world war one in in most cases but they did not prevail the monarchies did not prevail the so-called republics that succeeded the monarchies in places like egypt and iraq in the 50s did not prevail the fragility of the arab state system cannot be understated uh oddly enough the strongest states the most stable states right now um are the monarchies uh the same ones that fell in the 50s so again we're just gonna have to make some hard choices here um as the world's leading democracy but also as the country that has to lead the fight against uh an enemy that would love to get to western targets thank you thank you mr chairman thank you mr maybe that's a good

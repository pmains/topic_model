but Republican congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida thinks Kairos needs to go the other way and add to the President's powers to control trade we welcome represented gates to work now coming to us from Capitol Hill so thank you so much for joining us sir oh well thank you and I know that Senator Grassley is worried about his Iowa farmers we all want the same things more access to international markets the question is whether we get that access by having other countries negotiate with 535 members of Congress at one time or whether we create a water a broader scope of authority for the president that would create a deterrent environment whether other countries would be less likely to impose tariffs and then giving those great farmers I know senator Grassley cares about more access in Asia and around the world so in short compass explain what the legislation you support would do yeah I'm one of the sponsors of the reciprocal trade Act which would give the president the authority to impose any tariffs on another country if that country imposes that very tariff on us for example India has a 50% tariff on American motorcycles we would then have the opportunity to impose that same tariff at the president's discretion if this legislation were to become law and again David the goal listen to have more tariffs it's actually to have a freer trade environment but if other countries knew that our president could go to their level of a tariff they would be less likely to discriminate against US goods so it's to pursue that point about lower tariffs would you favor going the other way as well if another country had lower tariffs than we do would you favor our lower in our terrace those those such as trucks for example from Europe I do believe that the president ought to have the authority not only to impose the stick but also to offer the carrot in circumstances that you've described and I think that those would go hand-in-hand his reforms what about the Constitution because estrogen ultimately really gives a lot of authority to the Congress when it comes to trading relations and it is the traditionally given up a lot of that now I think that the Congress can impose a benchmarks for example we wouldn't want to give the president the authority to impose higher tariffs than another country imposes on us and so I think that we need regular dialogue and back and forth we need the folks who are engaged in the administration or really any administration's trade policy to regularly brief the Congress if they exceed the length of their leash that can always be yanked back but I think that right now we're in an environment where the United States has largely been taken advantage of and trade we've viewed trade not as a as a way to build up the American worker but as a way to ingratiate other countries to the United States and often that's been at the expense of the Forgotten men and women in this country who want to go work hard and have their of products treated fairly in the global square so so Congress can give us a sense of what you're looking for in the State of the Union address tonight on the specific subject of trade because I've read some places at some if I can call them trade Hawks are worried the president might get a wobbly here on China there may be backing off some and in fact he should be more aggressive is that your attitude I have no concern that the president's gonna be anything other than tough on China he understands China for the threat that it is and really for the first time in the post-world War two ERA you've got a president who is understanding the fusion between economic and strategic and military interests in our relationship with try at China as for what we're expecting for the State of the Union this really is the kickoff to the 2020 campaign the president's gotta build his coalition by exciting the base on immigration and border security and then at the same time appealing to those Rust Belt states you know oh hi oh Michigan Pennsylvania Minnesota Wisconsin this election in 2020 will be won or lost in the Rust Belt and I think that's why trade is such an important policy for him to emphasize in the State of the Union tonight congressman you also mentioned border security just now let's talk about border security the wall whatever it really consists of exactly what do you expect the President to say on that subject and let me be very specific are some of your Republican colleagues starting to back off of the president's position no I think that what the president will do is point out the hypocrisy with members of the Democratic Congress who have in the past supported border security and barriers and fencing and walls but now they choose not to do so largely because it is viewed as a political win for the president and so I think that the president will call for unity on immigration but the tools he will use to call for that unity will be the specific examples of votes and positions that Democratic members of Congress have taken that are inconsistent with the views currently held and I think that hopefully will create some I also expect the president to lay the predicate for the utilization of emergency powers if that becomes necessary I don't think he'll invoke those powers tonight but I think he will make the case for their proper use in the event that the conference committee is unable to produce an acceptable work product congressman do you think you have a good sense of where the American people are on this subject cause it was a poll just came up with CBS for example that said the really substantial majority of Americans are not willing to shut down the government again over this wall whether they're for it or against it they don't think it's worth that is that what you think the American people are in a weird way the last shutdown as painful as it was paves the way for action even if it's executive action following the State of the Union because you're right the American people do not want to shut down and I think that they would view the president's use of his executive authority as preferable to another shutdown and that may be the only way out of this give the president a win on his wall give the country a win on avoiding the shutdown and then move forward addressing trade and some of the other issues that I think will be central to the 2020 campaign congressman thank you so much we always benefit from your being with us and really appreciate it that's Congress Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz

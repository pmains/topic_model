mr chairman i appreciate this hearing happening but my farmers and producers are not talking to me about climate change issues they're talking to me about the ever soaring input costs the how is this administration how are we in congress addressing those high costs and inflationary pressures what is the biden administration doing to tone down the rampant spending and reports just this week show average gas prices in the us have risen 22 percent and that's just in two weeks uh and yet the biden administration refuses to uphold the renewable fuel standard uh an immediate solution to lower emissions and reduce costs at the pump inflation is now at over eight percent ag input costs are rising as i mentioned and showing no signs of slowing and it's not just that this administration has abandoned our farmers in so many ways be it through pushing a new regulatory regulatory scheme with their lotus rewrite abandoning the president trump's navigable waters protection rule creating new obstacles for pesticide use and failing to follow through on existing trade deals the ag economy is hurting across the board they are concerned about whether or not they're going to be able to afford to plant a crop this year and look we can always talk about addressing climate change issues i mean america deserves credit and our farmers deserve a lot more credit for what they've done to reduce greenhouse emissions can any of the witnesses please tell me and and speak to the way inflation these input costs and maybe even these reckless policies make it impossible to predict what a market looks like months from now let alone a year from now when we start talking about this farm bill our farmers want to know if they're going to be able to survive before we get to the next farm bill mr connor would you like to respond congressman davis thanks thanks for that opportunity i do not disagree with you that the the coffee shop talk today is not climate change it's it's world events it's fertilizer prices it's a number of things that are literally you know sort of in your face and and i concur with that i will say though that um we find great interest uh to our from our producers when we start talking about climate in the context of incentive based in the in the context of additional resources and revenues in your pocket and you know that is in desperate need out there in rural america given the challenges that we face farmers need a better shake and we're doing this uh right now to try and give them that and we wouldn't you know we wouldn't be sitting here addressing these concerns if it didn't have that strong strong potential associated with it on the biofuels front you know i i'm i'm well aware of what you're saying you know the the number of um uh facilities out there that are offering you know the higher octane uh blends is dismal out there in rural america and we you know we're missing a great opportunity there you know we we need that infrastructure you know and some of those investments we are talking about in in this climate debate you know to to raise that numbers because right now we cannot have much of a market impact when i believe the figure is like 3 000 retail outlets out of tens of thousands of outlets actually offer these higher blends and that that's totally inadequate we've got to change it yes retail atlas are not going to invest in in offering new choices if they don't know if the administration is going to follow the existing law under the renewable fuel standard there's no certainty how in the world can you expect somebody in the private sector to make a business decision when they don't know if decisions here in washington are going to actually follow the law and that's what's frustrating to us i mean we've heard promises from administrations in the past in the current administration about what they're going to do to help help our ethanol producers what they're going to do to help our our farms they're they're not doing it and that's what's frustrating we're we're kind of a spin cycle of whether or not to be able to get these products out into the marketplace mr outlaw did you want to make a comment on the input costs or any of the other issues that our farmers are facing well obviously we've done a couple of studies one from for uh congresswoman lutlow on impact to fertilizer prices on all of our farms and it's been it's been huge uh and we did some analysis just looking at nitrogen as well and it was big the honest answer is is that i hope that the prices that the futures market is reflecting come true because if not we're going to have a big disaster because prices the costs have gone up uh in some cases 20 to 40 percent across the board for different types of commodities and that will put a lot of people in very dear dire straits it's going to put them in dire straits imagine you know if we had to compete against our our global competitor where we see war ravaging in in europe and imagine if there weren't any issues with the brazilian soybean crop but that cannot be permanent and we cannot allow these costs to be permanent i yield back mr chair

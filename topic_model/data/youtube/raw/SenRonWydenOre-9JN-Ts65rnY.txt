senator wyden thank you madam chair and let me come in you madam chair in the bike vice chair for the way in which you put the focus in this committee in a bipartisan way and I commend you for it and it's all the witness table I thank you for your outstanding service has been extraordinary year let me start with you if I might director clapper with respect to Iran I've come to believe that Iran's leaders are not going to give up their push for a nuclear weapons capability unless they believe it's going to cost them their hold on power do you share that assessment center widen actually that comports with the intelligence community assessment that this if the decision is it is made to press on with the nuclear weapon and there are certain things they have not done yet to eventuate that that this would be based on a cost-benefit analysis starting with seen the supreme leader's world world view and they sent to which he thinks that would benefit the state of Iran or conversely not benefit so that's I think precisely where he is and it will be done on a cost-benefit basis and and we don't believe he's made that decision yet what what could convince them in your view that their hold on power is being undermined by their nuclear effort well the I think you know a rest of population because of the economic extremity country of Iran is incurring if you look at the plunging value of the rial if you look at two indicators I think are important in the extremely high unemployment rate in Iran this I think could give rise to resentment and discontent among the populace and does not say there haven't been other examples elsewhere in the region now on another subject mr. director you referenced a recent report that describe how foreign spies particularly those in China and Russia are stealing our economic secrets can you give us some sense of what types of Secrets these entities in China and Russia are most interested in stealing well the report you refer to as an ass encounter tells is the executive report that was issued this fall which called out Russia and China for particularly China on their wholesale plundering I guess if you will of intellectual property and of course they seemed most interested in our technology obviously if they can save themselves the time and expense of doing R&D on their own and just steal it from us that works to their benefit so to the extent that they can penetrate unprotected industry networks which they've done unfortunately with the industry networks mr. director do you think are most vulnerable I think it's across the board I think a lot of it's driven by what they can get access to but I think it's pretty much card watch obviously the more high-tech for them the better and so this is a serious serious problem let me move to a third topic mr. director in your view could the peaceful revolution in the Arab world have happened if repressive governments in the region had been successful in censoring Twitter Facebook internet search engines and electronic communications well in some cases they tried to do that I I i am not sure the success of these upheavals if you if you will were completely dependent on on social media i think the basic problems in this region but particularly economic repression of political freedoms and all that thing would it would have bubbled up anyway I think the social media simply helped foment foment and amplify that resentment when people understood it was a large collective so I think the social media certainly facilitated it but I don't think without it would not have happened and of course some of the government's reacted to that by a tenth their attempts to suppress such communications I I won't continue this to the one ask something of a mr. Goldberg but I don't know how the word would have gotten out I mean if you look for example at the way phones are tapped in the region and a variety of other approaches I don't think the word would have gotten out and that's why I'm going to ask you a question if I might mr. Goldberg as you know there's a discussion now in the Congress about whether or not internet search engines should be involved in a censorship approach in terms of dealing with intellectual property specifically are you concerned that if that is done here this could be a precedent which could make it harder for the State Department to go forward for example with secretary Clinton's internet freedom in the shift I've come to feel in a minimum it would be cited as a precedent that if it's done here you could have repressive governments around the world say look at what goes on in the United States they're supposed to be the leader in terms of freedom now we'll pick up on it are you concerned that this could possibly be a precedent I think that we're always concerned with many conflicting strains when policy and legislation is being discussed about the internet and about how to solve various problems with the distribution of information as well as how to protect private property as is going on in the Congress at the moment the Secretary of State Secretary Clinton has made very clear that Internet freedom is a very important principle and the overriding principle as we approach all of these issues and I think when we consider whatever precedent is being said whatever legislation is being considered that that's the primary interest that we need to consider we also need to consider though and the administration has spoken about online piracy and how to deal with that very serious issue and that this can be done within the in a way that protects those freedoms but also that is going to not change the architecture of the Internet let me wrap up with you director clapper on an issue that I've asked about before at this open hearing a general petraeus knows about this is the question of the use of force and a speech that was given by mr. ko Harold Koh the State Department the lawyer and let me know at the beginning it's a matter of public record that the intelligence community sometimes takes direct action against terrorists and this direct action sometimes involves the use of lethal force and as you know director ko gave a speech outlying outlining our policy with respect to various terrorist groups you talk about detention talked about the use of unmanned drones and noted that under US law the use of force against terrorist groups is permitted by congressional authorization while under international law it is permitted by America's right to self-defense but in spite of having asked about this on a number of occasions and General Petraeus you know that I to share the chairs view with respect to your working with us here on this committee and you're being forthright I've not been able to get an answer to this specific you know question and I would like to know whether that speech that mr. ko gave contained unstated exceptions for intelligence agencies with respect to counterterrorism it does not so it applies to all components of the government involved in counterterrorism Viet military or non-military are there other exceptions other than counter terrorist activities well I believe his speech dealt with counterterrorism so you believed that his speech the text of the speech because this would be important applies to all agencies it applies the intelligence community his entire speech the overall thrust of the speech applies to all the intelligence with respect to counterterrorism yes thank you madam chair thank you very much senator Wyden

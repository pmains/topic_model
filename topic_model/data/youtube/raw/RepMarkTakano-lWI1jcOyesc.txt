right and that's representative mark Takano who joins joins us live now from Washington congressman it's really a pleasure to have you on the program thank you so much for your time it's my pleasure you know you have a very interesting story yourself as a japanese-american I mean you didn't even know that you had family members who were impacted by the bombing until you visited what 14 years ago tell us a little bit about your experience when you visited Hiroshima and did that compel you to encourage President Obama to make the trip himself why absolutely in 2002 I made my very first trip to Japan at the age of 41 I encountered a second cousin Kiki way takagi who you know was a 12 13 year old middle school student at the time the bomb dropped I learned to my surprise that she was a survivor we knew her in the United States as a post-war immigrant and together we went to the peace museum for the very first time and she had you know most of her classmates perished that day but she stayed at home because her mother said that she was sick and she lived on the rather outskirts of Hiroshima and so as we crossed the Oh Tagawa bridge on the day that we were to visit the museum for the first time for each of us she pointed to the river that we were passing and said you know they say that you couldn't see the surface of the water because of the many dead bodies that were floating and I thought to myself at that moment that every world leader who controls a nuclear arsenal should come to Hiroshima to understand and fully fathom the destructiveness of these weapons and do you think to that very point that there is a lack of understanding particularly among the strongman of the world and and and and leaders in general I mean how does going there seeing the realities impact somebody well it for me it was to meet someone's my own that I had we had never had a conversation with her about it and to not have it be an abstract fact in a book someplace but to actually connect with somebody that I knew I think for every leader a strong man or someone who controls it at the Arsenal to actually walk about the city to fully in the concrete understand just how you know what Ground Zero was and you know just what actually happened in Hiroshima to walk through the museum look at the the effects the consequences of what they might what they could possibly do I think I think it ought to be a moral imperative that every leader of a of a nation that controls nuclear arsenal come to Hiroshima and follow President Obama's brave example it's one thing to understand history but to physically be there and to talk to people and to understand the consequences that still linger today is obviously a crucial to experience but when you talk to your family back in Japan you know and as President Obama gets ready to visit Hiroshima and make history how important is that visit for your family well I can tell you that I when I gave a speech on the floor encouraging the presence ago my father who is a rather typical Asian father typical at least for me he's very not very mostly demonstrative but he texted me after he saw my remarks on the floor and he said I'm proud of you son you've done something that is very important for our family and is very important for the people of Japan and the Japanese people I spoke to my my cousin Kokua and she she told me that the the Japanese people are just so excited that the president has come that's a very meaningful to them and again I was just going to ask you about that you've said that this could be a healing visit expound on that I mean what do people in Hiroshima think of America today Americans today well of course the Japanese people and the American people couldn't have a stronger friendship there's a there's a strong alliance between the two nations and it's such a powerful example of what can happen to two formerly fierce enemies what it means to you know the Japanese people in terms of healing is that I think they're hoping that the president is going to focus attention on Hiroshima focus on what happened but really in toward a hopeful future of peace and stability and the hope and the hard work that needs to be done to make sure that a nuclear weapon is never ever used again and I have to ask you this you know especially with the headlines today and the politics in the u.s. you know we have a presumptive Republican presidential nominee who's called for Japan and South Korea to have nuclear weapons you know who's called for a ban on Muslims and have insulted some ethnic and racial groups in the United States yes someone whose families experienced the horrors of a nuclear weapon your family was also I think your parents your grandparents spend time in Japanese internment campuses there were victims of course of scapegoating and racism as well coming from that background and then hearing this rhetoric today in America how does that make you feel as an American citizen well I'm in disbelief that we have to reteach the lesson of what it means to scapegoat people my own family suffered the loss of property extensive property because of what happened and for another reason that they looked like the enemy they weren't the enemy I have grand uncles who served in the American military in the fame 442nd infantry it was an insult to hear Donald Trump contemplate that the internment of japanese-americans was something that we should repeat today and his anti-muslim remarks are in my mind a departure from our American values and his nonchalant comments about arming Japan and South Korea with nuclear weapons potentially fomenting a nuclear arms race in Asia this really shows me that he's nonchalant cavalier about his foreign policy I don't think such a person has any business being taken seriously as a candidate for the presidency of the United States strong comments yeah congressman thanks so much mark Takano thank you we're very very strong comments and appreciate you coming on the program thank you for your time my pleasure thank you for having me

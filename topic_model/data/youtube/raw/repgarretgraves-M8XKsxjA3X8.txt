there was conversation earlier about about the again the 9 000 permits and and and the impact that this is having um mr chairman there there's something called a letter of authorization that national marine fisheries service has to grant in order for energy producers in the offshore to to to be able to actually produce energy or to be able to do seismic surveys and things along those lines these normally just take a few weeks but national marine fisheries service has delayed these things exponentially and as a matter of fact they recently came out or i say recently in february they came out and acknowledged that quote erroneous estimates resulted in miscalculated projections and the impact of activities in the gulf of mexico involving rarely cited species let me give you an example maybe it was like this activity is going to impact walrus or maybe maybe polar bears that that you may be shocked to learn we actually don't have in the in the gulf and so it's another example of this administration their mistakes that are that are causing an impact and are delaying production of energy this is this is why they're they're even though we're at the highest percentage of permits that have uh that have ever been produced that's why we're in this situation that that we're in right now so so we do have we do have an amendment amendment number four says that the bill cannot act uh restrict access to critical minerals on federal land or increase reliance on foreign nations with human rights issues mr chairman the reason we've proposed this amendment let me be clear we fully support we fully support increased deployment of renewable energy which needs to include solar and wind it needs to include wave and geothermal it needs to include hydro it needs to include nuclear energy including smrs and next-gen nuclear and it needs to include oil and gas because the byte administration's own projections indicate that there's going to be a surge in oil and gas demand globally like i said developing countries nearly an 80 percent increase in demand moving forward and so rather than doing what this administration is doing where they're shutting down the twin metals mine shutting down the resources we need to deploy renewable energy in the united states rather than what the admissi this administration's doing we're just what was that yesterday or day before the biden administration comes out and says that we are actually going to eliminate tariffs for solar panels that are being transshipped from china china right now manufactures 90 of the solar panels that are being sold around the world 90 you know what we want solar energy too where it makes sense when it's economically sustainable and it's environmentally sustainable this administration is not just going to other countries for oil and gas they're going to other countries for renewable energy sources too whether it's the critical minerals and the rare earths or it's actually the production of things like wind turbines or things like solar panels you can't make this stuff up if we didn't learn our lesson that this administration committed to triple our dependence on russian oil now we're gonna go and say hey we're gonna get all of our solar panels from china which which juveniles are running this place this is crazy we're gonna go from one authoritarian regime to the other and we're going to be dependent upon them and give them leverage over our economy and our national security this isn't funny this is serious stuff and it's incredibly dangerous look i make mistakes all the time but i try to go back and acknowledge them and fix them this administration keeps doubling and tripling down on the stupid decisions that have got us in this situation mr chairman i'm gonna i'm gonna actually say something that that i don't think i've ever said before and i i hope i never say again let's let's take this moment okay in this instance i actually think i agree with senator schumer senator markey senator cantwell and senator menendez let me explain in a letter that they said a while back they said the current run-up in world energy prices is effectively a tax on every american family's discretionary budget except that the money goes to the opec cartel rather than the u.s treasury let me say it again it's pretty rare that i actually agree with those senators senator schumer senator markey senator cantwell and senator menendez but you know what they got it right this is a tax on the american people and the profits are going to opec they're not coming to the u.s treasury because this administration is blocking domestic energy production i urge adoption of the amendment yield back

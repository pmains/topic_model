last Friday marked two years since President Biden who was sworn into office and I think without question one of the biggest failures in his first two years in office is the absolute disaster we have at our Southern border if you look at the the data statistics the numbers tell the story December was these largest month single month largest number of people who were apprehended trying to uh I should say who attempted illegal border crossings and that was over 250 000 people the number of gotaways is now 1.2 million people and the last three months has averaged 70 000 per month so the numbers continue to just get worse the president finally finally took a trip to the southern border and um and obviously what we're anxious to see now was what he learned on his trip and is he actually going to do something because talking about it is is one thing but actually doing something to address this crisis is is I think with the American people are looking for and that's a solution and there are lots of things he could do I mean starting with just enforcing the law that would be a very simple place to start he could reinstate remain in Mexico policy he could quit trying to do away with the title 42 policy that has given our border patrol agents at least some aware with all in order to stop people who are trying to come here illegally he could end Catch and Release and he could finish building the wall there are a whole series of solutions many of which are very obvious to I think a lot of people that the president his administration so far at least had been unwilling to to entertain but this is a disaster it is a humanitarian disaster it is a law enforcement disaster it is a national security crisis if you look at the number of people not only the number but the types of people who are now coming across our Southern border it's a solution which cries out or a problem which cries out for a solution and this Administration as I've said before has been entirely missing in action and it is high time that they engaged and tried to fix this problem and those are a number of solutions that I think would work

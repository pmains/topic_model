hi it's congresswoman jan chiakowski i know at the end of the last plans and pans i said i would be gone for a week at the time that we were taping that the tragedy the unspeakable act that took pa took place in ubaldi uh texas um killing 19 children little school children up to uh first second third grade unbelievable and two teachers were were killed some of you wondered why i didn't mention it because we didn't know it hadn't happened at the time or maybe it was happening at the time and as outraged as you are i think that reflects the way most americans are feeling and also fearful what do we say to our children child all children that i'm sure have heard about it may be talking about it to each other what do we say i asked a mom in evanston illinois what she's saying to her her child and she said i don't really feel like i can say don't worry you're perfectly safe i'd love to hear some of the things that you recommend that you might say to your children who are frightened now at school but in the meantime we the adults have to act we the congress of the united states has to act now as you know and i'm sure you're thinking it's really not sufficient the house of representatives has passed a number of pieces of legislation most importantly i would think is the legislation that 90 percent of americans support and that is to require universal background checks and even that at the time could not pass the united states senate think of that not only going against common sense but going against the will of most of americans we also passed a bill that closed the charleston loophole what that means is that right now while those that are getting background texts if it hasn't been approved in a certain number of days then that person can get the gun anyway um and what we did was close that loophole loophole and say no you you had to be able to get an approved background check there was no waiting time during which you could actually get one so um you know we've done a few things but obviously it has not been enough we have introduced important other legislation including a ban on assault weapons and i would love to see that that's really at the top of my list why do we need military weapons in the hands of citizens any citizens when are you going to use a military-style weapon isn't it enough that there are legal guns for hunting um that people have for uh for for self-defense although you know there is already evidence that if you have a gun in your home for self-defense it is more likely that it will be used against you than in your in your favor but in any case the idea of an assault weapon is just totally unacceptable and we should absolutely get it made illegal in the united states of america so i think what we need to do is vote in the congress in the senate as well you know the yes if they can come up with some sort of a compromise that would be great i know some of our senators are trying to work together to come up with something but in any case we have to have significant votes and if there are some senators who decide to vote no let's keep a list of their names let's hold them accountable as more and more children more and more people are dying now you know the governor abbott from texas has criticized loudly the city of chicago and our governor but governor pritzker really pushed back he said you know abbott was talking about the number of deaths and shootings in the city of chicago and governor pritzker made absolutely clear there's one reason for that and it is not because the city of chicago or the state of illinois is lacks in its gun laws oh no we have some of the best anti-shooting laws gun laws in the country it is because the majority of guns that are used in crimes in the city of chicago and around the state of illinois come from adjoining states yes on a weekend you can drive into indiana when there are gun shows you can open up the trunk of your car and you can load it up with guns we don't check people at the border between indiana and illinois and they can come across and that is why we need federal gun laws and it is time to act and we need to hear your voices we need to hear your voices loudly even those of us who support this uh the these these really important gun safety laws it would be useful to help to to hear from you but it would also be useful to make sure you call people in other states that you know where we need to get some votes to change this in um states where it is easy to carry openly carry a gun and do states where there have been these mass shootings and it seems like they're more and more and more frequent and we all need to vote in elections elections really matter the people that we choose to represent us at every level we want them to support common sense gun safety legislation we need to do this we need to act now we need to act on behalf of the children we need to act on behalf of the people the many people who commit suicide with guns because they're so available the many people on dangerous streets in cities all around our our country the youth that have easy access to guns this is the time for action i'm committed to do absolutely everything i can as a member of congress and as a human being to stop the carnage thank you thank you for watching my video make sure you subscribe to my youtube channel and

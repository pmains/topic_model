senator marshall thank you madam chair let me follow up on senator scott's uh concerns the people back home having an allergic reaction to the policies it's actually an anaphylactic shock that the people of this nation are having you know my grandma had many old sayings and one of them is that two wrongs don't make a right two wrongs don't make a right and certainly i was not here in this body with the reconciliation package but the arguments is basically what what i'm hearing from the other side is that two wrongs would make a right when i hear my friends my colleagues across the aisle talk about health care we agree on so many at the same goals so many the same goals that we want every american to have access to health care and i think they do i really do think that they do we share that same common goal and there's always opportunity for improvement i'm i'm so proud that any hospital i was affiliated with any clinic we did saw every patient we never did a wallet biopsy we saw everybody and we took care of everybody i was so proud to help sponsor health departments county health departments that use local state and federal funds and and to provide free family planning clinics wherever wherever i worked um so proud when i got to congress to help fund community health centers which do a great job i just don't know where people would come off saying that americans don't have access to health care you know because i think that they do i do think that they have access to health care and that's again the goal we had the goal we share in common is how to have access true access to meaningful health care at an affordable price and that's why i came to congress one of the reasons was to make sure that we had quality health care at an affordable price but where we disagree is on how to get there one solution would be a medicare for all socialized medicine and mine is the the opposite where i want to give people more choices but drive down the cost of health care i think we all acknowledge the cost of health care has is just almost unattainable it is absolutely a nightmare for so many people the cost of health care i'm glad to see medicare advantage prices stabilizing that's a that's a situation where we're giving people more choices and it's driven down the price of health care and stabilized prescription drug prices the prescription to drive down the cost of health care is more transparency more innovation and consumerism consumerism being letting patients be consumers again otherwise we're going to end up with diluted health care rationed health care and lack of innovation several colleagues have mentioned the innovation of new vaccines miracle vaccines that have saved millions of lives the ability of a pharmacy to have new drugs that instead of a person having a liver transplant we have a medicine they take once a week for 12 weeks in it and it cures them of hepatitis those innovations aren't going to happen if we overreact and we put too many lids i think we we need to talk about the true cost of what's driving up the cost of health care a meaningful discussion about the cost of prescription drug prices and who's making that money we need to talk about the administrative burden that we've created in health care where we've seen the numbers of health care administrators go up exponentially in my career in medicine but the number of physicians staying flat when we talk about driving down the cost of health care i'm shocked to think that we want to pull the rug out from under the positions who ran to the sound of the battle and saved so many lives and we want medicare reimbursement cuts for physicians going forward this year we already have a shortage of positions we have a shortage of nurses and our policies exacerbating that i do think there's very meaningful discussions that need to be had in this but two wrongs don't make a right thank you madam chair thank

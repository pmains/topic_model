Iowans are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of prescription drugs a teacher in Farragut who's had diabetes for 20 years is spending over $750 a month for insulin that's a third of her take-home pay and she needs a second job just to cover her costs a woman from West Des Moines wrote to me that her medication used to cost fifty dollars for a 90-day supply and now that price has gone up to $1,000 and her family found they can buy the same medication in Canada for $60 in fact Americans pay more for prescription drugs than any other country in the world brand-name drug manufacturers are gaming the system to reap profits and they're using delay tactics to prevent generic companies from bringing the same drugs to market I ran for Congress to protect Iowans not Big Pharma and this bill will help bring generics to market quicker to lower the cost for consumers and save billions in taxpayer dollars no one should ever have to decide between putting food on the table and taking their medicine and I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs for all Iowans and Americans I yield back

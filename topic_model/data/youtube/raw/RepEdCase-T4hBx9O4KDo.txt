this okay looks like we're max dotted it's not going up anymore so uh wisdom go ahead and let me know when i'm good to go just let people in and let me know when everybody's in okay waiting on now [Music] looks like you should be good to go okay um good morning and aloha to all of our colleagues uh throughout hawaii i'm congressman ed case here with congressman kaialii we are both as you can tell um in hawaii for the week uh back from dc after a busy uh first uh start to january and then we're gonna go back to dc next week but we've got some time here to catch up with you and we want to do the same thing we did with you last year which is cover uh federal funding uh opportunities for all of us this is obviously a critical part of our jobs and it's a critical part of our overall effort uh throughout hawaii state state and county governments as well as non-profits as well as other organizations who are all beneficiaries of federal funding in some way shape or form and many many throughout hawaii are recipients of federal funding or are entitled to receive federal funding our observation is that although there are many many opportunities oftentimes the opportunities are not widely known in hawaii sometimes people are intimidated to go out and chase the opportunities and so our mission here today again this year is to spend some time with you to describe to you our work in federal funding the opportunities in federal funding the challenges and the ways that our offices can help you uh to do what we all want to do which is to serve the people that we serve and so uh congressman canelli and i are going to spend uh um a little bit of time here just kind of walking through some basics i know some of you have joined us before some of you are very familiar with the subject and some of you uh this is uh this is real beginners uh stuff you're all welcome from that perspective we'll probably start from the beginning on a lot of stuff so apologies if you already know it but it's it's good to repeat it and it's good to get it out there um so with that our agenda i think you can do the next um slides skip a couple there uh to the agenda slide next one although that's a beautiful view of washington dc we're going to introduce you to our congressional offices we're going to give you a little bit of an overview of the 117th congress which is the current two-year congress that we're in we're halfway through we are each going to describe our own uh particular committees that we serve on which are uh give us tremendous opportunities to help we're going to talk specifically about probably the largest single opportunity uh for hawaii in literally a generation and that is the one trillion dollar bipartisan infrastructure investment in jobs act uh that was uh signed into law in mid-november uh we'll we'll update you on covet 19 we'll talk about constituent services and then we're going to going to turn this over uh to you so thank you again um and it is a real pleasure for me to to introduce um my colleague and partner in congress uh who is just finishing up uh really about as good a first year as as any freshman member of congress has has ever had um kaika so over to you congressman well mahalo congressman case and thanks so much for uh those kind words in that introduction and um you know it's an honor for me to be here with all of you you know right out right out of the gate hauli makahiki ho and happy new year to all of you and um really looking forward to to working with you this year in congress you know like congressman k said uh you know we work really hard for hawaii and and i think myself and my team uh have got some pretty good accomplishments that we've worked hard on but it wouldn't have been possible in all honesty without congressman case's mentorship and his team's support working together with my team i think this is one of the first times in a long time uh that there has been incredible synergy between both members of the united states house of representatives that represent hawaii not just at the member level but also at the team level um our staffs work very closely together congressman case and i meet weekly uh we were perfectly positioned uh in terms of the committees that we serve on for 117 congress and uh you know i just want to say how much i appreciate his his mentorship and helping me prepare for this year this webinar uh and the opportunity to to do this the second time after we did the first one last year is really his idea um he's been there for a while he's the only member who's ever served in both cd1 and cd2 but he also serves on a very critical appropriations committee which he's going to talk about and he knows how important it is for um not just members but also our states and hawaii to prepare for the current appropriations bill we'll talk about a little bit about that uh but again mahalo for joining us we hope you get a lot out of this we're looking forward to your questions and uh i yield back to my partner in the house congressman case um thank you congressman i i should have mentioned up front uh that this is being recorded uh so notice everybody that this is being recorded so that we can use it more broadly um switch the next slide and perhaps uh kai you could just introduce your office real quickly and then and then i'll take over from my office you bet so um uh my or hawaii's second congressional district office is is the first time uh in the history of the office where the district office is not on the island of oahu and that was something that i felt really passionate about you know growing up on hawaii island uh and i moved the office over to hilo and we have a great staff there uh the most important person in hawaii that could be your belly button and connection to the district office my deputy chief of staff [Music] many of you know him uh but ikaika takes care of our operations uh here in hawaii in washington d.c ikaika's partner is christy wagner she is our chief of staff you may or may not know her i encourage you to get to know her she is a waiakea high graduate she is the daughter of coach bob wagner she has been in washington dc for over 10 years and served on for various principles on various different committees so i would encourage you to get to know her and finally in the dc office uh the most important person for policy is your legislative director and that would be connor smith uh she is also ties to hawaii punahou graduate very very smart and uh if you have any policy related issues um connor smith is the legislative director and there is all of their emails and contact information and back to congressman case okay next slide wisdom can you put it on over to my slide yeah there you go um similarly to congressman cahelli i organized my office and and let's go back to just one basic here because sometimes people don't exactly know how this works um we do we do represent specific legislative districts obviously with two of us we represent half the state each my district at present um is the first congressional from makapuu and i say at present because we're in a reapportionment year and our districts are going to change a little bit my district is the the city of honolulu proper really if you want to think about it that way it runs all the way from makabu point all the way through honolulu all the way up to the border of wahiawa so it takes in mililani and mililani malka and then comes on down through waipahu ewa beach kapolei and goes all the way out through kolina to kahe point at present that's 750 000 people and congressman khali as the rest of oahu plus the rest of the state all the way out to midway by the way so he's got um uh probably one of the bigger biggest legislative districts uh in india in the country um the reapportionment uh commission is probably gonna just adjust uh the line a little bit out by uh koholin a little bit because both of our districts grew at roughly the same pace in the last 10 years so there's no need to really uh monkey around too much with with the districts that basically been this way since um since the beginning although we represent uh districts uh functionally we each represent the entire state uh that's the way we look at it we look at the fact that we you know there's no way to split you know honolulu from kailua kaneohe and and nowhere to split oahu from the other islands and so uh we will usually be working jointly with each other on behalf of the entire state on functionally at large uh representation so there's there's no there's no concern uh with you know him working in my district or me working in his district we're all in one team we all try to get the job done um the way i organize my office is that like most members of congress and like congressman cahelli i do my legislative uh really national legislative dc work in d.c on capitol hill and then when it comes to trying to help hawaii with our federal government i really do that kind of as a partnership between my my dc office on capitol hill and my my district office which is right here where i am right now in downtown honolulu and then i do all of my individual constituent services out of honolulu proper uh the folk the the ways to contact me are are on the side here um the easiest way into my office is just case.house.gov my website all this information will be there my two senior staff members are tim nelson my chief of staff he is in washington dc um tim has 20 plus years now in the federal government he actually started out with patsy mink and then when i took over for congresswoman minky he stayed with me throughout my first term in office and then came back and joined me in my second term he runs the whole office uh but he's particularly focused on on congress and the legislative and the appropriations side jackie conant is my deputy chief of staff uh jackie also started out with congresswoman mink and joined me for my first sermon and came back for my second term and she runs my honolulu office and really for on the ground quickest entree into my office especially at the state and county government level jackie is where you should really start because she'll she'll be able to cut through it all and get you to the right people in my office right away um if an azkoved permits she is also always on the ground here in honolulu while i spend about half plus with my time in dc okay let's go to the next slide let me just give you a quick overview uh from my perspective and congressman kelly will have his own on on the big picture we obviously in congress uh um face all kinds of issues uh you know we're obviously facing for example the crisis in ukraine right now um and we have you know china challenging taiwan we have a million domestic issues uh that all of which process uh and our desks and in congress in one way shape or form but these are the areas that i think are are the big picture of areas that are on my desk uh for for this year uh first of all again as i said uh congress operates in two-year cycles and so we are in the middle of the 117th congress that that means the 117th time that congress has convened since since congress started convening in the in the 1700s and we have just started the second session um obviously um second sessions are slightly different uh than first sessions uh for one main reason and that is because um in the united states house of representatives everybody has to run again every two years and so in an election year you face a little bit of a different rhythm in terms of the timing of congress oftentimes the intensity of issues just because the election starts to crowd in on you but nonetheless our job is to get our work done and so um first second session we've still got to deal with appropriations we still have to deal with the issues of the world and of the country and so we are beginning the second session but um not as much time on the legislative calendar to really get things done in the second session the national issues no surprise at all we all face an incredible cost of living uh escalation across the board that impacts us right here in hawaii in various ways from from fuel to food to energy and beyond the entire country is feeling that there are many causes to this some of them national some of them quite local for example some of the housing issues are kind of more local than national but happening at the national level just accelerated and worsened here in hawaii and we've got those things on our plate covet 19 is still with us we have spent two solid years now with that being our number one priority that's not going away we may be possibly coming over the top of the peak in terms of omicron but there are other variants out there and we don't know what the future holds in terms of covet but what is certain is that our federal government needs to continue to stay very closely involved with covet and to help where help is needed and then finally um this is a national issue again i reference this because although we've already passed this bill the challenge is now to implement it uh a generational reinvestment in our physical infrastructure um that was very much on congressman valley's plate because he was and is a member of the committee of jurisdiction and he'll talk to that uh but for me um on a national basis uh national issues is to get this uh bill fully um fully fully implemented and the money out we're already seeing hundreds of millions of dollars committed to hawaii um and that's a key area that we can all work together um locally of course red hill is on the tops of all of our minds uh from from my perspective uh we really have a short term midterm uh long term um time frame in terms of red hill the short term is the immediate emergency the immediate price is getting people back into their homes getting the water uh safe again so that we can again drink it use it feel confident in it uh the midterm of course the stabilization of the facility itself uh the safety uh necessary to to de-fuel as the state's order uh requires and in the long term of course the the future of red hill how did he feel that how to find alternative fuel sort storage sources for for our military the all of all of which requires our attention right now is as i think you have seen the entire congressional delegation very deeply involved in red hill and then finally and we'll get into this the annual federal funding process because whatever else is happening with the rest of the world uh we still go through a yearly um appropriate appropriations process for our federal government every single year regardless of what's happening we've got to fund the government again so we do not have the model that the state follows of one two-year bill and then supplemental appropriations we do it every single year um from scratch i mean obviously not from scratch because we have a lot of what has happened in past years but uh we do it at you every year okay congressman do you have anything to add on kind of the big picture of of of your congress yeah i think i'll touch on two major issues before we go to the next slide uh because i'm sure people are wondering the status of the build back better act uh you know congressman case mentioned earlier the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill uh that's that's real hard infrastructure money and and if we do nothing at least three billion dollars coming to hawaii for hard infrastructure the social infrastructure piece is the bba or the president's uh final piece of his um of his vision for the country and that's in the build back better act uh the house of representatives has passed the buildback better act we've sent it over to the united states senate unfortunately it does not seem like there is um the votes currently in the u.s senate to pass the house's version of the bba so we're waiting to see if um members uh that have issues with the current uh draft of the the bill that's sitting in the senate are willing to break the bill up into smaller more manageable pieces um that the white house and some of the more conservative democrats in the senate can support that's a really important bill for hawaii it's one that we worked on all year long it has um you know uh generational changes uh that can really help hawaii universal preschool for every three to four or five-year-old child in the nation reducing the cost of prescription medications incredible investments in climate change and things that can help hawaii be more resilient to climate change investment in sustainable aviation fuels to um you know combat the use of coal and oil in um and fossil fuels so there's a lot of things in that bill it's very disappointing it has not passed the united states senate yet and um and that's the current status of it the the second thing i'll make mention of is the status of the continuing resolution which congressman case can speak to that's basically the appropriations bill the current budget right now is a continuing resolution which means we're operating on last year's budget or essentially president trump's budget until the 18th of february when the continuing resolution expires so right now the the congress is quickly looking toward being able to pass an omnibus bill which means all of the appropriations bills has won instead of 12 separate bills but it is possibly looking like we will probably have to pass another continuing resolution because negotiations have started late so how does this impact this year's appropriations it's difficult to start fy23 without having a solid understanding of how fy22 shakes out so all appropriations bills will probably be running a little later than usual and congressman casey sits on the very powerful and very important appropriations committee um i'm sure we'll speak a little bit to that but that's what we are operating under uh right now okay great thank you next slide okay um i talked to this a little bit but again just to set the stage in terms of our rhythms um as as your congressman uh the rhythms of the the congress uh and how we uh look at the opportunities uh to help hawaii um a couple of things uh first of all i already mentioned that we are we we function on a two-year congress so the very beginning of january to two years later um our current uh congress uh started on uh january uh third of last of last year um three days uh before uh the attack on our capital um that was congressman kelly's welcome to washington dc um and then it ends um on january early january of next year when the 118th congress kicks off from the perspective of the annual federal funding process we function on a fiscal year that starts every year on october 1st this is the federal government and we are currently in fiscal year 2022 which started last october first 2021 and runs until this this september 30th 2022. um now in the normal course uh we start somewhere around six months out from the beginning or i should say farther that nine months out really at the end of the prior calendar year on working on the next year's appropriation bill so for example for a fiscal year 2022 which started on october 1 of 2021 last year we actually were working on that already way early next year and actually at the end of the last congress i was already working on that that that's because it takes a long time to put together a 1.5 trillion dollar federal funding bill and you need every opportunity you can get to influence that bill along the way including outreach back to hawaii to identify exactly what the needs are in hawaii and how you can match the funding opportunities to those needs in the appropriations process and so the house in fact passed and congressman cahelli referred to 12 bills we split the appropriations bill up into 12 separate subcommittees on the appropriations of committee and take each of these bills up individually obviously they they all add up to a federal funding bill but we fund our departments based on these individual bills so for example we have the homeland security subcommittee which does the department of homeland security we have the appropriations defense committee that does the department of defense bill and these all get passed and then uh homogenized so that they fit together and meet an overall number uh along the way um and so we did our job in the u.s house of representatives last year we we worked very hard early in the year through the appropriations committee and passed all of our appropriations bills they have been hung up in the senate and in a negotiation over a number of various issues and we are forced in that situation to as congressman kelly said pass a continuing resolution which is a fancy way of saying while we're busy doing the job we should have been doing to start with we are going to spend the same amount amount of money on the same programs as last year and so we are now already four four months into the new fiscal year without a federal funding bill and operating on last year's uh continuing resolution which which is a first of all a tremendous problem because the bill that we passed last year was a great bill including a lot of good stuff for hawaii we want to get that one passed um and also it just wreaks havoc with federal programs that that are that uh become very hard to to to plan for and that also impacts funding at the state level because states get affected obviously by federal funding not being there or being uncertain and so we're in a very difficult situation right now that is impacting all of us we're trying to get that solved in the meantime we are working already on fiscal year 2023 which starts um this year on october 2022 and we're going to go through that whole cycle all over again and i'll get into that a little bit more on appropriations that's why we want to reach out to you early in the year because we are both um focused not only on finishing fy 2022 but we are working already on on fy 2023 there are some regularly recurring bills that we also watch these are bills that come up every year or every couple of years and and you always want to watch the cycles of these bills because uh you only have your opportunity every you know number of years to really influence that particular um uh part of the uh federal government it's much harder to get things done kind of in the intervening years this year we're watching three uh major bills these are these are not technically spending bills they are bills that authorize programs and authorize spending uh the basic authority before you get to the money um the national defense authorization act is an annual bill it governs the entirety of our military it's a critical bill for many many different uh reasons uh congressman kahele is on the armed services committee that he'll get into as well as senator hirono who is on the senate armed services committee and they forged the ndaa which gives us major uh influence on issues such as red hill and we've used it to that effect um the farm bill is our the the um the authorization of our agricultural programs across our country this obviously has a huge impact here in hawaii and that farm bill only comes along every five years so when you hit the farm bill five year mark and you know the farm bill is coming up it's time to focus on agriculture and that's what especially congressman cahella is doing because he's got most of the agriculture in hawaii although obviously it impacts all of us and i'm involved in it as well and then finally the water resources development act is essentially the authority for the us army corps of engineer projects and these projects only come along for authorization at least in the kind of the usual course every seven years and so we're in a word uh we call it word up we're in a word a year and so we're all focused on okay what are the core of engineer projects that we need to get in the pipeline for hawaii these would fall primarily in the area of flood control we've obviously seen flooding throughout our state and coastline protection where appropriate and then finally um we also focus our legislative efforts uh through individual bill introduction just like in the the city council and at councils and the state legislature um our calendar is a two-year calendar so we introduce bills we can introduce bills anytime during that two years clearly the earlier the better because you have more time to work on them but they continue uh for the entire two years of a congress and then there are all you know then they all are finished then you've got to start over in the next congress um we're going to talk a little bit then so that's that's kind of the rhythm that we work on uh in terms of trying to help out hawaii uh what the funding cycles as well as the bill introduction cycles as well as some of the bigger picture cycles but much of our work and much of our ability to influence what's going on flows from the committees that we serve on and um this delegation this current delegation i think has one of the best us coverages from a committee perspective of of any of our congressional delegations um ever senators uh shots and hirono serve on major committees on the senate side uh senator hirono on armed services and other critical committee senator schatz is is getting to be a pretty senior member of the senate appropriations committee and then over on the house side i serve on appropriations and i also serve on natural resources which gives me a great deal of say not only over programs affecting our environmental protection in hawaii but it is also the committee that covers the indigenous peoples of our country and so i have a jurisdiction over at native hawaiians which gives me ability to to address some those issues going to turn this over to congressman kahella he's going to tell you about his committees and and what he's up to there thank congressman case you know i will if i can make one note um you know the recurring bills you talked about we often refer to these as must-pass bills and so the nda the water uh the rdra and uh farm bill are must-pass bills so when we're looking to put in language or writers into bills sometimes we look for those must-pass bills to put them into and with the farm bill um being uh up in 2023 you know congressman case and i have already uh conveyed our um our uh i guess uh priorities to senator de la cruz and representative luke uh and the relevant agriculture uh committee chairs in in the legislature because there are there are really important things that the state can do this legislative session for agriculture in hawaii that will position hawaii and will position our delegation to um to do great things for hawaiian agriculture in the farm bill and so i just wanted to point that out the farm bill is coming up next year it only happens once every five years and and we need to get hawaii's priorities into the farm bill okay let me jump to the committees i'm on so i get a chance to serve on two really important committees transportation infrastructure couldn't have asked for a better committee in year one especially when you're doing a one trillion dollar infrastructure bill uh and and that committee has jurisdiction over everything transportation aviation maritime highways bridges mass transit railroads um i serve on the aviation subcommittee and the highways and transit subcommittee on the overall tni committee which is chaired by peter defazio a long-time uh member of congress and subject matter expert on infrastructure and climate change and he's out of the state of oregon one of the things that i worked on this past legislative or this past year was clean water and wastewater management you know coming from the legislature knowing how important wastewater is and the uh state's uh mandate to eliminate all cesspools you know by 2045 or 2050 or whatever that date is uh it's not just that it's also making sure that we have resilient wastewater treatment facilities and besides islands like oahu that have wastewater fees and have modern sophisticated wastewater facilities like sand island and others on this island hono uliuli for example the neighbor islands uh are really struggling with wastewater management particularly on hawaii island and so i'm really working to try and work with mayor mitch roth and the his administration for the east hawaii wastewater treatment facility and other uh facilities like that throughout the state um but beyond that uh the tni committee uh touches everything uh that is really important to hawaii from federal highways roads bridges um airports common use areas through our airports uh the state gets a lot of money for that of course you know we residents uh when we fill up our gas tanks we pay both the state tax and the federal tax the gas tax and a lot of that money comes back to hawaii to to make sure we have money to continue to repair our highways and roads of course we also touch disaster preparedness and response we know all that and how important that is for hawaii we have hurricane season from june through november every year we have earthquakes we have other uh types of natural disasters we have to continuously prepare for and um the tni committee is a relevant committee for that next slide second committee is the armed services committee like congressman case mentioned both senators hirono and myself serve on the relevant senate and house armed services committee this committee is is the policy uh is the policy committee for the department of defense and and its signature piece of legislation is the annual must-pass national defense authorization act uh which which is passed every year for the last like 60 plus years if you remember president trump actually vetoed the ndaa in his last year in office and he was overridden by the by the congress um for whatever political shenanigans he was pulling at the time but the ndaa is a critical bill for hawaii everything from the pearl harbor shipyard um to funding for red hill uh to you know all the different bases and and things that are really important not just here in hawaii but throughout indo-pacom that is part of the national defense authorization act and uh the armed services committee i serve on two key subcommittees i serve in a readiness subcommittee and a tactical airline subcommittee so when you're talking c-17s kc-135s at hickam air force base or you're talking readiness and that's 8 000 people living in waikiki right now because they can't drink their water because their homes have been tainted from red hill that's what readiness is and and so working with the relevant sub subcommittee chairs um who are very very supportive of our red hill efforts as a delegation um you know that's that's where that purview comes into so i have a direct direct b line to indo paycom and of course congressman case does as well but we have the opportunity to talk to top military commanders here in hawaii and we can get the answers that we need whether it's classified answers or unclassified answers and we've been um holding the the navy and joint base for harbor hickam [Music] to the fire ever since red hill kicked off on on the 20th of november so that's uh the two committees that i have the opportunity to serve on back to congressman case okay thank you um i should note also that we have many many different committees throughout congress and although we are able to influence areas where we serve on committees as already discussed we obviously have to participate and develop relationships with all of our different committees it's pretty routine for us to appear for example before other committees to to talk with our fellow members that are on those committees to to try to help them with their issues on armed services or appropriations and hope that they will help us with our issues on their committees and so the the the effort to to achieve legislation and to help hawaii and the federal government kind of starts in many ways with committees but is much broader than that i want to talk about my major committee which is appropriations this is the oldest committee in congress it is responsible for federal funding it is and let me let me make this one distinction unlike at the state and county government level we have a a two-fold approach to federal spending in the federal government the first is the is the authorizing committees and so these are all of the committees except for appropriations the authorizing committees are responsible for what it sounds like authorizing the programs creating and authorizing the federal programs but they do not for the most part have the right to direct the spending for those programs so the idea is um that you've you've got to have committees that specialize in these areas focus on actually putting the programs together well but you have to centralize the spending otherwise it gets out of control and uncoordinated so the spending itself focuses through appropriations and we're responsible for really what to authorize what to actually spend on the authorized programs and so that's where appropriations uh fits into the big picture senate follows the same model and so the house and senate committees obviously have to work together to direct overall federal spending i've already talked about some of the stuff on the slide here appropriations uh i covered the first part about the fiscal year um second uh federal spending must start in congress under our under our constitution in fact it must start in the us house of representatives under our constitution and so that's the that's where the appropriations process starts u.s house appropriations committee the administration does not have the right to independently um create and spend on federal programs the the authorization and the appropriation has to come from congress now we have fights from time to time about whether the administration can redirect monies already appropriated but you can't independently appropriate um we split our federal spending uh into what we call mandatory spending non-discretionary and discretionary um mandatory is spending that's going to happen it's already authorized it's going to happen absent some sea change it's going to happen year to year we don't have to do it through the appropriations process classic uh mandatory non-discretionary spending would be social security um we don't we don't appropriate social security every year that that is set up it's self-sustaining it continues on similarly with many of our benefit programs including our veterans and so we obviously have to oversee those programs and adjust them and ensure their sustainability but but um this is not part of the normal appropriations process but discretionary is everything else and that does have to be authorized and and um or more accurately has to be appropriated every single fiscal year and so that all starts in appropriations okay next one um just to try to give some sense of what we're talking about in terms of overall federal spending this is fy 2021 so this is the federal fiscal year that ended on september 30th of last year fy in 2021 so a full year total amount spent by your federal government is about 6.8 trillion in all spending so you can see the breakdowns there and this is distorted because um as you can see uh that was the heat of of uh kovid that was the heat of the uh numerous uh federal bills dating back to the cares act um in 2020 to the american rescue plan in early 2021 and then a number of other bills in which we spent somewhere in the range of six trillion dollars in two years uh to basically save our economy save our country save our communities from the from the effects of covet 19. and so this is a very distorted um year uh but nonetheless it's it's a it's a it's a glimpse of where we spent our money in one fiscal year um that coveted piece amounts to 2.8 trillion dollars so it was about half of the total spend so far um but the um you can see that the mandatory spending was roughly 2.1 trillion dollars on social security and everything else um interest alone um is now a huge is a growing uh portion of our overall spending that's half a trillion dollars in interest every single year that number is higher than it was and it's because we're borrowing so much we've borrowed we borrowed all of that six trillion dollars and we have to pay interest on it and so this is a great concern if the interest portion of your total budget starts to overwhelm the the overall budget then you can see defense discretionary and non-defense discretionary at ten percent each but even that ten percent each amounts to one point four trillion dollars okay next slide so this is taking uh federal discretionary spending so take out take out the interest take out covid take out uh mandatory spending and this is the 1.4 trillion dollars where does it go um from a federal perspective uh defense 48 that's a huge uh debate ongoing uh throughout our country uh whether that is you know a sufficient uh percentage whether it's much too high whether it's much too low it has been at about this figure for several years now and that's one of the key issues that we're dealing with in terms of appropriations because you recall that president biden came in and said and i think correctly that we're spending uh too much as a percentage of overall budget on defense and not enough on on other stuff and so this is just fy21 and you can see that the rest of it is pretty split but uh clearly um labor health human services and education is is one of the is the second largest that's our social safety net but some of these areas are pretty small when you look at them as a percentage of agriculture for example interior uh much too small from my perspective but nonetheless even two percent of 1.4 trillion adds up to a fair bit of money at the end of the day next slide okay i'm going to turn this back over to congressman heli to start to get into kind of the weather river meets the road in terms of how this money gets to hawaii what happens how we can help you on it sure thanks congressman case so the you know federal grants that come to hawaii are are really really important because they touch you know every fabric of our our society and then there's a lot of money that is on the table um that that can come to hawaii you know one great example of that is the infrastructure investment and jobs act or the infrastructure bill that includes really really solid examples of successful grant applications you know typically our state's operating budget like you see on the slide is about 14.4 billion dollars there's almost three billion that come to the state through federal grants that come to hawaii and so it makes up about 19.6 of the state's operating budget university of hawaii is a major recipient of federal funding that comes to hawaii you know one example of that would be the native hawaiian education act there's about 80 80 to 90 million dollars that come to the state for native foreign education um many of those grants ultimately go to the university of hawaii and other organizations and also to the state and their native foreign education program another example is the native one healthcare act and and monies that come to the state for native wine health care that help fund papa lokahi and the native one healthcare system throughout the state so um i would highly encourage and and i think congressman case and i have been saying it for uh at least the last two two months since uh the infrastructure bill passed is um it's not just the three billion dollars that's coming to the state for hard infrastructure and what i hope the legislature will prioritize its projects and the governor will prioritize how that money is spent uh it's you're not gonna spend three billion dollars in in one year and so the the expenditure of these funds and the projects that these funds can can complete are going to be multi-year but the grant opportunities are really really important and so um i would i would highly encourage uh not just the legislature but the different executive branches and different relevant county and and agencies across the state to look at um priorities in your district's priorities uh where we're working with the congressional offices we can help uh identify federal opportunities um that we can bring back to hawaii one example is wastewater there's 250 million dollars or 50 million dollars a year for five years in the infrastructure bill that can go to wastewater and so whether it's helping east hawai'i's wastewater treatment facility or or helping pahala and lehu build a wastewater treatment facility plant out there there are federal grant funds available but you have to apply for them and you have to be able to write them and you need grant writing capacity to write them some of the best grant writers uh in the state are at the university of hawaii and so working together with them we really need to build our grant writing capacity in the state be able to identify where our state needs critical investments and uh apply for those federal grants and then work within our congressional delegation and our staffs to um to push for and source those grants from the relative federal agencies that are expanding those grants and so that would be um what i would cover on this slide as as you can see one of the the biggest sources of funding in federal grant to come to hawaii is at the very bottom and that's medicaid just a quick note on this slide before we go to the next one and that is that this is fy19 we just don't have an update at least a concrete update here the percentages will be roughly the same but some of these uh uh various areas have seen significant increases in their total amounts um because frankly they've just been been doing a really really good job of of of looking for obtaining federal grants and i think are completely open and available to each and all of you for advice on how to get these grants the one that i would point to is the university of 40 they have a pretty tight ship uh there in terms of understanding of federal grant opportunities and obviously um you should you should access their their knowledge uh and connections uh can we go to the next slide and uh i think um congressman kelly this is just a snapshot of the of the same slide as to the city and county of honolulu um which obviously shows kind of a significant amount the reason uh the reason that federal funding for the city and county of honolulu as a percentage of overall budget is much less than the state of hawaii and this is same of all of the counties is just because a lot of the federal funding comes through the states some of it actually gets distributed by the states to the counties but there's there's far less direct federal funding to counties than there is to the states so to the counties out there the same old story but having to deal with the state sooner or later um congressman kelly anything more on that nope okay next slide okay so let's go to um how to start to talk a little bit more directly about how how we can help you uh the major area that we can and want to help you in is the appropriations process every year and we both operate very very full efforts at the beginnings dating back six nine months before the start of the fiscal year to getting your ideas on appropriations and to making sure that we understand where and how we can try to solve your problem in washington dc so this is this is our schedule that we are following right now on the appropriations process usually by the beginning of february we know what the president has to say and that's important to us because if the president is going to leave something out of the budget as president trump did when he tried to zero out the east west center as an example then we know that we need to prioritize there to to get the money restored which which we did um this year it's going to be delayed for a number of different reasons i we both have deadlines uh for providing your request to our office so we can at least take a look at it we've got to get those in and start to work on them and prioritize them in some way shape or form um this is all on our websites uh my deadline is february 15th coming up in a couple of weeks and and congressman galleys is march 1st um april 15th is a budget resolution which sets the overall funding levels uh and then we are full on into it in april may and june and appropriations we try to get them out by june and july the house has done so the senate has not in past years and we've got to finish this all by september for the end of the fiscal year and the beginning of the next fiscal year um i should say here because it's not on our slides that um the appropriations process is not the only place that we can assist you with federal funding um it is the it is the best place to get upfront with it um but there are many many federal programs out there that uh are we fund on a on a larger level and then it's up to the states and the counties and others to actually obtain those funds from the administration at that point the money has left congress it's in the administration and these funding opportunities are classified as a programmatic program funding which happens fairly automatically for example a lot of the highway monies are are allocated to states by by by metrics uh you know how many miles of roadways how many passenger uses we often have issues with the federal government on on their metrics and whether they work for us but the funding itself is going to be pretty automatic but the second area where i think frankly we're falling a little bit short is on competitive grants and so these are grants that that are available to be to be obtained but you got to compete for them you got to make a case for them uh and really this is where we think we can help the most is to is to get an increased focus on competitive grants and we'll get to that in the bipartisan infrastructure uh bill uh in a second next slide okay this is this is my uh my my kind of process my my my request in terms of of your your appropriations uh inquiries and requests to my office start early start talking to us early folks that are interested in appropriations uh you know have been talking to me for months already that are familiar with the process a lot of these are multi-year efforts and so you know you don't get it one year you go back and try the next year try to get as much information as you can about exactly what you want and need and where the possibility is for for federal programs we try to match an appropriation to a program itself an existing program we can help you with all of that but obviously the better uh prepared you are when you start talking to us uh the the better it's gonna be for both of us and then we do have forms um that are on our website to make your appropriations requests um this is not because we're trying to be you know difficult but because this is the information we need to make those requests to the appropriations uh committees um okay next one um congressman kelly you want to talk more specifically about um bip and then roll into any of the grants that you want to talk about yeah sure i mean it'll be uh kind of already talked about the infrastructure bill um you know it is a you know congressman case framed it uh correctly it is a once-in-a-generation type of bill um that that has eluded many presidents and many congresses in the past that have not been able to get an infrastructure bill done president trump was not able to get an infrastructure bill done uh but this congress did and you know it was bipartisan um uh unlike other bills that that are partisan like the american restaurant but this was one bill that everybody could agree on and that's because we just have not invested in infrastructure in this nation for years and years and years and it's why we have here in hawaii have a d-plus when it comes to our infrastructure when we're rated you know nationally and so uh structure bill is to eliminate uh the majority of lead pipes uh throughout the nation something that i know is really important it was a key part of governor ige's state of the state yesterday and kudos to bert lahm and the broadband who and all of you will do participate in that um is providing more high-speed internet access and um making sure we have our rural communities our we're stitching our rural communities together with broadband so that's a big part of the infrastructure bill of course there's there's components of the american rescue plan and parts to the infrastructure bill that offer a subsidy to dhhl homesteaders that live on homestead lands but when looking at better roads and bridges that's really important right we if you live on maui or you live on the big island you know how important those bridges are up and down hamakua coast and out in east maui and we have uh many of those bridges are from the plantation you know generation era gone by and they need major investment and when those bridges go down they limit weight they put rate restrictions on them and they severely affect um you know the movement of goods and commerce and people throughout throughout the islands what's important for roads and bridges is you have to work with ed sniffen and the department of transportation and if you're on oahu or maui your respective onpo because if a project that you want to do in your community it's not on the stip or the tip which is the state transportation improvement plan or the transportation improvement plan then it then it cannot qualify for federal funding typically there's an 80 20 match but but it's really important to work with them uh you know i was working together with the leeward coast elected officials out there on makaha bridge something that's been uh talked about for a while well that that has to be on the stip in order to qualify so make sure you work with dlt and ed and jade and make sure that they know where your priorities are um investments in public transit there is no money in the bipartisan infrastructure bill for the uh rail rail project um and and that uh was not part of our conversations but upgrading our airports and our ports we got a lot of money for upgrading our airports especially the common use areas like runways taxiway lights and and ways that we can improve infrastructure so of course working with rossigashi marvin muniz on maui and all the other airport managers throughout the state are really really important i already beat uh wastewater infrastructure talked about that quite a bit uh electrical vehicle chargers part of the infrastructure bill is to convert um electrical vehicle charging stations at post offices across the nation and to electrify the grid so not only to replace usps vehicles and convert them to electrical vehicles but also provide the charging stations for them as well we need to upgrade our power infrastructure of course here in hawaii resilient infrastructure and coastal infrastructure is really important and then finally investment in environmental remediation um you know a great uh well one you know example of that is what we're dealing with here on red hill and you know the radio situation isn't just unique to hawaii right we have environmental remediation projects all over the nation um that that need to be uh properly remediated and the the money in this bill will be really really big for hawaii to do that carson casey anything else yeah we're estimating on uh the bipartisan infrastructure plan right out of the box that uh hawaii would be eligible for somewhere in the range of three billion dollars to help our infrastructure across the board of these uh buttons but that is primarily uh program funding so funding that we would get fairly automatically what we want to do with this is to maximize our competitive grant approach so that we can maximize these these monies which are not going to come around again at least in you know my service in congress and so we want to we want to use these as as as well as possible i sent yesterday or or i'm sending today to the governor every mayor and every state legislator and every county council member a letter outlining a competitive grant and to the cabinet members of the state and county level a letter that outlines competitive grant opportunities under bip and i strongly encourage you to take a look at that and chase those those possibilities because again this is an area that we um we just have had a generational um uh success and and um it's it's a tremendous opportunity and you know um a couple of the areas that i think congressman ellis spoke to many of the primary priorities uh the one that i would highlight is broadband uh we need to help on on broadband uh many parts of hawaii that need broadband coverage including in urban honolulu many people think that this is a you know another islands uh issue uh and it's not it's all over the state so um go to the next slide and and congressman kelly oh i'm sorry if i could uh congressman i wanted to cover up one other thing that i that we haven't actually covered thus far earmarks um or as we call it now congressionally directed spending um here marx we tried in the appropriations process this year after many years of not doing earmarks because of abuse allowing each member to direct specific spending to specific projects under very specific and tight controls our websites describe earmarks they they have a lot of safeguards to abuse has to be a local sponsor etc etc fully documented and both congressman kelly and i were successful in the earmark process to uh earmark very specific uh spending to very specific projects for example um you know just to pick one um i the the blood bank of hawaii is building a new headquarters and and i tried to help them with very specific federal funding which was in our appropriations of that bill um that is at risk uh because of the negotiation between the house and the senate over fy 22. um the effort was a very good one we don't know if we're going to get to the end of the of the of the road on these earmarks but we are likely going to be following the same process for fy 23 and so certainly where funding doesn't particularly fit into a federal program or is particularly urgent or particularly unique we may have that ability to request it again however we don't know whether we're going to ultimately be successful we've got to make the effort okay over to you uh next slide and uh congressman if you could take this let me just add on a quick point congressman case so like he mentioned you know earmarks um what we now call community funded projects um they did they did away with that during uh uh budget the budget tightening controls uh about 10 years ago senator inouye and akaka they were part of that well that came back this past year under very very stringent controls and tight controls and so i had an opportunity on tni to look at surface transportation projects to the tune of about 18 million that i could uh potentially designate uh projects like wine repaving wine anyway avenue on hawaii island or addressing a bridge issue on maui after the rains in march those were able to get into the tni infrastructure bill but once they went over to the senate the bill was redone he took those out and unfortunately it wasn't part of the fifth the second part of that is the community funded projects congressman case is talking about which is the appropriations funded projects and both of us had to go through a stringent process and to make those public and i posted a link for my community project funding request on my website or on the on the chat there congressman case also has a link that he could post as well but those are still in play we don't we don't know if if they're going to be part of the final appropriations uh bill um but we'll have to see but there are critical projects in there that fund things like mao farms or other different projects throughout the state very very similar to the state's granting a process where you can appropriate fundings to different non-profits and and community programs throughout the state that that can qualify and meet the highest stringent standards of qualifying for a federal uh community project of uh community funded projects so you can click on that link and you can see the ones that uh i was able to get in and are currently in play now we're crossing our fingers we can get them we can get them through all right congressman back to you um okay this is your section just to talk about kind of how to go about the the administrative administration that grant price yeah yeah you bet so federal grant opportunities there's the information you know both of our offices are willing to work together uh um with your staff um there's you can go to grants.gov and and those that's a direct link to different federal agencies that have uh um federal grant opportunities um there's a lot of information online um that i would suggest to take a look at or you can go directly to the federal agencies themselves so if you're if you're um senator gabbard and you're looking for a federal grant opportunity for uh industrial hemp um for you know a certain project at the university of hawaii or whatnot through the usda we can look for topics and search keywords to look for federal grants that we could apply for um to address that particular issue so those are that street that's three ways to to look for federal grant opportunities and again we're happy to work with your staff to find those next slide uh defining the grant uh grant application process you know you really need to define your project and get your grant ready of course identify the research funding source you need to prepare for when that grant will open during the application period you can create review and submit the turnaround time is is basically when the grant closes and when they do a final award and then if you are a successful recipient of course managing that award and doing all the necessary federal reports and requirements to draw down on those funds and to to do your annual or quarterly or monthly or annual reports and then the final close-out part of it and beginning again and so um again happy to work with your staff to do this next slide hey um i just uh i mitch hyden reich by the way mitch is for for all of your uh information mitch is my legislative assistant in washington dc and he is in charge of my overall appropriations process and so if you want any or need any follow-up questions that are appropriation specific please feel free to contact mitch directly he also added the information on my own earmarks let me um whip through a couple of last things because we are we've taken a long time to give you our information and we want to get to your questions um so this slide just is a quick update on cobit 19 our our our ongoing crisis i spoke to some of this earlier on the federal government has responded uh in huge amounts for coveting emergency assistance to the states to the counties to our communities the total amount as as i said earlier closing in on six trillion dollars uh over the last two years uh you know better than us that um much of that money uh i won't say much of it because much of it has been spent already but a fair bit of that money in the hundreds of millions is is still with the state and county government and available for allocation of the city and county of honduras just ask for public input uh credit to them for doing so on 193 million dollars of of american rescue plan uh funding that is going to be allocated to uh continued covet emergency assistance we have been tracking how much to hawaii the total is now somewhere in the range of 21 billion small businesses direct stimulus payments unemployment supplementation direct assistance to state and county governments assistance to our to our to our non-profits and community organizations and so that's all good news i think that was critical here's the reverse side of that in all likelihood unless we really see kovit completely accelerate again and start to tank our economy we don't anticipate right now any any con any further uh major uh federal funding along the copa 19 line so um no to the question i sometimes get i don't think that there's a fourth stimulus payment out there although apparently governor eva does have in mind a state payment of some sorts um the possible exception is that we are discussing in congress right now further aid to especially hard hit parts of our economy um these would be the restaurants and our shuttered venues and so our stages our independent contractors uh who in many times were left out of the kovid 19 packages we came in with with programs for them fairly late uh unfortunately um and the funding uh was really not sufficient for their needs so there it's possible that we will supplement some of those programs in the cup next couple of months but i don't know that that's going to happen for sure yet uh okay anything to add okay no i think you covered it all okay um we've talked about um kind of our our involvement next slide we've talked about our involvement on national issues um so the whole range of issues that we deal with on on as members of congress voting for our country we've talked about um aid from our cons from our federal government to hawaii we have focused here um on appropriations and on grant opportunities so in other words money but there are many other opportunities for us to help you sometimes it's just a matter of a program that uh exists and is maybe funded well but it just doesn't work as applied to hawaii um so these are areas that we can also help you with but the third area uh is critical as well and that is individual constituent services uh what we call case work in congress um and this is our effort to help individual folks that we represent uh with their issues with government you know maybe in the big picture um small in the big picture government perspective but the most important thing in their life um and so you know uh whether whether their you know their mother or their brother uh can can finally immigrate from from another country to join the family uh where's the where's the visa hang up we had one a couple of weeks ago where um a a constituent's niece that tragically took her life and we wanted we needed to get her mother from the philippines to come uh to be with the family in a time of need uh that took a lot of you know cutting through some red tape because it's not so easy in the middle of cove at 19. immigration veterans benefits uh there are many many we are anticipating a huge increase in in case work from questions over uh taxes uh you've all seen um the the short the short staffing at the irs which is creating real problems for people on refunds and processing and so these are areas we also want to help you and your constituents with one thing to note here is that this is one of the areas where there actually is a difference between the districts because um the rules of congress uh on the ethics side um restrict us from helping folks that are not our actual technical constituents except them some limited um exceptions where you have personal knowledge of somebody or where you you um you know you you have particular expertise in this area but those aren't going to apply very often and so if you're if you if you need help for your individual constituents um and they're in the second congressional they should contact congressman cahelli and for first congressional you know me we work back and forth all the time between our offices but those are the ethics roles that we're functioning under in this area all right um anything to add on that uh congressman i'll turn it over to you to conclude and and turn us to questions yeah no um you know thanks for hosting this uh you know sorry went over a little bit late but i know we want to get to a few questions and uh we'll just call 11 30 as our as our heart stop but you know the bottom line is uh you know we want you to look at us both of us and our and by extension our staff and our offices as your federal partners uh and we are we are here to work together with you i think it's very important that we have synergy between county state and federal government um and and you know we look forward to welcoming you to washington dc and to meet in person uh especially if you come up to dc for various different conferences and things throughout the course of the year but we're also happy to work with you uh you know via zoom and connecting with our staffs and and one of the things that we're really passionate about is working together with the legislature especially in the legislatures in session to help position hawaii to be successful at the federal level and it's as an example it's one of the reasons why we both co-signed uh a um joining letter to both uh the wham and finchers and the respective ag chairs rare passion and senator gabbard on agriculture parties for the state that we are critical that with the department of agriculture needs to do uh for food resilience food sustainability and to support local farmers and prepare for the 2023 farm bill and so just look at us as partners um of course most of you have our contact numbers to just reach out anytime that being said uh unless you have any other closing comments congressman case will will jump to questions okay um ditto to everything that congressman kelly just said in conclusion but uh to the questions uh so i'm seeing in the chat uh christine from uh christine kubat is that right on recycling recycling is an infrastructure to federal infrastructure bill uh kana from congressman kelly's office answered that additionally for anybody that has any questions about about bipartisan infrastructure programs uh beyond what the information that we sent out we certainly welcome your comments uh your question directly to us so please do that and then uh representative onici has one special to you congressman kelly having to do the mountain view post office relocating the post office off of highway 11. yeah a great question reponishi you know i i've i've been struggling with the united states postal service since since day one you know i've been uh down in in lower puna at the pahoa post office uh watching long lines uh and just inadequate services uh for the u.s postal service so we've been working directly with the most senior leaders uh at the u.s postal service here in hawaii and in the western region and uh your your concerns are the same concerns that people have on moloka'i in keau you know down in down in pahoa especially our rural communities that have grown in size over the years but the post office has not grown or or or met the needs of the community in terms of po boxes or delivery service etc so we're working on it i will forward you a letter i finally uh just drew the line and sent a uh letter to the u.s postal service uh to find out what they do to expand post postal service operations or increase the footprint i'll send you the response that the postal service sent to me about a week ago the bottom line is that there is no direct funding that we can provide for the postal service so the postal service is an autonomous uh agency of the federal government congress does have an oversight role over that ultimately the postal service is run by um the the postmaster general and uh the board of governors um and so there is this target relationship between the u.s postal service they've been running in the red for years um part of it was changes done during the george bush administration in the early 2000s that really affected the um the the budget and how the postal service is is run and but it's something that we need to address because it's a major issue in the second congressional district so i'll send you over the letter and happy to work with you on that especially out in mountain view and um in your district yeah i just wanted to let you know that i'm more than happy to work uh you know a federal government state partnership where we may be able at the state level to provide the land for the relocation as long as you know the post office is willing to relocate and you know before we have a major accident there and you know as you know it's very dangerous i'm trying to get the pahoa post office to move over to the malama market there's adequate space there there's lots of parking there um the footprint they have in pahoa which i know is not mountain view but as an example is just totally inadequate i've set my staff down there a couple times so um let's let's work together on that and i'll send you the letter that they sent me because i've been asking them tough questions sometimes they give me answers sometimes they don't but i've been staying on them and uh i look forward to working with you on it okay um does the bipartisan bill include funding for cyber security harding or purely building the broadband infrastructure i do not uh know that down to the specific level i i would guess it's pretty broad but we can get you that answer if you if you can email like kai do you know that that's that's uh from uh carpool's ecorp you know i don't but uh well you know we we got we got smart hard-working staff you know that uh are sending us messages and i don't know my staff said yes so let us get back to you on that um and um and we'll make sure we answer that uh that question it definitely definitely includes money for cyber security in general yeah economist has uh 47.2 billion dollars for cyber security um but let's drill down and make sure that that includes cyber security hardening and what you're referring to so if you can if you can do a direct uh message to conops you can have your contact information and we'll get back to you now i'm sure brett lam might also also know the answer as well because he's he's dialed into the federal funds coming to hawaii for broadband okay um any other questions either just unmute and ask or or you can do it by chat if you prefer let me ask you this then um and you know again we'd like to take the questions but this is also an opportunity for input what's on the top of your minds right now i mean what what and and uh and and similarly um what what areas uh in this presentation were uh uh particularly uh informative or whatever i mean we're always up for for for seeing how how we did and where and where the information gaps are that we need to solve for you okay well that one's for you congressman dally and you've spoken to wastewater quite a bit um i'm sure that's huge for you yeah yeah we're working on it you know mayor roth and his team are working really hard on it and this is going to be a a project that will require county state and and federal federal support so um we're we're uh we're on it let's see i see other um of our former colleagues on representative hashimoto representative kiyogawa representative sayama any any of you would like to offer a few comments pilate we know you guys are busy there's a five-day bill introduction ends tomorrow so i'm sure you guys are getting all your bills in before the deadline look forward to uh supporting whatever we can we have no um to make you feel bad we have no bill introduction restrictions in congress you can you can do it up until the last day anytime up to the last day if you're if you if you really want to wait till the last day and no limits on how many and no limits on uh foolishness sometimes my friend county of hawaii beth how about you beth beautiful picture of uh mauna kea there monologue beautiful love it i i found this really interesting after having submitted some successful eda grants including the buildback that are regional challenge i think we're really psyched to get some more funding into the county but it's hard work with minimal staff and fighting matching funds is always a challenge um but we're up to it thanks for your help terrific yeah okay one's going once going twice anything else please contact um i any either or both of us with any follow-up that you didn't want to share in front of everybody else um or down the road um we we this is we don't want this to be the last time we talked to you it's not going to be the last time we talked to you uh we're we're going to be with you all through this the remainder of this congress um and uh we all need to be you know working together in the same spirit that i think we all work together very very well through quote 19 for for in for for for for the most part i think it was a it was a good solid effort uh so i'm gonna leave with the congressman kelly to close oh thank you guys so much for your time really appreciate you know giving us an hour and a half of your uh your morning and uh mahalo felicia for the comments and again we're looking forward to working with all of you and just have a great day and let's make it a successful year for all of us so aloha you

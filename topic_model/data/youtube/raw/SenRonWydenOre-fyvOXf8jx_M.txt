mr chairman and colleagues i think i've heard the words aligning incentives about five times in the last 15 minutes and i certainly support that we always hear about it in the context of providers insurers those are usually the two but almost invariably the patient is kind of an afterthought particularly with medicare and senior citizens and i think for example that real behavioral change particularly in this program with 50 million people that a lot of us see a sacred ground i mean i remember working on medicare reforms when i was director of the great panthers we were passing petitions around for what senator rockefeller was working for back in those days so this is really sacred ground and senator portman and i have introduced the first bill to really start trying to come up with some fresh thinking in terms of creating behavioral changes particularly for seniors lowering blood pressure and cholesterol and all that kind of thing mr malloy what do you think about just the concept let's set aside any bills and the like but what do you think about that concept because i think it's really an afterthought that the senior the beneficiary really isn't much part of this discussion of aligning incentives no i i completely agree we've actually had so i personally had some experience with this within the medicaid plans that we uh we served that senator rockefeller talked about uh and we found that uh incentives for encouraging patients to see their primary care physician and have preventive care screenings was incredibly effective i think it would be fantastic to continue to expand that into other marketplaces the new organization that i've recently become affiliated with healthways has a lot of programs that are along those same lines to incent and aligned incentives for patients to have them focus more on the health care or their own health care and improving their own health status i think it's i think it's important i think incentives matter throughout the healthcare spectrum whether it's the patients the the providers or or hospitals um i think as we think about payment reform those are the areas that we've got to focus on to uh to encourage them we we've impres appreciated your support your endorsement for the legislation the health ways group and uh let me take the other side of the coin then if i could for you uh dr migliori with respect to this question of incentives and particularly for us to create a new approach to to bring the patient involved you've been talking about the transparency efforts united has put in to try to get more data and try to particularly get comparative data senator grassley and i have introduced legislation to open up the medicare database so that people could really see what the data was again in an important program with 50 million people now some states have gone beyond that colorado for example has been talking about an all-payer database so that you can get medicare information and medicaid information and private payers i gather that you all would like to see these kinds of approaches that get a great deal more data out there and particularly comparative kinds of approaches is that that correct i don't want to put words in your mouth just tell me how you see this senator that is correct our perspective is is that health care improves when the participants in health care the doctors the patients the hospitals are connected and then informed by the data they're generating themselves to take action you can go beyond that to the other point that you raised earlier is that to then provide meaningful changes in reimbursement so hospitals don't take it on the chin when people get healthier but at the same time providing incentives and foster encouragement to get patient engagement just as dr sax was saying earlier about getting patients engaged taking the health the information that comes out of the health care system analyzing it understanding what it's saying and pushing it back to the health care system is the best way to for us to create higher quality better health and lower cost i i appreciate that and mr chairman thank you for that i think that what the witnesses are highlighting is a lot of these decisions particularly that last point by you dr migliore is we're making some decisions in the dark i mean to really not have this kind of information so that people can have it to make choices just seems to me to be a big gap in this i want to see us align incentives and that's what we've been talking about but let's make sure first and foremost that we recognize that behavioral change starts with people with individuals and we ought to at least have some incentives there and i think what you all are trying to do with data dr migliore is very helpful and i thank you mr chairman

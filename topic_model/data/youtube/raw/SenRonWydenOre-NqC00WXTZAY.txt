in recent years there has been a revolution in how our citizens exercise their right to vote instead of every American showing up in person more and more Americans are choosing to vote by mail using absentee ballots no excuse absentee voting or in the case of my home state of Oregon the entire election is conducted by mail this amendment that I will be offering and I'm discussing this morning that I join senator Feinstein and other colleagues in is designed to protect the millions of Americans who choose to use the post office to exercise their right to vote this amendment protects those millions of Americans from any kind of postal delay that could disrupt their ability to ensure that their vote is counted now Madam President my home state of Oregon has a system in which all ballots are cast by mail in Oregon if the ballots are not delivered by mail to the county election offices by the deadline on election night they are not counted so it's essential to the conduct of fair elections in my home state the delivery of ballots cast by mail not be delayed to prevent the potential threat to our elections from delayed mail delivery the widen Feinstein amendment would place a moratorium on the closure of postal facilities until November 13 2012 in states that vote by mail or allow any voter to vote no excuse absentee it would also require the Postal Service to notify election officials of closings and consolidations and require the Postal Service study the effect of closing or saleh dating and mail processing facility on the ability of the affected community to vote by mail jordan valley located in beautiful Eastern Oregon on the Nevada border is 457 miles from portland with the proposed consolidations the nearest regional processing centre would literally be almost 500 miles away if the united states postal service goes ahead with their proposed closures and consolidations then a ballot cast in Jordan Valley could travel approximately a thousand miles before it reaches the hands of elected officials this is unacceptable for constituents who vote in the far corners the rural corners of my state cuts to the postal service mean that ballots mailed in the final days before an election may not get to election officials in time to be counted ballots sent the weekend before a Tuesday vote may not get into the hands of election officials by the present day deadline of Election Day closing and consolidating postal facilities disproportionately harms the ability of rural residents to have their votes accounted now these issues raised important questions are closing postal facilities and states that primarily vote by mail a responsible approach for me and many of my constituents in the millions of Americans who've chosen to vote this fashion the resounding answer is no this is not a responsible approach closing processing facilities and potentially impacting the delivery of ballots in a general election is a risk not worth it closing postal facilities will have unintended and unforeseen consequences on the impact of elections so that's why this amendment would place a moratorium on the closure of postal facilities until November 13 2012 and states that conduct all their elections by mail or permit no excuse absentee voting to ensure that elections are fair no excuse voting Madam President of course allows any order to vote absentee without having to offer additional reasons for their making that choice placing a moratorium till after the election will ensure that what is done here in the United States of Senate does not negatively impact voting in Oregon California or the scores of other states that make extensive use of mail ballots in their elections I hope Madame president will be possible for us to win bipartisan support for the proposition that ensuring the highest level of voting participation in our country is fundamental to our democracy I hope my colleagues will support the amendment that I intend to offer later with my colleague and friend from California senator Feinstein to protect the millions of Americans who choose to vote by mail

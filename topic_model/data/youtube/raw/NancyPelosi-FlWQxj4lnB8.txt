well thank you thanks the folks are here i uh my my constituents across southern minnesota like all americans they're sick of this it's ridiculous i would have never believed that supervising the high school lunchroom would have been such an important skill set to come here but it certainly feels like that right now um this is not that difficult you've heard it from my colleagues unfortunately the longer it goes on uh you start pitting american against american and last night a very despicable thing happened starting to use our veterans as a pawn in this game the most precious gift those veterans gave us was that very rare precious gift of self-governance the way you honor veterans is you make your government work they don't want to be pitted against their neighbors they don't want to be singled out in this they want to do their job and they want to have the promises that were made to them and their families fulfilled by leaving them behind and putting them into this disrespects everything they fought for everything they stood for and everything they died for and so while you'll find a lot of folks around here there's a lot of folks around here that want to uh preach the sermon of patriotism duty honor country every once in a while you'll find that rare person who actually lives that sermon and with that i'd like to introduce my colleague from illinois tammy duckworth dedicated my life to serving our military men and women and our veterans i owe a debt to them that is far more important than any political party i've been fighting for our military men and women in beds for too long to allow anyone to cynically exploit them in a political brawl and what we're doing at the world war ii memorial with our greatest generation the heroes who serve democracy by using them as a pawn for political stunts is shameful it's shameful that we were using his generation for political gain so i was incredibly disappointed that the majority has attempted to use veterans as political pawns the bill last night was not to support our nation's heroes in fact it cuts more than 6 billion dollars in funds for the department of veterans affairs in a budget that has already passed shame on the people who would return our veterans service with a six billion dollar cut at a time when the need for veterans services has never been greater we cannot keep the government running piece by piece my constituents deserve service from from and access to government i urge the house leadership to end the shutdown today by passing a clean cr and then let's get together to conference on a long-term budget that addresses deficit reduction creates jobs and supports our veterans and our military men and women

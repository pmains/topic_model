last week tens of millions of Americans empowered by the Internet affected political change here in Washington the Congress was on a trajectory to pass legislation that would change the internet as we know it it would reshape the Internet in a way in my view that would have been harmful to our economy our democracy and our national security interests last week the Congress did what the American people called for instead of what the Washington insiders wanted that's what I call real change it was a grassroots victory for the history books and as one commentator said now we are in unexplored territory here's why eight million of the hundred and 62 million that visited Wikipedia took action to influence their member of Congress seven million Americans signed Google's petition to block consideration of pippa hundreds of thousands of Americans called the Congress in all in just one day more than 15 million Americans communicated with the Congress and urged it to reject the Hollywood proposal to censor and censure the Internet the 15 million Americans that took action who signed the petitions who provided their email address zip code and desire to be informed they are now going to be watching us like never before the 15 million that looked up and spoke they're not faceless and they're not anonymous they are people like Francis Stewart of Maryland Nancy Linton from Oregon and Debbie Kern's from east hartford connecticut in John Jewett of Colorado who gave their names to web sites around the country they're joined by millions of other Americans were raising concerns for months before last week's web black out and support the filibuster that I announced here in the United States Senate mr. president almost a year and a half ago among the lessons we should have learned from the events of the past few weeks is the importance of letting the public in on what we're doing there are serious unintended consequences when members of Congress and staff think they have all the answers and rush to construct and pass legislation there are clear virtues and prudence deliberation and even a little humility I believe that's what our constitutional framers had in mind to the United States Senate

we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw the angle has landed everybody welcome back so one of the questions i get a lot is uh like what do we do to fix the va um there's a lot of complaints about the va a lot of complaints about care for our veterans um i'm always sifting through what's real and what isn't with respect to that conversation uh one of my friends a former senate candidate actually gop candidate gop nominee for the virginia senate race in 2020 is uh dan gade so dan gate is uh army lieutenant colonel retired twice wounded in combat uh apparently you didn't learn from the first time man that's right and um but the second injury resulted in your entire right leg being amputated and uh you got a master's in public administration and phd in public administration and public policy from university of georgia you served in the bush administration you're appointed to the national council on disability so uh and you really recently authored a book called uh wounding warriors um to to discuss this you know system that we have and maybe having some tough conversations that i think a lot of the veteran service organizations maybe don't want us to have so it's called wounding warriors how bad policy makes veterans sicker and poorer and um you know i think that probably rings pretty pretty true with me so we'll we'll we'll get into that um so how tell us how actually just give us some a little bit more background than what i read if you if you'd like how did that second injury happen why did your right leg have to be amputated yeah sure so the the first injury uh was november 10 2004 uh i was the tank commander and we've been in this fire fight and uh had engaged and destroyed some enemy uh fighters and then uh this rocket propelled grenade came off the roof of this mosque and decapitated the soldier next to me or partially his name was dennis miller from lasalle michigan and uh i was wounded only slightly i was down in the tank and i cut some shrapnel off of that and and uh so that was not great and then uh two months later i was returned to duty though as mild wounds you know and then two months later i was in a humvee right front seat of the humvee where the commander sits of course and uh we were out doing a patrol looking for looking for bad guys but also doing some tribal engagement with these shakes and i remember we're going down this road and the and i had my rifle between my knees and i'm looking out and i'm like man this feels like a dangerous place because of the way the road was and then i woke up on my back in the ditch and um i remember somebody here i hear somebody screaming and i tried to crawl to him and it was my interpreter he'd been sitting behind me and had uh had uh broken his leg and turned out later but my soldiers i was already on a stretcher my soldiers pushed me down on the stretcher and uh said sir you're the only one and i was like i'm the only one i'm the only one what and i'm like oh crap you know i got wounded again so i lifted my head and i could see my whole body arm was blowing open i could see my guts and but they were working on my legs and i us telling your team earlier and they said it was okay to to tell this story but so uh they're working on my legs and i could see my guts and i'm like oh no there's some important structures in between all that stuff and so i so i said the guy was holding my hand keeping me out of shock he goes i said hey sir i gotta ask you something he's like yeah anything i go you gotta be honest with me he's like yeah anything i'm like are my balls okay so he goes uh i don't know man let me check that is everybody's question yeah let me check and so he goes down to where my pants are blown up and he goes he comes back and he goes yeah dude they're dusting me they look good to me best news i'd ever gotten so i end up you know unconscious in the hospital for about three weeks uh in the icu for about three months and uh about a week after i got blown up my right leg had to be amputated at the hip so i have no femur on that side at all and um and i spent you know about six months as an inpatient 40 some surgeries like that and then uh and then another six months as an outpatient but during that time a couple things happened one is i decided to stay in the army because i wasn't going to let the enemy i was a captain at the time and i wasn't going to let the enemy determine when i got out i wanted to stay and continue to serve if the army would have me and the army said they would totally have me so then the other piece was i saw a lot of my fellow wounded guys really adopting a world view that said hey give me stuff because something bad happened to me and and our society was lined up at the time you know the sea of goodwill and all this they were lined up at the time to give everybody everything they wanted so if you want tickets to the giants game you get to go if you want tickets to the you know you want sideline tickets sideline passes to hang out with dallas cowboys cheerleaders you can have that um and so people begin to respond as anyone does when they're given a bunch of free stuff people love free stuff and so these guys were getting it but what i was seeing from them was a change in their identity from war fighter soldier you know hero in some cases to something darker and and kind of dependent on others in a in a way that i didn't really like and i i hated it i mean it was like repellent to me in part because i have a great wife and she was like look you know i'll take care of our family we have one daughter at the time we have three kids now um she said i'll take care of our family while you're in extremis but when you're recovered enough you're the dad and you're in charge of us of this family and that was a really cool like call to action by her that really kind of helped light a fire in me to get better and to continue to thrive and so this book you know the impetus behind this comes from my personal experiences but also from my professional experiences you know i went um i earned a phd in public policy doing veteran stuff i worked at the white house doing veteran stuff so i know all these people i know all these actors there's an authentic podcast in the u.s capitol that's why you hear these bells and whistles going on yeah exactly um i hope that doesn't mean you're going to have to vote or something but no no um anyway i can't figure out what the hell these things mean to be honest i think it means we've opened up session right like so they're gonna do five-minute speeches or something yeah see i'm getting it yeah yeah so uh um anyway so i was i've seen this professionally and i've seen this personally and i felt like in order to help veterans thrive in order to help veterans see themselves as valuable and for society to see them as valuable productive members of society we need to have policies that support that instead of policies that that cause people to be dependent on others sure and so this book is about uh how to do that yeah this book is about that we'll talk about before we get into the details of that i mean it's it's an important subject and it's uh hard to talk about um politically especially because like you like you noted uh very aptly the the the the general trend is to victimize veterans and like you said give them anything they want i mean i there's i'm not sure it happens as much anymore just because you know it's it's been out of the public's mind for so long but yeah you want tickets to the giants game like whatever you want super bowl i've been to the super bowl because of it uh right after i was injured um i'll never forget that and then i was it was the new orleans super bowl and uh i was really kind of still blind at the time so and i was walking around i tripped on this this extension cord and then the the entire power went out for the entire stadium is that a true story no okay that's better all the power stick with being a true story all the power did go out so i just joke around like yeah i just hit this weird chord and then boom like uh that's better yeah uh but it it's true and like there's nothing wrong with that necessarily i mean that that's not what i have an issue with now i mean but you but you did start to get the sense like there was especially like in the wounded warrior foundation like it's the same group of guys going to all these good deal events that's right and you're like a certain point is is this accomplishing the mission that's right because there's a lot of other guys you know and and um they're not here um and they're worse off than the guys i keep seeing around uh so you know what's maybe maybe there's something going on here and when i was um being medically retired as this is 2016 never forget um you know in balboa hospital in a classroom there going through my out processing for for medical retirement specifically and ever and the only question on anybody's mind was how they were going to get 100 disability it was the only question they had and everybody's sort of working together like how do we do this is this famous like there's one guy that really sticks out my head on this facebook sort of influencers air force veteran who's just constantly peddling this this uh this weight is he like super good looking and like has like this crazy like it might be it overstates all right i mean let's calm down okay i know he's in the air force and all that but no but he's young yeah he's charming like there's clearly there's nothing like there's no indication there's nothing wrong with this guy everybody knows my i don't know his name i don't i can't find him on on online anymore but i mean i'll just never forget how like passionate he was about getting you the hundred percent you deserve but like do you deserve it yeah you know because there's people like you um and who who will never get better right and um there's there's a lot of guys like that who who probably need who probably do deserve that 100 and you water down the standard by just getting it to everybody and then what was also um interesting from that experience was not only was everybody trying to get to this point and every single person in that room had 10 fingers 10 toes and two eyes and right all of it i mean it was a navy out processing it wasn't the army it wasn't the marine corps um nobody there was injured and um i i was i was the only combat injury in that in that classroom of like 20 30 people and they were encouraging everybody to also apply for social security disability insurance on the back end and like that's that was a real wake-up call for me i'm like this is corrupt this is this is blatantly corrupt stealing of taxpayer money and um because that's not what americans think disability insurance is for people think it's for someone who really just can't work yeah that's the point of it now it's obviously it's become sort of a form of welfare over time but but it's just not what it's for um and so you know as you point out the the way to fix this it's the same it's the same philosophy that we use with general welfare reform in america i mean what are your incentives it's a very simple question if you want more of something incentivize it you want less of something tax it and right now we incentivize disability and illness and malaise and we get tons of it and it contributes to the veterans suicide crisis it contributes to uh by the way the way employers see veterans as a potential employment pool in the last 20 years has shifted radically from you know honorable hard-working dedicated disciplined those are the words they used to use 25 30 years ago and now they use words like ptsd damaged um you know uh mentally ill and and as you look at that it's par in part because the veterans i call the in a nod to dwight d eisenhower's military-industrial complex i call it the veteran disability complex or the veteran industrial complex there's all these organizations and people like this air force guy that that we're talking about who make a ton of money and these organizations get their legitimacy out of having as many disabled veterans as possible and in the profession you're in right now uh the left and the right are complicit here because they both buy into the myth well so the left approaches veterans as they're scared of these bsos i mean for sure it's just being scared of being you know tarred and feathered as whoa whoa you don't want to help the veterans it's like i'm just not i'm just saying we don't need to give everybody like a race car well let's help let's let's help them the right way let's help them thrive instead of to be victims but the way the left approaches these veterans is they well first off they see the va as a potential model for their desired universal healthcare system and that's in part but the other thing is they think that we're all anybody who serves in the military john kerry famously said um if you're if you're smart you go to college if you're dumb you end up in iraq remember that story from you know 2005 ish he's not an elitist at all no no no so but the left believes that everybody who joins the military is a bunch of economic draftees who have no other options and therefore and they're victims of this patriarchal system that's building empires overseas right and so they deserve everything because they're victims the right the political right believes that anybody who ever looks at a uniform regardless of the character is the character of their service whether they're a generator mechanic in the coast guard or a you know uh you know their brit slavinsky right metal body recipient seal if if they're um if i said his name right if i didn't please don't kill me um whether no matter the characterization of their service anybody who looks at the uniform is a hero and so they deserve everything and so the left and right come together on deserve everything yeah and the vsos have convinced them that deserve everything is an economic statement whereas people like us know that deserve everything might be something like let's help these people get to a place where they can thrive on their own terms so they can get that self-efficacy that prevents them from eventually harming themselves and of course we have a you know support system not a fulfillment not a self-fulfillment system you know and and that's that's important just again again it doesn't even necessarily has to apply to the veteran community it needs to apply to all forms of support systems in the welfare community so um i mean but the book that you write about is it's how bad policy makes veterans sicker and poorer so so how does it how does it make them sicker yeah so it it pays them to be sicker so i'll give you a couple of examples one if somebody has a let's say a mild form of mental distress you know ptsd is not a condition it's a basket of conditions where there's a basket of symptoms yeah that may be that may be connected to a previous experience or maybe which is very vague it's very big so so let's say somebody has a 30 rating for ptsd what happens is there's no requirement once you get a 30 rating or a 70 rating or 100 rating there's no requirement to continue to seek ongoing care from the va you know what's interesting can we just stop for that you know it's interesting you know what the rating is for you losing your leg and me losing my eye body part major body part pretty sure it's 30 yeah 30 uh 40 below the knee 60 percent above the knee oh screw you and you guys sent for a hip [Laughter] listen since we're joking around halloween is coming up and you and i need to hook up and like be a pirate ship it'll be awesome actually we're just thinking about that for this halloween i'll get my i'll get my peg leg you get i rock i rock the pirate stuff yeah we need to get one no problem yeah so so anyway so you so you have this 30 rating for some mental health condition you're not required to contin to continue to seek care to try to get better for it and as a matter of fact you're incentivized by money to not get better for it because if you get to 70 now you can file for individual unemployability get compensated at the hundred percent rate as long as you don't work so that's the hook right wow as long as they don't work they can stay at home i didn't know about this particular so let's back up a little bit like who who who exactly ends up being eligible for that anybody who has a 60 disability for one condition or a 70 disability for two or more conditions okay can get compensated at the 100 rate provided that they don't work in that way it's similar to social security disability insurance if you get above 1200 a month yeah you lose the delta between your new 100 rating and your actual 60 or 70 rating it's called individual unemployability it's the worst program in the federal government wow okay since 2000 the number of people on iu went it used to be super rare a few dozen people a year because it was designed for to to fix a niche problem in the rating system and now it's a commonplace system where there's like 400 000 or 500 000 of the total six million people on disability from the va are on iu and so literally we're paying these people to sit home and we're penalizing them if they try to go back to work so let's think about you asked how people get sicker here's how they get sicker you have a mental illness now you're excluded from society you're excluded from all the benefits all the protective benefits of work you're sitting on your couch drinking whiskey at 10 o'clock in the morning playing video games and for for a weekend you know whisking video games is fine like go for it have fun yeah for a lifestyle it's not and so these people begin to adopt the sick role they begin to see themselves as sick and in seeing themselves as sick there's something called and it's super lame and i know you don't not take the gre anytime soon there's a term called iatrogenic disability and what it means is disability that's created by medical care iatrogenic disability and so these people begin to get on board with that and they get sicker and sicker and sicker and pretty soon they're at 100 percent at least in part caused by the disability system itself that's how we're making it sicker and you can easily see how that happens but it's not this isn't theory you know we can kind of witness this and in many cases so and that probably leads to the next question which is okay how does it make them poor it's pretty obvious from that explanation that you just gave how you're also poor because if you're not getting you're never you're never rising above a certain level you're like well this is good enough i mean and it's generous i mean you know it obviously changes depending on your um family's dependency yeah dependence and your rank when you left but um it is uh it's livable it's very much a livable wage so you could just do nothing for the rest of your life so if you're 100 and you have a spouse and two children your total compensation is going to be about 30 300 a month tax-free so effectively think about somebody who's making 55 000 you know taxed and that gets to about uh 3 500 a month uh tax free so is that workable sure that's what a schoolteacher makes you know a good school teacher in a good district in a good city makes 60 70 000 yeah so so now you've got uh somebody who's making enough money to survive and yet they're not getting the thriving that comes from work right right so and their social relationships get worse too so for example let's say it's a 24 year old who uh man who isn't married yet and he's gonna go try to meet somebody to get married too you know and let's say he does the right thing goes to church to try to meet somebody or the or the wrong thing goes to a bar to try to meet somebody either way um he uh you know the first question the the potential the girl is gonna ask is hey what do you do for a living you know she doesn't care about his name yet she cares about what he does for a living and if he says oh i'm a disabled veteran you know she's gonna pivot on her heel and walk away why because really what she's looking for is a lifelong partner who can who can be an equal partner and potentially if she has children and wants to exit labor markets she can do that right and he can provide for the whole team you know only in the movies in some weird love story is that a is that an attractive thing oh yeah a woman oh yeah i want to save this guy i'm totally disabled please save me you know that's that's not a thing so so they end up more isolated um they end up insulated from society and because they never get to the you know professional status of earning you know getting a higher education and earning a higher income they're trapped in this sort of lower middle class realm and um and you can yeah you can survive like that but you're not as wealthy and well-off as you would be if you were able to work should should benefits be um weighted a heck of a lot differently i already have my opinion on this but waited a heck of a lot differently for uh combat related injuries because right now i believe there is extra for a combat related injury but it's very little it's very very little not much and i'm not i don't think like again i don't think our combat related injuries should get more but i do think everybody else should get a lot less i think i think if you break i think if you break your legs playing basketball or riding your motorcycle like an idiot and that happens so often it happens a lot i think we've had we have we have absolutely lost more service members in the last couple of years to just random stupid accidents right then covet oh for sure whole other problem um got my mask if you want me to put it on yeah we won't address right now but you know it's um you know and then but how do you even have that conversation well so i i would uh disagree with you slightly in that um i would privilege uh service caused conditions differently than i would service training training should be part of that absolutely and because the thing is is as you know you know i think correct me if i'm wrong on this if you're active duty and you have to be injured in the line of duty to be to get care but they just consider every energy you know basically as long as you're active duty we consider it in the line of duty even if it was a bar fight yeah correct everything that you do and i don't have a problem with that necessarily but it but how it but because i look i mean you know every slope you get beat up at a bar it's like well okay we're just not gonna fix you up like right i don't have a problem with that but but should this count towards your service disability in the long run like that's that's that's not as obvious right so the the way the va does this is anything the delta between the time you joined the military and they do a full you know head to toe physical of you and then and then when you leave the military x number of years later whether it's three or 35 the delta between those two things is your disability so anything that's wrong with you in that period of time so i have a friend who who got parkinson's disease while he was on active duty he was diagnosed with parkinson's disease that's considered to be a service-connected disability and it's like wait a second whether or not he ever ca of course we should treat him and it's fine for the va to treat him but the question is is that the responsibility of the american taxpayer right do you also just get benefits because remember this is like you said it's very important there's a difference between treatment and benefits and man i have seen some things where it's like there is no way that this condition you have uh related which is clearly related to your habits yeah yeah you know maybe it's like diabetes or some kind of arthritis uh you know i i've seen this many times and this person is like 80 and also waving the victim flag like look at me disabled veteran you sat in an office the whole i know i worked with you yeah you sat in an office the whole time and and look fundamentally it feels unfair right and you and i are we both feel like this is just unfair there's a sense of injustice here but also there's a what worries me is the long-term consequences for the reputation of the military and for the veteran community well and i touched on that earlier you know every veteran who's walking around with a shirt that says and i saw one of these the other day that said um dysfunctional veteran you know like do not speak or some nonsense like that but yeah yeah totally and then and then the i saw you know obviously you know about the uh fourth of july and it's talked about in the book the uh you know uh uh ptsd veteran lives here please be courteous with your fireworks how about this no screw you dude it's america it's the fourth of july i'm firing off my fireworks you know but but um you you touched on a couple of things and i want to give i want to give you a couple of things that should make everybody's blood boil um sleep apnea sleep apnea is about 20. don't get me started on sleep we're going there so 25 of americans have sleep apnea it's the fastest growing according to the american sleep institute i think it's called it's the fastest growing condition in america and all this stuff it's it's a big big deal and sleep apnea can be a real problem if you if you can't get sleep then you're groggy during the day and you're not fully functional all that stuff so sleep apnea is a real thing it's also caused by two things it's caused by having a narrow neck uh circumference and obesity yeah that's it that's what causes sleep apnea so in the va if you have sleep apnea that was diagnosed while you're on active duty and you go and get a cpap machine one of the positive pressure breathing machines from the va that's a 50 disability yeah i know whereas whereas a bologna amputation is 40 and an i is only 30 30. it's insanity and i had to prove like a ridiculous amount about my left eye to to get that one up too i mean it's it was like i'm freaking blind man like you know like i've been massive correction correct division to get this it's it's fascinating can i tell you something else it's going to totally boil your blood there's something in public policy and everybody you know dan knows this i'm giving a lesson everybody else there's something called vertical and horizontal equity vertical equity is is are the disabilities stacked in order of increasing severity in a proper way and horizontal equity is does somebody does one person's 30 percent roughly equivalent equal the disability related somebody else is 30 i'm going to give you something crazy so when i went in when i was retiring from the army i went in and i uh you know i only claimed conditions that were combat caused conditions i didn't even do service connected i just did combat cause so amputation yeah i'll take the you know yes you can the american people can pay me for my lost leg fine yeah but also they wanted to they wanted to list on the thing this scar on my lips so if you've ever like look at my lip here you know it's really ugly this little yeah little star on my lip it is kind of ugly i should grow a mustache but my my wife said i would have to be i mean i'm not sure how you look she wouldn't kiss me let's just put it that way i guess how do i how do i look walk around with a scar this scar on my face thirty percent yeah yeah no i'm not kidding yeah it's i'm awake there's an intense amount of given to scarring and again i'm assuming that scars from your explosion it is yeah all right so you know it's um but it's not an eye i'd rather have this scar all day than have yeah it's kind of a cool skin i have to go i wish i had more scars on my face because my face was messed up like it was it looked like i got hit with a shotgun that's what it looks like full of birdshot that's kind of what my face looked like and i just don't scar um but i but i also got well my legs are really really scarred up but um but over time in my arms as well but those but even that's kind of dissipated over time it's like that right it's like little black marks from well there's that that's all over my eye or my right eye under the eye patch there's a lot of that tattooing i don't have that everywhere else around my body it's just it was just kind of shredded mm-hmm um and it's not that bad anymore i'm kind of like wolverine you know with my healing so it's you know it just kind of disappears eventually um why are you laughing that's that's just funny it's good what's funny about it nothing i'm you have a knife right behind you i'm not playing there's a trident behind you oh no yeah you like slap me with your fake leg all right i'll whack you with a crutch yeah oh you don't have enough i don't have none um in any case well well then you're just disarmed um the the what was i well i forgot what that's what i was talking about but it was just oh the the scarring right what's in that coffee cup by the way that you have um coffee i mean if it's i was going to make something up but it's my podcast thing um yeah but but to your point like the the the excessive amount of um i think it just it's not fair right that that horizontal equity doesn't seem to make sense um or the vertical equity based on how you actually defined it and um the other sad part about this is that i think everybody at the va knows it for sure i know from the last administration we had this conversation with the secretary and they're like we know it well how did changes not get made you had four years you had four years how did changes not get made um i talked to the current chief of staff uh for the secretary of the va um seemed like a good guy we had this conversation too and you know i think they'll be less aggressive than the last administration which still didn't get anything done on this because i mean the political backlash is just too much and it's too easy to keep there's no consequences to going down this road um but as you point out there are consequences and and the more people realize that the more maybe we'll make some hard decisions but um well well right now the way i always describe it is right now the va's benefits administration is worth about 138 billion dollars a year the va health administration all va healthcare is worth like 120 billion a year so in other words we're paying more to keep veterans sick on the benefits side than we are to get them healthy on the health care side imagine that i mean that's insanity it it is so i mean is there any um movement though like a change in culture in in the major vsos i mean because where i do see a major cultural shift is in sort of the uh the um how would i describe this kind of side of the veteran population i mean like the black rifle coffee population you know let's just call it that i don't know what else to call it i sort of call it the brovet there's like sure yeah thing and then there's like a really aggressive like thriving culture so team red white and blue is very good yeah team rubicon is very good yeah yeah um it's all about empowerment all about all about um confronting this victimization cultural trend you know these are people who who don't show up to to to vfw to to talk about what they deserve um in benefits right and um and they and they're because i think i think the vast majority of veterans just to be fair to veterans agree with us on the problem here i've been really pleased by by wounded warrior project under the leadership of general mike linnington who's the current ceo um they've really gone in the direction of empowerment and economic you know economic empowerment helping veterans thrive rather than you know just helping them file claims for increased benefits and that's actually a change from wounded warrior project went through this dark period six seven years ago and that's a change for them and it's a really positive change and if they if they can it's a huge organization and an important one and if they can change their culture then i'm hopeful that other things will change but the other thing it takes is i think people telling the truth and because i've had you know if you look at the book reviews by the way the website woundingwarriors.com if you pre-order i will totally send you a signed copy myself it'll be awesome um but it but um the the reviews on my book i've got three former va secretaries i've got general mattis i've got jack jacobs who is politically on the left but a medal of honor recipient from the war in vietnam um and all of these guys are saying this is an absolutely necessary book and so my hope with the book honestly is to fundamentally like i'm is this the thing that can cause there to be a national conversation about this i certainly hope so um but it's take it takes people like us and you know tammy duckworth on the senate side and people like that to tell the truth about what's going on so that we can help veterans thrive this is not about cutting benefits in my view it's not about about cutting benefits or about cutting costs for the va it's about properly shifting those benefits to where they're in a place that actually helps veterans thrive like why are we not reskilling up skilling transitioning veterans in a healthier way rather than just paying them a pittance for the rest of their life in order to be ill yeah and and there's the issue of um of reassessment you know or a continuing assessment that that goes on and on and on i mean there's some injuries like like yours that are very clearly permanent um so there's no need for that for that reassessment um i'm in the same category and then they do they do categorize that differently right like um yeah you're per you're on permanent disability or temporary and it does require temporary does require an assessment but there's an incentive structure in place to come up with new illnesses essentially right because that's a pretty good benefit like you don't want to lose it yeah um i mean what's your assessment of that is that yeah totally it's it's it's in the book um there's a there's some stories in there about the uh about people in a in a wounding wounded warrior battalion who every time they come up on their like disability assessment they're constantly like quote-unquote like having falls in the shower and then oh i hurt my back and now my back is out and trying to piece together a portfolio that will get them to 100 disability and that's actually i'm not surprised by it nor am i angered by it because that's normal human responses to the incentives that they're given you know if you go to a national park and there's a sign that says don't feed the bears the reason why you're not supposed to feed the bears is because then they'll get dependent on humans and dig in the trash and cause trouble you know right so from a policy point of view what we need to have is something that takes into account human behavior and human behavior is to seek you know to seek those benefits and that's normal we should incentivize the things that we want to see you know for example in the in the epilogue of the book i sort of give some about half a dozen principles don't give specific policy proposals nor do i give like you know legislative language because that's you know you guys do that um but what i do do is get some principles and the principles are things like let's incentivize the things that we want so for example with diabetes diabetes is an absolutely a hugely expensive disease there's about 300 000 or so veterans no it's less than that it's about 100 000 veterans i think i'll have to check it but who get diabetes uh disability every year as new recipients added to the million or so who are getting it currently right diabetes adult onset diabetes is not caused by your agent orange exposure as a blue water navy sailor you know it's because it's a pretty weak assessment anyway it's caused by your lifestyle it's a lifestyle disease so how about when you go in for your annual va physical if your bmi is in a normal range or isn't it is in a healthy range we give you a 1500 bonus how about that you know because then we're incentivizing the kinds of behaviors we want now of course you'd have a bunch of 65 year olds like trying to cut weight in the gym in a in a rubber suit or something but the point is like which is something they should be fine right um but the point is like right now we're incentivizing the worst possible thing which is malaise and illness and sickness and what we should be doing is helping these guys and gals thrive you brought up the blue water navy thing um you know it's a frustrating one because i can't i can't objectively look at that and say the science supports that at all um not as sure about burn what's your opinion on burn pits yeah so i would really love to have a conversation with jon stewart if you can hook me up with him that'd be amazing i want to send him a copy of my book and just sit down with him about it he's like the leader he's the leader of the good like the feel good well but i mean all things too it's like you know it's not all things but just like all benefits must be good don't you think he's smart enough that maybe he's just making a mistake he's falling into the mythology he's believing the mythology rather than the truth i tend to like jon stewart so yeah maybe maybe yeah yeah so so with burn pits i think that you know let's say uh beau biden um i'm sorry he's gone i'm sure he was a valuable person all that but does anyone believe that the attorney general of delaware when he deployed with his national guard unit to iraq was like working every day directly in the plume of a of a burn pit you know was he the one pulling the pulling the stuff i didn't actually know that that that's what the stated so their potential is blamed on so the president goes around telling people that his son died at least in part due to burn pits in iraq and that his super rare brain cancer that killed him at a relatively young age in his 40s was due to uh his exposure to that and so and one of the things it just makes my blood boil like with when the heroes were killed in afghanistan a couple weeks ago uh biden is alleged to have said to them that he understood because his son also died due to his service or some nonsense like that it's like you know listen you are not a gold star father like i know some gold star dads you are not one your son died because of a rare brain cancer but was the brain cancer due to his burn pit exposure i would say probably not so there's this there's this universal thing it's impossible to make the causal connection i mean well scientifically it's just there's no way the emotional connection is easy so you know like one of the one of the first sins in the bible is sort of like god comes down and says eve like what the heck happened here when she's sitting there with an apple in her hand or no to adam she's like what what happened and he points at her she did it it's her fault it's her fault right and so it's a human thing that everybody that we all have that if something bad happens we have two choices one is we can take responsibility for it and say it's my fault it's i have internal locus of control it's me that did it and so it's my fault or we can point the finger at somebody else and it's super comfortable to point the finger at somebody else externalizing blame is always like a warm blanket yes and so part of what happens when somebody has a rare cancer of their lungs or some kind of other horrible disease if you can point at the government and say it's the government's fault then you can have the warm emotional blanket but you can also have the substantial financial blanket yeah there's a lot of incentive structure there psychologically and practically yeah and so so gulf war veterans had the magical illness of gulf war syndrome right vietnam veterans have the magical illness of agent orange exposure and our generation of veterans have the magical illness of burn pit exposure right which is what's frustrating is like look there are some people who have serious agent orange exposure there are some people who have an actual gulf war syndrome and you know but when everybody gets it then nobody has it that's right and that that's that's the problem we should be clear like that's the problem if you worked near a burn pit like there's a chance that the it's very carcinogenic there's a there's a better chance there but i was deployed multiple times with burn pits everywhere but i wasn't like in them you know i mean i could maybe sometimes you know drive past you drive through them yeah and as you noted like 99.99999 of all jobs had really not the exposure levels that would that would that would indicate any kind of causality there and um you know compare that by the way to like firefighters that have a very clear um excess of cancer yeah um so there's just clearly something going on there um cancer is just it's a mystery you know and if we and if it because i'm sure you and i would just be eligible for for burn pit compensation if that's where it went and uh so i'm just very skeptical of the science on that and um well and and the the fundamental the the tough thing to do from a public policy perspective which is of course you know my passion and your day job is to separate the wheat from the chaff so with post-traumatic stress disorder clearly real clearly people can be traumatized by by their war experiences just like people can be traumatized by being raped um is there are there people truly suffering yes are there people who need health care and and potentially benefits if the health care isn't going to make them better for sure but is it the numbers that we're seeing absolutely not there's a lot of chaff inside of the wheat and that does two things one is it makes the american taxpayers on the hook for a lot of people who are potentially grifting and we've got some stories about that in the book woundingwarriors.com pre-order give me a signed copy see i'm good at that i can do that um yeah totally and but the um there's a lot of people in there doing that but there's also a lot of suffering people who can't get the healthcare appointments they need because there's a whole line of grifters in front of them and how do you separate the wheat from the chaff i think we have to do that by the by policy yeah yeah and that's that's definitely a part of it you know so you know we've been talking about the the compensation system and the disincentives and incentives that occur there um what about the va in general you know when you were on the campaign trail in virginia i'm sure you got asked what do you do to fix the va and i always answer that question um very vaguely because it's it's not there's not some obvious legislation that we could just pass that would quote unquote fix the va and the other reality is is that it depends on the va um you know i i think the houston va is pretty good um uh i had horrible experiences at the boston va when i was there for a year going to school so it depends on the va and oftentimes it seems to me like the the the inefficiencies the ineffectiveness of a particular hospital is due to you know a few points of failure in the bureaucratic system and um that's what causes it and um and so it depends i mean what's your answer to that well yeah i'm i'm much more of an expert on the benefit side than i'm on the health care side but what i would say is that if you look at what the va treats um in the in the american mind it's hey the va treats uh you know all these combat wounded guys and you're gonna see a bunch of guys like a bunch of amputees a bunch of spinal cord injuries and blind guys and stuff like that actually if you go to a va and just sit in the waiting room what you're going to see is a bunch of people with normal geriatric conditions 100 percent i mean that's what you see i don't see any i don't see anybody my age no no no it's a geriatric health care system it is not a trauma healthcare system yeah and the civilian sector has done very well in treating geriatric stuff and it's getting better every year as they as they begin to figure stuff out um so my preference would be and this is super controversial but my preference would be that people who are eligible for the va can either go to a va or can take a you know basically a credit card and use that to seek civilian care because if you have you know let's say your wife and your kids go to whatever local place they go to for their health care why shouldn't you be able to go to that same place and take your take your va benefits with you if you find a provider that you love and they've expanded that to somewhat yeah it's still kind of complicated to use um it's it's hard to figure out you know you still need like a referrals and it's just it's difficult yeah it's too difficult but and i think the network of va like mega healthcare centers like these sort of death star of life star of of health i think those are probably uh you know kind of belong in the dustbin of history in some sense now maybe we have ma i mean this is there are some va centers who have uh excess capacity should they be able to market their services to anybody who walks in of course don't let veterans get behind a bunch of civilians who are seeking care there but why shouldn't those be a place where civilian civilians can get health care too as long as they're paying for it with their insurance so that those doctors they could actually stay busy and you can fund it yeah that's an interesting idea so there's a number of reform the vsos hate that of course because they're they worry about whether that undermines the sort of political legitimacy of the of the va healthcare system there's a number of things we can do on the healthcare side but to me the real huge problem in the room is the benefit side not the healthcare side yeah yeah no i mean i tend to agree with that because just for the simple reason it's not obvious to me what i would go in and change um it's very much situation dependent in each hospital and i got my recent eye surgery at the va and um now the houston va is interesting because look my doctor who operated on me he really only works at the va on fridays you know so he's got a private practice and that's pretty normal in the houston ecosystem because of the texas medical center and so there's just a it all works together um you know and democrats who think that the entire nation should just look like the va don't understand that the va can't exist without the private health care system because that's where you get your doctors trained up that's where you get your technology from the research and development that occurs and then you just use it like all socialism it can only exist on the back of the free market system that created the wealth in the first place and then you can redistribute some of it but you can't do that indefinitely i don't know why i keep explaining that basic principle to the left but i do um well and and by the way cost per appointment at the va is like uh last time i did the math like six times higher than the cost per appointment in the um civilian healthcare system because the va has a whole bunch of overhead that it has to carry yeah and the number of ton of bureaucracy rockets which is saying something because there's a ton of administrative overhead and hospitals these days right well that's mostly because government requires that yeah regulation just it's just going through the system um you know maybe we shift gears in our way a couple minutes left how was they um what was it like running in virginia we have any chances in virginia republicans yeah i mean we've got an absolutely phenomenal candidate this year you've met him yeah yeah yeah former um private equity executive this is for governor for governor right so this year in virginia we have a governor race um and he's a he's a great candidate he's a conservative but not a crazy ridiculous bomb thrower um and virginia is not alabama you know we can't you can't be a hard hard right you know if you run on i sort of joked about this during my campaign if i run on guns babies and trump i'm going to lose 35 65. so you have to be a little more thoughtful about that than um then you know again virginia's not alabama it's not new jersey either but it's not alabama yeah so so which is often what party activists just can't wrap their heads around yeah they don't very frustrating there's some there's some uh cutting off the of the nose despite the face kind of stuff that happens and if they don't if you don't give the perfect answer that they want on uh you know abortion or guns or some other like hard social issue then they're like oh you're dead to me you knew you were a rhino you knew you were running rhino hunters that's what i call them they're like they're looking for traders in their midst at all you know just uh they like it they like losing yeah but we have a great chance this year i think in virginia um most recent polling shows yunking up uh by five among likely voters what that's all yes yesterday i'm very hopeful about it do you think uh covet had a lot to do with this because i mean like northern virginia unbelievably liberal i never understand it um well they're all government contractors yeah but even the ones who aren't are just like it it's become like the wealthy whites in america have become extremely liberal it's something about loudoun county same houston i mean my my most democrat precinct in houston is the wealthiest one of the wealthiest whitest areas of houston and you're just like what are you what are your value i'm confused here you know um it's just not that they should all be republican but that it should just be more balanced i mean that it's just it's just strange how they all kind of come together like that well they want they want to give other people money provided that they never have to actually meet those other people yeah you know like if if a bunch of let's say minorities moved into um great falls virginia one of the richest zip codes in the in the country probably a lot of those people who are voting hard left would be horrified because really their motivation is to virtually signal to their friends not to actually have policy that cares for people yeah because if you wanted policy that cares for people you'd freaking have uh charter schools so that people could get their kids out of out of poverty and out of poverty stricken schools and into schools that are worth a hoot you'd have but those are the money that's right you know but you know you'd have money fall as a student you've had you've had you'd have some of those things but that's not really what they want they want to you'd want to empower me it's the exact same conversation we're having about veterans if you really cared you'd want to empower them like if you love your kids you empower them you tell them that things are their fault when they screw up yeah and that there's rules in life and that there's consequences in life if you don't love them you're like you're doing fine yeah everything's great i just like do you like me today if you don't like me i'll buy you more ice cream yeah if you don't really love your kid that's how you treat your kid well and you're going to set your kid up for crap well back to the back to the veterans thing there's a lot of the vsos and a lot of you know individual veterans are like well but if you love me you'll give me stuff and i'm like i've got twin 13 year old sons they're phenomenal they're phenomenal but but if they ask me for a candy bar at 10 o'clock in the morning am i gonna give them a candy bar no because i love them because i don't want them to get cavities and be jittery or whatever it is maybe later as a treat you guys can split a candy bar but you're not just having a candy bar at 10 a.m because i love you and i think our policy should be about again back to the veterans thing helping veterans thrive and that's what this is about not again i'm not anti-veteran i mean look at me for crying out loud right i'm not anti-veteran i am i'm pro-veteran and that's why i think we need policy change around this topic yeah i fully agree with that um wait okay back to the back to virginia for a second um do you think covid's gonna real is what's really shifting this is the mass mandates the school closures uh it seems to me a lot of parents in this area who are in the dc area right now are really fed up with that and do you think that i mean maybe biden might mandate stuff and killing businesses well the the disaster in afghanistan shows the effectlessness of the of the current presidential administration i think a lot of people are having buyer's remorse because of that i think that uh the ongoing sort of economic stress of lockdowns and copied mandates or and vaccine mandates and all that stuff are showing people that the left is mostly interested in in power and not so much um in in good policy in this case and and so you know i think all of that comes together it's a i think it's kind of a perfect storm for for uh glenn juncken to uh to to win the governor's mansion and and he already has a mansion he doesn't care about the mansion he actually cares about serving the people yeah you know and that and that's what i really admire about the guy he's good he's he's tall people like he's drawing people i mean it's like like i mean he's taller than me because i'm about six one he's about six four i don't know no he's more he's taller now he's like six six ish whatever he's real tall the important part is that i'm six one yeah i was gonna say maybe standing on a box or six one yeah screw you if i'd gotten both legs blown off i could be as tall as i want i could i could like get the long prosthetics and be like i meet some guys that i'm like were you this tall yeah you know beforehand because like you seem really tall usually they did they probably were but uh it's kind of it is like it's an added benefit yeah you can be whoever you want yeah that's good stuff uh dan gate thanks so much for being on and uh wounding warriors is the book of course so um thanks for your hard work on this and thanks for your service awesome it's great thanks for your stan appreciate you brothers

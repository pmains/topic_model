[Music] senator lee came to my home the week after my husband was killed emotions were high i was still in a total daze i remember him coming and sitting in our home asking questions about our family expressing not only condolences but his commitment to help our family going forward we felt some of that genuine compassion from him he probably knew better than we did that there might be some bumps and hiccups ahead with paperwork and processes and just said he and his staff would be there for us if ever we needed questions answered or case work done not only does he listen and make time to listen he'll have questions he wants to know more he wants to really understand the issue he's a husband he's a father he's a community member and i truly believe he works as hard as he does because he cares as much as he does i'm voting for mike lee because he's been there for me and my family for our military community here in utah mike lee for senate i'm mike lee and i approve this message

mr president senator from kansas thank you mr president it was just a couple weeks ago that president biden asked the nation he asked republicans what are republicans for i want to make it clear tonight that i'm for border security i'm for law and order i've been to the border three times in the past four to five years and what i saw there was a crisis and if i could i just want to paint just for a minute what that crisis looks like having been overseas doing medical mission work i think i know a humanitarian a health crisis when i see it and this was a humanitarian crisis a health crisis thousands of people sleeping underneath a bridge they just traveled across mexico for days maybe weeks maybe months and as a position i look out there and and what did i see i saw people that were dehydrated uh malnourishment dehydration from diarrhea from dysentery scabies tuberculosis border patrol was overwhelmed the doctors were overwhelmed the nurses the dentist everybody was overwhelmed that's what i would call a humanitarian crisis one of the biggest humanitarian crisis going on though is human trafficking as an obstetrician gynecologist in kansas believe it or not we would have to take care of young young women who had been abused from human trafficking maybe they had chlamydia maybe they were having a miscarriage but i'm just shocked at the amount of human trafficking going on across the border in 2021 fiscal year 2021 145 000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended at the southern border and i want to emphasize this is young girls and young boys that are being abused and sold into sex slavery of that 145 000 about a third of the miners that were released to a sponsor we lost contact with are we turning children over to human trafficking i think that's what we're all concerned about so i think certainly there is indeed a humanitarian crisis a health crisis there just to talk a little bit more about the border and we'll put that up here microphone look at the statistics from last year alone two million people were apprehended at the border last year two million people do you realize that there's 14 states in this country with less than 2 million people and beyond that as i spoke with the border patrol there they told me for every person they apprehended two got across the lines so probably an additional four four million people came across a total of six million there are 30 states in our country with a population of six million people furthermore what we were doing was making the cartel rich what again not what i was told by texas rangers and border patrol officers is the cartel was making three thousand to nine thousand dollars per person and of course if it was a uh some person maybe from the from the middle east a little bit harder to get across the border they were getting twenty to thirty thousand dollars a person as well i haven't talked to you about the national security crisis i think we've all seen the the films and the reports of single adult males being flown on nighttime flights across the nation being released migrants using arrest warrants as forms of identification i think you know america is not stupid we see what's going on i want to talk about fentanyl for a second so probably 90 95 the fentanyl coming into this country is is made in china coming across our southern border an average month of fentanyl being seized at the border was over 800 pounds that's almost a half a ton of fentanyl that would kill 200 million people you know this is a drug that if a drug dog sniffs it it kills them it makes them stop breathing most normal people if they just had a small small amount in it it would make them stop breathing this is the national security crisis going on more people dying from fentanyl overdose young people dying from fentanyl overdose than from coven and that's just part of the national security crisis you know i kind of started off this discussion saying what i'm for that i'm for border security and i want to tell you how we can fix the problems there and these are solutions every american knows dhs several years ago came up with a 25 billion dollar budget to to control the border i couldn't think of a better way to invest 25 billion dollars of american dollars to build a wall where it needs to be built to finish the wall to put the gates in that are sitting there rusting away we can start with that we of course need more boots on the ground more technology more drug dogs but 25 billion dollars would significantly improve the situation on the southern border next the administration can fully and in good faith enforce the remain in mexico policy and end catch and release practices and finally this of course work with mexico let's go back and ask mexico to help us again to control the security on that border ask them to work on their southern border which is much easier to control and of course work with our border patrol on our common border this is a crisis that america sees every town hall i do someone's going to bring it up every one of them without without any questions someone's going to ask me they say why does president biden want this crisis and i mean what do you mean he wants it he's what they say well obviously he wants this crisis because it would still would be so easy to fix so if we see the problem we know the solution that would be my question for president biden do you have the will to fix this crisis thank you mr president i yield back

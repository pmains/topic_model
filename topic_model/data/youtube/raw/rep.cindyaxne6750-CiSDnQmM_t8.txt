five minutes Thank You chairwoman waters and Thank You secretary Minuten for being here again I appreciate it I'd like to talk to you a little bit about tariffs and trade I'm from Iowa so of course we're being hit hard first of all I appreciate the removal of the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum however those were put on by your administration but thank you so much for removing those but I want to talk to you about the tariffs that were just placed on Chinese goods this month and the tariff is almost on two hundred billion dollars of imports and it was just increased from 10% to 25% do you agree with President Trump that China is footing the bill for these tariffs I agree that China is fitting most of the bill for it yes so who's paying the price for these well again when you look at the tariffs there's probably three or four different things that are going on one is a change in the currency which leads to a lower price for us that we can buy things to its margins that are being absorbed by companies in China and three there may be in certain cases a impact passed on to our consumer and we're closely monitoring that and that'll be part of the exception I appreciate your bringing up that last piece because major retailers like Walmart have said they will raise prices as a result of your administration's to understand how a tariff operates and could you tell us a little bit about that I'm not sure if you were here when I mentioned earlier that I just spoke to the CFO of Walmart we speak on a regular basis so I'm monitoring with them very carefully so our tariffs attacks on imports tariffs are a tariff on imports they are not a tax they tariffs are a tax on imports and they're paid for by the US companies who import those Goods so do our companies like Nike and Adidas and Walmart who have said they're going to pass on these prices to consumers would you not consider that an increase on costs on folks like mine in Iowa and Americans across this country well what I mentioned earlier and the reason why I spoke to Walmart is because obviously they have a lot of these consumer issues the way the tariffs were designed was the last tranche was really the consumer issue we are monitoring carefully there will be some exceptions my expectation is a lot of this business will be moved from China to other places in the region so that there will not be a cost so reclaiming my time I'm not getting a straight answer here do you agree that American consumers will be paying more as a result of these tariffs I don't necessarily agree with that and that's something we're monitoring very carefully and we'll be issuing exemptions so you disagree with all of our key retailers in the country and experts who understand that a tariff is most likely passed on to consumers because that's historically what happens you disagree with that as the secretary of the Treasury I just spoke to many of these CEOs many of you disagree with that that the tariffs will won't be passed on to consumers in any way shape or form again there may be a small number of items where the tariffs may be passed on and those are the things we will specific so you agree that American consumers will be paying more because it'll clear ups but we've made no decisions on that the last tranche is is subject to the president's approval and subject to exemptions the importers that make the decisions on that isn't that correct it's their products that they're importing excuse me if the decision is being made by the the folks in our country who own the companies who are importing the products not necessarily you who's deciding what price they're going to put out on their product well again if we issue an exemption it doesn't then there will be no price increase and again most of those companies are moving they're claiming my time moving on can you tell me what the average Iowan makes in a year I I can't tell you exactly but I would guess it's can you tell me what the average American family makes in a year yeah it's it's it's between depending upon whether you use the mean or the median it's between 45 and 65 thousand yeah it's it's median is 60,000 closer to 79 thousand for the mean can you tell me what cost these tariffs will put on these American families I don't expect there will be significant costs on the American families and that's something that we are absolutely focused on have you done research on this I have I as I said I've just spoken to all the major companies that provide consumer good so if you've done research on this how come we haven't seen this research I I haven't seen it I don't think my colleagues have seen it why hasn't that been passed on to us to ensure that the constituents in our district aren't paying the cost for this well let me just comment the last tranche is under investigation the president has not yet made the decision and the consumer products are by design in the last tranche so will you commit to providing us this research then again at the appropriate time we will brief Congress on what the economic impact is of it yes okay well let's move on

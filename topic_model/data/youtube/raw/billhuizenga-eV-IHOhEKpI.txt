speaker today I rise to recognize the 50th anniversary of Grand Valley State University's pioneer class in June of 1967 in a tent on its Allendale Michigan campus Grand Valley held its long dreamed of first commencement ceremony on that hundred and thirty eight seniors including 86 members of the Pioneer class that started in 1963 received their diplomas from Michigan's newest college these first graduates laid the foundation of a university that would grow to offer 124 degrees enroll students from 82 different countries and boast a 94 percent employment rate for its graduates always a good thing after that first graduation ceremony in 1967 gb/s you had 138 alumni today the university has over a hundred and ten thousand proud alumni throughout Michigan and frankly around the globe under the leadership of its first president James Sundberg followed by continued guidance of Aaron lubbers mark Murray and current president Thomas Haas Grand Valley has grown to become a renowned institution and one of the 100 largest universities in this nation during the very first commencement address a speaker noted quote no one could ever possibly chart your course through these years and quote and it's hard to imagine that the Pioneer class could have dreamed of the role that they would be playing and helping Grand Valley State University achieve such great heights so I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Grand Valley State University's pioneer class of 1967 the original Lakers for a lifetime and I yield back

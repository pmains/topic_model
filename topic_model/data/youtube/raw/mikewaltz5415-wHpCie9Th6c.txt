the taliban reimposing harsh rules on afghan women forcing them to be covered from head to toe and be accompanied by a male chaperone whenever out in public the wall street journal editorial board warning that under the taliban afghanistan keeps getting worse let's bring in florida republican congressman michael waltz he's a national guard colonel and former green beret commander as well you know this is the wall street journal went on to say after its disgraceful withdrawal the biden administration has a particular duty to help americans and allies left behind keeping the world's attention on taliban abuses is an essential part of that duty but they don't i mean they've got a lot on their plate i understand that but they don't talk about this at all congressman nope yeah no dana and it's shameful i mean we remember the promises of taliban 2.0 the more moderate taliban the good terrorists that are going to help us against the bad terrorists if you just look at the plight of women they can no longer even show their face they can no longer leave their home they can no longer get a job the taliban have replaced the ministry of women focused on taking care of women's issues there with the ministry of virtue advice and heck dana even if you a poor woman levels a sexual assault allegation or a rape allegation they have to bring a witness in order to be able to level the charge and we have heard crickets zero nothing from this administration and it is shameful it's despicable and i will hold joe biden and the people around him accountable on behalf of those women but also on future american soldiers that are going to have to go back to deal with this terrorism problem the girls there are still also not able to go to school that was a promise that the children broke as well oh they they promised uh the world right and and the bite administration swallowed it hook line and sinker but we're seeing their true colors and listen where women thrive in societies around the world in civil society politics business terrorism doesn't and where they are oppressed you have a massive terrorism problem and we just heard yesterday from the intelligence community to the senate that we are on a ticking time bomb and turn of in terms of isis developing the capability to be able to attack us again as though by the way they commit commit these atrocities against women it's been nine months since that disgraceful withdrawal and so we'll continue to be on top of it and follow all of that also the congress is expected to try to pass some ukraine aid here's jim jordan the congressman of ohio on that yesterday i understand how bad the situation is for the ukrainian people what they're going through and why some of my colleagues may have went that way but i also understand what's happening here in this country with record levels of crime a border that's wide open for us the debate as you see it as this aid was requested by president biden it looks like even nancy pelosi wants more than the president asked for yeah look i mean i understand representative jordan's concerns i have the same concern we have to be able to do both we have to be this administration can secure our border can make america energy independent again and also can support the fight for freedom uh in europe uh and we can't go down the slippery slope of allowing putin to take ukraine then the baltics uh and and so on and so forth look at the end of the day dana we're debating right now 800 billion dollar defense budget i think 40 billion for ukraine is a good investment at the end of the day our number two adversary is is being stymied and bled militarily uh for those of us me included that want to be able to focus on china the ukrainians are take care taking care of the russian military for us and we ought to support that do you think that now the ukrainians are getting the weapons that they need to actually be successful if the goal if their goal is push the russians out completely do they have what they need to do that i think they're getting what they need to fight russia to a stalemate i think they're going to need more sophisticated weapons to actually go on the offensive and the biggest thing they need dana that they're not getting is a consistent in ukraine training program like we had before before the invasion they need that and we need to go back to that as our embassy goes in we need to send small amounts of advisors in to help them with the logistics and help them with the training the other thing dana i i would call for a humanitarian c corridor into odessa i don't think we appreciate the food crisis with half of the food that goes into africa and the middle east coming from ukraine that we're about to face worldwide we have to get odessa open we have to get that wheat barley and other food stuffs out hunger leads to uprisings which can lead to even worse things as we've seen atrocities across the world when hunger takes hold congressman michael waltz thank you as this vote gets underway today we appreciate it all right thanks dana

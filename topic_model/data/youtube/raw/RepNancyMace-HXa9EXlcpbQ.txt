i don't want to talk about this um you've introduced the states reform act uh it legalizes cannabis cannabis uh well it will certainly has a lot of legal cannabis activists happy but it also has a lot of criminal reform activists cheering too so tell us a little bit about this because i think it's remarkable and i'm really impressed that you're leading the charge on this this is a bill i spent a lot of time on i ran on cannabis reform in my race for congress i worked on cannabis cannabis reform in the state of south carolina as a state lawmaker and there's a patchwork of different reforms and legalizations across the country and this bill takes that into account it takes the federal government into modern times and takes into account that there are 47 states that all have some form of cannabis reform or legalization my home state of south carolina has cbd and hemp florida has medical and then you have places like colorado and california that have full adult use and this recognizes that it provides a federal framework to have a very low federal excise tax on these things and provides a regulatory framework and recognizes every state's different doesn't force one thing or another there's criminal justice reform in here there's protections for veterans protections for small businesses and farmers and this really is and truly will be a bipartisan a bipartisan effort if we're going to do this as we should as past time that we do it this is the platform and the framework to get it done for both sides of the aisle um yesterday there was a report a hundred thousand folks uh have died died in the last year the opioid crisis does that kind of news make it more difficult to get this through it makes it easier quite frankly if you read the medical journals and the opioid crisis in different states and states that have some form of cbd medical cannabis or adult use the rate of opioid abuse is greatly reduced in those areas and regions and so this can be an effort that that that helps those states there's funding actually through the the federal excise tax that would provide money to states that have opioid addiction issues and crises across the states uh this bill also has funding to ensure that we don't market or advertise to kids or those under the age of 21. i mean it's just a i try to put something for everyone in there charles and do a good job on this one you know what you you put together in my mind a heck of a bill i it's remarkable to me that there's any opposition but it's at least a chance for people who have said they want to make a change to make a change we'll see congresswoman mays thank you so much thank you

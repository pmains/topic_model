okay if assuming your work your way down through all the other your questions your co-sponsor to balanced budget amendment what are you down to get that bill on the floor and why do you think the Senate will go along with the house assuming he passes 30 states have already petitioned the Congress for a balanced budget amendment 32 32 states are needed to force Congress to act Michigan is not one of those states along wisconsin' and Ohio and Indiana what are you proposing to do to get Michigan and perhaps one other state I here at cantor state to force Congress to move on the balanced budget all right we've got a lot we had a lot on our way today ah and like I said long as gay people like you cover back we'll keep you in a suit and this is encouraging we've got a good size crowd I wanna talk for a little couple things that happen is tested we had to wait 24 99 years first last Wednesday was meeting with President Obama and the Republican cause he had met with the Senate Democrats of course that then that he would cry bro sup didn't even sent publicans and then of course else in the house all day oh slide it so we got our turn and the next day he met with Democrats so so we've all had our opportunities about the president it was about an hour and 15 minutes I thought it was reasonably productive no we did not solve the debt ceiling issue we do not solve devid or the deficit issue no it's a budget issue but there are some ancillary things that were brought up at the meeting about specifics by peeling the permits Oh oil exploration for example holy and now the number of those types of things and the president said he won't work on it I had a Janus often I'll say this i have chance to talk to the president for a few minutes afterwards along the first lecture for us tonight and then alone and i did two things I at home wanna thought we need to give this more often now again not just because we just solve all the issues but I believe we actually need to have dialogue and when it's this little talk when you're just doing some vice whether it's MSNBC or fox news there's sometimes there's contacts that it's lost and all that I'm sure we all recognize that the other day and it is I just got back from trip to soothe Middle East and Amanda Kuwait Iraq in Saudi Arabia and in our situation in Iraq is transitioning towards transitioning out of our defense run operation to Department state-run operation the family says thousand troops there the still the I will tell you that our military leadership there about we've spent a lot of time with the Ambassador who spent a lot of time with perforce our general who is who's there and coupled three-star generals in fact I told this is from general helmet this is a challenge coin in our mouth you guys are familiar with the challenge coin this is typically with summary which would carry from the company or their Italian or the brigade whoever and this is this is from general helmet it was the three star and I pull them on with you forgetting about those guys and so I've been carrying that around every day the Iraq is need to figure out what what they would like and this goes into some what would guess and so on we're starting starting to pull out in Afghanistan we are there Isis thinking a lot of money into it and continue to do that we've gotta figure out what we are going to do what's going to be our footprint we're going to have the largest embassy in the world is going to be in Baghdad and somewhere along the 9,000 employees there it is it's it's a challenging environment to say the least we have to travel around is the ambassador and a flak jacket and helmet harmless all this up but I believe it's time you need to make sure that the Iraqis one have the ability but to that they finally do stand on their feet as well and there's a lot of feeling that that will be towards that we're having sort of that same discussion with wood Afghanistan we have far more troops in Afghanistan right now is my hope to get there soon as well i think that is constitutionally probably one of the most important things that i need to pay attention to is when i'm sending our men and women in harm's way I want I want I want to know what doing I want to I want to see it experience it myself so hopefully you'll be hearing about a trip that make its illuminating schedule yet but yeah real quick yeah yeah they disposed into work hours after here a little bit so Libya I voted for both campaigners resolution that called President to deliver a report for 14 days it clear that we were not to would not be having any kind of ground troops there also in the defense reauthorization act there was language inserted by voice vote in other words it was controversial both sides of the island that passing the defense budget would not be viewed or constituted as any kind of tacit approval of our actions in Libya here's why that happened in bosnia-herzegovina the Clinton administration had gone in did not consult Congress but 78 days into a congress passed a supplemental defense bill that paid for it and but then still said hey we don't think should be there and the Clinton administration came back and said well we're using you casting that budget as approval so I voted for that and are going for density seditious resolution which dream and I wasn't real popular with it some of my leadership they didn't want to have Chris initially sort of the front on this I frankly didn't care because i think it was it was bad that he had not taken action on that property so inside here is just this episode sessions I see the War Powers Resolution President to remove United States Armed Forces from Bolivia but not later than data a few days after the date of the adoptions concurrent resolution that lost 148 said 265 there was 87 us Republicans that voted for it the manor amendment passed 268 147 telling if ever there's an issue that's got people in knots in Washington it's this one because you see some of the most liberal people that have been proposed to every single boon on the ground in Iraq or Afghanistan supporting the president than you've got you know number of Republicans who voted for us going into Iraq Afghanistan not willing in his lip and that action my my problem is that the clearly President did not adhere to the War Powers Act did not go that you did not come to the Congress did not miss all the Congress informed us we had our mind that our briefing three days after three days after operations were launched that's a problem we you know regard setting aside whether we should or shouldn't be there the whole action of getting into it i believe was was was wrong and presidents part so that that's what we're going to be dealing with there is there some discussion about whether we try to revamp the War Powers Act and so this isn't this isn't going to be done it's it's it's not done and and we're going to be we're gonna be dealing with us washing my leadership was okay so I happens in 40 days you know it's resolution passes we'll see what the center does then what I mean we'll get another 14 days yeah lowered what not what we do this is but this is this to me doesn't doesn't make a lot of sense oh right but yeah we would be rare he'll do that so this meeting that was president it it was very revealing and the next day we had meeting with the fresh meat by person meeting with Sir area the Treasury Tim Beckman pretended on that as well and the what was the revealing part was the philosophical divide and real quickly some of you may have heard me talk about this I've seen four main divides in my time in Washington and I saw this a bit when I was in the state legislature as well but it's not steroids out of Washington the first divide is geographic all right in the Midwife we think differently than someone from the heats up or you know the south

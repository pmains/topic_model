Hi everyone, Zach Nunn here at the Iowa Capitol
with Tiffany Allison. She's with Soaring Hearts. We've been working together for several years
on policies to curb domestic violence in Iowa. Tiffany, what are the key take-aways from
where we are and where we should be going? We need to work on laws that put survivors
first. That take care of their perspective and their
needs. That we address the issue when it happens. That we support that survivor through the
process. And that we hold offenders accountable. Absolutely. Prevention. Remediation. Accountability. Yes. Tough on Crime. Smart on Crime. Thank you, Tiffany.

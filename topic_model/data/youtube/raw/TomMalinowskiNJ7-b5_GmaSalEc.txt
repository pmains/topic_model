joining me now democratic congressman tom malinowski of new jersey he was barricaded on lockdown for hours inside the capitol yesterday so congressman um you know first let me start with this you know we're just starting to see more videos coming in from offices of some of your colleagues of the destruction of congressional offices this morning things stolen you know what was left behind tell me what happened to you during the attack what you saw what happened [Music] sure thank you i was in the house chamber when we were forced to evacuate i guess our first sign was seeing the speaker of the house the majority leader taken out by their security details shortly thereafter we could hear banging on one of the doors police frantically urging one another to barricade the doors we were asked to take out our gas masks which are found under the seats in the house of representatives uh there was a wailing siren made by each of these gas masks which contributed to a a an atmosphere i've not seen in this uh in this house uh in in in my time here uh and then our our wonderful house chaplain as we were being escorted out comes to the microphone and starts uh making a prayer to almighty god which also i thought was a lovely thing to do and yet also contributed to the sense that we were on a ship that was rapidly going down we were safe of course we were taken to a safer location there were staff in the capital who i've spoken to who literally had to barricade doors with furniture who hid in darkened offices under tables uh as these uh these terrorists were banging on the doors this was uh an incredibly difficult situation for a lot of people and look i'm proud that despite all of this we did our job last night we were not intimidated but i do not think it is enough i do not think we can simply say we certified the election and we can go home so let me ask you about this because um you know lieutenant colonel vinman who obviously you know you know was it was testified during the impeachment he was on earlier and said um you know so many countries um saw this and they didn't actually just see that the united states was like other countries in terms of something like this happening um that was shameful and embarrassing they saw that but he was emphasizing that what they really saw was the after part right was that congress came back last night and you all did your job uh and he's raising the same point that you're raising which is that isn't enough the question is though then what is uh congressman i mean i know you're you're calling for impeachment do you have concrete republican support for this is this anything that could actually happen well let's let's back up for a moment right now the executive branch of the united states is in complete disarray it is led by a man who is borderline deranged who is responsible for having incited a violent attack against the united states congress to stop us from doing our jobs the most important thing right now is for the legislative branch for congress to remain in session i think it was a mistake for our leadership to send us home last night although people are frazzled and tired we need to be in these buildings we need to be working absolutely we should be considering everything from uh impeachment to censure uh to congress doing its part to invoke the 25th amendment which the constitution allows us to do we need to be uh reckoning with the role of law enforcement in our country in dealing with white nationalist far-right extremism and terrorism we have been lackadaisical about that there's legislation we could come back here on monday and pass um there are a whole host of things uh that that we can be doing and we should be doing because they are right and because we want to show the american people this institution is functioning even as the president is degenerating into whatever he may be right now well certainly he wasn't running hasn't been for quite some time but yesterday obviously even i'm just talking on a very practical logistical basis mike pence was running the country right in terms of the national guard and those things um but but i i i understand you want impeachment i understand your point about the 25th amendment do you think censure would be enough if that's all you could get would that send a statement to the world to the president do you think censure is a reasonable outcome here or you actually believe you've got the support to go further you know it has to be tested i i spoke to several of my republican colleagues yesterday i'm not going to speak for them that wouldn't be fair to them but but there are significant members of the republican party who not only had the integrity to vote against this charade uh yesterday but i think would be ready to support action against the president of the united states uh i don't know how far we could go whether it's censure impeachment or the 25th amendment i just know we need to be here working on on that right now the legislative branch is the only branch of our government that can govern that is led by sane and competent people we need to be doing our jobs all right congressman malinowski i appreciate your time and thank you very much

for more I want to bring in two army veterans congressman bill Pascrell Democrat of New Jersey with us from englewood cliffs and with us from Washington former VA official Brandon Friedman who completed combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan Brandon allow me to start by thanking you and the congressman for your service but Brandon when you hear the litany of challenges facing our vets today is it not clear that we are falling seriously short of fulfilling what the president described as our duty to our troops well Martin first thanks for having me on a day historically we had fallen far short of what we owe veterans in this nation however you know that said we've come a long way in the last four or five years in this administration a lot of the things that you mentioned while they're not good for example the backlog still stands at about 400,000 claims that has dropped by thirty four percent in the last eight months unemployment is also on the way down so while we have a long way to go we've seen a lot of progress in the last several years and hopefully we can keep that up because we we certainly do this to our veterans we absolutely do congressmen the president today pledged that our troops will be and I'm quoting him the best cared for the best treat respected veterans in the world but when you see nine hundred thousand veterans living in households that rely on Nutrition Assistance close to one and a half million without health insurance it seems for your colleagues across the aisle opposing the president is more important than supporting things like affordable health care and food assistance that vets desperately need well there's not enough people on the other side then all honestly Martin to say or appreciate what you just said look we all talk about veterans we Pat them on the back we say thank you thank you for your service but when you look at those numbers about how many are on food stamps 22 a day commit suicide that means we're not paying attention the latter fact we're not paying attention to the meta the mental needs of these soldiers that are coming home so many have fallen through the crack since 2001 I mean even New Jersey we've forty-three forty-four thousand new jerseyans have been called into action either in Iraq or in Afghanistan and we let them fall through the cracks up until about three four years ago and who are trying to do something about those mental problems which exists whether you're in the service you're outside the service and the post-traumatic stress disorder has been really a disaster the civilian part of it's been one way out of the Armed Forces it's only been lately that the DoD has really started to catch up and when you have to wait 270 days to get your disability check there is something dramatically wrong when you cut a bunch of the cross it's a crime it's a crime against these men and women it's probably worse than a crime is immoral because we send them out the fight we send our sons and daughters and our neighbors to court to Vietnam to Iraq to Afghanistan to wherever and they're the finest group of men and women that we have in this nation they stand up for our country every day and we have to beg one another to reach out to them and welcome them back give them shelter so many don't have offer them a job where they have a shot or give them some kind of education which we fought for as you know more and got bipartisan support finally in the new GI Bill look we've got a long way to go I know the one thing I hate to hear and Brandon this is no slur on you but I hate to hear where these were going in the right direction man on that boils me because we should get this right from Note one because we made an obligation to those people who went to the service I went into the service they went into the service and fought in the wars they they were on the front lines it would seem to me it's more than an obligation it's a contractual obligation which we have failed to uphold Brandon you have to respond to that because when you think about look when we think about the veterans administration specifically and the backlog itself it hasn't gone away I mean is the VA doing enough well I you know not you know I hate to say this but we are on the right track because when you look at this problem this problem was decades in the making literally it was only seriously they only seriously need to deal with this in the last four or five years with this administration when they moved to automate the disability claims processing system they now have that in place so now that now veterans are filing their their claims electronically this was not in place a few years ago and so that people often underestimate the complexity of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the task and what it's tasked with that getting that process in place to automate the claim system took two to three years and so now that it has been rolled out to all the regional processing offices Brett friend it's all the backlog Pico in bartlett him now 30-10 eight months but Brandon it doesn't seem very complicated to send men and women out into battle and yet it's incredibly complicated to ensure that their benefits can trigger the moment they return this is entirely consistent fatality morn from the last administration it is a mentality not only weren't we prepared to go to war in Iraq and Afghanistan we weren't prepared to take those veterans when they came home and take good care and it's only been the last few years that DoD caught up to their obligations and responsibilities to those soldiers coming back with post-traumatic stress disorder you can't say that this was done from 2001 or 2003 because it wasn't Brandon and you're right to some degree that the past administrations are the presence I don't want to hear about the past administrations we're here now we gotta deal with it we got to face up the way and you got to fight for it and it can't be part of any budget deal what you make between now and January I hey that this is something that we got to put on the line and say we're not going to take any batch steps period in the complexity of the problem this problem was decades in the making and the previous administration is much as you might not want to hear about it the previous administration did not take steps to plan for this they started two wars two wars yes and they sent hundreds and hundreds of thousands of troops tour and they did not plan for this this administration has come in and they have taken steps to modernize this system and it has taken several years as you keep saying it's only in the last several years we've we've made this progress but that's what it takes the you know when I came into VA I completely underestimated the complexity of the organization and how deep these problems went and I think a lot of people do but now that you know you might know one here but now we are on the right track the unemployment rate is dropping the backlog is literally plummeting in the last eight months the department has hired 1,600 mental health clinicians in the last year so this department has made more progress in the last couple of years than you had seen it in any period up to this yeah I think that's right congressman we know that the number of veterans seeking help from the VA has soared even as the suicide rate has also risen would it not be more prudent to get more veterans health coverage including mental health benefits absolutely as the Affordable Care Act would do absolutely and it's unfortunate that from 2001 to 2008 and 2009 very little was done in the area of mental health very little we did not put money into the budget concerning a traumatic brain injury into 2008 with the great help of the four min late great congressman Jack Murtha and a few of us got together I've been working on this for 12 years I've been working on this before Iraq and Afghanistan and we've got to make sure that we understand what the implications how many have fallen through the cracks how many did not get any help when they got out of the service and where are they now doing Haunter themselves the families into the Restless society and then we look back and say what are the consequences of this there are great consequences we can do something about it we have the power we have the authority as complex as it is Brandon we got to be doing much better than we're doing congressman bill Pascrell and Brendan Friedman thank you both for joining us and I wish to thank you on behalf of our broadcast both of you for your service to this nation thank you John thanks coming up what

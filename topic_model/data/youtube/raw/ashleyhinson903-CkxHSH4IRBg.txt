remember all the talk of the blue wave a democratic landslide well house republicans defied that expectation last week by blocking efforts to expand a democratic majority and many are crediting female candidates as the house gop is set to add a record 13 women to its ranks this includes our next guest who defeated democrat congresswoman abby finkenauer in iowa congresswoman elect ashley hinson joins us now congresswoman that's got to be uh music to your ears to hear that every time that you do hear it what was the difference in your race you beat an incumbent not an easy thing to do how'd you do it well i think it just came down to uh driving all around the district i'm a mom who drives a minivan we have a mortgage i'm an everyday iowan and that's really what it came down to i i listened to the concerns of the people in my district and i think it was a very clear message that they said they're tired of the left-leaning rhetoric about medicare for all a green new deal and nancy pelosi's stalling of much needed aid for iowa families and so i think that's what it really came down to hard work and a lot of miles on the mob van congresswoman congratulations on your win i hear you on what drove out voters in iowa you plan to it sounds like stand in opposition to the radical agenda of the left but one of the great lessons of donald trump's last four years is also a repositioning of the republican party when it comes to working class americans i'm curious where you as a republican representative and what you think the house of representatives will do to continue in that vein to continue with that focus or will it be returned to the republican party of four years ago well i think it's all about economic opportunity and prosperity and how do we continue to push that forward no matter what our landscape looks like that's why i ran for office in the first place is to give families in iowa the chance at a good life that's what i think we all want so continuing to focus on tax reform if at all possible i know your last guest was talking a little bit about that infrastructure and how that affects everybody's daily life here in iowa i chaired the transportation committee in the iowa house so i've had some experience in looking at that and how how infrastructure projects can really help our communities to to grow and expand so um i think that's what this this next congress is going to be about that's what our new generation of republican leaders are about is continuing to focus on ways where we can give everybody that economic prosperity and that opportunity going forward and congresswoman elect just quickly if you could just comment on that stat we mentioned earlier that's pretty big number 13 non-incumbent republican women big leadership role being taken by women in the republican party especially considering that the left often labels that party anti-woman a brief comment on that if you will well i'm just so proud of the the crop of incoming freshmen that we have i've been spending the last couple of days on the phone getting to know a lot of them before we head out for orientation next week but i think it's something to be proud of a lot of the seats that we were able to flip were with republican women they were with veterans they were with minorities so um i think it's a very clear signal that uh this is the the future of the republican party right here and we're ready to get to work all right congresswoman elect ashley hinton congratulations again on your big win congrats thank you guys appreciate it coming up dueling demonstrations in atlanta between trump

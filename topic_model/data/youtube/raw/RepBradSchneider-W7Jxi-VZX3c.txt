more time just so everybody has it you can do it online at 2020census.gov or call by telephone english 844-330-2020 or spanish 844-468-2020 great thank you and now i want to introduce our guests who are doing great work in our community spreading the word about the census and ensuring that everyone is is counted we're joined today by carmen patlon who is the executive director of the of the hollywood library and david mcdowell manager for impact funding and advocacy at the united way of lake county i'll start with carmen uh carmen could you please introduce yourself a little bit more and share how the highway public library is engaging in the 2020 census thank you brad for this invitation and for allowing me to be part of this venue yes my name is carmen batlan i have been the executive director of the howard public library for the last a little over a year working in a community that is has a dense hard to count population we felt that it was critical for the library to engage with tony 20 census work and we have been working very diligently since january engaging the population ensuring that they understand the impact and the importance of registering for the census great thank you carmen and now let me turn it to uh to david uh from the united way uh david please introduce yourself and talk about what united way is doing to help us uh make sure we get everybody counted in the 2020 census thank you congressman united way uh decided to get involved in the census uh fairly early on um uh last year largely because most of the families that we noticed are most of the populations that we noticed are under counted are also the populations that united way and its community partners serve uh so we thought we've got a network of strong organizations from partners who can work with trusted messengers and can talk to the families in those hard-to-count communities about the importance of the census and why they should be involved great well thanks to both of you and your organizations for all you're doing uh now i've got a few questions that i have that i'll ask our guests but uh i want to let folks know that we're also able to answer questions uh you might have about the census um in the facebook live comments uh so if you have any you can uh put them there but my first question i'll start with you carmen um what are some of the common misconceptions about the the 2020 census and how it works and what impact it has so what i'm hearing from families is that that maybe their information is not secure maybe their information will be shared with the other branches of government uh there's still the misconception that the immigration question is being asked and that the government is utilizing this data for tracking purposes that may impact them negatively in the in the future um and it's just more paperwork that the government wants from us so those are the the common misconceptions that i'm hearing from families in my community and it's an overall fear or an overall sense of ah what does it matter i i don't even count i don't see the money coming to me directly so those are the those are the misconceptions that i'm hearing and those are the barriers that we're looking to overcome with families right and we just have to make sure people understand it is so important it affects everything that's going on in our community so it's really important how about you david what are you hearing i actually think one of the uh biggest misconceptions about the census is that people don't care i don't think people understand the barriers that exist to people actually answering the questions there are four key barriers to folks the first one is people are hard to locate if if we don't know where they are we can't access uh either uh our outreach workers or the census can't access people it doesn't matter uh what they think about the census they don't hear about it and they don't connect to it the second one is we may know uh where they live but it's difficult to get to because uh there are gated communities or they're in apartment buildings that you can't get access to um or they've got uh barriers that ex that include fear it's fear of being scammed it's fear of strangers knocking on their doors the the the one that most people talk about is just one of three and that is people who have a mistrust of government that is a barrier uh that needs to get over but the fourth barrier is that we may know where they are uh they may want to answer the census but there's a communication challenge this year that's uh especially visible through the fact that the census bureau is trying to do everything on the internet and so folks that are not well connected or not well-versed in using the internet um they may want to fill out the forms but they just they just can't they don't know how right and again to remind people it is available on the internet the phone numbers will repeat them again and uh that i think is is one of the important reasons but uh carmen turning back to you you know there's specific barriers that are are distinct maybe not unique but distinct latino community barriers that are specific to people for whom perhaps english is not the primary language in the home you want to touch on on some of those certainly so the the major the main concern that we're hearing is the lack of trust and we'll we're going to keep reiterating this as the conversation goes day uh you know as dave mentioned brad it is the lack of trust families that especially new immigrant families have many barriers that they're facing right now they're in survival mode uh right now with covid in the picture and now especially with all of the rioting happening it's like a perfect storm against the senses so it tends not to be a priority in families minds right now so especially for latino immigrants that are new to this country they don't understand what the census is for they have a mistrust of local government and of government period when you come and you ask them you know we need to count you because you're important and your information is critical for us to make sure that we have the the accurate statistics that will determine the benefits that are going to be coming to our communities they still it's like um it's okay i'll do it later but then they don't do it and so i think that coming creating an atmosphere of trusted voices to target this demographic is key working with families um having someone like myself or someone that i the people that i work with that are latino engaging latinos is making a little impact but again the overall sense is that i'm afraid i don't want to give you my information i don't want to be put in any jeopardy i'm new to this country i don't know what this is and so i don't want to be counted and when you're trying to explain to these to the families that we're working with that you know you if you count whether your status is is uh you're documented or undocumented you and your children will determine how much funding will come to each of these communities if you don't count i always highlight the dollar amount that is going to be impacted for each person for the next 10 years that kind of resonates with them and they kind of uh begin to to break down those walls but it is very difficult yeah and i want to explain something you said you talked about people new to the country the census is about counting everybody and it is everybody whether they were born here or they immigrated here irrespective of their immigration status people who are new literally people who may have arrived in the in the last day or two whether by birth or by immigration that newborn infant counts every bit as much as the adult who's coming here for for a job all of that matters because every single person is a part of the census and it's been that way since the founding of our country and it's important to know that this is how we establish our government and i appreciate the concerns about the fears certainly there are people and some people in high places in government who are trying to stoke those fears but i'm going to quote abraham lincoln government of the people for the people by the people that is because of our census in part that is census allows us to have that and everyone being counted is is a critical critical piece of that um and david you touched on this a little bit earlier the certainly the pandemic is affecting how we are doing the census you know as i said we've been doing this the entire history of our country at one point it was people knocking on your door uh riding up on horseback today we're using technology with the internet and phones but how is cobit affecting it and what should people be aware of i think um i think there are a number of things that are that are impacting this census um we've talked a little bit about the immigration issue we're going to talk about kovid but i think we also have to acknowledge that the the protests that are happening are raising very serious issues about uh a large part of our population that also is um struggling with full recognition with the african-american community um uh i think what we've run into with the coveted pandemic is the first problem is we can't talk to people face to face much of our outreach plan was based on having trusted messengers talking to people about the importance that we can't do the other challenge is that places where people gather or connect those have disappeared under social distancing and other trusted messengers like home visiting programs or health departments or health uh clinics those are the also places that we were going to try to reach our targeted populations and those uh they're overwhelmed with uh responding to covet 19 and are not able to partner with us around the census at the same time i think uh the census is about being counted when you have a large part of the nation standing up and saying we're not seen uh uh and there is a a uh quite frankly at the administrative level on the federal government an unwillingness to really listen to that message it's going to make it much harder for us on the ground to say the census is important you need to be counted when uh we're struggling with a federal government that is not quite sure uh whether or not the voices that are coming from the protests are important enough to hear and i think that's something that we need to acknowledge we're struggling against what's happening um at the federal level as well absolutely and let me say that every voice is important to hear and that's part of the reason why the census is so important uh the other thing david you mentioned we've lost in many ways protests contrary to that but we've lost the public split square the gathering the places meeting in libraries and things like that but i'll raise a question two questions that i guess are linked um we are having gatherings like this we're on facebook people are using other social media or video platforms to to be together with family or friends even though they're remotely so something that each of us can do as individuals is when we have these gatherings remind our friends to to go get the counted to make sure they've taken the census uh and we've seen in in certainly in in the 10th county but illinois we're doing better than the national average we're about 60 70 of the way there we have a long way still to go we want to get 100 because everyone has to be counted and so uh for both of you i'll start with you karma within the context and you mentioned this in the early some of the initiatives we're seeing being taken in our communities to to get that number to 100 and and some of the things that we might still try to do so what we've been trying to do here in highwood uh when we set out to do this project we said that we wanted to get last census we got to 70.2 percent so we said if we get anywhere over 80 close to 90 percent we're going to be very happy so we were excited we had plans to do all some major events we had a lot of plans but then all of a sudden they all crumbled with kovid so we had to become creative on how we reached the population and our heart to count community here so what we're doing is uh one of our trusted voices is a lunch mom so at every lunch pickup she's reminding families register for the census this food is made possible because of funding that we're getting due to the census resources and so we are distributing information at every lunch pickup we have uh gotten stickers that we're putting on tortilla packs and at tostada packs and on three liter cokes or sodas at our local local merchants local grocery stores to stay in front of families we were able to secure a lot of giveaways so every time families come and pick up food from our pop-up food distribution we're giving families a frisbee we're giving families a water bottle and we're reminding them you have to register for the census it is critical that you get counted that your three month old gets counted that your 12 year old gets counted and so we want to make sure that families that we're in front of their face and so i think our efforts are working so far we're at 63.6 completed here in highwood so we're nowhere near our goal but i feel like we're in a good position right now that if we continue to stay on this path that we can reach that 80 85 percent hopefully 100 percent goal but yes there are many barriers that are preventing us from making things happen here for so right before the shutdown we had a churros event trying to be as culturally sensitive as possible to our community and so we had a great turnout and so we had planned el dia del nino and uh and uh ice cream socials but all of those unfortunately had to be cancelled so we're becoming creative on how we target that audience and so we're we ordered face masks that we're going to give away to families that have the census information on it and so anywhere that they go they're a constant reminder this is something that's critical and important that we need to complete and so we want to stay in front of this and we want to stay in front of everybody's face that says you know get counted your numbers matter and you count absolutely um david how about united way well we we made an immediate shift in how uh we had a very extensive plan uh working with community partners we made an immediate shift when uh in early march when the governor issued a stay-at-home order our outreach workers basically got on the phone and started calling we looked for places where there was still connection school districts are still reaching out to families food banks were going to be um more and more active as folks lost their job and we've been working to move uh flyers out electronically or delivering flyers uh to uh food banks and to the organizations that we're funding through our uh over 19 community response fund to to get census information out uh while we're doing that and we've actually gotten a lot more contacts out with flyers than we had initially expected to but that still isn't as high quality contact as talking to people face to face or actually having community leaders as they're whether they're pastors or teachers themselves or other places of contact pushing the census message out as well the census as carmen had mentioned is critically important for programs that are in uh really life savers for many of our families medicare student loans for parents that are going to have kids going to college in the next 10 years uh the money for student loans and pell grants are proportioned by the population uh school breakfast school lunches many of the things that are being delivered by school districts now even though they're not open those are funded through um census grants uh wic and head start these are all pieces that are critical to our families and we need to get the count up so it's it's going to become more and more important that pastors are talking about this with uh their congregations that um places uh even when people are gathering around uh uh sort of memorializing george floyd it's important that the census piece start to be a part of that conversation if you want to be seen if you want to be counted there are numbers of ways that that has to be done and being in the street and being vocal is one of them but being a part of the census is also one and so that's part of the message that we need to start moving out the other thing that i would want to would want to mention really quickly is that the census self-response time was originally scheduled to end at the end of july the census department has moved that up to october so the census will extend much longer than it normally does and there's going to continue to be opportunity for our community stakeholders as they begin to open up to be more active on the census and uh we're going to be reaching out and trying to make that happen as we stretch into late summer and early fall sorry i also wanted to add that one of the things that has really been impactful for us as well is that we have i've recruited 13 very active community members and they're my promoters and so they're our ambassadors and they are reaching their own networks so i think that that is that grassroots effort that is really making an impact here in highwood is that we get trusted voices from within the community to do grassroots uh marketing and engaging to their own networks uh yeah i think that's absolutely right and carmen you mentioned uh this idea of community leaders i think we do have to convey as leaders the the uh responsibility but also the trust and and be uh very focused on that uh but also as others have mentioned the the the protests that are going on over 24 period hour yesterday and i guess wednesday night i was at uh three protests within the community all student organized all organized by our young people and these leaders it's amazing what they're doing as they're pulling people together but so i guess this is a a not so subtle plea to our young people to step up and lead as well this is your future as you touched on it is about education it is about what resources will get for our are not just primary and secondary schools but for universities uh it's about housing it's about roads it's every single aspect that touches each of our our lives so getting counted matters and i think there's an opportunity for leadership not just from elected leaders not just from community community leaders students but everyone in in the community and we can really um make a huge difference so as we're trying to wrap up i wanted to give just a general opportunity for us to to to close with some thoughts uh start with you carmen any specific things you want to say and i will repeat before we close the phone numbers and website again yeah so this flyer this little postcard is what we're handing out to people and so i'll just say it in in spanish as it reads here in english the senseless the senses is safe it's easy and it's important and this is the message that we want to convey to as many family members as we have here especially the hard to count the immigrant population the young families that are new to this country we want them to understand that they matter that they count regardless of their status in this country so that's the final message that i want to share is that we're working hard to make sure that everyone gets counted that we keep all of our congressional seats that we get the funding that each community requires to be successful and to thrive so thank you brad for this opportunity to present these this important issue here thank you carmen david didn't you last stop yes the one thing that i would add is that figuring out how to get connected is one of the key parts that we're facing a united way of lake county has the 2-1-1 lake county helpline so if people are looking for a direct path to census information dial 2-1-1 and speak to the the folks at the other end of the line and they can help you get connected to the census department order organizations um like the highwood library or like mono amano that can help work through any questions you have about the census it's also a great resource for anybody that has questions about covid19 or needs access to any other help so i want to make sure that folks are comfortable um and are aware that if you don't know where else to turn just call two one one thank you to two one one's a great service and again thanks for uh setting that up so let me let me summarize real briefly i'm gonna go through the five things real quickly again number one everybody counts we need everyone on on board number two uh the census does not does not include a citizenship question number three it's confidential number four it's easy really easy and number five it is so so important so let me close with the the uh information of how to complete the census it takes less than 10 minutes you can do it online 2020census.gov again 2020

a couple additional questions i want to add to the conversation here the next one is i think this was part of your background mr barola as of 2020 39 of all undocumented students pursuing graduate degrees have an undergraduate degree in stem fields and thousands of daca recipients work in health care roles as teachers in food and agricultural industries now daca recipients we know pay billions of dollars annually in state and local taxes and like international students found businesses at higher rates than their native born counterparts so these are young people who are creating jobs and revitalizing communities in the process indeed daca recipients like dr larios have played a critical role as essential workers during the pandemic in their ongoing economic recovery that's why i introduced the citizenship for essential workers act as my first bill in congress last year to provide essential workers like dr larios who keep us healthy who keep us fed who keep us safe during the pandemic with a pathway to citizenship now dr ladies as a physician do you worry about the impact on patients medical care if you and other daca recipients who are working in health care lost your ability to live and work legally in the united states yes absolutely this is something that i worry about the amc so the association of american medical colleges published a report in june of 2020 noting that there's a projected shortage of up to 124 000 physicians in the next 12 years together with our ongoing pandemic every member of the healthcare community counts we need everyone every doctor every nurse every physician assistant and so on to continue ensuring that our population in the u.s is taken care for properly with this said there are nearly as was mentioned earlier 30 000 daca recipients in healthcare and about 200 medical students and residents who again have daca and would be able to contribute to this to ensuring that the shortage is a little bit lessened by having more members participate actively and and contribute the amc has also noted that in their lifetime if you look at those nearly 200 medical students and residents that have daca they will touch the lives of 1.7 to 5.1 million patients certainly this is not a trivial number and knowing that we have an america that has enough doctors that can care for them is something that i think we can all be on board and it highlights that everyone matters and and deportation especially in a time of need um does would not make sense uh so definitely something something i worry about from a numbers perspective and from the other perspective is from a cultural perspective we want to know we want to show that our healthcare workforce and really any workforce represents the people that we're serving that it is diverse that it comes from individuals from all aspects of our america and i think daca helps do that as well absolutely particularly a cultural competency in uh medical care is uh important for ensuring quality of care correct now we've also heard today how training and developing and retaining immigrant students here in the united states is imperative to preserving our global competitive edge in technology and innovation and continuing to help our economy recover however in order to obtain a visa to come to the united states international students must typically demonstrate that they are not intending to stay in the united states following graduation that seems short-sighted for our country if we want to actually compete for global talent students who study here and wish to remain must navigate outdated and restrictive immigration policies including a highly competitive temporary visa lottery and a years or decades-long backlog for employment-based visas mr barola i know in your previous answer we touched on this i'm asking you to maybe expand and explain why it is difficult for an international student grad graduate to simply stay and work in the united states after completing their studies and also how not just how it impacts the students themselves but how it impacts the universities and colleges as institutions thank you chairman it's interesting the us is really the only country that has this immigration law which does not allow students to stay after they complete their studies other countries welcome them to their to their universities and then continue to welcome them to work and contribute to their economies we do not do that as i mentioned after about 60 days after graduation students will need to either depart the country get a h-1b visa or a green card or they could also use optional practical training which is one option where they stay as an international student and contribute by an academic process of learning a particular field for a short period of time but it's still not a pathway to a work permit and this makes it challenging for our universities to compete with foreign universities that have that option when again when a student is looking at where to study they're looking at how quickly can they get that student visa how expeditiously can that can that visa be obtained and also can they stay and work in the country after they finish their their studies thank you

reintroductions as the case may be an issue like this so my name is bill Huizenga I'm a freshman congressman from the 2nd district in Michigan and you may be kind of wondering what's a freshman doing with it out with a bill that's been around for a decade well I actually haven't had the pleasure of being the district director for congressman pete Hoekstra my predecessor who started working on this and i also am home to currently two of the three largest office furniture makers in the world herman owner and Haworth that's going to be expanding under redistricting and i'll be taking in steel case as well and that that had been a major issue for us back home when we were dealing this and and we welcome you here today as we shed light on this very important issue which is literally restoring competitive access to businesses across America from from government contracts and as you can see this is something that is bipartisan we can all agree on this one and we're working on making sure that it's bicameral as well that actually might be tougher right congresswoman getting getting the Senate sometimes rather than with publicans and Democrats together but this this bill is seen bipartisan support over the years it's soon be bicameral the sponsorship of this has been broad and as you'll hear it's an issue that affects virtually all states in a variety of industries as you'll see in this chart back over here so we have some folks here today with us dick McDonald dick is dickies with t3 global strategies small business in Pennsylvania John pehle TLO over here who is ahead of the Business Coalition for fair competition and then Ellen boo boo who is chief executive officer linens of the week buist right Ellen and located in Washington DC and with a moniker like Huizenga sometimes with challenges on the name so with that this is as I was saying this is an issue that's near and dear to my heart and you're looking at one of the reasons right here this this is one of the one of the best sellers in the office furniture industry and the aeron chair created by herman miller built in my home town back in zeeland michigan and it is widely used if you don't have one I'd highly recommend it it's it's it's a great seating enjoyment so but yeah it's not just for me Miller we actually looked at it with their 17 private wholesale and manufacturing facilities and companies near my small town in zeeland michigan in in western michigan and of course every government agency needs those chairs but sometimes herman miller or a worth your students can't even compete for those for those bids and even bid on those contracts and that's what happens instead is unicore of federal industries of government-owned corporation which employs prisoners under the Federal Bureau of Prisons to manufacture products and provide services that are then sold to federal agencies now get this they have 89 factories in most states that was something that totally blew me away that their impact and their footprint is that big and sometimes these agencies are required to buy fpi products or services without being even allowed to shop around for the greatest value and one of the great memories I had on this issue back when I was working for me hoekstra was when the Social Security Administration opened a brand spanking new office in Holland Michigan that was literally within eyesight of one these office furniture makers Hayward within 10 miles of Herman Miller and within 20 miles of steel case yet they were not allowed to even bid on that contract and we had to have unicorn furniture go into this it made absolutely no sense from from a number of angles cost delivery the schedule that was on there they actually delayed the opening of this is my recollection because they couldn't deliver the furniture on time and here we are literally in the shadow of office furniture makers so we are we're trying to make sure that this bill preserves market access for these products and services to the hard-working men and women hard-working taxpayers of all of our districts and it's simply one more easy common what sense way to preserve jobs and help to restore the economy and security here in the United States and currently government currently does nearly million jobs that the private sector could do we believe that that has an impact of about twenty seven billion dollars a year in taxpayer dollars that that are going into there now that's common sense that we need to put out there and I want to join my colleagues today and with our legislation find that at highs and get da house gov black backslash FBI and we need to end this and with that I want to turn it over to the distinguished ranking member if I'm sorry ranking member Frank was is actually delayed with the Financial Services Committee that both congresswoman Maloney and I serve on but with that I want to introduce congressman congresswoman carolyn Maloney from New York's 14th district along the east side of manhattan who has been a champion of this particular issue for nearly a decade i think is when you started working on that so with that I want to thank mr. huizinga and actually this is our second effort today we passed a bill out of committee that we were both working on in financial services earlier and what we're talking about today is American jobs and fairness and the bill were introducing versions of which I helped author it which I co-sponsored over the last dozen years with his predecessor mr. Hoekstra role these bills this bill will require the federal prison industries or FBI to compete with private sector businesses on a level playing field our bill should increase the number of private sector businesses winning government contracts and it will improve the wages and working conditions of FBI employees so this is our bill is a win for everyone and we've been pushing so hard hopefully this year would be able to pass it and turn it into the reality of a loan for decades the FBI brands have had an absolute monopoly as a supplier on things such as clothing uniforms and the military gloves of the military and office furniture and even 800 number call center services to the prison system itself and to agencies in the executive branch that near malapa monopoly was based on wages taxes and workplace regulations that the private sector could not possibly match some FBI employees are paid less than a dollar an hour for FBI businesses also pay absolutely no taxes or rent and occupational health and safety laws do not apply the reason that I have supported this for so long and for this FBI reform is that it impacted on my own district in New York I have a blow manufacturer which was producing many of the gloves for the military one day without any notice the military cancelled their contracts and said that FBI is going to be doing the business from now on these men and women were not even given an opportunity to compete they were allowed to try to give a product that was better or cheaper to the American people and taxpayers and with this action of congressman hoekstra and I formed a really a coalition a team effort where we supported initiatives in our own states and across the country to protect the American worker at the very least give them notice let them have the chance to compete for this business and our bill today will ensure fair competition that federal contracts are awarded to the company that will provide the best products at the best prices and terms consistent with federal purchasing standards and include a private sector impact statement for any FBI work that is accepted at the same time this bill will also phase in the federal minimum wage for FBI employees require that FBI industrial workplaces adhere to OSHA rules and enhance vocational training within the bureau of prisons to better prepare inmates to work in the private sector once they are released this is a win-win for everyone private sector businesses who will win more federal contracts and improve working conditions training and wages for prisoners who are doing marketplace work and I am very very proud to support it I'm pleased to stand with many American businesses that are competing with the FBI and they should not have to compete line folded and with both arms tied behind their back and in some case has not even given notice that the contracts are out there or that they're going to be taken away from them and i must say on a personal note congressman hoekstra night but all can go before the FBI industries in appeal on behalf of certain companies and in some cases we were successful I believe this is an absolutely important to Bill to the American economy for American business and also the inmates as it will provide them with better training and vocational training for the time that they will be released I thank you for including me and I yield back those are great cheers we're happy to get you a lot of 2nd district product yeah well with that I'd like to ask dick McDonald who is with t3 global strategies as home Thank You congressman good afternoon my name dick mcdonald and i'm the director of federal services with t3 global strategies worse a small business located in the Pittsburgh suburb suburb of Bridgeville Pennsylvania and we offer a full line of surveying parametric mapping and geographic information system services i'm also the current president of maps the national association of mapping firms what federal prison industries just doesn't offer produce product tangible products i want to affirm today that yes in fact FBI does perform mapping services and many state prison industries have entered mapping related services including geographic information systems or GIS computer aided design and drafting or CAD services data entry scanning and digitizing the FBI is developed these capabilities to provide services to federal agencies as well that p is own documents have said it as quote is broadening its prime contractor role in the areas of digitization of maps and GIS applications digitization of engineering facilities management drawings is scanning and digitized private sector mapping firms including small businesses like mine we already suffer from Ontario government competition there are dozens of federal agencies of G mapping in house with federal employees despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of private sector firms that could do this work as contractors to the government We strongly support the legislation that representative as in gun and his colleagues have introduced this legislation is long overdue and is especially needed today given our high unemployment rate we should not be giving advantages to inmates when we have honest law-abiding taxpaying citizens out of work thank you very much and with that I'd like to ask John pehle TLO Business Coalition for your competition Thank You congressman Isaiah original Maloney I have been i also have been involved in this issue for quite a number of years and what is unique about this issue as a couple things number one mr. Heyman is baloney talked about the very broad and bipartisan group of members of Congress that have led and supported this legislation over the years and which they have reassembled behind this bill again this year what has been gratifying is that a similar coalition has historically worked on this bill in a private sector we have had the wonderful opportunity over the years of having the afl-cio and the US Chamber of Commerce become the national association of manufacturers at NFIB and we've had unite we've had private companies and federal Managers all who believe that competition drives quality and that has been lacking in this equation in the past the GAO has done studies of federal prison industries and what they have found is that their products and services do not meet agency requirements they are not necessarily delivered in a timely manner they often are more expensive than a private sector despite the advantages that FBI have that others including miss Maloney have mentioned secondly this is about a monopoly versus a competitive process the Napoles are inefficient whether their government monopolies or private sector monopoly so what this bill is all about is injecting more competition into federal procurement it permits the private sector to offer their goods or services and let good old-fashioned market competition and finally as mr. McDonald said at a time of high unemployment we shouldn't be giving preferences to inmates when you have law-abiding hardworking Americans that want to work the final point that I would make is this this is a balance bill there are features in this legislation that provide alternatives to FBI actually being in competition with for you surfing opportunities for the private sector there are opportunities for FBI to serve organizations like Habitat for community where everything there is donated and there's not a business opportunity lost in that transaction and finally most importantly the coalition that's behind this bill is very sensitive to the needs of guards and prison administrators that you do not want idleness in the prisons and you do not want recidivism number one this bill does provide alternatives to make sure there's not I don't miss that there are actually more effective programs to rehabilitate and educate and occupy inmates and historically the inmates that have been an FBI actually have had higher recidivism rates that nose in other programs so this bill not only names to inject competition and help the private sector but there are features in the bill to help with prison management and actually help folks who are incarcerated to become better citizens upon their re-entry into society so we strongly endorse the bill congratulate congressman Huizenga congresswoman Maloney and look forward to working with a broad bipartisan coalition of private sector groups and members of Congress in enacting this bill into law thank you regulations thanks Jenna and it's interesting you brought up habitat when I was in Michigan State Legislature we actually had a similar situation and we had to go in and change the law that allowed state prisoners to build sort of preassembled components for those Habitat homes gives them a skill gives a productive outcome beneficial outcomes to society and doesn't take away those private sector jobs social i think is an important port direction so with that Alan pubis who is chief executive officer of lenin's of the week located here in Washington DC okay Thank You congressman Hosea I now AM you Bizarros Eck you toughest herb Williams of the week a textile rental company which is headquartered in Washington DC we have locations here in DC Maryland Delaware Virginia and Florida I'm here representing the textile rental services association TRS a is the national association representing industrial loggers and textile manufacturers in an effort to level the playing field in which the federal prison system has an unfair advantage TRS a strongly supports HR 3630 for an instant across the country TRS eight members are competing for business with prison and laundries in some instances in the public market space our ability to translate lo ma costs in the sub competitive pricing has made it much more difficult to competing private companies like us to succeed labor costs are the largest ongoing expense in our industry and competing with prison laundry to labor costs are far below prevailing rates creates an unfair playing field competing with the government does not foster a healthy business environment for us this competition reduces the number of jobs that I and others in our industry are able offer trs-80 members also make regular investments in the latest most efficient laundry equipment to minimize our needs for water and energy we use environmentally friendly detergent we reduce reuse and recycle supplies Prison laundries operations do not duplicate these green benefits although I believe strongly in job training for inmates it should not be at the expense of private sector jobs tsa is very grateful to these members of Congress stand against government competition and we look forward to seeing this bill I am with that we've got an interesting perspective here with us Jonathan long his background and what he's had to deal with a good afternoon my name is Jonathan long I'm the program manager for military systems for proper international proper has been manufacturing clothing and textiles for the department fence since nineteen sixty seven we're very proud of that heritage our concern is the erosion of opportunity to compete for govt business our industries market share is declining because a significant portion of the DoD contract and our field are being given to federal prison industries this means that companies like ours can no longer even compete for those opportunities while we support the intent of the FBI program and we need to find ways to rebuilt eight prisoners serving life terms you don't believe that taking scarce jobs away from law-abiding citizens is the way to proceed so our question is why the federal government would allow the removal of jobs from communities which are already impacted by high unemployment because FBI policy is to give those jobs to prisoners as a rehabilitation aid these are factory jobs that could put people to work today but instead FBI is trained prisoners to be sewing machine operators these kinds of jobs won't be in existence anymore if FBI continues to take that work from private industry we fill this policy seems a bit misguided and really negatively impacts our part industry's ability to produce the most innovative equipment for our servicemen and women and the established prisoner when they're released won't have much of a chance for employment because this same policy has taken those jobs away we think that the FBI it offers what we call false economy it promises low procurement prices and rehabilitate a prisoner employment in the end we believe that the government will receive neither the FBI products such as the army combat helmet which recently recalled last year due to poor quality actually increase total program costs and at the same time neither the existing unemployed factory worker put out of a job because of the policy or the newly rehabilitator prisoner will be able to find jobs the point now is is to help control the FBI's appetite for growth in the military clothing and textiles and push those jobs and production back into the private sector stimulate job room thank you very much thank you and just in closing let us say appreciate you coming out here and one of the founding members of something called the Yellow Pages caucus and what the Yellow Pages caucus is is individuals who have said you know what if you can find it in the yellow pages or in the modern equivalent of on your iPad we have to think long and hard whether the federal government should be doing that and taking that potential taken at potential business away from the private sector now last time that there was a vote on this particular issue was in 2006 and with that there was 300 anumber was 320 362 yes votes and 57 no votes out of the house of representatives there's obviously been some turnover since 2006 but as we've gone through we think that there's a good solid strong base of support here a few of those House members at the time it moved the Senate as well we are having conversations with them as we are doing this and with that I think it will take go take some questions yes I yeah I kind of remember that 2006 so I was around when the group it was in his caucus so that that bill did not pass the Senate for wasn't there an appropriations bill or some other bill that put some restrictions on FB I and and what happened with that that that no longer a factor that it just no not dude there there was a fat Carl Levin who has been very involved in this issue of my recollection that vision into kitchen either at time which dressed some of those specific DoD issues as well so there had been some progress that was made I will tell you that one of the one of the roadblocks at that time was a philosophical difference with the George W Bush administration that was something that he came up against I heard that was experienced coming off the Texas prison so that that was some of those some of those hold of Carolyn you have any other recollections and there was also a pushback from some members of Congress in that they were very interested in the rehab work that was taking place with the prison inmates so an improvement that this bill has our steps to provide the vocational education and vocational training and other supports that will help them get a job when they leave I think it's very important that habitat that the prison industries are developing products for Habitat for Humanity it is a total not for profit and I think that we should look for other areas where we can do contributions to not-for-profit areas such as building the homes but certainly you should not be taking it away from hard-working American men women a very important provision of our our bill is that you have to provide notice and you have to allow the private sector to compete for their own jobs you can't as it stands right now they can just go in there and take those jokes and that's totally unamerican and absolutely wrong and I would venture that a hard-working American man and woman have given the chance to compete would win those jobs on the performance of their work a very important factor and one that we should get a GAO study on is the fact that the helmets were produced and they were not up to standard possibly putting American lives in jeopardy costing money delay and a problem so when the visit industries goes in there they are often not up to the standard that the private sector man and woman is supplied to this country and I will never forget those workers who came in from the glove factory they were devastated many of them were middle-aged and older this had been their profession they took great pride in the work that they were doing and then looking at their faces I could see that the jobs were not going to be out there for them this is very wrong unfair at the very least let them compete and let them work hard to continue the work they're doing to to make this Country Strong Kenneth with regard to your specific question yes there have been some piecemeal reforms that have been enacted over the last several years but they've been just that they've been peaceful some of them applied only to the Department of Defense others were on appropriations bills and holding we're good for one year even with some of those piecemeal reforms we still have companies that experience tremendous difficulty in be able to compete so not all those reforms have worked as well as we would want and so we believe there is still the need for comprehensive reform not only on the competition site but also is miss Maloney just mention on a rehabilitation site as well that's why we're back with a comprehensive bill at this time the tigress minh um you all mentioned where a fragile economy jobs are scarce and all that that's even more true on to roy arias because there are fewer jobs and if you employ so what would the specific impact of your legislation have on rural America you have a lot of rollers in your district on your absolutely urban right Kyra true but in rural America with the impact babe well people get some of the other supporters and sponsors of the bill Jim Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin Walter Jones from north carolina number of others involved in this in the past right it's not just urban centers that produce whether it's office furniture or or wiring harnesses etc etc so we believe that it's going to be well when they have 89 facilities around the country that's a pretty wide swath of areas that were covering and i can tell you for my area we have a lot of people drive in from warm even more rural areas to go and work in at birth or steel casing so we think that this benefits not an urban center specifically we're not a rural area specifically really a broad spectre of the area of the united states and basically the American worker wherever they with this with this legislation legislation may God make it so that FBI contracts would be phased out over time or would it be just an immediate transitional well one of the main elements is the ability to compete so this doesn't end unicore it but it does then take that ability away for them to have exclusive dating rights and I think that's what most of us are looking for is is not just policy makers I believe that the those that are in business are saying at a minimum let us compete I would still get beyond whether it's great philosophical thing to be doing having having everything from recycling and sales and fleet management of vehicles or tronix clothing textile value set office furniture it's almost a 130 million dollars that i can fight a 130 million dollars to the office furniture industry is significant now and it it levels out the playing field as a start and what's so terribly unfair is they can go in now to a company and just terminate the contracts and take the business away that's totally totally unfair private sector jobs just go and say we're no longer going to work with you we're going to close it down oh thanks again for being here today and we'll stick around if anybody has any other questions but with that we will be looking forward to working with you all as we get some progress

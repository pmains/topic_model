Billy and I rise in support of this legislation mr. speaker millions of our fellow Americans in Texas Florida Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are looking to Congress and the administration to work together to provide aid and assistance in recovery and rebuilding I disagree with the president the United States that we're gonna leave Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands or any other American precipitously before we have done the job we need to do the recent hurricanes have left 3.6 million Americans in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands still without power fuel clean water food electricity and access to medical facilities that is unacceptable I say to the administration we are witnessing a humanitarian disaster of historic proportions and it will get worse if we do not come together as a nation and bring to bear the full force of the federal government to assist I thank the chairman for bringing this bill to the floor to effect that end that's why I've called on President Trump to muster every federal resource every federal resource to muster and ensure that aid and supplies can reach those who need them and to work on restoring power water and communications because many are still ala breech we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and loss of life today's Washington Post is a front page story chronicling the tragedy that continues as of now to unfold in Puerto Rico where nightfall brings complete darkness and diseases are spreading by way of contaminated water the island has been plunged into the 19th century the Virgin Islands shares that status this supplemental must be followed in the weeks and months ahead by additional measures to provide disaster relief funding and financial assistance to bring the infrastructure of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands up to 21st century standards in order to prevent a repeat of what has occurred according to a letter sent to the congressional leadership on October 7th by Governor of Puerto Rico Pedrosa yo Robert Rozier yo the damage of that Island is estimated to cost as much as 95 billion dollars which is 150 percent of Puerto Rico's gross national product this funding package is an important step though it fails though it fails to provide urgently needed Medicaid funding to help 1.6 million in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands who rely on Medicaid for their health care Congress must do its part and ensure that the resources are available but it's up to the administration to make certain that the resources we provide get to those who need them so I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this bill and I call up the president again to take every necessary measure to address this humanitarian crisis affecting our fellow Americans and mr. president do not send a message to any American that we will turn our backs on them that is not fair it's not right and you are correct the statement you made gentleman that order and I yield back the balance of my time

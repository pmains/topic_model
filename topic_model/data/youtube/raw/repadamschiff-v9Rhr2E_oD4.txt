all the breaking news the chairman of the house intelligence committee democratic congressman adam schiff of california is joining us mr chairman thanks so much for joining us let me start with your reaction to the white house now raising new concerns about the potential for a russian biological or chemical attack in ukraine have you seen any evidence the russians are actually planning such an attack i can't comment on the intelligence rule but i think that this is all too tragically a part of russian tradecraft when they start talking about an adversary using biological weapons using chemical weapons uh it may be their way of creating this false flag operation this pretext this propaganda that they're going to use to justify their own use of these weapons so it's deeply alarming obviously we're keeping a very close eye out to see whether the russians in fact go forward and use this kind of a false flag approach it's another escalation by putin and another tragic sign that putin is doubling down after suffering such heavy battlefield losses do you have any doubt mr chairman that putin would actually be willing to use chemical or biological weapons at some point i don't doubt it at all tragically i mean he's already demonstrated his willingness to do that of course he's used chemical weapons to poison people uh on foreign soil uh so it's uh not at all beyond his uh evil capacity uh to use these in these conflicts someone who is bombing maternity hospitals is going to stop at nothing the russians have made some some gains in their push toward kiev the capital in recent days u.s intelligence was initially wrong apparently about how quickly the capital key would fall to the russians is there an updated assessment as far as you know as to how long the capital can actually hold out well you know i think one of the difficult things for intelligence agencies to assess is the will of a people to fight uh and of course this was a big issue in afghanistan very recently but what we're seeing in ukraine is there's a tremendous will among the ukrainian people to fight and for that reason they are holding off the russians uh and and doing so beyond our expectation i think also we've been surprised by how incompetent much of the russian military seems to be their basic logistical problems their failure to coordinate so these these have been surprises that in order to the benefit of ukraine but it's always been i think the assessment um that russia has overwhelming military superiority and if they're willing to press it long enough and hard enough uh they will overtake ukrainian defenses but that doesn't mean they win it just means they get further bogged down and this is the terrible tragedy of what's going on in ukraine which is there's no apparent exit ramp for vladimir putin uh he's headed for a strategic defeat uh but at the cost of so many civilian lives yeah dude that's the key point a lot of civilians men women and children are going to be dying in ukraine over the next several days as the russians attempt to move closer and closer towards keefe the u.s and nato as you know mr chairman they continue to refuse ukraine's desperate pleas to establish what's called a no-fly zone over ukraine do you worry the united states could look back let's say a year from now and wish that the u.s had done more and done it sooner well you know it's heartbreaking to see what's going on and i understand the the the fervent desire of ukraine that we impose a no-fly zone and i think many americans watch those images and it's just heartbreaking uh i worry more honestly wolf though of getting into a shooting war with russia uh and that the incredible tragedy uh uh that that would represent and so i think the administration is trying to help ukraine in every way it can we in congress are doing the same uh without crossing the line and getting into a hot war with russia between the united states and russia two nuclear powers i think probably the most pressing need that we can fill is trying to help ukraine with its air defenses and and i've been urging the administration as others and i know they're acting on this to try to find the munitions that ukraine needs to shoot down russian aircraft i also favor a way of finding a way to get those polish aircraft to ukraine uh and i'd like to see us solve that problem and do so quickly yeah the ukrainian leadership president zielinski and others they're they're pleading and pleading for that kind of assistance congressman adam schiff as usual thank you so much for joining us adam schiff's the chairman of the intelligence committee

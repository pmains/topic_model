there um bill clinton when he was president signed defense of marriage act he also uh supported the don't ask hotel policy now he's in favor of same-sex marriage my question is harold ford also says that he's in favor of same-sex marriage can people change their minds and why shouldn't all new yorkers not just gay new yorkers think that he is sincere this is not just you but other ones in history i like converts let me be clear so anybody who was once against gay marriage don't tell my father uh anyone who's once against gay marriage and now wants to be for gay marriage i welcome that support and i think everybody in the community does that's the only way we will ultimately get marriage equality passed in the new york state senate and in other places throughout the country that said the comparison that harold ford has made between himself and senator schumer is a disingenuous comparison harold ford hasn't gone from voting for the so-called defense of marriage act to now saying he's for marriage quote he has a record where he twice twice a position senator schumer never had and president clinton never had twice voted to amend the united states constitution a document which should which is the the skeleton the infrastructure of rights we bestow on america he twice said he wanted that document to now be a document which denied a particular group of americans a right had that happened it would have been the first time the constitution was ever amended to single out some americans for rights and others could have those rights so although i welcome people evolving and understanding uh mistakes they've made in positions and i'm sure i will do that myself but to compare him to senator schumer or president clinton as he has is simply an unfair comparison beyond that we have in senator gillibrand someone who has always supported marriage equality who would never tamper with the constitution to take away people's rights so from my perspective we have the gold standard as it relates to the lgbt community why should we look for anywhere else particularly unfortunately to someone who would change the constitution to limit my rights

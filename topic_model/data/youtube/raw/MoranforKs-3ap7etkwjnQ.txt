for example Planned Parenthood you reach the conclusion that Planned Parenthood is fine what kind of message is that about this difference between right and wrong so it is decisions that we may contribute to this now while this may sound odd talking to a group of Republicans but I've always thought that Christians need to put a higher priority on we need a priority on the ballot box I'm not at all discouraging people Christians from engaging in politics but never lose sight that we're more capable of changing the world at the altar then we are changing the world at the ballot box our priorities have to remain something that transcends all of this stuff and so when you say oh they're family issues that we're concerned about absolutely and one of those things that may be at the top that government plays a role in is we have a government now that is hostile to people who have values religious beliefs hey at where is at least the neutrality where is the circumstance in which we don't have to fear that our government is going to force us to do something that we don't believe in and is reprehensible to us in the standards that we believe why should there be problems hmm

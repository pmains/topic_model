hi everyone how y'all doing this is Wesley hunt here I know many of our small businesses have been her significantly by the challenges that have been posed by coronavirus we are thrilled today to have senator Tim Scott with us he's a senator that's represented South Carolina since 2010 and I think right now his advice and his leadership is what we need for this country fortunately for us he also serves on the Small Business Committee in the Senate so news needless to say he knows exactly what's going on and what we need to do to get America back to work so with that said I'm gonna ask you a few questions sir and then please answer them as you see fit and we'll just go from there so thank you so much for joining us so it's good to be with you and let me just say at the opening Wesley I like your leadership style bottom line is won a primary your running for the general election but you're already constructed of thinking about your constituents you're not thinking about your election you're actually focusing your attention in your time and your valuable resource of being a thinker on the problems that so many of our business owners face I will say that as a former small business owner for over 15 years it's nice to have public officials elected service who understands that the job is not about themselves but that leadership is really about influence and influence today provides an opportunity for those folks to be informed to be educated and hopefully to bring illumination to some very dark corners of what's not happening or what is happening and no better place to start than with small business owners who represent about 50% of all employees work for small businesses about 90% of businesses are small businesses 30 million around the country so thank you for your leadership and I appreciate you taking the time and focusing your attention not on sound bites about having real answers for people who are very interested and also pretty nervous thank you thank you for that I appreciate it sir first question would you begin giving us a brief overview of the payment protection program and the resources being made available to small this owners right now sure the Paycheck protection program is a program designed by the Small Business Committee led by Marco Rubio my good friend as well as Senator Susan Collins who participated intimately in the design I was fortunate enough to be on the task force as well and so my fingerprints are on the PPP that's in one part of the cherries act that I it's been a lot of time on that's been some time on nonprofits in the churches also being engaged and included in the package on the finance task force I was also on that task force as well but on the PPP the paycheck protection program its program designed to help employers maintain their employees on the payroll for eight weeks in addition to that they provide two weeks of equivalent money to your average two weeks of payroll to be used for your overhead expenses said differently seventy-five percent of the money that you borrowed goes to payroll twenty-five percent of the money you borrowed those to your overhead expenses like your rent or your mortgage utilities if you use the money for those two specified purposes that alone becomes a grant that's a really important part if you don't use it for those two specific categories whatever you use outside of those two categories becomes a short term note 24 months with a 1% interest rate that's really important for people to remember that the other thing I would say is that the way you figure out how much you can borrow is by taking your your average monthly payroll multiply that by 2.5 that's your maximum so 2.5 the 2 is for your payroll and the 0.5 is for your overhead right excellent next question I've heard from a number of small business owners here in Houston who have concerns with the rollout of such a large program of this this magnitude how can we make sure that all businesses have access to these to these programs now that's been one of the struggles of the program so the first iteration the program provided about three hundred and fifty billion dollars about three hundred forty billion going to small business owners about ten billion dollars going to those financial institutions in order to process the loan so the way that you make sure that the small business Main Street as we like to call it Main Street gets the money and not just Wall Street or the investor community is by focusing our attention on empowering financial institutions to remember that they have a federal government backed program so the responsibility is to first come first serve that's the responsibility that has been done for the most part we were alarmed and concerned about some of the small businesses that are publicly traded that have access to capital trying to get in line I know in in Houston you have the Texans they would never do that but in Los Angeles the Lakers did do that so they they I caused a bit of a stir or a stink stench in the air not LeBron James flying through it but the owners take cash that's unnecessary so I think they wise they are giving the money back as well as yeah I think Ruth Chris makes a great statement I don't want them to have a subsidize thing on the backs of taxpayers so they knew their money back in pot belly I guess they make sandwiches but we don't need to make it sandwiches on the I have a taxpayer so we're glad to see some of those folks give the money back the 310 B is that's the first 350 that we were able to refill the coffers with another 310 billion dollars that will go to aid a lot of a lot of small businesses the good news is on the first iteration the average loan rate was around under $200,000 and about I think that I think the number is 1.2 million of the 1.6 million of small businesses that received the money had fewer than 10 employees so while you heard a lot of news I'm not sure that I think the news would be a little different if Donald Trump wasn't the president but you've got a lot of new coverage around negative information about the PPP but the truth is 1.2 out of 1.6 million businesses had fewer than 10 employees the second trot is is showing that about the average loan rate so far in the last first three or four days to three days now is around a hundred thousand dollars so the amount of the loans is fall and which tells me that we're now getting targeted targeted into Main Street even more we also set aside about sixty billion dollars for institutions with a gross gross worth gross assets under 10 billion dollars and so that means that we're targeting those institutions that having more intimate and personal relationship with folks from mom-and-pop businesses I mean I used to be a business owner I had a little insurance agency and that started a little real estate company we're trying to get to those folks who understand and appreciate how to create jobs and making sure that they have the liquidity and so I think we're heading in the right direction especially now ok ok another one for you sir I know PPP funding can be used for payroll as we just discussed how many small business owners in Houston rely on income for their businesses so does the PPP a funding allow for owners to compensate themselves yeah so that's a great question let me get back with you on that answer tomorrow ok [Laughter] yes up to one hundred thousand dollars of the any payroll so if the owners on his own or her own payroll she owns the business she pays herself a w-2 income then that income up to one hundred thousand dollars can be included in the amount being borrowed against so she would Fioretti place she would be able to pay herself the over eight weeks basically was sixteen thousand dollars on $96,000 you know divide it by 12 divided by 4 you get down to 8 grand amount flow or 16000 over those of those weeks so that's possible I think most emotional owners are not doing that they're cutting their own income to down some and paying themselves some portion of it but it's under a hundred thousand dollars a favor all week with everybody ok I got one more for you I've also heard from some business owners who have seasonal employees or work with contractors they are concerned that they will not be able to use PPP funds to hire those people this year can you address those concerns please unfortunately without any levity being added to this question the truth is that's a hard one yes it really yeah it's hard because what we're looking for the way the rules are written we're talking about the average monthly payroll and if you're in places like South Carolina or Texas what you'll find is that seasonal business it's not unusual we have as a tourist state we have folks at work they do 70% of their business from you know end of April to the beginning of October so those six months are very different than the other six months maybe blend the two together you don't really get average you just get too little or too much and that was not contemplated even though we have argued before that it was not contemplated in the PPP so yes you can get funding but no it may not help you in your peak season that's what you are so thank you thank you well is there anything else that you want to add just kind of for us you know - yeah and then we'll just look we'll close it out from there yeah the one that's I'm looking forward to you becoming a member of Congress and I am praying for your health and your in wise choices on your part in your your team's part so thank you for your willingness to sacrifice in to see your approval ratings plummet by being a member of Congress or senator Brady huh I'm not sure who that sole person is I'm thinking either big there's something I do think as soon as only nine percent by the way so you guys you know we got y'all beat if you go by districts the average member of Congress has over a 60% of formal rating within their own district so we don't we like our own we don't like everybody else you know so that said only one other thing that's today about the cares Act that would be helpful and I'll give you it in 60 seconds or less first part of the carries act that that matters to the average person around the country are the direct payments $1,200 the vast majority of the country has received it for those folks on Social Security or receiving disability benefits that check may have lied behind I spoke with secretary Medici recently those checks have started going out as of this past Friday today's Tuesday so take the weekend out over the next few days we'll have ten or twenty million more Americans getting their checks secondly I would say is the unemployment benefits they are enhanced with in the cares Act an additional $600 per week for 16 weeks the 16th week ends at the end of July so if you are employed now get unemployed in May it's not actually the 16 weeks as a legislation envisions it's only it expires on July 31st so that's really important to note the third thing I would say is the expanded classifications of those employees that are eligible includes 1099 employee contract workers includes church employees and nonprofits as well the other part about the cares act that's important to business owners would be the fact that we are setting up facilities which means the ability to get a loan from the Treasury or some facility controlled by the Treasury perhaps through financial institutions around the corners of America those facilities should be up and running in the next 10 days they're considered that 13-3 facilities which is a technical Washington way of saying you can get your loan if you're in several different areas through facilities that are being established specifically for employers with more than 500 employees that's that's an engagement that was hardwired into the carriage that that's only coming to fruition and finally for the state's 139 billion dollars to be divided by the state's cities with more than 500,000 employee five thousand people can actually have a direct payment to that state to that city and in your state unlike South Carolina you have abused cities and we qualify for direct assistance so we can talk about that on the next call if you want to but there are a few other aspects of the Carrey's act that might be interesting but the heart of it from my perspective is a paycheck protection program god bless fantastic well sir thank you so much I just want to say thank you for your leadership I mean we're all blessed they're people like you up there fighting this fight for us and you have been a mentor of mine for many many years and I've been following you for a long time and thank you for being a person of character that we can look up to so please stay safe be blessed and I will be in touch and thank you so much thank you very much for their figure

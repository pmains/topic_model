  PRESIDENT. THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS IS  RECOGNIZED.  MR. MCCAUL: I'M PLEASED TO   YIELD TWO MINUTES TO THE   GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI, MR.  PALAZZO, A MARINE COMBAT   VETERAN OF THE GULF WAR AND  CURRENT MEMBER OF THE  MISSISSIPPI NATIONAL GUARD.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI IS  RECOGNIZED FOR TWO MINUTES.  MR. PALAZZO: I WANT TO THANK MY  FRIEND, MR. MCCAUL, FOR  YIELDING ME TIME.  MADAM SPEAKER, THE AMENDMENT   BEFORE US TODAY IS ANOTHER   EXAMPLE OF THE DEMOCRATS' MOST   RECENT CAMPAIGN TO UNDERMINE   OUR MILITARY, OUR NATIONAL   SECURITY, AND AS ALWAYS  PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT REPEALING THE AUMF OF 2002  WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT IS   DANGEROUS. AND THE HOUSE MAJORITY MUST  UNDERSTAND THAT. IF THE DEMOCRATS CHOOSE TO   ADOPT THIS AMENDMENT, IT SHOWS   OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN   STATIONED IN THE MIDDLE EAST   THAT THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS  DOES NOT HAVE THEIR BACKS. BY ADOPTING THIS AMENDMENT, IT   TELLS OUR ENEMIES THAT THEY CAN  CONTINUE ATTACKING THE UNITED  STATES COMPLETELY UNCHECKED. IT PROJECTS UNCERTAINTY AND  WEAKNESS TO THOSE WHO ARE  ACTIVELY WORKING AGAINST US. THE UNITED STATES MUST MAINTAIN  THE ABILITY TO COUNTER   TERRORIST ATTACKS AND AN ACTIVE  AUMF ACCOMPLISHES THAT.  THIS AMENDMENT, IF ADOPTED,  WILL ONLY WEAKEN AMERICA'S   DEFENSE STRATEGY IN THE MIDDLE   EAST.  THE AUMF IS IMPORTANT AND HELP   LEAD OUR MILITARY TO DEFEAT THE  AL QAEDA IN IRAQ.  IT CONTINUES HELPING US  IDENTIFY OTHER INTERNATIONAL   TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS THAT   WANT TO HARM AMERICANS AND   SPREAD TERROR THROUGHOUT THE   WORLD. IT NO ONE WANTS ENDLESS WARS IN  THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT WE MUST   HAVE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO  REACT IN THIS HIGHLY VOLATILE  REGION.  WE SHOULD NOT PREVENT THE  PRESIDENT FROM DEFENDING   AMERICANS FROM IMMINENT  THREATS. TO DO THIS IS RECKLESS AND   DANGEROUS. NOT ONLY WILL YOU PUT OUR  MILITARY AT RISK, BUT YOU ALSO   ENDANGER AMERICAN CIVILIANS. KEEP IN MIND, WE NEED TO FIGHT   THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM  OVER THERE.  OTHERWISE IT WILL END UP IN OUR  BACK YARDS.  I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOT

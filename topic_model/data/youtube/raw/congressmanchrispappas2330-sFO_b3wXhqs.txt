it's been about a year uh since covet 19 has hit our state and upended every aspect of our daily lives and since then we've seen an economic crisis that has hit our state incredibly hard as well as a public health crisis and both have put an unprecedented strain on our health care systems our small business communities as well as our cities and towns now what i've been hearing is that revenues have decreased well the need for essential services and costs have also increased so in order for our communities to effectively combat this crisis to be able to be on a strong footing as we move through covid 19 we have to ensure that we have direct federal funding to cities and towns in new hampshire and across the country and that's exactly what the rescue plan does so since the year began i've been speaking with local leaders our mayors our town managers county officials public health officials and other local leaders and the message couldn't be clearer they're doing everything they can to respond to this pandemic but they need some more help to effectively defeat the virus and to move our com communities forward without profound damage to their long-term financial picture local governments are making tough budget decisions due to increased coven 19 expenditures and decreased revenue they're doing everything in their power to avoid cutting critical services we could not tolerate laying off our police officers our firefighters our teachers our sanitation workers our emergency personnel during a period like this and we also can't afford to see tax increases to hard-working granite staters in the middle of this economic crisis so that's why i'm happy to say that help is on the way either today or tomorrow the house will take its final vote on the american rescue plan and send it to president biden's desk for his signature

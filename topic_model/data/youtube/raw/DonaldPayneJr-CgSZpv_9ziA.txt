politicians from new york and new jersey are calling on president trump to stop gulf-based emirates airline from starting a round-trip flight between newark new jersey and athens greece this month in a letter released late tuesday the group contends at emirates and other gulf airlines have an unfair advantage over american air carriers because they receive billions in government subsidies subsidies they say are costing americans jobs congressman donald payton junior's signature is on that letter and he joins us now congressman welcome good to have you with us well thank you for having me i assume lots of airlines get some form of government subsidy or another and and it's not new news that emirates may or may not get those subsidies sue's gonna follow up with that in just a minute but why now why are you objecting to this one if emirates has been doing business i flew him from new york to milan two years ago uh you know it really is a a serious issue for us i have newark airport in my district and we feel it is unfair competition that they are subsidized to the extent that they are 50 billion dollars is is quite quite a subsidy and it really gives an unfair um access for emirates in this in taking this flight from athens to newark congressman on the emirates website they basically made a statement disputing your claims and saying that the the thought that they are receiving subsidies is patently false their words they say what u.s legacy carriers really want is protection from competition what do you say to that well now we're actually trying to make sure that there is competition as we stated these subsidies are dramatic uh it gives them an unfair advantage and that's what we're trying to stop even though they deny it even though they deny it they can deny it but i mean you know the facts are the facts they are subsidized to this degree and it it causes unfair competition and what it does for us really back here you know for every um every flight of that distance that we lose an american carrier impacts 1500 jobs and so that's very serious and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that we have a a fair playing field for our carriers throughout the globe we have an open skies agreement with the uae how does that figure into this number one number two have you looked at the price differential between what emirates proposes to charge on these flights which i think begin maybe even this weekend and what a u.s carrier flying the same route would charge i don't have the exact um cost but i know um it's not competitive and it goes back to once again them being subsidized so it just continues to harken back to that one point uh but we we are going to uh be at newark airport this sunday um to show our support for american carriers several members of the new jersey new york delegation will be there sunday and we're going to continue to fight this issue because it's very important to jobs and the gdp of this country congressman payne thank you very much congressman donald payne jr of new jersey

we're back uh Senator Tom Cotton joins us now Center great to have you hey Brian it's good to be back on with you so why why do you think we got to get rid of tick tock now more than ever well Brian Tick Tock is like a trojan horse on Americans phones uh it can give backdoor access to all of the data on one's phone not just the content that you upload in Tick Tock or even that you saving Tick Tock but don't upload but your other apps as well text messages email photographs contacts browsing history it's part of the most massive surveillance state in the history of mankind and it's something that will stick with people who use it forever you might say well gosh my 12 year old daughter who just posts and Views baton twirling routines is not at risk well she could be at risk in 10 and 15 and 20 years from now when all of her data is still in the hands of the Chinese Communists this is a part inside from the fact that it's like a kind of digital fentanyl that exposes Kids By Design and by algorithm to grossly inappropriate content unlike the way it works in China it is a trojan horse on all Americans phones and I'd urge you if you have it to delete it and then probably get a new phone well here's the thing how are you going to go up to every 12 to 18 year old and say let me see your phone I need you to delete that it's in the hands of the parents in those situations but I think most Parents try to monitor what their kids do but is there a way to stop it uh digitally can you stop an app from coming ashore well what you can what you can do from a technical standpoint once it's already uh in the United States and download it on phones what you can do is stop any more kind of updates or software refreshes through app stores through which it's downloaded that wouldn't necessarily eliminate it immediately but it would in a way kind of Wither on the vine but the most important thing you can do if you're a parent is to get your kids off of it and get it off their phones it is protecting your kids just like you would protect them from child pornography or drugs or alcohol or any other nefarious influence in their life well we'll see where it goes because I know Senator Warner's there are there any Democrats standing in your way because we know the president was taking ads out on Tick Tock during the midterms so with the Democrats I'm sure Republicans were too so they were playing the game Barack Obama with sitting down and on the floor with an influencer under a desk uh you know Joe Biden embarrassing himself with with some other teenager who never knew what she was talking about so uh do you think Democrats going to fight you on this so tonight it warns Americans about the risk on the other hand they're inviting so-called Tick-Tock influencers to the White House to campaign for them and help spread their message that's a very bad signal to be sending to Americans um second I just think that this part of President Biden's unwillingness to confront China he doesn't want to rock the boat for instance he's not standing up for these Brave protesters uh in streets across China right now he often talks a big game about uh confronting China but in the end he's worried about creating too much conflict creating too many ripples in our relationship when it real in reality is the Chinese Communists who are creating this conflict it's only a matter for us of whether we want to Prevail or not Prevail I'm all for real politics and I know we have to do business with people that don't have governments we support like Saudi Arabia for example but I am amazed how this Administration has thrown morality after pledging just the opposite out the window not coming out can condemning the riots and protest and back in the protesters in Iran not backing the protesters in China going to bed with Maduro ignoring the Cuban Uprising from a year a year plus ago whatever happened to our backing a convicted criminal 76 year old Lula in Brazil and Boston Arrow it looks like he was robbed that's according to millions of people have not stopped rioting inside Brazil and we're on the wrong side of almost every issue what happened yeah yeah you're totally right about this Brian actually I have a section in my new book Only the Strong about this about distinguishing our friends and our foes I would follow the approach and the philosophy of Ronald Reagan his great Ambassador United Nations Gene Kirkpatrick of Simply distinguishing between pro-american governments and anti-American governments it would be nice if we lived in a world where all countries shared our political system and our cultural and social values that's one reason why we have such close relationships with Great Britain and Israel we have shared political goal and religious and historic and cultural Traditions but let's not kid ourselves we don't live in that world the world is not a church picnic we live in a dangerous world and there are countries who don't share those uh political systems or those Traditions with us like Saudi Arabia like the United Arab Emirates like Jordan and Morocco who have nonetheless been reliable American partners and then there are countries that have even worse regimes that are also implacably hostile to America Iran Syria China Venezuela Cuba Russia the Biden Administration and Democrats in general turn this on its head they almost always tend to alienate in the cases of Saudi Arabia intentionally ostracize governments that are friendly and supportive of America's national interests while they try to hurry favor with and apologize to and appease to those Outlaw regimes look we also have a history of being able to help nurture and midwife more tolerant and ultimately representative governments and countries that once were non-democratic look what Reagan did uh in the Philippines and what he did with South Korea in the 1980s and in in truth Brian just the very fact that you choose as a nation to align yourself with the United States is itself a kind of modernizing uh and and liberalizing tendency the fact that you choose to be a part of America's security networks around the world as opposed to aligning yourself with a China or Russia goes to show that you actually are a country that is moving in the right direction so when you watch what's happening in China you don't overstep and say I call on everybody to China to Riot like in the 80s with George H.W bush said for this she had a rise up and they had no protection and they still held a bitterness for us there's a way to do it I'm looking at Justin Trudeau's comments from yesterday he says we're going to continue to ensure that China knows we'll stand up for human rights we'll stand up for the people who are expressing themselves we also need to make sure that China and places around the world are respecting journalists and the ability to do the job you know why is that why is Justin Trudeau who is anything but admirable as a leader who just abused his own truckers we know that why does he sound more muscular than us yeah again I think it goes back to Joe Biden's unwillingness to stand up to the Chinese Communist just frankly like he refused to stand up they're not the Cold War as a senator to the Russian Communists as well um it's very similar to what Barack Obama did in 2009 during the last big protest in Iran as well you know President Obama recently apologized for remaining silent during those protests but it was not it was not a mistake Brian it wasn't you know a new or naive or inexperienced president caught flat-footed it was a ruthless ruthless plan in pursuit of his main goal which was to apologize for what he viewed as America's sins against Iran to get a nuclear deal and to pull in America's horns and have a ground reprashment with Iran you see the same thing today I think with China Joe Biden doesn't think uh or doesn't want to risk you know I don't know a possibility of a climate change agreement with China by speaking out in behalf of these Brave Chinese protesters Ronald Reagan always took the exact opposite tactic look what he did for instance early in his tenure with the solidarity labor movement in Poland speaking out against Soviet domination in Poland he was not worried that as Democrats always say they are oh it's going to play into the hands of the regime it's going to allow them to portray these protesters as puppets of America no he knew he knew as is the case today that captive peoples who are the first and worst victims of communist regimes or repressive dictatorships are yearning to hear American Presidents speak out on their behalf and to Champion their cause and that's exactly what President Biden should do now in his own voice and on camera yeah would be nice instead of his press secretary uh walking around the block instead of answering the question even though he was an admiral uh the price of freedom in the U.S one million covet deaths 40 000 gun deaths per year 107 622 fentanyl deaths in 2021 alone Federal debts are there this is a statement from China the American people deserve something far better than that what we want is to protect our people's lives and ensure them a better life so they're trying to justify welding them in their house letting them burn alive stopping them from going to work or leaving their house to not giving them food and they're saying look at America we keep shooting each other and killing each other with fentanyl that they produce so our our inadequate response still got hostile responses from them exactly exactly and this is always the case with aggressive anti-American dictatorships you saw this in Alaska during a summit early in the Biden Administration with Tony blinken and Jake Sullivan being dressed down by their counterparts when they should have gotten on offense and condemned the Chinese Communists for their genocide against religious and ethnic minorities in Northwest China or Decades of repression and destruction of Tibetan Heritage on the Tibetan Plateau or the fact that they harvest organs from political prisoners or persecute 100 million Christians instead they just meekly accept these criticisms and try not to rock the boat because John Kerry wants to get a climate change deal with China what about the fact that by the way you the the book is still out doing well Only the Strong by Senator Tom Cotton who's my guest Senator what about the fact that macron comes over here and basically says that new green deal not good for business not good for your allies it might be good for you but it's not ready do you believe that we're getting lectured about doing going to Green by the president of France I know know and let's just remind I want to remind everyone too Brian that China has the market cornered on most Green Technology in the world so progressives May March under the banner of climate change but it looks an awful lot like the Chinese Communists five-star flag if you are promoting more green or so-called clean technology you are playing right in the hands of China making ourselves more dependent on Chinese manufacturing of solar panels and wind turbines and elements uh and components for those things if you believe in more North American oil gas and coal production you are playing into the American strength and what makes us a superpower an energy superpower in the world so I know you're working on something else you're introducing a bill to support 911 Beirut bombing victims in what respect is there a Gap there yes sir uh Brian there is a a fund created uh in the US government about seven years ago for victims of state-sponsored terrorism so if you have a judgment against uh in court against a country uh for a terrorist attack you can apply to that fund uh to receive some compensation um at the time in 2015 both the 9 11 families and the Beirut families uh of the of the barracks bombing in 1983 were not included in that they were seeking other means of redress for understandable reasons it's turned out that that fund is probably the best way to get victims of Terror the benefits that they deserve so the house passed a bill a few months ago that would add the 911 families back into it and give them so-called catch-up payments as if they had been there from the beginning I think that is a laudable and worthwhile goal I don't want to leave the Beirut families behind though I don't want the Beirut families to be the only victims of terrorism who are not receiving the same just compensation that all the victims Terror do so Dan sell and I have been introduce new legislation that would add both groups of Terror victims into the fund make sure they're both made whole and going forward will treat all victims of Terror on an equitable basis and lastly there's a movement now to withhold 45 billion from the Pentagon because they still are demanding that all military including Academy students get vaccinated what can you do to stop this get their attention and like under make Democrats understand too this is a problem and unfair yeah it's someone who served in the military and took a lot of shots when I did some of them were pretty painful and inconvenient as well especially the smallpox shot I would say in general the military does have the power to instruct its service members to take these shots this is why I think the code vaccination is different though first it was under an emergency use authorization from the FDA it wasn't a tried tested vaccine going back decades unlike smallpox and the flu and Anthrax and so forth second the rationale for the Mandate as it always is in the military is one to prevent the spread of the virus to to prevent terrible cases well we now know that this vaccine does not prevent the spread of the virus so that rationale is no longer applicable and it doesn't even appear especially in young people to do much difference in terms of the severity of the case and you're already talking about an extremely young population that is physically fit the third reason is the military already faces a recruiting and a retention crisis we should not be taking any steps that make it harder to get young men and women into our military or to keep them in our military when there is zero benefit in return so many republicans in Congress uh want to insist that we get a vote on the annual defense bill that will prevent uh Joe Biden's uh Department of Defense leadership from continuing to enforce this needless and counterproductive mandate can they go around you well not if we can pass it into law I mean the Democrats should go on record about whether they believe that we should continue to force service members to leave leave the military because they have hesitations about taking a vaccine that has proven to be needless and in some cases harmful uh Senator where are you at I've hit you on too many topics or you really like to cry Uncle now put up the white flag and say I can't take it anymore all right good if you can hold to that not running for president because I know Nikki Haley seems to reverse herself and Mike Pompeo seems to reverse himself are you going to reverse yourself are you thinking about it no uh Brian my decision and uh I'm gonna ask not be a candidate for the White House in 24 if if nominated I will not run if elected I will not serve or you know maybe I'll maybe I'll take the rides on the big plane that seems attractive and let someone else uh do the work but no my boys right now are seven and five and you know what one day my wife and I saw over this fall as I was on the campaign Trail for so many of our candidates is that it's just a particularly challenging age for uh for Dad to be gone you know they're old enough to be aware I'm gone and be sad about it but they're not enough to understand why all this matters and uh what we're trying to accomplish for the country so not necessarily closing the book on a potential White House run one day but uh definitely closing the 2024 chapter I look forward to continuing my work in the Senate um and being of help where I can to the candidates running and uh supporting our nominee in 2024 so we can take back the White House and in the background you could hear two Cotton Kids uh cheering one of which I saw the bookstore it's got a lot of energy a great kid oh yeah you could say that Standard Time cotton thanks so much Only the Strong Great Book thank you Brian
